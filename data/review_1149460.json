Instead it provides a really high quality \"rustic dollhouse experience with annoying yet unavoidable combat\".\r\n\r\nLet's start with that they do well:\r\n\r\nBase building:  You can make your dream cabin.  The building system takes a lot of resources, and it makes every placement seem important.  You have to maintain your buildings in the face of storms, and there's a rudimentary structural support system that means you have to think about your decisions, and not just place improbable floating mansions.  Everything is a little dark inside since the lighting system isn't fully baked, but honestly that's my only complaint.  I enjoy building things in Icarus.\r\n\r\nExploration:  They did a rally good job crafting a beautiful world to explore.  There's hidden caves that you need to track down in order to get the resources you need for building, and the caves feel creepy and claustrophobic.  In general, the darkness, at night and in caves feels dangerous, and that is appreciated.  I enjoy exploration in Icarus.\r\n\r\nThen there' the systems they want to work well, but don't:\r\n\r\nCombat:  I think they want the world to feel hostile, but it doesn't, it just feels annoying.  You either need to kill things that offer no challenge (e.g. deer, rabbits, birds) in a way that feels too easy and kind of gross, or you need to kill annoying bullet sponges that run after you full speed while you stab them in the face.  Or jump on a rock and stab them in the face.  Or jump over a stream and shoot arrows in their face.  The most interesting enemies are shielded everywhere except their face, which means you have to run backwards for longer, because you need to take more shots to get more face hits.  Sometimes there are a lot of things at once that you have to stab/shoot in the face, so you have to run backwards for a while to herd them into  a group while shooting them in the face.\r\n\r\nCombat in Icarus is a nuisance, and I think the developers realize that, because they've recently released a game mode that requires less of it, but I wish they would just fix it.  If you made the creatures and the player less spongy, and turned it into something that more closely resembles danger in the wild, it would be more fun, and fit the game's theme better.  \r\n\r\nSessions:  The idea behind Icarus is that you can avoid the boredom of tech-tree-climbing that's endemic to all games in the genre by time-limiting the sessions.  The idea is that you will land, quickly set up the bare minimum to accomplish the mission, go do the mission, and return to space.  Unfortunately since construction is so resource intensive, this means that every mission begins with a lot of boring labor, to build a structure you probably like, only to throw it away at the end of the mission, the majority of which are not particularly enjoyable (1:place macguffin. 2:level-appropriate animals attack. 3: annoying combat to defend the macguffin.  4: rinse, repeat). \r\n\r\nThe idea here is great, but it runs into a wall as a consequence of poor execution.  As it stands, the missions are more boring than the tech-tree climb, so I just kind of ignore them because they use up resources that I could otherwise be dedicating to my dream cabin.  I genuinely wish there were some cool settler-related missions, but that would require NPCs and AI, which is not where this game shines.\r\n\r\nOne of the most frustrating thing about Icarus is how it takes a very interesting premise, and makes it boring. \"Be part of colonizing/exploiting a very hostile planet with exotic materials, by running backwards and repeatedly stabbing earth animals in the face while a beeping thing beeps.\"  I honestly dream about some \"State of Decay 2\" style mechanics being introduced to this game, which would give it stakes, but the developers seem to habitually avoid AI spending time on AI.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I think the primary failing of the game comes down to AI.  Game AI is hard, but if you don't do it the game is boring or annoying.  Until they add some meaningful character interactions to the game, I'm going to avoid it.", "timestamp_created": 1710707805, "timestamp_updated": 1710707805, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 114, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828246891498565674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161003894": {"recommendationid": "161003894", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987288370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4283, "last_played": 1710951121}, "language": "english", "review": "I really want to like this game.

Being someone who loves the survival genre, playing everything from the go-to Valheim to the more obscure The Long Dark, I'm fairly versed in the nature of survival games and what makes one good or not. \n\nOne key aspect that Icarus does very poorly is leveling. When a title such as Valheim gives you the pure freedom to unlock or \"learn\" new items simply by finding an item (e.g Copper unlocking Bronze items), it painfully obvious how bad Icarus's system is when tied directly to XP points. You want to progress to Steal, well your stuck to hitting an xp level to manually chose to unlock the option to use Steal items. I understand this is a design choice, but from my point of view only incentives cheesing the game to hitting an xp wall, aka just murdering animals to boost xp. It's a very poorly done system in my opinion.\n\nAnother major downside is my opinion is the point of doing any of this. You might finally hit an XP level that gives you the ability to use Iron tools for instance, but after building these items your left questioning, why do I need any of this to begin with?!?!? Is it only to hit the next item in the tier, sooooo this leads to back to the original XP grind of doing things literally just to hit a \"level\". In short, it does not feel rewarding or dynamic, but instead feels very restrictive. \n\nLastly, is animal system. It's down right terrible. You want to take a trek into the snow biome and look for new items, good luck fighting a million wolves, bears, etc in route. It's comical the level this is taken too. I've broken 3 weapons in one trip killing 100+ wolves or other enemies in a small few hundred meter distance traveled. Watching enemies literally spawn directly in front you, after having murdered hundreds to that point feels downright stupid. It literally feels like an artificial difficulty metric that is used to slow progression just for the sake of doing so. Never does it feel ground in reality. \n\nI say all this to bring me to my last point and why I uninstalled the game. You work all these broken systems to go out for a long trek to explore and find \"cool\" new places, only to face broken gameplay after broken gameplay. Break every weapon you have on one outing because the game throws a stupid around of enemies at you or you enter a cave which you later find have no way out and your character and all it's gear is essentially stuck because the terrain navigation doesn't allow you to exit the cave. All in all, it feels like a pointless grind, leaving you to question if you've indeed wasted hours of you time into a broken mess. Sadly, you'll come to realize this is exactly what you signed up for and I just couldn't bear to grind my teeth over it anymore.\n\nRecommendation = Avoid and push down any questions of \"this game looks beautiful, I wonder if it's good?\".

I didn't realise this when I bought the game, but I also bought it on sale. So for now this hasn't really affected me much, but if you are worried about what the devs might do in future, here is something to know.\n \nHaving said that, the game is being actively developed, new things are added all the time, and perhaps having funding through DLCs is helping this aspect.\n\nThe premise: terraforming gone wrong, you get sent down to do things for various factions. But why on Earth (excuse the pun), would you be sent to a new planet with not even a bedroll? I understand that you can earn some currency that allows you to go down with some equipment. But we can build rockets and space stations. You should be able to get basic supplies with you. I am pretty sure that's what NASA plans to do with Mars. Also let me make my bedroll out of fibre or something. I don't need all that leather.\n\nSo you kind of have to go, \"Okay so the premise is kind of cool, but there are contradictions. We can terraform planets, we can build rockets, and space stations, but we must be in an hyper-capitalist world, where you have to earn ABSOLUTELY everything yourself, even a bedroll. And someone must have gone cheap on the suits, because we can get pneumonia. In caves. Only.\" And even though the thought was amusing for a short 2 seconds, it still didn't make much sense. So I just shrugged and moved on.\n\nI found the beginning of the game on your first character is very grindy. So grindy that I wound up modding some of that. I still want a challenge, but I feel that maybe having some sliders like Valheim and V-Rising might do this game some good. The game takes off at around level 20ish. But it takes a long time to get there. \n\nThis game has some decent mods though, and the fact that it is moddable is certainly a plus. I think most people mod survival games at some point.\n\nThe crafting progression in this is rather good. It is what is keeping me engaged. I really like how No Man's Sky lets you automate certain things and how you can create extractors, how you can power bases, etc. And this game does the same thing. It has several tiers of things to craft, etc. It isn't something new, but its implementation is just satisfying.\n\nI rather like the weather events too. They add jeopardy. You do learn easy tricks to trivialise them, but a thunderstorm can set the forest on fire. And that you have to deal with. I managed to set a forest on fire by being on fire myself and running towards a lake. So... I burned all bushes between my cabin and the lake. Yeah. I do like how environment hazards work here. I would have rolled on clear ground. But you can't do that here. \n\nOr you are exploring somewhere, wind up in a snowy mountain range, a hail storm hits, you hide under a rock but four wolves and one snow leopard come to greet you, so you can't stay put into your rocky shelter anymore. I think the weather is a strong selling point for sure.\n\nThe game looks pretty good in general.\n\nThe combat is a bit of a downer, and it's rather binary. You hit the face with a ranged weapon, you kill stuff really quick (and can often one shot). If you do not, you have to strafe in a circle with a knife and spam your left click until the thing is dead. That's it. No reason to craft any other weapon other than your ranged weapon of choice and a knife. You might like to build something in case what you are trying to hunt is a bit too hard, so it can't reach you straight away. And then you try to hit it in the face. It's almost like you are playing Fortnite but this is not as smooth.\n\nAnimations in third person are not very good. And the aiming is a bit wonky. All the game does is to zoom out a little when you are in third person, but when you hit something, you are still trying to hit things with the dot in the middle of your screen, which is slightly removed from your character. You are not actually trying to make contact with your character. So I just stay in first person, as third person seems to be an after-thought. I wonder if it was added some time in Early Access as a player request, but it was never well implemented.\n\nIcarus has an open world and a mission system. (It also has outposts, which basically is a non-aggressive version of the game where you mostly just build.) The mission system works like a rogue-lite game. You do the missions, extract, lose anything you might have built on the surface. But you earn currency to unlock new equipment and your character still levels and earns talent points. Yet, not all missions involve creating bases. Some are just hunting. Some are just gathering ores. You get the gist. It actually does not feel like you are wasting your time (at least I don't). I like having missions to do. It's almost like Deep Rock Galactic in that respect.\n\nBut if you like to build persistent bases, you go in the open world, and then eventually craft the mission board, and then you can do most missions in the open world too. That makes it so you can access the equipment from both progression systems - the equipment you get with currency, and the equipment you get via levelling tech trees.\n\nThe game also has talent trees, which is something I really like. You can become a better hunter, a better builder, a better forager, etc.\n\nCONCLUSION\nOnce you get past the initial logic issues with the premise, and if combat isn't a make or break proposition for you, this is a very good survival game.", "timestamp_created": 1710943684, "timestamp_updated": 1712907342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674479067325592041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163159332": {"recommendationid": "163159332", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991097954", "num_games_owned": 1619, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 11060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11060, "last_played": 1704570093}, "language": "english", "review": "This game had a lot of promise in the early days but its just a money grab with the constant over priced DLC.", "timestamp_created": 1713525873, "timestamp_updated": 1713525873, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666633903980255127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157582453": {"recommendationid": "157582453", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974949173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 29046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 289, "playtime_at_review": 22386, "last_played": 1713705421}, "language": "english", "review": "I have put many hours int othis game with solo play and co-op.

You can easly put a ladder on top of a build, but it will not snap to your target.\n\nENEMIES! - Basic enemies are easly dealt with until you get into the Arctic.  Basic enemies become crazy hard to kill. For example, a brown forest bear is powerful but can be killed in 4-6 well placed shots to the face.  A polar bear however may take 14 - 20 arrows to the face.  You can succeed, but will more than likely be killed.  Then add being attacked by more than one at a time.

Make sure you have plenty of room away from walls to survive.  Needler enemy can shoot needles through rock and hit you.

I held off on this one at first due to lukewarm reviews and later due to the cost of the experience (if you include Styx and Prometheus in that equation).\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm glad I did finally pick this game up and I would recommend it to fans of the genre, but in particular people, like me, who really enjoy the early portion of survival games. The mission-based part of the game (the original part that many people did not like) is basically repeatedly starting over with nothing (a bit of a rogue like experience) and as you progress you do get to bring more things down with you that you purchase with meta currency that you are earning on each mission. This gives purpose to constantly restarting and the missions also give finite objectives for each \"game\".\r\n\r\nI've enjoyed the mission bit enough that I haven't even started the other types of games (which you can run concurrently) including open world (more like a classic survival experience with some of the elements from the mission based game mode), and outpost (like a peaceful building option). The same character can run all 3 types of games at once from what I gather which is neat. You don't bring things between the modes but you keep your talents and research unlocks.\r\n\r\nBasically, TLDR, I think this one is a must buy if you like the start of survival games especially and if you like the idea of a rogue-like survival game :) It does everything else pretty well and the storms definitely make survival more interesting, but I'd say the biggest difference is the sort of meta game of missions and unlocks.

Let me tell you some good, and some bad things about this game. Now, I have had Icarus since game preview launch, and have survived around 300 hrs on my most recent save. \r\n  I give this game a high rating due to it's constant fixes to the problems the community makes the devs aware of. if you start playing the game new now compared to when they launched it, you wouldn't understand 100% how far they have come with Icarus. \r\n When you first start, the game is a bit rough and it's slightly difficult to survive things like lightning storms, and other bad weather due to the physics. The weather aspect in this game is above and beyond with detail. Buildings can take damage from more severe weather, even heavy wind depending on the materiel used for building. Along with the weather aspects of reality, they have given you the gift of parasites, bacteria, hypothermia, overheating, dehydration, and a few other things that may be a challenge throughout your play through.\r\nLets get into the building tho cause that is a top interest in this game for sure. Building has come a long way and Icarus has it down to a science. Straight to the point with how to build walls, floor, doors and ceilings, and other basic building blocks such as foundations and stairs. the use of a construction hammer makes it so you can change materiel of said building pieces without removing them, which makes re organizing a lot easier. With a wide variety of materials to use for building as well as crafting, the game offers you a more laid back style of building and crafting. Physics in building is what makes it so much more than just putting floors down and walls. support is Needed for building in this game or it will fall, and it will collapse. between the weather, and the detail in lighting, building gives you a place to come back to from your hunting/gathering missions. It gives you that sense of excitement to come back from an hr long grind of gathering resources to build yourself up to those next items you need, instead of coming back to just a boring 4x4 house with a roof. \r\n  Along with the great building perspective i do have to say there are a few things that make it not so great sometimes, but they are working on everything that the community throws at them. Every now and then you'll experience a couple display glitches like weapons not getting pulled out in your hands when you select them in your hot bar. Clay and other resources that require a sledge hammer to break, a lot of the time pieces will fall into the ground and you cannot pick them up. when trying to repair a lantern in your inventory just as you can do with your tools and weapons, it will not repair the lantern. It will say it is repaired but as soon as you turn it on, the burn time falls back to zero time. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a survival game that has not only Misions, Creative mode, And Outposts. This game is the game to get when it comes to a survival game with actual content to keep your mind busy. Highly recommend Starting with a Open World Save, and playing a long term save on each map. it makes losing all the progress you make on a mission not so bad to lose when you can load an open world (which has the ability to earn you just as much if not more credits/exotics along the way!! \r\n", "timestamp_created": 1711543690, "timestamp_updated": 1711543690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161524927": {"recommendationid": "161524927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149945692", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 14351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12130, "last_played": 1711724824}, "language": "english", "review": "Im an avid survival player and this has surpassed my expectations i originally bought this on release and never played it as i hated that the game was instanced \n\ndo not sleep on this game if you like survival craft open world\n\nbut now.. theyve added open world it is AMAZING!\n\nthere is so much to this game!\n\nthey have thought of so many small things other survival games dont do! and theyre consistantly updating it and adding more content! \n\nthis is a must play with friends! i havent been able to put it down since i started playing again\n\nlove the huge skill tree\nlove the building!\nlove theres an insane amount of craftables \nthe world looks amazing i would love to see more biomes in the future!\n\ncant wait to see what else they do.\n\nalso please add a way to move my ship after I spawn in thanks :D\n", "timestamp_created": 1711476048, "timestamp_updated": 1711476048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160756310": {"recommendationid": "160756310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836284801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 123, "playtime_at_review": 3520, "last_played": 1713568988}, "language": "english", "review": "good build/survival game. peaceful to play.", "timestamp_created": 1710677072, "timestamp_updated": 1710677072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160575806": {"recommendationid": "160575806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317950099", "num_games_owned": 855, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 20681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 479, "playtime_at_review": 8113, "last_played": 1712780718}, "language": "english", "review": "In Memorium: Crungle The Moa", "timestamp_created": 1710500031, "timestamp_updated": 1710500031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160541356": {"recommendationid": "160541356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041804220", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 388, "playtime_at_review": 6095, "last_played": 1713480808}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so much fun!

There are now significantly more missions, game modes such as open world, and additional content through DLCs. The game mechanics have undergone drastic changes since its initial release, making it a strongly underrated game deserving way more recognition.\n\nInitially, Icarus was a game where players were sent on missions with a timer that continued even when they were not in the game. However, it has evolved into a much richer experience with the introduction of features like an open world gamemode, dedicated servers, and a variety of animals and alien creatures. Players can engage in activities such as taming mounts, hunting, fishing, and intricate building mechanics, which have greatly enriched the gameplay experience.\n\nWhether you're embarking on a solo mission, riding a buffalo into battle against wolves or lions, facing off against the giant worm boss, or peacefully constructing a cabin in the outpost game mode, Icarus offers a diverse range of experiences. \n\nOne notable aspect of Icarus is its responsive development team, who are always attentive to player feedback. This makes a positive community atmosphere and contributes to ongoing improvements to the game.\n\nI highly recommend purchasing Icarus and investing in its DLCs. If you enjoy building I would definitely recommend supporting the developers through purchasing in game maps like outposts or furniture packs as this is a great way to show appreciation for their hard work and dedication.

We were really enjoying the game and knew it had a lot of potential. But ultimately we put the game down for a while to play our other go-to games. \n\nFast forward a year later and the devs have been putting out WEEKLY updates for over 52 weeks... This is an unbelievable W for the dev team. What other game devs do you know of who never fail to crank out quality content and listen to their players?\n\nA few days ago I remembered the existence of Icarus and the sweet bliss of being lost in the middle of a hurricane with only a knife made out of bone and burlap sack armor. Running until I'm out of breath from grizzly bears, swimming across a river just to catch a virus from the water and get pneumonia from being out in the cold rain all night. Many times I overstayed my welcome in the caves trying to get that last bit of precious ore just to catch pneumonia over 10km from our base of operations.

The tech tree is straight forward and level progression is simple and for the most part, intuitive. \n\nI'm not sure what to think about being able to cheese a game by bringing in an established character into a new world. it seems overpowered if a group wants to start fresh, or there's some new players in the game but one person decides not to start fresh.... I'm on the fence with this concept..but this is my opinion. Not sure if you can force the game to not allow characters from previous games on the server or not.\n\nBut... \n\nHoly Grind. \n\nI understand the concept of getting stone for a stone foundation... I'll never understand (in a game) where you need to get Iron Nails and wood as well. It's a stone foundation, I'd even be fine with the concept that it takes more stone to make the foundation sure as that makes sense. But, it seems VERY deliberate to make you grind resources purely for the sake of grinding resources.\n\nFor this reason, I can't honestly give this game great review.\n\nHas all the tools to be a Monster good game. But making things complex for building, and mainly just the structure building, purely for the idea to be complex and grinding just takes away all the fun aspects of the game, which there are some really nice aspects to the game. \n\nIf they simplify the game, I'll probably sink tons of hours into it. \n\nTill then, it will sit on the shelf.", "timestamp_created": 1708379023, "timestamp_updated": 1708379023, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509803950786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163319115": {"recommendationid": "163319115", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993226996", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4093, "last_played": 1699713694}, "language": "english", "review": "This game does not respect my time.

I like so many more things about this game than I hate but the things that I hate, I REALLY hate. I would tentatively recommend this game for big-time lovers of survival games. For anyone else, I would maybe wait and check back in on the game status in a year or so. I feel frustrated because this game has enormous potential. It has all the right pieces and building blocks, they just aren\u2019t quite fitting together the right way. Icarus has a lot going for itself but in its current state, the game leaves much to be desired. There\u2019s a lot to talk about here so I\u2019m gonna break it down with some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nThe game is beautiful. Even without cranking the graphics up to their max, the game looks and feels breathtaking. Lighting and shadows are crisp and dynamic, the environment oscillates easily through a beautiful day/night cycle, and the general atmosphere and ambience is well-rounded.\n\nThe survival mechanics are fantastic. With the player needing to monitor things like body temperature, thirst, hunger, and oxygen levels, keeping yourself alive requires attentiveness but is not unnecessarily burdensome.\n\nForest fires! Finally, a survival game that lets you set a tree on fire and watch in morbid glee as an entire forest goes up in flames!\n\nInclement weather events! With random weather events from minor winds to severe blizzards, this adds a whole new survival aspect to the game. Some weather events are little more than an inconvenience whereas others can cause trees to topple over, make you the victim of a lightning strike, or tear the roof right off your house. While the weather events can be unforgiving and deadly, I must say this is perhaps my favorite aspect of the game.\n\nUnique gameplay. This is the only survival game I\u2019ve played that essentially has you start fresh with each new mission, dropping you into the map with nothing. While I do think this system is a new and interesting take on a survival game with good potential, I have some major criticisms about the way this is actually implemented.\n\nCons:\nThe chief issue that I have with the game is that the game flow is severely hindered by the incongruity between the mission lengths and the time investment of having to start from scratch for each mission. I\u2019m actually quite a fan of the idea of having to regularly start fresh but the way this works in Icarus is pretty frustrating. Most missions take between 30 min and 6 hours to complete which just isn\u2019t long enough for the grind of starting over to be anything other than criminally boring. I think this \u201cstart from scratch\u201d idea could still work but only after significant edits to the gameplay workflow. There are many potential solutions to fix this tedious gameplay but I don\u2019t have the space to suggest any here and still discuss the other major cons. Whatever the case, it feels like the missions are at an awkward stage of length: long enough to require you to invest time into gathering resources, crafting tools/weapons, and building stable shelters, but not long enough for you to really sink your teeth into the medium and high tiers of the craftable items which brings me to my next point:\n\nMost medium and high-tier craftable items are effectively useless. A majority of these items require unnecessarily intensive resource gathering to yield an item that is only mildly more effective than its lower-tier counterpart. This problem is compounded by the fact that you cannot take any of your crafted items with you for the next mission so why bother wasting an hour of your time trying to make a weapon that is only marginally better than a simpler one that will still get the job done?\n\nPlot/premise incongruities. I feel that in order for a mission-based survival game like this to be effective and engaging, it must rely on some sort of overarching premise to bind the different game elements together. The devs set themselves up beautifully for this in advertisements and the general game aesthetic but really just fail to follow through with it. I love the idea that Icarus was a lifeless planet that humans tried (and failed) to terraform into Earth.2.0. Unfortunately, I feel like the creators use this setting as a crutch to haphazardly excuse various game elements rather than investing themselves into creating an interesting reality and then using the game to reveal that reality to the player. E.G., It\u2019s mentioned that the atmosphere of the planet turned \u201ctoxic\u201d during the terraforming process which is why the planet is uninhabitable for humans. But if that\u2019s the case, why are there still bears and wolves and deer walking around? I was initially expecting that the player would slowly discover that the toxic atmosphere had caused the plants/animals to evolve strange characteristics that allow them to survive the hostile environment, but by all counts, the deer on Icarus are no different than the deer that wander through my neighborhood in suburban Colorado. This is just one of many many examples of missed opportunities with the sci-fi elements of the game but at the end of the day, the pine trees in this foreign, extraterrestrial landscape are the same bland trees growing in my backyard. Bummer.\n\nThe polar bears\u2026 I do not know what the devs had goin on in their personal lives when they made the polar bears in this game but when you\u2019re going up against 1300 pounds of pure hatred that can run at 92 miles per hour, scale near-vertical cliffs, and slap your shrimpy lil biped butt back into orbit, your best hope is to pray.\n\nJust generally fighting hostile animals. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s particularly hard, it\u2019s just wildly inconsistent. I think this inconsistency arises mostly because face shots deal significant bonus damage to animals (which makes sense); the problem is that the hitboxes are either terribly buggy or woefully oversimplified. You must hit an animal directly in the face (not head) to receive the damage bonus; hitting an animal in the side/back of the head or neck will do the same amount of damage as hitting it in the foot. The damage dealt to you by the animals is also terribly inconsistent. In some instances, hostile animals struggle to do any damage to you at all whereas other times, they can deal massive damage without even looking in your direction. They are also able to deal damage for about a full second after they are killed meaning it\u2019s not uncommon to barely survive an encounter with a bear only to be killed moments later by the bear\u2019s lifeless corpse (note that this has happened to me in both online multiplayer and offline solo so I don\u2019t suspect this is a lag/ping issue).\n\nScientific blasphemy. Maybe this is nit-picking, but for a realistic sci-fi survival game as highly anticipated as this, I had expected the scientifically relevant aspects of the game to at least make some sense. Many of them do not :/ A prime example is the fact that whenever the player is in an underground cave, they receive the \u201cunderground\u201d debuff which significantly affects health/stamina regen. As if it wasn\u2019t already weird that you are debuffed simply by walking into a cave, you also risk contracting pneumonia whilst underground. Given that the player is wearing an air-tight suit (\u201ctoxic\u201d atmosphere, remember), I am fascinated to know how airborne viruses/fungi are getting into the player\u2019s lungs and further baffled why this can only happen underground.\n\nThere is still more to talk about with both pros and cons but I think this list at least hits some of my thoughts thus far into the game. All of the cons I\u2019ve mentioned (and most, if not all the cons that I\u2019ve seen other reviewers mention) are perfectly fixable problems; at this point, I'm just waiting to see if the developer is willing to put in the time and energy required to turn Icarus into the smash hit sci-fi survival game that it was advertised to be.", "timestamp_created": 1639596445, "timestamp_updated": 1639596445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 853, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.967008531093597412", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142729673": {"recommendationid": "142729673", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995773853", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 826, "last_played": 1694824871}, "language": "english", "review": "Mixed reviews apparently were of the new release.

This allowed a friend and I to take part in the Beta Weekends program that ran for several weeks prior to actual release. I am pretty sure it was released as full retail but it was arguably still in very early access condition.\nSince game mechanics were still being implemented it would have been defined as an alpha phase game.\n\nIt was harsh, unforgiving, but strangely addictive. \nMany hours of hard work could be totally wiped out by a poorly placed torch, a random lightning strike, or the retro-engines of a coop buddy randomly being given a trajectory to enter the map that targeted directly at your camp.\n\nWolves could chew through multiple layers of stone construction in as little as 60 seconds.\nYou find yourself frequently faced with situations where you either rage-quit or simply roll over laughing hilariously at the unexpected.\n\nIt's can be that kind of harsh.\n\nBut fun!\n\nSince I stay pretty busy with a small cadre of gaming friends who are mostly from my generation, (I am currently approaching 62 very soon.) so after release I decided that I would keep the game and check back in every so often to see how things were going with it's development. I own server hardware from which my little band of old farts play various survival-sandbox games and such as our interests lead us. Time marches on...\n\nNow it is fast approaching Halloween for 2023 and I notice that I have around 258 hours of play under my belt from which I can form an opinion. Steam is reminding me again that I should offer up a review... so here I am.\n\nThe game is quite fetching, with a lot of natural mountain splendor, open desert vistas, and frozen wastes.\nThere are now enough play options and locations available from which to work feverishly on gathering resources while the local wildlife attempts to gnaw your ass off at every opportunity.\n\nWhy does the suspiciously \"alligator-esque\" looking crocodile seem to find me far more appealing as a dinner entree than the pretty pony, with tusks, that also wants a piece of my sweet-meats?\n\nIf you kill something, you had better dress it out in a flat-ass hurry, or hope it's small enough to throw over your shoulders and carry with you. If not, in less than 30 seconds, other denizens will come running like you rang a dinner bell.\nIt can quickly get out of control and you find yourself needing waders to slog your way out of the corpse pile of now dead predators you unintentionally attracted.\n\nIf... you survive.\n\nPlayers are allowed to set up camp practically anywhere.\n\nCaves are interesting, but the current mechanic is terribly janky, thoroughly breaking any semblance of believable immersion from outside weather conditions that insist on following you into the depths of the underworld in an unpredictable fashion. You can literally perish from heat stroke while suffering from frostbite inside caves that act as passageways between different biomes. The caverns seem to \"want\" to have their own biome but just can't manage to enforce it throughout with any dependable consistancy.\nBeing in a cave large enough to allow you to build a completely enclosed structure is just about your only chance against those subterranean sandstorms.\n\nBeasts of burden have been added recently. A much needed addition to the game.\nNow, if I could just convince my buffalo that \"defensive\" mode means it should defend itself if attacked, not go off full-Rambo at the merest sight of a possible predator in the distance.\nNormally pets follow at a distance, unless they are going psycho-aggressive on a perceived intruder or if you are stopping to dress out a fresh kill. At that point they will amble over, stomp it to ensure it is dead, and then proceed to stand on the carcass in an attempt to prevent you from claiming your kill.\n\"Look fart-stain, you either get off my dinner or I am going to introduce you to my 'boom-stick' and make an entree substitution.\"\n\nI think you all get the idea... this title is a little gem under a considerable bit of early access crustiness.\nThere is something to love in here, but it needs some elbow grease to make that sparkle visible.\n\nKeep workin' on it RocketWerkz, I am a patient guy.

If you play it for as long as I have, you can see many, many mechanics are half baked, where a potentially cool concept has been implemented but has not been implemented to a complete degree.  Useless workshop items, mounts that don\u2019t seem to trigger mission objective progression, some missions reworked, others left very unsatisfying, etc.\n\n\u2022\tThe performance is still not acceptable.  I now have an RTX 4090, and this game still suffers from stuttering, and frame dips.  Yes, I play at 4K.  Yes, I choose not to use DLSS because I hate the distortion it causes. However, that does not excuse that I get 40-60 FPS on average with this game.  It visually at times is a pretty game, but not pretty enough to justify how poorly this game runs.  And no\u2026after two years no Nvidia driver has magically fixed your games poor optimisation.\n\n\u2022\tThe animal AI, while they no longer stupidly decide to go \u2018lets only target the humans\u2019 and you have multiple different species of animal attacking you all at once (save for the cougar, for some reason\u2026) they still do not act like animals.  You NEVER will see a wolf pack hunting another animal, a bear going fishing, a herd of buffalo or antelopes moving together for protection.  What do I see instead?  The alpha wolf ATTACKING ITS OWN PACK MEMBERS while I am attacking it\u2026I have also successfully glitched the AI to have other animals attack another creature by setting it on fire, while the other animal that is set on fire just stands there and doesn\u2019t react\u2026(Don\u2019t ask me how that even works).\n\nA couple of just personal gripes from me that make me see red (and I have posted on their feedback form about\u2026over a year ago).\n\n\u2022\tIt\u2019s been two years\u2026why have you still not fixed the biofuel lamp and flashlight literally failing at properly doing their job?  What I mean by that, is that the light gets obstructed by your own characters arms.  Even better, when you try to aim with a weapon like a bow, or look up and down, THEY DO NOT POINT WHERE YOU ARE LOOKING SO YOU CANT SEE! Seriously, fix this.  Its not even hard, mount the light source to over the shoulder, simple.\n \n\u2022\tFor the love of all that is holy, why, on Icarus, will you not tell us what the hell our actual mission objective BEFORE dropping into the planet?! Seriously, what is the actual real behind this?! This has cost me HOURS of backtracking because I do not have the right equipment, or blueprints to craft items at hand.  Some mission conditions changing due to unexpected events, that is ok.  But, when the lore behind it is we are getting contracts from entities to undertake missions on the planet, it makes ZERO SENSE why they don\u2019t tell you what you specifically need to do!  There is zero point concealing it, people will just go and look it up on the wiki to know what to expect.

So I wanted to throw my hat into the ring with my view of this game and the direction it has taken. For context, I had played with a friend during the trial weekends that were held before the official launch. \n\nThis game is incredible, but is meant for a niche audience within the survival games genre group. Most survival games tend to be about construction of homes and the improvement of equipment to get rare materials. Most games, ICARUS included, follow this concept. However, some games put a spin on things (which are both good and bad features). I feel that some reviewers have missed the spin that ICARUS delivers, which is a hardtype take on the genre. \n\nFor gameplay itself, ICARUS focuses on character importance and effects rather than how effective one's gear is. Players do not have the ability to unlock all the crafting recipes, and the player's character can either spec their talent points into being a jack-of-all-trades or a specialized character for one to two specific purposes, and there is little wiggle room. This emphasizes the benefit of having multiple people to play with, as your friends can fill in the gaps that you may not have access to. For example, I focused on farming and husbandry, while my friend was more focused on hunting and weapon perks. I enjoy this aspect purely because this enforces the notion that playing with friends makes it easier to work on specific jobs instead of trying to perform multiple tasks at once. \n\nICARUS is also a game that encourages the player to focus on their character's status, as buffs and debuffs could radically change how the player operates while exploring the wilderness. They affect more than just health-related boosts. Aspects such as stamina consumption and capacity, food/water/oxygen drainage, and even experience can be affected by both buffs and debuffs. I am a huge supporter of this idea, as it enforces the concept that you can't permanently buff yourself to minimize the danger you face. \n\nNow that I have written down my thoughts on the gameplay, I would like to address some complaints I have seen in the reviews:\n\n-There are complaints about the weather system being a general tumor on the community, but I disagree. Why should my crappy Thatch shack be able to withstand a storm with high-speed winds? It's made of sticks, fiber, and wood, which aren't the most durable of materials. I frankly enjoy the storm system, as it provides me with a purpose beyond plopping down some walls and roofing on some foundations and calling it a home.\n\n-To those that say the game is poorly optimized, I do not disagree with your statements. I would prefer to view the hardware and game setting specs on reviews that are based purely on the graphics more, because I have a mid-tier laptop by today's standards and I'm running the game fine for the most part. The only time I have performance issues is when I load into a world. This is probably the only review claim that I do not fully disagree with. To those that have posted their computer specs, I thank you. \n\n-Finally, I've seen some reviews floating around about how predators are a joke. I agree with you that the AI could use some tuning, but you can still get your ass handed to you if you're not aware. For example, I've seen complaints about normal forest bears (which I feel have been nerfed). Bears can be a joke now, but the polar bears in the icy biomes are ruthless and aggressive. Coupled with an ill-prepared prospector that has little to no cold resistance, then you're asking to be mauled to death. Not to mention, that the debuffs that you suffer are no laughing matter. \n\nTo summarize my thoughts on paper in a review format, this game is pretty good, especially for the price it's currently at. If you enjoy having a survival game that doesn't really hold your hand, but gives you the basic knowledge of the game functions and leaves you stranded (to a degree), then you may have fun. If you want everything to be explained in painstaking detail with little room for danger to seep in, then you should probably avoid this game.\n \nP.S. If you find anything in my review that you disagree with, shoot me a comment below. I want to hear opinions from other people outside my social circle. As long as it's not to disparage me based on something you may disagree with, I'm eager to hear the thoughts of others.", "timestamp_created": 1677873154, "timestamp_updated": 1677873154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 281, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.935023844242095947", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144920360": {"recommendationid": "144920360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002162816", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 14284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13034, "last_played": 1693484847}, "language": "english", "review": "The game itself is actually quite decent. I'd even suggest picking it up during a sale and giving it a try. However, what really stands out in this situation is the fanservice and the way the developers handle their promises and criticisms.\n\nLately, on their official Discord, it seems like all they do is talk about the expenses they're dealing with to make everything happen. Frankly, it gets a bit tiresome hearing about these complaints. They only seem to be active when they're about to release something new, like New Frontiers now. Other than that, they can go for months without any communication. They're going on about how much effort and money goes into creating a pet in the game, costing anywhere from $30k to $50k, and how players don't really understand the work behind it. Then they talk about features like full mod support, which we all know breathe life into games (remember how DayZ did it?), and they claim it would cost millions. They also mention something as simple as character customization being worth a million dollars.\n\n\"Rocket | CEO\" mentioned that those who bought the Supporters Edition will eventually get a significant discount. Depending on how many units are sold, the Supporters Edition might even end up not costing the developers anything, or possibly even causing them to lose money, especially in certain regions.\n\nHonestly, this kind of messaging to the people who believed in them and invested more to receive what was promised is a bit surprising. It's common knowledge that pre-orders and early supporters often get better deals. It's not rocket science (no pun intended). It seems like they're trying to make it look like they're the ones carrying the financial burden, which doesn't really sit right. This is a standard practice, and usually, it's the other way around \u2013 pre-orders are given at a discount.\n\nI can already imagine the defenders who will argue that we should support the developers. It's fine to have differing opinions, but we need to be honest about our concerns.\n\nThe financial equation here is quite simple. The Icarus Deluxe Edition (that was the name of the edition I bought) costs $109.98, yet Styx, which everyone owning the game received for free, has a standalone cost of $23.44 (on promotion). The first DLC, priced at $25.49, brings the total to $48.93. Even if we factor in the $8.99 for Styx and a $5.99 add-on with lamps (which is also part of the deluxe edition), the total comes to $63.91 - and the next DLC won't cost $40 for sure, does that mean they'll start slicing out every little feature and selling them for $3-4 each just to hit that price point?\n\nThe lack of transparency in their communication is baffling. Any expression of dissatisfaction is met with backlash from their supporters, who don't seem to grasp that if you don't voice your concerns, you won't see any improvements. On Discord, you're flooded with messages about how everything is perfect and fantastic, which doesn't make sense for a game that's still in development (and it's supposed to be the first year in Early Access, but that's a whole other issue).\n\nEncountering yet another update that introduces redundant features like two shields, coupled with the ongoing lack of progress in the development of the station shop and the repeatedly emphasized but elusive focus on future improvements, has thoroughly exhausted my patience. The absence of effective communication on these matters has significantly eroded my enthusiasm. I'm left in a state of uncertainty regarding the specifics of what the next game update will bring: what content will be added and how the game will evolve. The broad statements provided often fail to align with the actual changes that emerge when an update is eventually released.\n\nTake a look at the sudden surge in positive reviews today \u2013 it's clearly orchestrated by them.\n\nI'm sharing this negative feedback not because I dislike the game itself, but because I'm disappointed in the way the developers are handling their communication and game development. I'd still recommend buying and playing the game. While it's notably under-optimized, the recent changes seem to make the gameplay more accessible for a wider audience. Whether it suits your tastes or not is something you'll have to decide for yourself.

Makes managing resources a lot easier.\n[*]The crafting queue is slick and lets you stack up your crafting tasks efficiently.\n[*]The shared XP system is a cool feature when you're teaming up with pals, making teamwork more rewarding.\n[*]The weather effects are legit; they can get intense and make the world feel dangerously alive.\n[*]The base story is interesting (even though it doesn't play much into the actual gameplay).\n[*]Base building and crafting options are solid with lots of variety.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]The Bad Stuff:[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]Okay, the technical issues are a nightmare. Solo play is alright, but in co-op, my FPS tanks hard. We're talking dropping from 90-100 down to 15-30, and that's with a good PC.\n[*]The Level of Detail (LOD) is a letdown. Even on the best settings, things pop in out of nowhere and the shadows look like they can't decide if they want to be there or not.\n[*]DX12 and Ray-Tracing options seem more like they're for show because they smash your FPS and barely make a difference in how the game looks.\n[*]The map is boring. There's nothing cool to find, no places that make you want to explore. No cool secrets or spots to discover, just a whole lot of \"been there, seen that.\"\n[*]The combat system is super basic. Animals just charge if you're close enough, and that's it. No dodging or parrying, and the melee is almost useless. It's all about bows or guns. There's no real skill or strategy needed, just shoot from a distance.\n[*]The animals might as well have a clingy relationship with you; they follow you forever.\n[*]Attack animations are rough for both the animals and the player. It's like watching early 2000s CGI trying to be real.\n[*]The movement and physics feel off. Jumping feels like you're on the moon and the overall movement is just awkward.\n[*]Building's got potential, but it's bogged down by a fiddly system where you craft each piece one by one and then struggle with the placement.\n[*]Despite a ton of skills to choose from, a lot of them don't really matter. Like, why have multiple talents for seeing animals in bushes when one talent shows their health from afar? But there is no talent for seeing dead animals in the lush bushes...\n[*]Missions could've been interesting, but they end up feeling like a grocery list of chores. It's just collecting stuff without any fun twists or challenges.\n[*]The biomes look different at first, but you quickly realize they're all the same just with different skins. Plus, they're the same every time which gets old.\n[*]The game's got systems like electricity, but they're only half done. There's no way to control them properly, so you're stuck playing electrician every time you need to switch something on or off.\n[*]What really bugs me is that they keep dropping paid DLCs and content when there are still so many bugs and basic quality-of-life stuff that isn't fixed.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Bottom line:[/b] Icarus has some cool concepts and could be a blast, but it feels rushed. It's rough around the edges and needs some serious updates to be what it could be. If you're a survival game junkie and you've played everything else, maybe take a look.

I understand launch difficulties and server issues that come up around them - none of my beef with this game has anything to do with that.\n\nThe game is intentionally tedious and obtrusive in the worst possible ways. \n\nThere are four talent trees, Survival, Construction, Combat, and Solo. The Solo tree makes no sense and forces anyone who wants to take points into it into a Solo-Only mindset, as these talents *do not work* if you are in a multiplayer game. This is a completely baffling design decision that blows my mind. The tree shouldn't exist.\n\nThere's no respec functionality whatsoever, and talent points stop at level 40. If you want to try different builds, the only solution is to make another character, which seems like an absolutely bizarre design decision without any real thought put into it. Characters are not disparate enough in terms of their talent selection to warrant alt characters, so you don't get enough of a meaningful gameplay experience change by rolling a new character to try different talents that might make your life easier. If talents were so impactful that they made the player's character feel meaningfully different from others, then I could maybe see a degree of permanence being important - but there isn't, so it makes no sense in my eyes.\n\nMost missions follow a set formula. Land, spend 60% of your time in the mission teching back up to whatever level of technology and assets needed to complete the mission, 20% of your time completing the mission, and then anywhere from 10-20% of your total time in the mission is spent trudging back to your dropship. None of the mission timers we had ever felt like we were 'under the gun', with most missions giving anywhere from 3-7 RL days to complete, while the mission themselves took anywhere from 3-4 hours of playtime to complete. There isn't any way to facilitate faster travel aside from movement speed talents, so these last 10-20% of missions are actual wastes of time as you run through the landscape as fast as you can to get back to your dropship, so you can leave and go somewhere else - these trips can easily take up to 15-25 minutes, depending on how far the objectives are from your drop. There is nothing challenging about it - it is simply more tedium tacked on that doesn't respect the player's time.\n\nThe missions themselves are usually cased around a biome, which is a set map that you'll complete multiple missions on. This sounds fine - except for the fact that each individual mission requires you to leave the planet at the end of it. When you return to that biome to tackle a new mission, all of your building progress is gone, but the map is the exact same otherwise. On the first winter biome, we had to build virtually the *exact same base* in the *exact same spot* no less than four times because we had multiple missions for that biome. This feels incredible repetitive, doesn't respect the player's time, isn't challenging and just feels lazy.\n\nDeath is a mechanic that also makes no sense to me. In a multiplayer session, if you are killed, you drop to the ground and can be revived by a teammate. The only penalty for death in this instance is a reduction of Food / Oxygen / Water stats, which can be easily remedied. The only time you have to actually contemplate a respawn is if nobody can revive you, which in the majority of instances where you have 3 or more players, is exceedingly rare.\n\nIn solo play, this is an entirely different animal. If you are killed in solo play, you *must* respawn, and take an XP penalty as well as lose all your equipment. The dropping of the equipment is fine and understandable, but the XP penalty boggles my mind. As of the time of writing this review, the XP penalty is scaled to the amount of XP you are currently into a level. So if you're 90% of the way from level 9 to level 10, the XP penalty is HIGHER than if you were just 10% of the way into a level. If this is a bug, I'm glad to be proven wrong. Even if it isn't, the penalty is staggeringly high, and massively disincentivizes solo play.\n\nThere are other issues as well, many of which are covered in the other reviews plastered here. The Mixed aggregate of reviews is fair - the game itself has some good moments and the framework of the game is interesting. As it currently stands, I'd highly encourage prospective buyers to wait and see what RocketWerkz does to address everything. If you do still feel inclined to buy it, make sure you're playing with friends - as with most games, it's better when you have buddies to play with.\n\nEdit:\n\nI will say, I've given this some thought and there's a few things right off the top they could do to make things immediately better. For those of you who have upvoted and brought attention to this review, I appreciate it.\n\n\n\nEdit: 8 June, 2022\n\nI give Dean Hall and RocketWerkz credit - they are listening and trying.\n\nMost of my initial suggestions (which I had to delete to conserve space) have been addressed to a reasonable degree. The new map, Styx, looks to promise some actual continuity between missions in some context (according to their devblog, missions now can change the map in between missions). The timer change to RL time makes sense, and the hardcore mode added alleviates any remaining concerns I had on that front. \n\nI still cannot recommend the game, but I'm a lot closer to it now than I was six months ago. It's very obvious at this stage that the staff is very committed to turning this ship around, and I've kept quiet tabs on it as they've progressed. Most of what they've addressed is core functionality of the game that was just unfun - and rightfully so, that stuff needed to be addressed first. I do think if you've read the progress and see potential with the title, it's worth investing in - but you should see it as an investment, not a game really ready to sink a ton of hours into right now.\n\nI think they also realize that there's just not enough interesting and exciting enough incentives to actually play currently beyond chasing exotics for gear. \n\nWhat will get me back into this game is a sense of persistence. I personally want to be able to be able to land on Styx or Olympus (the two current maps) and complete *multiple* missions before returning, so I can get the benefit of not having to rebuild the same base over and over again in the same general area.

In fact, the only time a predator shows any interest in anything that's not human is after you've killed something, and then every carnivorous creature in a 10 mile radius is suddenly drawn to the bunny you just killed, and you have to fight all of them off in order to harvest it. The carnivorous creatures are also simple, though. They see you? They try and eat you. I've had bears, crocodiles and wolves working together chasing me through the water to kill me. There's no territorial aggression between species, they all just serve to kill you.\n\n[b]Travel:[/b] A large portion of the game. And also probably the most boring part. The majority of the missions I've done, and I have not done all of them, require a lot of running from point to point. The last mission I just completed was to open up a path to make travel between an area easier. But what was required to open that path had so much time wasting filler that it wasn't even fun. And also to note, these steps are told individually after you complete the previous one. There's zero indication, unless you look up the mission steps ahead of time, that these will be required.\n[list]\n[*]Step 1: Land on the planet, retrieve the radar from your dropship, scan three locations. In classic Icarus fashion, each area you scan causes wildlife to attack you.\n[*]Step 2: Once all three locations are scanned, (which are pretty spread out and take a while to get to each) you have to head over to a cave that was picked up by the scanning.\n[*]Step 3: Gain access to the cave, which requires backtracking down the snowy mountainside  that you had just gone through to scan one of the areas in order to retrieve explosives dropped for you.\n[*]Step 4: Once you've retrieved the explosives, head back up to the cave you found and place them.\n[*]Step 5: Once those explosives are placed, you're told you need to go to the other side of the cave in order to place them on the opposite side. The 'legitimate' path to do that requires you to circle the entire map, and then cut through the desert straight back south to place the explosives on the other side of the cave, too.\n[*]Step 6: Once you've done that, mission is over and you can extract.\n[/list]\nBut, to add onto all of the above steps, a weather system starts every 5 minutes and lasts between 5-10 minutes of having to wait through it in shelter. And between running for the 5 minutes of time without weather, you've gotta kill every wolf, bear, boar, cougar, hyena, scorpion and whatever other hostile creature I'm forgetting to mention because they'd all aggro onto you as you pass by.\nBut to top it all off, the reward for this mission was garbage in comparison to the one I'd done previously for not even half the effort or time.\n\nTLDR; Unfortunately the game suffers from far too much time-wasting filler and lack of interesting mechanics, despite initially seeming like it should be interesting. The game can certainly be fun, but at the end of the day I think there are better survival games out there, and I personally would not suggest this one to any of my friends.", "timestamp_created": 1659391579, "timestamp_updated": 1659391579, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 260, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.91316145658493042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105537542": {"recommendationid": "105537542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281034380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 14854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6328, "last_played": 1695370701}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, just to be clear, I don't recommend this game YET. I get the feeling that given some work, Icarus potential may be met, and there is a ton of potential here. But in it's current state, there is a lot of disappointment.\n\n[b]My biggest issue with Icarus is it doesn't seem to take it's own identity seriously.[/b] Its stake in the survival gaming world, its gimmick if you will, that you're not sticking around, you get in, build what you have to and get out, its quite invigorating and a great take on a survival crafter. But as I have followed Icarus through beta it seems like more and more it aims to try to keep you around longer than you should have to be. Furthermore, mechanics that aimed to put that type of manic pressure have been either removed or pseudo-removed, I say \"psuedo\", as the timer for missions is still very much implemented, but 7 days ([i]real days[/i], not in game days) is not exactly pushing you out the door even for the most casual of players. It's all kind of a wash and many likely play through there 20 or so levels gathering different components to craft higher level gear in the first or second prospect (Icarus' name for missions) and don't bother pursuing the others.\n\nAnd why would they? [b]Higher level craftables are insanely expensive and completely unnecessary given that the \"second best\" option in many cases is nearly as good if not pretty much identical to the far more expensive top item. [/b]This is compounded by the fact that the game expects you to get comfortable with a play loop for its prospects but offers almost nothing unique or interesting to do once you get to them. It feels really bad to spend an hour or two building the same stuff you've already built a dozen times to do a mission that then asks you to do little more than touch a couple flowers and leave, no weapons, armor, proper preparation of any kind was necessary in the first place. This had me treating most prospects as trial and error. Lets try to do the mission, if I die, we build some stuff, if not, we just leave. But this feels very counterintuitive to the gameplay loop Icarus WANTS to establish.\n\nI know everybody has a bucket list but I'd like to offer some things I personally would like to see implemented I think would alleviate some of this general unfun grind and allow for some far better experiences. It doesn't sit well with me to just say \"this bad\" and offer no alternative.\n\n1. [b]Combine some of the prospects together.[/b] This one is integral as far as I'm concerned. There is no sense in grinding a house and upper level crafting stations for upwards of an hour to play for 15 minutes. Claiming there are 36 missions is a stretch, of the 10 or so I've done through release and the beta there's more like 1 mission and 9 bloated side stories. Just taking the first 3 forest biome propects alone, if you were to drop, have to gather some exotic tea leaves, plant some radar stations and hunt down a scary predator all in one mission, with a timer of say more like 6 hours instead of 6 days... holy moly we're playing a fricken game now. [i]It's almost like we could potentially fail[/i], like there is something at stake. A vital aspect this game is missing.\n\n2. [b]Electronics need to be nerfed or just removed, and then and only then the \"second best\" needs to be nerfed in almost every category.[/b] This isn't just tools and weapons mind you, the ice box can run for an Icarus eternity on a handful of ice and preserves food what seems like triple or better. This is already fantastic, and makes the much, much more difficult to craft and run refrigerator, frankly a joke. The dev (devs?) already lowered some crafting costs but seem wary of making any sweeping changes, which is totally fair, however I'd say also completely necessary in this case. EDIT: As of 12/10, the devs have also buffed gold spawn, which was by far the biggest pain point for resource gathering. However that has done little to aid the the mind-numbing amount of materials necessary for some crafts, even if they are more readily available. My rant is reduced, but the following statement still holds true. [u]Have fun farming for 12+ hours to make your compound bow and composite arrows that you will likely leave behind after the 20 minutes it takes for you to complete the mission.[/u] This is a serious problem.\n\n3. I've played solo and with a team and there is an unfair disadvantage to players who either do both or exclusively play solo. [b]The solo tree should get talent points every level[/b]. Obviously still turn them off during team play, but allow leveling solo and group trees together. The separation of the trees is actually implemented quite nicely, the fact that you must choose is atrocious.\n\n4. [b]Talent respec please[/b]. Especially if the talent tree is not going to recieve points beyond 40, there is not enough variation in builds to warrant walling this without making a completely new character, and in modern games spending those 3 or 4 points in something that did not have the impact you expected and having NO viable way to undo that action is rough to say the least. I don't care if it costs in game currency to still slightly discourage, I'm fine with that, but SOMETHING to respec talent system please.\n\n5. This is more of a refinement to the speeding up gameplay to match what Icarus is all about but how about some better exotic offerings. It takes about 10 minutes to get in a craft a steel pickaxe and about 10 seconds to craft a campfire but up to 2 hours to craft something I'd really LIKE to use like a dehumidifer. How about a darn exotic dehumidifer so I can drop in and cave base. In the absence of some way to bring items back with you (which would sure be nice, even if just 1 or 2), I'd really think the game would know itself well enough to supply you the good stuff  in its end game meta progression and not extremely minor benefits that barely speed up gameplay at all. An icebox, a furnace, a stove, SOMETHING you actually want. Or just let us keep it. You know how much better I'd feel about crafting that stupid compound bow and a full stack of composite arrows if I could KEEP them? Much better. Maybe THIS (exotic storage container?) is something worthwhile to throw on the lackluster exotic tree.\n\n[h1]Conclusion, TL:DR[/h1]\n\nI know a lot of this sounds like \"make Icarus harder!\" no wait \"make Icarus easier!\" but that's a lot of how I feel about the games current state. Things that should be difficult like the prospect objectives are disappointingly simple especially if you put any effort into preparing that prospect. While others that should flow with Icarus' time based missions are dummy hard like crafting anything made of composites. And this isn't good difficulty, its tedium which Icarus is currently full of and really doesn't have to be. At least these two problems bandage each other, I guess. Had missions been tougher this would make crafting necessary top level stuff just feel all the worse. Instead most will simply never even experience that content because its relegated as unnecessary. But this seems a shame to me, and can't possibly be what the developer intended.\n\nHere's to bettering Icarus, I really like this game all the frustrations aside, I hope to recommend it and even love it in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1639082216, "timestamp_updated": 1639206152, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 626, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912273287773132324", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108256335": {"recommendationid": "108256335", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972575721", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 15577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9758, "last_played": 1685747285}, "language": "english", "review": "Over 150 hours played so far and I left a negative review.

Then a bear runs up a vertical cliff and destroys me as I get stuck in the map...with pneumonia...but I have on a spacesuit with its own oxygen supply.\n\nThe game does not run well even on new hardware.  The grind is awful just for the sake of being awful.  There is no balance to any of the crafting costs or Tiered equipment.  Enemy AI is ridiculous but not in a funny way.  There is usually no point to getting anything beyond the lowest tier gear and sprinting (vast distances) to the objective unless you are forced to craft T4 gear just to complete the mission immediately afterward and start all over again on the next one.  My character is almost level 90 but I stopped getting talent points 50 levels ago and will never be able to learn the art of turning wood into sticks. There is almost no point to exotics, yet they are described as the most valuable thing on Icarus.  Cheese tactics usually prevail in any situation.\n\nAnd despite all of this, I grind on, searching endlessly for gold and I guess sticks as well because my character will never know the joy of converting the wood I chopped into sticks that I need stacks and stacks of to get a drop of that sweet bio fuel and those shiny electronics parts.  I just imagine that it will all be worth it in the end...or when the DLC continues the story even though there are current in game items labeled as \"coming soon\".

So many creative ideas and concepts feel half finished, poorly implemented or terribly balanced. I can see how this game could have, and still might be, one of the greats of the survival gaming genre, but at the current rate with the direction of updates that Rocketwerks' creative team seems to be taking, they are turning this game into the most average open world survival experience. \n\nThe premise of this game is that you are a semi independent contractor, doing jobs on a failed terraforming project for research, economic, and military applications. This failed terraforming project for some reason or another has caused the atmosphere to be completely unbreathable for humans, and with the lack of any real and established presence for full scale colonization or production from orbit, you are dropped in to do these jobs with the clothes on your back and a sense of optimism. You will need to source all of your equipment by yourself (or with friends), from the planets surface every mission. This is without a doubt one of the main draws of this game for myself and one of the reasons I loved it so much. This system, of continual restarts in an almost quasi-roguelike open world system was very well done. \n\nHowever, after your first few missions you will start to hit a massive wall. All of the late game tech (tier 3 and 4 in the game's 4 tier system) is HORRIFICALLY balanced to a point where doing them in a mission is not at all worth it. For basically every mission in this game that doesn't include fighting a world boss or dealing with polar bears, you can deal with practically any threat with the tier 1 bow. It doesn't help that most of the animal AI in this game is borderline mentally disabled to a degree where if it is a passive, prey animal it will most likely run directly away, and if its a carnivore, it will immediately turn and try to kill you on sight. If you even have the slightest amount of game sense you can predict basically all your shots, and easily dodge animals like grizzly bears by simply moving slightly to the left or right. However you will never see a carnivore try to kill anything other than you. In fact all the animals literally have zero interaction with each other in the environment around you. Speaking about the environment, remember how you were on a planet that had an unbreathable atmosphere, so you had a space suit? Get ready for that to never matter - the only fucking interaction you will ever have in this game that will remotely remind you of this fact is a little oxygen indicator you need to keep filled, which ends up being nothing but a glorified timer for how long you can be away from your base for. This spacesuit will never rip or crack, even though it apparently lets you catch pneumonia from caves (even though I have a filtered oxygen supply?) and take massive, bleeding gash wounds from all the dangers on this hostile planet. This somewhat haphazard thinking and implementation is what plagues this game and often seeps into its systems and development. Another great example would be the complete random spread of biomes, with no crossover or realistic mediums between them - a massive glacier area is literally bordering 2 fucking deserts in the main map. It would be more interesting if there were additional maps that had a more biome focused region, maybe one that is tropical into a coastal area, a steppe type region that blends into a desert, a more northern coniferous forest type that merges with a cold northern arctic blend. I think this would not only add to the scale of the game's world, but allow for more interesting biome interactions that don't border on nonsensical.\n\nAnd this is just the tip of the iceberg. Realistically, I have a list 20 miles long of things that this game needs to fix or implement better. Which brings me to my next point - the devs have a broken game that needs to be fixed, and they will not do it in lieu of adding simple stupid weekly one-shot items and systems in these cheesy weekly updates. Instead of optimising the game (which by the way will have massive lag spikes even with top of the line cards and processors, god forbid you get a wildfire, which will basically shoot you down to 4 fps if you're lucky AND have a good system) they seem to only want to add more, new content. Content is not bad, but the issue is they're adding it to a game that doesn't need it. This game needs optimization, general redesign, balance fixes, etc. These are things the community has been requesting for almost a year and a half but it feels like its falling on deaf ears, to a point now where it feels like they are slowly changing the game to be a shadow of its former self in the idea that the criticism received is due to the game's core systems and gameplay instead of its piss poor performance on gaming rigs. \n\nBut honestly I could forgive all of this. Even though this game has so many critical issues, if it wasn't for the fact they gutted the asynchronous online multiplayer feature, and seem to be starting to look to abandon this game. I think they don't understand that their fans want quality not quantity when it comes to updates and now they seem to just be adding random shit for the hell of it, instead of focusing on developing the culture around this game and turning it into the cult classic title in the survival genre it could easily be. \n\nDon't buy this game unless Rocketwerks fundamentally changes their approach to this game's development. You're better off in the hands of Iron Gate Studios with something like Valhiem. They at least give a shit about their game, and understand it's mechanics and systems, which is more than what I can say for the devs of this one.\n\nI really, really hope that this game will change for the better and I'll get to say I was wrong. \n\nBut I doubt it.", "timestamp_created": 1672999905, "timestamp_updated": 1673030359, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 535, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.904758870601654053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106323976": {"recommendationid": "106323976", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977202753", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3496, "last_played": 1675220338}, "language": "english", "review": "Tl;dr this is an early access game masquerading as a complete game with some interesting mechanics but is about as unbaked as your aunties homemade minced meat pie after a hard night of boxed white wine - get it on sale for $5 and play with some friends in a year or two when (if?) the developers get around to finishing the game.\n\nGood stuff first since it's a short list:\n - There's a nice big old talent tree with tons of awesome looking talents, which is one of the things I find survival games [i]never[/i] have. If they do have them they're anemic as shit, where as this game has multiple trees with really nice looking QoL perks. Sadly, you won't get to use more than 15% of it (more on that in the negatives....).\n - When the game doesn't run at 20-30 FPS on a 2080 TI @2k, it's beautiful. Best of luck finding a guide that helps you figure out which options decimate the engine and then praying they actually work. On the other hand, I'm genuinely impressed (technically speaking) that a company managed to find a way to make Unreal run [b]worse[/b] than Unity for an FPS.\n - The building and crafting is fun despite all of the various issues with both. Making bases is enjoyable, the multiple tables are nice, progression makes more or less sense (though it's stupidly expensive and grindy)\n - Despite being an awful grindy overall experience it's still somehow fun to play with friends, at least until you get to the end game missions and realize that you spent $27 on a running/mining simulator with combat mechanics implemented by a toddler\n - Some cool save-game tech; your game ('prospect') gets uploaded somewhere central any [b]anyone[/b] you were playing with can resume it, at any time, and play it with or without you. This is a great approach since there's no real time limit in-game for completing things (just real-life time), so people can play at their leisure and make progress.\n\nTransitioning to the cons...:\n - Nothing is explained. Apparently, everyone was expected to play the two previous betas/open events and know what all the gameplay mechanics were, how the missions worked, that your character gets permanently deleted if you don't finish (or abort) a mission in X real-time days (yup!), that exotics (the end game in-game currency to buy cool unique \"workshop\" items) require a specific quest chain to unlock (the game now highlights these missions after some patches, at least).\n - Sometimes your cool unique workshop items get deleted and you lose them and have to repurchase them. No, not because you left them behind on a mission, because the game just decided to delete them. Why does this suck? Because they require in-game rare currencies (either golden dollars or purple exotic dollars) that come in small quantities from grinding missions and [i]aren't supposed to get deleted[/i].\n - The talent trees are huge but you stop getting points at level 40. This gives you enough points to get 2 trees pretty filled out, but since you had no idea this was going to happen, you've got points spread out over random ass trees all over the place as you were having fun exploring. Naturally, though, you can respec - oh wait, the developers have never played a game with a talent tree before so that's not implemented either. Coming soon (TM), though!\n - The AI is about as smart a lobotomized penguin and all of the animals behave exactly the same. Prey runs and comes back to the [b]exact[/b] same spot you shot it, so hunting amounts to either 1) crit and 1-shot everything, 2) don't crit, wait for animal to pat back to you then murder it with a crit. Predator combat is either 1) bring more friends and pincushion it down with arrows, 2) crit and 1-shot everything except polar bears, 3) if it's a polar bear, crit it and glitch past it or unstuck and get teleported 15 feet away and re-engage, 4) get glitched and 1-shotted yourself when the enemy is 15 feet away and contemplate all the other things $27 could have got you (have you even tried Wendy's new breakfast sandwiches? $27 is a [b]lot[/b] of sandwiches!).\n - The game runs like crap and it seems to be on a completely random basis; find a guide on Youtube and pray it has an affect on your FPS.\n - Dropping items on the ground sometimes falls them through the planet, deleting them permanently, because this game is [strike]fully baked and released[/strike] early access\n - Crafting at later tiers is abysmal. For example, end-game benches require 40-80 gold, and on average you'll maybe get 40-80 gold ore (crafted 2:1 into ingots) from tier 2/3 mines. You need a lot of benches. This basically means all of the end-game is: run around the map decimating every mine (which have fixed amounts of ore, doesn't respawn), then hope to god you can craft the benches to make the mission materials you need at which point you then fuck off back to space and lose 100% of your progress only to do it all again in the next mission.\n - Crafting in general is just terrible. We don't tech beyond bows for weapons or basic bone arrows for ammo as all it does is force you to play the same mission longer, re-grinding the materials you used for either item. The game is also of course very realistic - an aluminium arrow (1, mind you) naturally takes 1 copper ingot, 4 aluminum ingots, and some epoxy. Yes, 4 aluminium ingots. If you've never Googled what an \"ingot\" of metal is, today is the day you should, then Google \"arrow head\" and try to wrap your head around how they fit 4 ingots of aluminium in one arrow.\n - Playing without friends is a nightmare; play with friends or wait until the devs address solo play. It's just taking the already massive grind and multiplying it by the lack of friends you have.\n - While mining in a cave you get a permanent stamina debuff no matter what armor you are wearing, because [i]immersion[/i]. You also randomly develop pneumonia, which there is a later-game fix for, but no one cares because all it does is make you take 15 minutes versus 10 to grind out the mind-numbingly boring cave mining expedition.\n - Fun fact: 100 stones in a pile weighs far more than 100 stones in your inventory, because the stone pile is full of extra [i]stone pile juice.[/i]\n - Dying in the beginning is awful (massive XP debuff you have to work through), dying after level 40 is 100% completely irrelevant as XP no longer matters at all.\n\nIt's got potential. Somehow, despite all of that awful experienced, I almost clocked 60 hours and that was largely playing with 1-2 other people. With more I'm sure the grind would be less noticeable.\n\nThis definitely feels like a come-back-in-a-few-years kind of game and see if the developers have got around to completing it.

After 20 or so hours I was really enjoying the single player loop.  Two years ago, the construction was really innovative.  Coming from Valheim, Fallout 76, 7 Days to Die, and other then-recent base-building games, I really liked what they were doing here.  It felt grounded and realistic and had a real sense of PLACE.  Something about the way storms rolled in and shook your entire cabin while you cowered inside in the firelight... it was amazing.  The weather system forced you to take breaks, to actually spend time inside, and therefore you want to make your base interesting, attractive, and useful.  You really wanted your base to be AESTHETIC as well as situated usefully.  Some of the early bases I built still stay in my mind, like an old college apartment.\n\nHunting (before assists were available) was a matter of walking quietly through the forest and paying attention to your surroundings (I still recommend NOT unlocking the assists, or hunting turns into running through the forest looking for health bars, and automatically landing headshot after headshot without even seeing your target...).  At any moment you could come upon a predator that would wipe you out.  It was tense and atmospheric.  There was one particular mission where you have to gather an absurd amount of food to return to orbit.  In one area, you have to hunt, and in another you need to farm.  That one mission took me about 30 hours in single player.  When I was a kid there was a forest near my house that my friends and I would spend every day exploring (bear with me).  I mapped every nook and stump in the forest in my head.  Until this game, I'd never experienced that same feeling from a video game.\n\nI made burnfields to chase the animals into valleys so I could hunt more efficiently.  I created towers and raised boardwalks to spot valuable prey and sight dangers from a safe height.  The other base was a total contrast, a fortress of farming.  Before taking to orbit, I even felt compelled to ceremoniously burn my house for closure.  It just felt more right than abandoning it, after spending so much (real) time using it as a home.  Note I started calling it a 'home' and not a base.\n\nI talked my friends into getting it and we spent over 120 hours together in this game.  It saw us through much of the pandemic years.  Unfortunately, none of us have any desire to play it anymore.  Why?\n\nWell, the same things that made it compelling are fatal flaws.  After one, two, 20 times through the loop of building a base, only to leave it and start again... it felt less like making an outpost and more like busywork.  The hollowness of the game started to peek through.  The fact that there are 4 variations on a cave, and you've seen them all by mission 2.  The fact that the predators ignore the prey and run straight for you (even to the point that deer and bears can sometimes literally RUN INTO each other and get stuck, causing pathfinding problems as they try to jump over each other in an absurd and very Bethesda way).  The fact that necessary high-tier items can take literal days to accumulate resources for, and you can't keep anything for the next mission.  What do you call a 'reverse-roguelike'? \n\nIn the early versions of the game, mission timers ran in real time - as in, start a mission on Friday, you better finish it by Sunday or you lose both the mission and your entire character!  It was a strange design choice, but one you could respect as it framed the game in a unique way.  It demanded a commitment that saw me and my friends log on night after night.  This is hard to maintain in reality, but did contribute to the immersion and significance of the time spent.\n\nUnfortunately this flawed vision really left no roadmap for the developer.  They compromised on some of the stranger decisions (like the real time mission timer), but the game was built with that in mind, so removing it removed meaning from the overall experience that they haven't been able to replace.  It is a game designed to be played one way, that never truly realized that vision, and is now wandering in a different direction, and therefore full of contradictions and broken ideas.  Some of the most fundamental design problems have not been addressed, while the developer seems dedicated to continuously releasing heartfelt but ultimately trivial weekly updates.  Somehow they are adding content while the game keeps feeling smaller and less important.\n\nIn short, the game really never came together.  There is clear genius leading up to the game's release - an ultimately unfinished but promising early access game.  Since then, however, that same genius has been completely absent.  Its like a song where they only wrote the refrain.  Its so disappointing, because at moments the game was not only my GOTY, but one of my favorite games of all time.  There are also many great memories made with IRL friends that this game helped create.   Its odd to go from enthralled to repelled, but that's the journey, and I think that ambivalence is scattered throughout many of the reviews you'll read.  It honestly makes me regret this game more than a game that just bored me.  Or maybe I should say I'm not mad, Icarus.  I'm just really, really disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1683490436, "timestamp_updated": 1683490436, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 267, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.890913307666778564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "154861507": {"recommendationid": "154861507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029584875", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 33260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31733, "last_played": 1704435135}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm giving this a soft yes.\n\nIcarus is like [i]Valheim[/i] and [i]Ark: Survival Evolved[/i] had a baby who ran off wanting to do its own thing.\n\nThe game was originally envisioned as a mission-based Open World Survival Crafting game with a twist: every new mission is a fresh start. In a somewhat roguelite fashion, your mission rewards can be used to upgrade your starting equipment for future missions, but every mission drops you into a fresh iteration of the world and you have a timer to get your job done and leave. The timers are quite generous, but ultimately all your work on-world gets wiped at the end of each mission and each new one starts with the same humble beginnings, meeting basic needs and working up the tech tree.\n\nThis means you are doing the early stages of OWSC play over and over again.\n\nThe addition of Open World play allows players like me who want to explore and build in a persistent world the ability to do so. A majority of the missions are available to Open World players through \"Operations\" (although some are locked off, such as resource-stockpiling missions). Additionally, many of the missions give you free tech that will bolster your progress if playing in Open World. (If you are playing through Missions the classical way where you leave the planet after each mission, sorry, you can't take those goodies with you.)\n\nThe missions, however, do not come with any sort of story. They are just \"go do this thing\". There are multiple factions in play, but you never get any feeling for any of them. The developers finally started correcting this with the second major DLC: New Frontiers. The missions on that map actually have a story and provide some much needed lore. Which is one of the reasons that DLC is the best that the game has to offer. The lore is scant, the story is shallow, and there are no choices that would elevate this to horizon's-distance of being an RPG. But it is [i]something[/i]. And that is much better than nothing.\n\nAs a sandbox, it is a good game that I spent hundreds of hours playing. The mechanics are solid. It doesn't egregiously waste my time (although I really wish there was some sort of fast travel system between bases). I found the talent trees very nicely done, with some very cool talents to work towards (like javelins glowing to allow you to retrieve them easily or planted crops not decaying once grown). Praise-worthy decision by the devs to have levels also give you separate solo talent points to put into extra boosts for playing solo that offset the difficulties for someone trying to take on a game meant for multiplayer alone. And the tech tree was fun to climb. I really appreciated when talents or blueprints unlocked alternate recipes, such as allowing making rope out of leather or gunpowder out of fertilizer. \n\nOn the other hand, some of the mechanics need work. Base building is often frustrating as pieces refuse to snap to other pieces or will do so in every orientation except the one you want. Oxygen and water containers will equip to your hotbar rather than your suit's life support slots. And one cursed site I tried to build on had terrain that wasn't actual terrain -- just invisible walls and blanketing textures in proximity to each other.\n\nAnd yes, there were bugs. Not too often, although more often than I prefer to see. Sometimes beneficial. Occasionally, I would stop consuming oxygen and water. Or have shotgun shells spawn in my inventory. Sometimes detrimental. On rare occasion, one or two pieces of a base would fail to load. A base I had worked on for over a hundred hours was destroyed by a glitch followed by a crash. And sometimes just bizarre, such as weather-damaged trees becoming invisible or the lava cave where creatures from the land above would regularly drop through the ceiling and land in the lava flow. With the exception of the glitch-n'-crash base-obliteration, none of these were significant.\n\nThe world is beautiful: lovingly hand-crafted map with an RNG factor for various resources. We are given small number of biomes: forests, deserts and arctic zones. As a lover of base building in OWSC games, I was drawn to the waterfalls of the forests and the desert oasis beauty of the canyons in the original map. My ultimate home on the Prometheus map was a cliffside manor built across a majestic waterfall such that the water flowed through the house.\n\nThe world is not exotic, which is fitting for a terraformed planet meant to be a second earth, but ultimately to the game's detriment. It is all very familiar. You traveled lightyears and dropped onto a planet from a space station to hunt deer and boars. The Styx map from the first big DLC gives you more of the same, with a few added creatures. The Prometheus map from New Frontiers takes real steps to remedy this by providing some more exotic scenery and color filters, making it the most interesting map to play on as well as the most rewarding. But I never felt the game developers went far enough. The opening sequence had hints of more, with its giant flowers in lakes of blood and alien creatures scampering through darkened woods. But the game doesn't live up to that. \n\nSave for the extremely rare boss monster, the most dangerous threats are bears. \n\nGranted, bears in Icarus are effing [i][b]scary.[/b][/i]\n\nBut they're not alien or exotic or particularly... special. And I suppose I was really looking for more. \n\nWhich sums up the entire experience of Icarus. Good, fairly solid, and the devs deserve praise for some cool design choices. Worth buying. Worth playing.

The only thing in the game that is alien is a cave worm, a bigger cave worm (boss) and Oxite. Everything else is earthbound: pumpkins, berries, carrots, squash, watermelon, etc. The wildlife? Wolves, bears, cougars, hyenas, fish, elephants, zebras, etc. Not a single thing here is alien. \n\n- If you go back and take a look a their earlier announcement trailers, you'll notice [b]SEVERAL[/b] actual alien creatures, including VEHICLES! None of that is present in their \"full release game\". If your defense to this one is \"they said it'll be added in later\" then you've proved the entire point of this review.\n\n- Animal levels in the game have zero purpose outside of a few extra XP given. They don't do more damage and they don't have more health. \n\n- Missions are clearly copy/pasted and rushed. Go to three areas, scan them, leave (or close to that same formula). \n\n- Outposts [i](aka sandbox mode)[/i] completely leave out predators, ultimately handicapping you on essential resources for advancement. No option is given to add those predators into the game at any point. Considering the desert biome is mostly predators, I can only imagine how empty that biome actually is in sandbox mode.\n\nDevs, I appreciate the free key and effort you've put into this game so far and I will admit there is a fun game sitting here. This isn't your fault, the project leads failed you on this one and rushed it out for holiday sales.

Yes I continued to play for ~30 more hours. To those who feel this invalidates my review, that's fine. For those looking to understand [i]why[/i]; I spent ~10 hours troubleshooting looking for the \"my game runs fine\" middle ground I kept seeing in the comments. Needless to say, the game still runs horribly. I continued to play beyond those extra troubleshooting hours because there IS something fun about the game. I can't tell what, but there is a foundation there for something great. \n\nI also wanted to see what else the game had to offer. To see if things got better. I think that's fair. If anything the fact that I [i]STILL[/i] don't recommend this game after sinking more time into it should further valid my review. I gave it a fair shot.\n\n[h1] Comments regarding me getting the game for free[/h1]\n\nI've been reading comments mentioning that [i]\"I don't get to have an opinion\"[/i] simply because I received this game for free. I encourage you to think a bit differently regarding your stance. The fact I have received a game for free doesn't mean it automatically receives a positive review. If that was the case, you'd never get an honest review. If I'm recommending against this game despite getting a free key, that should speak volumes to you.\n\n[h1] In response to the Developer comment:[/h1]\n\nThis is typical PR speak. If we can just keep it real with each other, everyone would benefit from honesty and transparency. You failed to reassure me or anyone else. You managed to admit nothing outside of you [i]\"feel confident the game is still in a 1.0 state\"[/i], yet in the very next sentence you state [i]\"expect to see a lot of patches, tweaks and updates over the following days, weeks, and months.\"[/i] but what you described is [b]exactly[/b] what an early access game is. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm on board with you all fixing the game. However this is an incredibly misleading and dangerous tactic to advertise your game as a full release when it is nowhere close to being full release.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nIf I had to take a guess, they fell behind on development, bought basic assets for resources/ animals and tossed it into the game either as the final cut or as placeholders until they can actually finish the game. They labelled it full release because they wanted to avoid the stigma \"early access\"  brings. This is easily comparable to the original launch of No Man's Sky; Over promised, under delivered, fix later. \n\n[h1] This is not acceptable and shouldn't be to you either. It's ok if you enjoy the game, but you should be more objective when it comes to identifying a games problems if you want games to be better. If we want better games, we need to expect better and be better.

We've pushed out a couple of hotfixes so far since release, and have another one coming which will address a few more.

As of March 9, 2022, This game is still in beta. Don't believe it when they say it's in full release because it's not. They never finished the story, progression is boring af, and it feels as though the game lacks direction. Heck, they are still trying to add missions... you know that core component of a game that uses missions for levels to play on. It's one thing for a game to lack polish, but it was missing core features and content that should have been available on release. Eh, it's all semantics anyways right? But it just feels icky since some people won't buy a game if it's not in full release because they don't want to play an unfinished game... and it's as though in order to save their asses, the leadership team at Rocketwerkz pushed it into full production to keep the money rolling in. The move seriously lacks morals and integrity.\n\nNow don't get me wrong... there's a reason why I keep coming back to this game, because it's so damn beautiful. I pretty much play on max/epic settings, and the environment absolutely draws you in. I often will sit inside my Icarus house and look out a window at the lake and mountain range and it feels peaceful. The exploration, mining, and crafting will draw you in if you're into those things. Crafting has a lot of imbalances. Some items you'll have a very hard time finding a use for, nor will you likely craft probably 1/4 of the items ever, unless you craft them just for the heck of it. They make crafting tier 4 items pretty much a grind to find copper and gold. And to get the OP workshop items, it's just a grind for Exotics... which there's really only 1-way to grind them which is 300% more efficient than doing other missions for them. The aggro mobs are uber meh; extremely simple aggro mechanics...run in a straight line at you and swing. If they didn't have skins you wouldn't be able to tell a difference between them at all.\n\nI give the criticism out of love not hate. I want this to be a great game.

The animal spawns seem random at best, and more often than not the entire region seems out for the player's blood. The gameplay loop of starting from scratch every mission makes everything feel very slow, and since you can't take anything with you when you leave, (unless you brought it from space to begin with) you spend much of your time just getting back to a decent level. And if you want to make some of the top tier items, you will need to pour hours into running around gathering hundreds of semi-limited supplies, such as 180 copper bars, (360 ore) just to make two machines who's sole purpose is to make another material that you requires four other resources, which you will need to make in abundance. When mining for metals, you *have* to go into caves, which immediately debuffs the player's stamina, but then you also run the risk of catching pneumonia, which further debuffs your stamina, and can leave the player with so little energy you might not even be able to jump or swing your pickaxe. This punishes the player twice over, for doing something that is required. (And makes no sense as you are hooked up to an 02 tank, not breathing cave air. Dying has the most severe punishments, though. Not only do you drop all of your belongings, (and respawn somewhere \"randomly\" if you didn't make a bed), but you also lose *all* of your progress to the next level, unless you can get revived by another player.

The upgrade path is easy to grasp and progress along it it is well paced with a sufficient variety of resources.\n\nThe build system is a little limited for the moment and does not yet include any curved pieces or even angled flooring but does support complex, functionally useful and visually appealing if somewhat restrictively boxy structures. Decorations are well thought out and allow a reasonable degree of freedom in placement. To put it simply I could never build exactly what I wanted but I was also never displeased with what I could build and most importantly I rarely felt like I was fighting against the build system. Hopefully we will see an upgrade to add snap points to half pieces and the addition of equilateral triangles at some point in the development cycle.\n\nEnemy variety is slightly better than the norm for these types of games, we will always want more but there is enough that you don't always feel like you are in the same fight at least. Some effort has been made to vary enemy tactics with the addition of predictable attack patterns for certain enemy types allowing you to sometimes learn and develop useful strategies but beyond that it is the standard 'passive enemies mindlessly run away and aggressive enemies mindlessly chase you down' fare that we are all familiar with. There is unfortunately no complex behaviour either scripted or adaptive to make things more interesting. I also did not witness any inter creature behavioural relationships beyond a few rare occasions of what may have been some creature running away from another. This is definitely a part of the game that is noticeably lacking; Even some very simple Predator, Competitor, Prey relationships would go a long way toward making the world seem far more alive.\n\nCharacter advancement is both broad and deep, all skills are broken down to serve all of the specific wants and needs you may have allowing you to build into whatever role you most enjoy playing. You can also respec your characters Talents for a small cost to adjust to specific scenarios. Unfortunately you cannot do the same with your Tech Tree, leaving you with many wasted points in Tech as you progress through the levels and there are not enough points available in the standard game to learn everything; This ultimately restricts your characters longterm viability as it is entirely possible through a few mis-assigned points to lock that character out of certain content permanently.\n\nCharacter adaptability to the environment is handled primarily through crafting. The game will throw many variations of hazards at you whilst opening up the ability to craft preventative and or curative items to deal with them. This system also extends into situational buffs such as increased melee damage or carrying ability etc in a way that allows you to boost your off abilities as necessary. This system is well fleshed out however I found that by the time I unlocked the recipes, crafting stations to make them and then gathered the necessary ingredients I had essentially moved beyond needing to use them. I feel this system would be better utilised if current consumables were moved down the tech tree and significantly more powerful ones added to the higher tech levels to make those buffs available when you actually need them and warrant continued use as you progress.\n\nThe game does include a taming system and the ability to use tamed creatures as mounts or even pack animals. This is a nice touch but, given the aggression of most of the creatures towards your mount when you are not around, is a feature you will likely ignore more and more as you progress. The extra speed/carry boost just isn't worth the hassle of constantly baby sitting your pet that will be targeted and killed by random creatures spawning on top of it the moment you are out of hearing range of it. There are Talents you can take to somewhat reduce the chance of aggressive creatures attacking your mount but not to any useful degree. Inter creature behavioural relationships would again be beneficial here as would expanding pet commands beyond follow, stay, or fight; The addition of a flee and some sort of return whistle or even just a flee to me when in danger command would help a lot.\n\nQuesting exists in the game, though in a very limited form; This appears to be expanded in the DLC but I have not had a chance to try that yet. Mostly in the base game it is of the go here and either kill x amount of y creature or defend this area for x minutes/waves. It gives you something to do when you are feeling kind of aimless which is always appreciated but it fails to give any reason to do it beyond a rather disappointing drop of reward items you probably have no use for. This is a failing most games in the genre suffer from and this game differs only in how very easy it would be to correct. The framework is all there to provide a reason for the players actions in their sojourns from an orbital station onto this terra-formed world to identify and test the environment and it's resources. It would be a simple matter to present this story to the player, include key milestones to work toward that advance the story and even add an ultimate conclusion that serves as both meaning to play and satisfactory resolution of play. It doesn't need a hoard of dramatic characters and deep themes with surprise twists, a story treatment would be enough; But it does need something to make this feel like more than a just a game framework or very large tech demo.\n\nMultiplayer worked perfectly for me, it was easy for my friend to join and we had no random disconnects. Actions in game synced cleanly and having a co-op partner greatly added to the experience. Everything else the game has to offer such as Graphics, Movement, Sound etc are all of high quality and for me the game ran smoothly and without any major issues.\n\nAll in all if I was judging this game against all of the very many others in the genre I would give it a thumbs up, I certainly enjoyed my experience, were it not for the issue of price.\n\nThere is no polite way to put this so I will be blunt, the price tag of this game is delusional. This is a 25-30 USD early access indie game that they are trying to charge $120 USD for with every indication that they will continue to charge even more for each and every future update; The justification for this seems to be to pretend that the game is no longer in early access and that the ongoing patches to the game are expansions and not the very necessary feature updates they clearly are. I can only imagine this is a result of an inexperienced Chief Financial Officer who simply does not understand how to price a product in the PC Gaming market.\n\nWhilst I certainly understand the need to ensure everyone gets paid and the desire to make a profit off of your product what the CFO seems to fail to understand is the higher you price your product the more you narrow your potential market. This game is actually priced all but entirely out of the PC gaming market, you could purchase two brand new AAA games for the same price they are trying to charge for this feature incomplete early access indie game. Even if by some bizarre series of events this game managed to capture the attention and wallets of all the 'whales' in PC gaming that fraction of a percentage of the market would be insufficient to cover the cost of development. By closing their product off to the average consumer this game is all but guaranteed to fail financially.\n\nAt $30 for the complete game this would be a clear winner for my co-op group and you would have had six more sales, at $120 it is a complete joke and you have nothing; Even RocketWerkz's CFO should be able to understand that math.", "timestamp_created": 1701802220, "timestamp_updated": 1701810548, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 163, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.87911069393157959", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117632370": {"recommendationid": "117632370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021314643", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 27521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23267, "last_played": 1701971456}, "language": "english", "review": "/////////////// 2023 June 29th ///////////////\n[h1][b]Alright boi's, it's been a year, and so many people are saying theres SO MUCH IMPROVEMENTS, let's see what really changed.[/b][/h1]\n\nWhat has changed since:\n1. Open world mode: Short explanation = outpost mode + enemies + mission board loop system.\nIn order to start off the mission board system, you have to finish your character grind, so it's kind of an end game content.\nYou establish a permernant base, make your mission board, and start looping 8 difference types of missions, like gather / hunt / recon / blah blah.\nLore-wise it's more reasonable as well, you come down the planet, establish a front, stay on surface, and deliver the needs to space.\n\n2. Progress wipe, so what really changed? That they need a progress wipe for it?\n2a. Tech trees are literally the same, with some extra new contents, but it doesn't differ.\n2b. Talents are literally the same.\n2c. Workshops are literally the same, with some extra new contents, but it doesn't differ, I do not feel like re-doing all the grind just to test if small things are stackable or not.\n2d. Missions, does the constructions stay? No.\nSo sum of point 2: Progress wipe, was it necessary, no, they just felt like disgusting you.\n\n3. Repair bench, yeah, you no longer need to carry all the tables around, just one table.\n4. Fishing features, some might like it.\n5. Buffalo carts, +1000kg weight, -40 speed, probably good for hoarders moving bases, likely never going to be used.\n6. Electronics: the material amount is the same, but they made it to gold wires + copper wires + electronics, no improvement, double the annoyance. \n7. Ammo: An extra process of making ammo casing, which has absolute no other uses other than making ammo, shotgun buckshots still costs the same, what an improvement.\n\n[strike]I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS BEEN IMPROVED.[/strike] So, I guess the big gamer is the open world mode.\n\nYou could give them a thumbs up for that, for those that hardly played the game, they didn't lose much, for those that played hundred of hours, I don't really know.\nYou could argue that in open world mode, you will eventually finish the material grind, and since you're staying there forever, there's no more grinds after that, so just SUCK IT UP AND COPE IT.\nSo, did devs take feedbacks afterall? Or was it always their way or the highway?\n\nYou had a (insert_number_here) year relationship with Icarus, Icarus is good looking, at start you were \"We've just got together, maybe there's more to Icarus, let's know Icarus more before judging\", but then as time moves on, you've finalized that Icarus' personality was just too much to cope with.\nA year later, Icarus' friends started to contact you, telling you that Icarus has changed a lot, Icarus is no longer the past Icarus that you know, you two should get back together.\nSo, you took your courage, and met up with Icarus, the first words spoken was \"Hi, I've threw away everything that you worked so hard on to obtain, but I really need a new kitchen, and fridge, and a few new closets, it'll be good to put a furnace here, the roof needs a fix, better be weather-proof, you'll still need to go out and dig gold for 3 hours though, phone me when you're done.\"\nThat's ... what you'll face when you come back, Open World Mode might be good, but.\n\nAnd there's another you know that had the same vibe but different ethnic, you knew NoManSky from a dating app, wasn't pretty, and nothing much to say about, never got together in the first place, but from time to time NoManSky comes back, not asking you for anything, but trying to prove itself to you.\n2 years later, you two were together, you thought that was the end to the story, but NoManSky remembered every anniversary, and made it better after better.\n\nIt is hard to judge, maybe Icarus just needs more time, maybe another year.\n\n/////////////// 2022 June 26th ///////////////\n[h1][b]What's BAD and needs to be improved or fixed:[/b][/h1]\n1. Crafting resource requirement:\n You could say things up to Tier 3 are bearable, but Tier 4 is just a total grind to torture players, they could counter by saying \"Oh Tier 4's are not neccessary\",\n but then what about your new content \"Enzyme Gyser\"? It requires composites, which means you need electric furnace + material processor = 120 electronics = 120 refined gold + 360 copper ingot,\n gold might be the minor and copper being the major issue that drags the game another 4~6 hrs longer just to grind those damn resources.\n[h2][b] YOU DO NOT NEED 1 GOLD INGOT and 3 COPPER INGOT TO MAKE A SINGLE ELECTRONIC BOARD, FOR REAL.[/b][/h2]\n Electronics is literally the most unbalanced item ingame atm, it limits the player from crafting other things that requires copper.\n For example: Are you going Tier 4? Yes? Then no shotgun for you then, because there ain't enough copper for that.\n Talking about shotgun, you shouldn't require epoxy and the extra amount of gunpowder to craft buckshot shell, just for the balance.\n Oh, and the armors, YOU DO NOT NEED 75 polar bear pelt to make a polar bear armor set, that's like 8 bears, 1 bear's fur is enough to make a full set for one person,\n by the time you're done collecting 75 polar bear pelts, you're already done in the artic zone, probably overdoing it 3 times more than the time needed in there.\n Same goes with leather/fur armor, but since they're not as rare, so it's in the \"bearable\" range.\n\n2. Weather occurrence:\n I know the devs are probably happy with introducing the new \"Heavy\" weathers, but having heavy weather that lasts for about 2~3 minutes and a 1 minute interval is just totally stupid,\n I don't know if I'm playing icarus or playing COVID-19, you're forced to stay sheltered almost all the time, this is not \"difficulty or challenge\" but simply disgusting your player base,\n combine this with a 6 hr mission.\n\n3. Insurance:\n With the newest update, devs previously wanted to remove the option of \"remove from prospect\" which could safely extract player and their items from full loss,\n I get the point they want to make insurance more important so players uses the system, but the devs literally have no understanding to their games.\n[h2][b]  You do realize the items player carry down are actually more important than the character's life?[/b][/h2]\n What is the point of insurance if I lose all my items? They're worth 2570 exotics, which is like 7 big exotic game sessions, which would be like 11~15 days of work.\n What is the worth of a character level 50? Like nothing?\n[h2][b]   So do you know why nobody uses insurance in your game? Because it's pointless.[/b][/h2]\n\n4. Loadout:\n This is a minor issue, but I just need to point out, the consumables should be \"stackable\", for example, if I want to bring down farming packets/edibles/bandage/arrow bundle/IC-001 power source,\n they are nowhere near the importance of carrying another exotic tool, which both takes 1 slot in cargo, so if I want 100 arrows, I need to use 4 slots just for the arrow, it is not practical at all,\n leaving your players no choice but to ignore them. Yeah, but you could just don't bring exotic tools at all, it's your choice, there will be one or two players doing that, but I doubt most would do so.\n 1 IC-001 power source is only able to extract 1 small site at most, to be more precise, probably 130 exotics, which takes up 2 slots in cargo, if the mission has 3 exotic sites,\n it's not practical to waste 4 slots for skipping driller crafting.\n\n5. Structure beams:\n Wether it's thatch/wood/stone or whatever, beams should give buildings a better wind resistance, where it's only provided by aluminium beam atm.\n At least give it like a 5% 10% 25% or something.\n\n6. Travel time:\n Probably one of the biggest problems other than the god damn electronics, and STYX just made it worse.\n I'm not sure if devs are thinking of making travelling tools/equips or not, but probably not gonna happen within years, the repair bench isn't even out after years.\n// exceeded text limit //", "timestamp_created": 1656224522, "timestamp_updated": 1688038152, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 289, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.876678049564361572", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "152638519": {"recommendationid": "152638519", "author": {"steamid": "76561199429715652", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1701425403}, "language": "english", "review": "The game itself is actually quite decent. I'd even suggest picking it up during a sale and giving it a try. However, what really stands out in this situation is the fanservice and the way the developers handle their promises and criticisms.\n\nLately, on their official Discord, it seems like all they do is talk about the expenses they're dealing with to make everything happen. Frankly, it gets a bit tiresome hearing about these complaints. They only seem to be active when they're about to release something new, like New Frontiers now. Other than that, they can go for months without any communication. They're going on about how much effort and money goes into creating a pet in the game, costing anywhere from $30k to $50k, and how players don't really understand the work behind it. Then they talk about features like full mod support, which we all know breathe life into games (remember how DayZ did it?), and they claim it would cost millions. They also mention something as simple as character customization being worth a million dollars.\n\n\"Rocket | CEO\" mentioned that those who bought the Supporters Edition will eventually get a significant discount. Depending on how many units are sold, the Supporters Edition might even end up not costing the developers anything, or possibly even causing them to lose money, especially in certain regions.\n\nHonestly, this kind of messaging to the people who believed in them and invested more to receive what was promised is a bit surprising. It's common knowledge that pre-orders and early supporters often get better deals. It's not rocket science (no pun intended). It seems like they're trying to make it look like they're the ones carrying the financial burden, which doesn't really sit right. This is a standard practice, and usually, it's the other way around \u2013 pre-orders are given at a discount.\n\nI can already imagine the defenders who will argue that we should support the developers. It's fine to have differing opinions, but we need to be honest about our concerns.\n\nThe financial equation here is quite simple. The Icarus Deluxe Edition (that was the name of the edition I bought) costs $109.98, yet Styx, which everyone owning the game received for free, has a standalone cost of $23.44 (on promotion). The first DLC, priced at $25.49, brings the total to $48.93. Even if we factor in the $8.99 for Styx and a $5.99 add-on with lamps (which is also part of the deluxe edition), the total comes to $63.91 - and the next DLC won't cost $40 for sure, does that mean they'll start slicing out every little feature and selling them for $3-4 each just to hit that price point?\n\nThe lack of transparency in their communication is baffling. Any expression of dissatisfaction is met with backlash from their supporters, who don't seem to grasp that if you don't voice your concerns, you won't see any improvements. On Discord, you're flooded with messages about how everything is perfect and fantastic, which doesn't make sense for a game that's still in development (and it's supposed to be the first year in Early Access, but that's a whole other issue).\n\nEncountering yet another update that introduces redundant features like two shields, coupled with the ongoing lack of progress in the development of the station shop and the repeatedly emphasized but elusive focus on future improvements, has thoroughly exhausted my patience. The absence of effective communication on these matters has significantly eroded my enthusiasm. I'm left in a state of uncertainty regarding the specifics of what the next game update will bring: what content will be added and how the game will evolve. The broad statements provided often fail to align with the actual changes that emerge when an update is eventually released.\n\nTake a look at the sudden surge in positive reviews today \u2013 it's clearly orchestrated by them.\n\nI'm sharing this negative feedback not because I dislike the game itself, but because I'm disappointed in the way the developers are handling their communication and game development. I'd still recommend buying and playing the game. While it's notably under-optimized, the recent changes seem to make the gameplay more accessible for a wider audience. Whether it suits your tastes or not is something you'll have to decide for yourself. If they follow through with the DLC as promised, it could potentially breathe new life into the game.", "timestamp_created": 1701425417, "timestamp_updated": 1701425417, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1018, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.873995959758758545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128211147": {"recommendationid": "128211147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002587305", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6190, "last_played": 1664988694}, "language": "english", "review": "Week 53 update is the biggest joke, Being able to hop in game without having to share data manually was amazing. whatever person decided that renting servers or manually sharing saves everytime you want to play should be canned from the company. what a sad update and even sadder with the moves of making this game great. \n\nQuoting from the most recent update: \nPreviously, Icarus had a very helpful feature that migrated the hosting between players when the original host left the game.

First, I never intended for this review to get so much attention, and honestly did not consider the possible effects it could cause for new individuals looking to purchase this game. \n\nWhen writing this review earlier today, I was coming fresh off of having Steam deny my fifth refund request for Battlefield 2042, and also attempting to play WW3 for the hundredth time without stuttering/rubber banding... so I was obviously a bit more heated than usual. \n\nIcarus is a complex game to review in its current state. I actually spent the money to purchase their Supporter Pack earlier this year, and played through a good number of their Beta weekends (having fun nonetheless). Somewhere towards the end of their Beta Weekends I stopped because it was becoming very repetitive. When I remembered that Icarus had recently launched, after the new Battlefield launch was completely ripped to shreds, I was really looking for something new to sink my teeth into and I wanted it to be Icarus more than anything. I expected quite a bit more content after playing through the first two missions, and maybe its only me, but I felt like the only 'new' content I saw from the Beta was different flora scattered around the world. Because of this, I left the terrible review below and really let my anger out. \n\nI am leaving the review up, because I won't now go back on my original opinion, but I have made some small changes to slightly lessen the blow of pure rage. If you're a fan of Survivals, and you're willing to stick this one out, Icarus really has the potential to grow into something incredible, however, there IS ALOT OF WORK TO BE DONE, that is the honest truth. \n\nTo the Developers: I agree. I don't truly believe Icarus will be microtransaction ridden, but I do hope that you guys are able to continue building onto this current base, and really make Icarus into a new Survival that everyone wants to play. I wish you guys only the best, and I appreciate you taking the time to comment here. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: \nThis game is a prime example of exactly what is wrong with the gaming industry + development companies today. Releasing 'full titles' that are clearly still in Early Access, hoping that the player-base will continue to support your shady business practices + continue to line their pockets with micro transactions while they actually 'try' to complete the game that was promised to their customers AT LAUNCH. \n\nIt's sad.. that the majority of PC Gamers are continuing to allow publishing/development companies to get away with releasing games in this type of state, after hyping up 'nExT-gEn' features.", "timestamp_created": 1638628871, "timestamp_updated": 1638673333, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2189, "votes_funny": 58, "weighted_vote_score": "0.859078347682952881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1638670534, "developer_response": "Hey! Totally hear your concerns and opinions about the state of game development. However, I wanted to speak a little bit to Icarus and maybe give you some insight into the journey. \n\nOur approach to the game is definitely not one of lining the pockets or hiding everything behind micro-transactions, in fact, we're unlikely to have any micro-transactions for quite a while as our focus is purely on the core game and delivering consistent, regular updates to improve performance, bugs and add fresh content. \n\nYour concerns about the grey area between Early Access and Full Release are absolutely heard! We do believe Icarus is at a 1.0 state, but plan on regularly and actively improving the game, as bugs, bad performance and other hiccups are not intentional, and something we don't ruining your experience. We've already pushed out 2 hotfixes, and have many more to come, including one very soon. \n\nObviously, launching the game with 0 bugs or misbalances is the dream, but also pretty hard to pull off!

If we had the hub/spoke wheel mission hub where a base would persist through multiple missions, I could actually pay attention to the story instead of mindlessly hacking ores and trees to remake everything I just did just to do one really mind numbing thing, like scan an area.  right now, I have nooo idea whats going on other than exotics are good and you must get them to get workshop gear and then... what?  The building and tech trees can take me only so far in this game... \n\nTake the respec solution, they put it in and marked it as done, but the resources it takes to make a major change, you're better off deleting the character and starting new.  unless you have hundreds of hours in to the game, but then you don't really need to make major changes, unless they produce an update that nerfs your talents... just punishes the new people who didn't know any better before they went down tree x only to find it was useless in practice.  Make respec cheaper. \n\nThey have done some good updates too, don't get me wrong. it feels less like an early access title than it did.  The in game timer was huge, although they need to greatly reduce the time to make it feel more urgent. Right now, your never going to run out of time and that plays against the point of the game. I really want this game to succeed, but they are not focusing on the right things and given that I have had posts deleted in the past, read that others have as well, then a player was banned for speaking their mind (and then unbanned by Dean Hall himself) just tells me that even the devs are getting frustrated by the direction this game is headed and that does not bode well for the first expansion.  For now, going to re-shelf this one and go back to monitoring the weekly updates.\n\nDon't pay too much attention to the hours played, a lot of it was sitting at the character screen, new baby so get distracted easily. \n\nUpdate 4/3: I've been reading every weeks update and the development team has put some work in, getting closer to a fully release game.  Talent respec, in game timers, fixing math and bugs.  Just a few more items to go and I will change my review.  Game needs more immersion with better AI and story, Multiple missions per drop so base building more things are worth it, this might require an entire re-write to the mission architecture, but would go a long ways.  They have the hub system already there, just allow you to accept missions that are connected to your base node.\nSorry for my rants below, was super frustrated with the experience I had that first month for a game that was supposed to be fully released.  I have no problem buying a game in early access as long as you sell it to me that way.  Things are looking up for me and my friends to reinstall this game after 4 months.  Still a lot of potential here.\n\nOriginal Review:\nPlayed 100+ hours, gave it a shot. Parts of the game are done well but overall just not finished. Once you do prospect \"Payday Extraction\" you realize the game is not fun, you just run around.  You do all this grindy work to do what exactly? get some minor coin to buy buggy loadout items and lose all that progress?  I really think they messed up their decimal points in certain places and never actually went back to fix it.  10,000 % break chance for poison arrows? um, you mean 100.00% lol, math hard.  80 electronics for the fabricator? then 160 more for the next three items? like what kind of massive circuit board cluster-f is that? Me thinks another decimal point... 8.0.  game needs a major overhaul or its dead.  uninstalled.\n\nUpdate 12/25, decided to give it one last go tonight as I had a couple hours to kill. Well, RIP character. I had the final two hours scheduled after Christmas festivities to finish up this gawd awful mission that the rest of my friends rage quit on. Just pack up my extractor and go mine the node. I get there and was like why am I getting one node per min??!! all the videos I watched were like 10 min tops. I have sat here for 40 min just watching the extractor.. am at 40 exotics.  2.5 more hours just to extract?  what, should I watch Netflix while I just sit here and reflect about how much time I wasted of my life already with this game? after the grind that I just went through? You broke the game, and not only that, broke me.  Made me lose faith in your ability to properly fix this game with patches. no patch notes on this, just change made, and now I am going to let my lvl 40 character sit here and die out of spite, uninstall this game again and rage quit like my friends already did. Man, seriously, learn to make a complete game.  Listen to the players. Simple things like change mission timers to in game timers, not real life ones. 75% of people are not streamers and cant devote tons of time to any game. Just breaks the joy in this game.  and don't make any part of this game (or any game) a 3 hours snooze fest of just watching the timer.\n\nUpdate 1/1: Haha, Read this weeks update patch notes.\n\"Fixed unintentional change causing the extractor to operate significantly slower than intended.\"\nI'm betting another decimal point mistake.

This game has been designed around everything being done in a group.\n\nMain issues as a solo player: \n* This game was not designed for you in any way shape or form, in fact it actively tries to do everything in it's power to discourage you.\n* This game does not respect your time.\n* I've never seen a game so desperate for you to do nothing. Storm, go inside, do nothing. In a cave, have a debuff, it gets cold have another debuff, get a disease which is another debuff, now do nothing, your stamina is zero.\n* Mining, this is a mining simulator for 90% of your time. It's annoying and boring. \n\nProbably the three most glaring examples of just how little the designers care about solo players.\n* As a solo player when you die, you must wait for the re-spawn button to appear (15 seconds). Then you must hold down the key for an equal amount of time. Then you must click yes. Nobody else is playing, so nobody else can help you revive. There is literally no other options, so why not revive you back at your spawn point.\n* The XP penalty, is an absolute dumpster fire of an idea. The death loop for solo players:\n   - As above, jump through some hoops.\n   - You lose all XP you gained this level (1 point of next level, that's right start again).\n   - You get a penalty for earning more XP until you clear the amount you previously had for this level.\n   - You have no gear, it's on your corpse (mind you the developers wanted to remove all your gear, they actually thought that would be fun).\n   - You need to run back to your corpse, the mobs generally just sit on top of your corpse. Enjoy the likely hood of multiple dead runs (my favourite is when a storm immediately starts).\n* All missions are balanced the same regardless of the amount of people in the group. So as a solo player the mission is balanced as if it had at least 4 people. That means in same cases collecting 1000s of things. You will get the same reward as each member of a group; might take you 8 hours vs their 1 hour, great design.\n\nGame Issues:\n* Buggy, very, very buggy. They seem to be slowly fixing some of the game breaking ones, so maybe one day it will be a far more pleasant experience.\n* Poor interface design. There are so many games in this genre that are just flat out better user experiences, rather than copying them, they tried to re-invent it and made it worse.\n* Debuffs, they stack, to the point you can do nothing (your stamina will be set to zero).\n* No respecing, you of course read the internet and knew exactly all the various things they had in the multiple trees, knew your play style for the game and how those talents would effect it. No? Too bad, pick once or make a new character. The game designers still posting about how it will be game breaking should the introduce it.\n* Hugely limited mobs, and they often don't make sense and are poorly scaled. This also seems to be deliberate, so they can sell dlc/expansions.\n\nBut the thing that topped all this off, was the game loop. It gets boring really quickly, the loop:\n* start with nothing\n* build a shelter\n* find the cave with as much iron as possible, this is where you spend a lot of time, so the above point about it being very boring, makes this loop so much worse.\n* fix your shelter to avoid everything being destroyed.\n* Get a gun\n* begin mission (usually run a very long distance).\n* run back to ship... do it all again.\n\nWhat's nice about this game?\n* pretty graphics\n* interesting idea with the constant returning to the ship, creates the above loop, so it's interesting, it just didn't work\n* Nice building ideas, different types of things, could clearly build some intersting things, just never really did as once the mission is done, they disappear. They also take a lot of resources, so you tend to build tiny boxes. Don't be fooled by the pretty pictures, most people made them in the outpost mode or the 30 day missions. \n* I like the amount of different things that can be built, I just never got near most of them, as they had no bearing on the mission, and required vast amount of resources.", "timestamp_created": 1643446192, "timestamp_updated": 1643446547, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 488, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858390569686889648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116509275": {"recommendationid": "116509275", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960877791", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 16392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16392, "last_played": 1653974806}, "language": "english", "review": "A game plagued by walking simulator syndrome and zero direction.

And my reviews are barely noticed by others, so, this is my therapy.\n\nDon't let my time played fool you. 6 hours is about 5 more hours needed to know this is was not ready for launch. Hell, within 5 minutes of dropping on my first \"prospect\" I watched a deer get stuck on a rock and loop into an endless jump animation. The 5th tree I chopped down launched me back into orbit and then I landed and died. A deer spawned under my first structure and tore apart my floor. And, I swear to Zeus, if having TWO f*cking bears spawn on me during my first real mission objective was intended, then f*ck you too. No, seriously, absolutely f*ck you. In every aspect imaginable. I was level 3, you absolute sh*tlords. \n\nThe single-player experience is a waking nightmare. Did they consider the solo experience? ABSOLUTELY. They even give you your own talent tree. The talents are...basically the same as other talents. They might be a little better? But nothing stood out enough for me to remember. How cool! Oh and you can't use those talents in any kind of co-op play. So, if you spend 90% of your time solo, but on that rare occasion a friend decides to join you, your talents are absolutely worthless. You're completed gutted in every aspect. Zero bonuses. I've never seen that and I never want to again. What an absolutely ass-backwards way to support solo players. You can't respec in any capacity too BTW. WHAT THE F*CK. \n\nOh, and you better have an high-end PC, cause if you drop your graphics to even medium, it will look like absolute trash. I don't need your fancy ray-tracing d*ck-swinging graphics, I can traipse around Ark all day and it looks just fine. What I need is for your game to work and for it to be fun to play. You failed.\n\nThe session-based time limit focused missions seemed cool, in theory. But it takes you about an hour to come to the realization that there's no point to doing anything because in an arbitrary amount of time, your work will be erased. Or you'll finish your objectives in a fraction of a fraction of that time limit and need to move on to the next mission to progress. So, instead of creating a cool base, you end up just making a 4x4 hut and putting the essentials in there. You won't be around long enough to give a sh*t, trust me on that. And you sure can't take anything with you because there's a magical barrier surrounding the planet that deletes anything in your inventory when you leave. You can carry a shitload of gear and resources in your magical, inter-dimensional pocket when walking around, but, oh boy, your space pod can just...only carry so much, ya know? It's realistic!\n\nSo, you're feeling pissed about the \"mechanics\" of the main mode? Want a permanent base? They offer that. You get slapped on a tiny map, with no challenge. No predators. No real game-play. No serious weather to worry about either. You can gain XP doing stuff, which is about the only benefit you get from playing that mode. I can't confirm either, but it sure felt like your xp gains were lesser than in the normal mode. Half my play-time was in the perma mode and I made it to level 3. The other half of the time was in normal mode and I ended that at level 8, with 3 deaths that reset my xp gains. There's math there, I'm sure.\n\nNow for the real rant. Let's talk about my favorite subject: Game logic. AKA, how and why do things work in your game.\n\nIf I can perma-base in one mode, then why do I have a death-timer in any other mode? What kills me? What keeps them from sending another drop-pod down for you? They sure do that when you actually die and respawn. Are you just assuming that after exactly 6 days, 3 hours and 42 minutes, that part of the planet...explodes? I wouldn't make a big deal out of it, if the developers themselves didn't make it a *crucial* part of this game. So, I ask again, what kills you if you don't make the drop-pod timer? You won't starve, freeze, run out of oxygen. You have shelter. Tools. Weapons. It's not explained, despite being a fundamental aspect of the game. You miss the timer, you die. No reason. You can \"die\" a thousand times before that timer and here comes another drop-pod to respawn you tho. Or you wake up in bed. What? You get \"left behind forever\"? That's beyond stupid, beyond any logic. You can imagine the most nefarious corporation and even they wouldn't waste the time, money and resources to send carefully selected explorers across the galaxy to an alien planet only to leave them behind forever because they spent 7 days on the surface instead of 6...for no reason. \"Whelp, Timmy didn't make the drop pod timer. Only cost us 8 million dollars to bring him here and we've only sent 834 drop pods down there already. He's a lost cause.\" Why even send these people to this planet and give them absolutely nothing in the way of tools or gear anyways? It would help if they took the time to  E X P L A I N. Which I (stupidly) assumed they would.\n\nOH, and the time limit is in real-world time, which is just the most bizarre fourth-wall, immersion breaking idea ever. How the hell do you even...? How does that work in the game-world? Because the day/night cycle in game is *not* the same as the day/night cycle IRL. Imagine trying to journal that if you were your character. \"Day 48. I landed on this strange planet with 6 days to achieve my goal. I have 3 days left. Only another 48 days before those 3 days are up. I ate oxygen rocks.\"\n\nThe time-space continuum shattering time-limit is not the only thing that breaks any illusion of immersion. You wear an evo-suit, yeah? Need oxygen, yeah? So...what happens when a wolf bites you? Does that not damage your suit? How are you casually eating barely cooked meat? Do you just rub it on your helmet and use your imagination? How do you drink water? Your suit doesn't protect you from any of the elements or temperatures? HOW DO YOU GET WET? How does it all work? This is important to me because it gets me in the f*cking MOOD to play. This isn't nit-picking. These are the questions that should be asked and I'm being serious. It's a survival game, this is what I'm here for. I'm here for it but when the mechanics they decided to implement don't make SENSE, I don't enjoy the experience. If I need to be in this stupid suit so you can peddle your \"terraforming gone wrong\" tagline, then make it apart of the god damn gameplay or don't f*cking do it!! Don't gloss over it so you can shove copy-paste survival mechanics in your game. \n\nHere is the perfect example: I walk into a cave, a weird worm creature pops out. (despite the world being specifically designed to support EARTH creatures BTW). This weird worm creature projectile vomits on me. I'm now poisoned and die. But...how? How does that work? Did you forget that I'm wearing an environmental protection suit? I sure have to worry about my oxygen bar but worm vomit just pops right through that suit and then into my bloodstream? It didn't damage my suit, mind you, my suit is indestructible. It never leaks, is never damaged. Always works perfectly fine, even when a bear is chewing on my torso. So, my suit is fully intact protecting me from the TOXIC atmosphere, but not from worm vomit? How did the poison get through the suit and into my bloodstream to then poison me and kill me? You think, dear non-existent reader, that I'm being ridiculous. But, I insist that it's questions like these that should have been asked WELL before a single developer touched a keyboard.\n\nYeah, I'm pissed.

But still there is a 'BUT...'.\nI chose 'not recommending' so maybe it gets attention...\n\nNice story, good visuals, everything is nicely designed, well balanced missions that you can do some easy ones or hard ones or just wander around and discover. Developers are updating every week etc.\n\nEven though I love it still, I am not playing since some weeks and i don't feel like playing just because of one reason : Everything starts from zero when you finish one mission and start another one... This gets so annoying after some time, it makes me not want to play the game anymore. \nBasically, You start a mission, build some shelter which can be a basic one or a more advanced one, build some weapons, tools, some crafting stations, do some mining, all depending on your mission, and fight with nature while doing all these. It takes hours and hours to get to a point which you have all the needed stuff and finish your mission. Then you run back to your rocket and fly back to station. Then, when you start a new mission, which is on the same map, maybe on another zone, all the stuff that you spent hours to build is gone...You need to start all over again from level zero... At first times, it doesn't bother much but after you play for lots of hours and reach some level, it get so boring you can't imagine. And its not logical considering the story of the game. \nAnd yet it can be fixed very easily. There is already a decaying logic in game that you experience when you are playing so i can not understand why devs don't use it when player isn't playing. Like after finishing a mission and get back to space station, the stuff i just built can decay in time instead of just disappearing. If i built a wooden house, it can decay in 3-4 days, If it is a stone building, it can completely decay in 6-7 days maybe...So if i don't play it for long time, i loose my stuff, but if i start a new mission, lets say like 3 days after last one, i should still find my building and tools from last session,maybe not in 100% condition as they started to decay, but still there so can repair them, instead of building them all over again. This way i can keep playing regularly if i don't want to loose my stuff...Same logic can be used also for tools, weapons, crafting stations.\nI can see the same complaints in most reviews here or on other platforms so i hope devs ponder on this issue and find a solution.

However, I love that about it.\n\nIcarus is a tough game, because as you level your points on your skill tree, you have to be keeping a build in mind.  Maybe guns are your thing so you level guns?  Maybe you're playing with friends and you want to be the gatherer so you put points into mining and weight, etc.  You only get so many points, so you have to keep in mind what build you want.  However, I quite like that about the game because it means that once you've reached the limit of that, how good you do will rely on you.\n\nCrafting up to new tiers is rewarding.  It requires a lot of gathering, time, exploring, and keeping in mind what resources should be put into what.  The further out you go the more you'll get, but there's that mission timer to keep in mind.\n\nYou can, of course, make multiple characters, with multiple builds, and do different things.  So this balances if you level a character up the way you find doesn't work for you.  There is also a respec system now.\n\nThen there's that beautiful piece about credits.  As you complete missions, you gain more credits, and eventually, exotics, in which case you can start buying things to bring down with you on missions, making things easier to deal with.  Instead of having to craft your way up to better picks, start with one.  Maybe you want armor.  Maybe an axe, etc.  This makes it easier over time as you go down to start well and get the ball rolling.\n\nI'm not sure why some people are saying this \"isn't a solo game\", it is very much able to be solo'd, you just need to be prepared, and methodical in your approach to missions.  I've played the majority of my hours entirely solo minus maybe 2 or 3 missions with a few friends.  The thing to remember is that just because a mission is unlocked, doesn't mean that maybe your level is ready for it.  Don't be afraid to replay missions, don't be afraid to spend the extra time on that mission counter to level up, and don't rush the hard stuff.  The game clock on many missions is 7 real days, don't be afraid to use it all if you aren't sure if \"you're prepared enough.\"  That said, it IS a difficult game, and it's meant to be.\n\nThe environment is very impressive.  I've heard rumors on the game that eventually there's bound to be MANY tiers of things to unlock, but for now, even the 4 is really fun.  You go from basically stone age huts to aluminum or concrete at some point if you want, and weapons are very similar.  Going from stone tools, to eventually very advanced composites.  The forests are thick, and can make hunting interesting.  You won't always see what's in the woods.  You might /hear/ a bear, you might /hear/ a wolf, but sometimes you end up face to face with one because you weren't paying attention.  Stealth plays a big part of that.  However, there's usually some kind of warning.  The audio effects are quite well done in hearing things off in the distance, what creature it is, and at least some form of, \"Ok that is probably safe.\" or \"I may need to tread carefully.\"\n\nThe mission progression is great, and doesn't just drop you in and go \"LOL good luck.\"  Your first several missions are in relatively safe places to get your feet wet and learn the ropes, and then progresses from there.  Different biomes have different pros and cons.  You might find one where water is scarce, creatures are hard, but the caves and resources are plentiful.  Maybe an area has lots of wood and stone and trees, making base building easy, but you have to travel a ways for caves.  Of course, be careful with that torch if you're in the woods ;) you know?\n\nIf all of those things aren't all within consideration, keep in mind the weather on icarus also wants you dead, everywhere.  Lightning storms are a little scary, blizzards suck, sandstorms are wild, and sometimes animals just decide to complicate that in pack hunting.\n\nThis game hits nearly everything I absolutely love about survival games, with a new and interesting perspective on missions and drops, instead of a permanent spawn on a map.  This games the game interesting, challenging, with a great replay value to level up new characters, try new items, go hunt for exotics, play with your friends, explore new areas.  They did actually have outposts as well, for those who don't want a mission timer or objective, to be able to spawn in and just make things in a kicked back manner.\n\nNow onto a few of the things I think could use some work:\n\nAnimal AI and pathing:  Sometimes the AI pathing is a bit odd.  It seems a little immersion breaking for an animal like a bear to be able to usually walk up what seems to be a nearly 90 degree cliff to come eat you.  As well, sometimes the \"stealth\" perception of the animals feels a little broken.  For instance, why is it an animal 100 meters out or so suddenly is spooked from me stealthing from the bushes onto a rock face when I can barely see it?  As well, sometimes stealthing in a house has this same effect, since I'm not in brush \"cover\" but I'm in a house, animals will \"see me\" even if I'm perfectly still.  Little weird.  I know the game just came out, so I'm sure this stuff is in the works, but I figured I'd mention it.  Also animals getting stuck attempting to go and jump on cliffs is pretty common in a few spots.\n\nThe pneumonia in caves is a bit weird.  Long as I'm in and out, and let that little red cave sign go away, I can go back in for a short time, go back out and the effect just resets so it never happens.  It's a little bit odd.  Even more odd that in very dry climates like the desert caves that it's as much of a concern.  Seems a little inconsistent but it's not terrible, just a bit of an \"well, this is odd.\" mechanic.\n\nAnimal spawning:  It seems, from what I can tell so far, that animals seem to spawn in front of the character, as sometimes you can see them spawn in.  Not behind, it seems, just where you're looking, even if briefly.  Perhaps I am seeing it wrong, or misunderstanding.  The reason it seems to be this way is I noticed if I cross a biome, such as the snow, things like grizzly bears spawn in there till i'm /in/ the snow, and then polar bears spawn.  And sometimes the opposite.  It seems it'd make more sense to spawn things in an area, or based on biome within an area.  It's not a huge deal, just a small gripe.  \n\nThese are all relatively small things that are more \"not sure why it does this, kinda don't like it, but not a game breaker\" level.\n\nIf you love survival games, you want an interesting new take on a survival game, with a very very playable game out of the gate, with a dev team that is working their butts off on making improvements, with a promising road map, this game is absolutely worth the buy.\n\nI realize I've now written a book, so, thanks for coming to my ted talk I guess.", "timestamp_created": 1645442627, "timestamp_updated": 1650697549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 172, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846603929996490479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105402867": {"recommendationid": "105402867", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998631490", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1709924425}, "language": "english", "review": "Here's the truth about this game.  5 Things you SHOULD know.\n\n1) This is a coop game. It's not meant to be played solo. You can, but not only you will struggle more than what's acceptable to have fun, but you also won't be able to experience the entire game. \n\nBesides having to walk all the way back to your corpse and get a huge XP penalty - since you have no one to revive you, you won't be able to unlock all construction blueprints or even all talent points on MOST talent trees. I am not even talking about all talents in the game. Forcing you to start a new character again and again, until you find out what build works for your playstyle.\n\n2) The game doesn't consist of an X-Number of missions. It consists of one mission. You just start a NEW GAME PLUS when you finish a mission. Let me explain. \n\nWhen you finish a mission and you leave the planet, everything there gets deleted. Your structures and crafted items. Trees and mining nodes get reset. After every mission, you start from scratch. You have to start with a stone axe again and again. And no you cannot take anything with you. Your crafted rifle that took you hours and hours from landing to craft, stays there*.\n\nThis is effectively a new game plus. Where you only keep your character's skills - like in most games. And that's assuming you make it to the dropship before the timer runs out. Or else your character gets wiped as well.  So to complete the game, you have to start a new game, again and again, making sure you remember to extract your character after each successful or failed mission.\n\n*You can unlock items while not on a mission that you can take with you to the planet but these items require missions to get since you need the special currency. Oh and make sure you don't lose these items, or you have to do more missions to make enough money to re-purchase them. So don't wander too far and die alone.\n\n3) Make no mistake, this is an early access game. Very few things were fixed during the \"beta\". And the game doesn't feel even remotely feature-complete for an 1.0 game. Don't give me the DLC crap.\n\nThere are like 3-7 different animals per biome. No insects, birds, reptiles. The pathfinding on these animals is mind-blowing. They get stuck at the smallest rocks, fallen trees or they just cannot get out of the water. They run or charge at you in a straight line. If you shoot an arrow at a wolf 200 meters away and you manage to hit it, it turns towards you and starts coming your way knowing exactly where you are.\n\nThe optimization is... Let's say the game runs the same as it did 3 months ago. And no. The visuals don't justify the extreme hardware requirements. It's like being forced to buy a powerful car just because the road only goes uphill.\n\nLet's not even talk about bugs and requested features. Bears that spawn on top of mission objectives just to kill you, getting thrown above the clouds, and more. On https://icarus.featureupvote.com, you will find thousands of reported bugs and requested features that have not and will not make it into the game. \n\n4) Lack of story - lore, poor writing, and missing promised features. \n\nNo introduction video. The game doesn't make the tiniest effort at giving you an idea of what is going on. You are supposed to be on a terraformed planet that has gone wrong, but there is nothing indicating that this isn't earth. Apart from 2-3 animals that don't exist on earth, everything else is familiar. They promised to add more alien-like biomes in later DLCs. Let me say that again... DLC!\n\nThere oxygen there is supposed to be poisonous for some reason. But that's just for you. The animals there can breathe just fine. Oh, and if you're wondering why you can catch pneumonia in caves while wearing your helmet, so do i.\n\nThe vehicle and space station gameplay you saw in the trailer was scrapped without warning. So did a few alien-looking creatures you saw. None made it into the game. If you don't follow their dev blogs and live streams, you may feel scammed and I don't blame you.\n\n5) It has one of the most toxic communities. If you mention something in the forums that you don't like and wish it were different - as well as provide solid feedback and ideas, you are labeled a troll and told to refund and get the F out. \n\nThere's no matchmaking so unless you have a friend who plays games and happens to like this one, you have to go on the forums and randomly start sending friend requests. \n\n__\n\nThere's a reason the reviews are mixed right now. If you really want to play this game, I'd suggest giving the devs a few more months to polish it. Maybe even wait for the DLCs to come out so the game can feel more like what you were first presented.", "timestamp_created": 1638877141, "timestamp_updated": 1638877141, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1057, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.84487617015838623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "152016559": {"recommendationid": "152016559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006570331", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 4656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 784, "last_played": 1709415039}, "language": "english", "review": "I do like the game, its ok, BUT: I can't recommend it...because its too boring. \nBeautiful map, resources are there.

It started off really fun. The early game is polished and there's a steady progression through the tech tree, but it quickly devolves into a grind fest. Missions all lean very hard on making you travel absurd distances to create an illusion of gameplay and the highest tier of the tech tree is an unabashed time waster that is for some reason required for some missions. This game is an early access title that pushed out a release well before it was ready both in terms of polish and content.\n\nThe missions in this game are designed to waste your time and pad out game time. All the missions require you to just move across the map. Most of the mission gameplay is traveling across the terrain or waiting for timers to finish. There's no real gameplay during these portions just running. Spending 15 minutes running between objective markers is not my idea of fun. What even is the point?\n\nEven in the missions where you have to gather resources, they place the drop pods where you have to deposit the different resources incredibly far apart. So you have to run from one to the other in order to drop off your gathered resources. And then after you grind out the stuff they ask for, you have to make another long trip back to your drop pod to leave the mission.\n\nWhy pad out missions with so much travel? There is no real gameplay involved in moving from objective marker to objective marker. Food isn't an issue because wildlife is abundant. Water and oxygen are equally plentiful. The only thing you have to look out for are aggressive animals, but all the common ones die quite easily to bows from a distance or knife stabs to the head (1 to 2 hits to kill even in the late game) if they get close. The only potential threats are the big animals in each biome (bears in forest, elephants in desert, and polar bears in arctic), but they're not that interesting to fight since they just run at you. If you're by yourself, it's just a damage per second check: can you kill it before it kills you (if you have an iron knife, leather armor, and the cooked meat buff the answer is yes if you're mostly stabbing the head)? If you're with even one other person, the person being attacked can kite and dodge the animal until the other guy kills it.\n\nThe late game tech trees are a massive waste of time. to even craft the items you will need to strip mine many many caves of copper and gold. This is an absurd ask when caves aren't that common. You're once again running around. I would be okay with this because having an organic reason to travel like mining out all the resources around you is cool, but you need an absurd amount of resources to build any item that requires electronics.\n\nInstead of creating an interesting tech tree and letting players explore the different items, the game uses massive resource requirements so a mission that just requires you to reach the final tech tree and build some items from it will have hours of time spent stuck at the previous tier slowly mining resources to build 5 items. Electronics cost way too much to be asking for 30 for each item.\n\nIf we stayed down on the planet longer, these massive requirements for higher tech items might make sense. Like if a mission was a series of different objectives and we ended up staying on the planet long enough for us to organically gather stuff and decide to tech up. But they can't do that because for some insane reason they decided to put a real world time limit on your missions. If you don't leave the planet before that time limit is up, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR CHARACTER. This means that longer term missions just won't work for people unless they increase that limit to the point where they might as well remove it or cut off an entire mission type from people who can't commit to playing this game multiple hours a night.\n\nOverall, this game is fun for the first 12 hours or so when you're just exploring and figuring stuff out. As soon as you level past the early game, the game starts becoming tedious travel quests. There's no depth here, only time wasters smothering an interesting concept and decently executed core systems.\n\nI'll keep playing this to hang out with friends, but I don't enjoy my time in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1644310709, "timestamp_updated": 1644311479, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 262, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842270314693450928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113139809": {"recommendationid": "113139809", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980930702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 259, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 416, "last_played": 1649021837}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is very fun.

There is SOOO much good here, but quite frankly, it's next to impossible for me to progress in the game because there is a 50/50 chance that a MAJOR component of the mission will just not spawn in.

I don't see any reason to stat dump to flex, but suffice to say it is more than enough to run this flawlessly thus far.\nMy survival game experience runs the entire list, really- From Rust to Ark to that god awful pirate Ark game and everything in between.\nWhile I'd never say that Icarus reinvents the genre by any means, it certainly takes some of the best parts of my favorite survival games and puts them in one place. I like that.\nLots of gathering and crafting, more like Ark than most, but with less of a grind. Anyone who says that Ark isn't a grind either hasn't played it or has their xp and gathering at 10x.\nFood and water/O2 requirements make you think tactically but aren't oppressive- I don't find myself needing to eat every two minutes to avoid starvation.\nThe various medical treatments you unlock (and will need) are enough to keep you collecting materials for the next time you get bitten by a wolf and end up with a blood disease, or drink water and get the old Oregon Trail Killer.\nJust a bit ago I realized they'd even implemented a game tracking mechanic ala theHunt, where a wounded animal can be tracked by blood trail. Its the little things like that that make me happy.\nMy brother and I have been working on the second area missions, with the radars, and have been having a blast. Perhaps playing with people you enjoy being around isn't the most objective way to give a game a rating, but then this game DOES allow for my brother and I to drop in and out of the same world and play together while thousands of miles apart with zero issues with connection or ping, so.\nThe crafting tree is fairly large, the tech tree expansive enough to keep me going level by level, and while the base building isn't \"permanent\", since you're leaving the planet soon enough, on the next drop I have a bunch of new pieces and ideas for the new base- I see this only as a positive.\nI would like to see more variation in fauna, though admittedly I haven't been very far in the map (which is enormous). Once you get a bow and figure out the aiming system you can drop wolves and other animals with ease from almost any range.\nIn all, I find myself enjoying the game, wanting to play more, and experiencing it all with friends- I'm not sure what else I could ask for.\nThe animal pathing could be better, with some animals getting stuck on rocks occasionally (though that has saved my life more than once, so perhaps I shouldn't complain.)\nAnd now, unlike most of the reviews I see, I will leave my comments open so that I can be called a shill or whatever.\nI paid full price for the game, including support edition (simply because I thought the game looked good, not because I was necessarily hyped beforehand), and see myself getting my money's worth.\nBuy it, don't buy it- obviously that is entirely your prerogative, and this review shouldn't do much to persuade you...

There isn't a tutorial, so it's best to be familiar with the basics of survival games (food, water, shelter) before tackling it. \n\nI love survival games, but I was unsure of the game in the first 30 minutes of the game. \n\nI chose to go open world before doing missions, because I thought that would let me get my feet wet with the basic mechanics of the game before trying timed missions. Bad idea! I got my feet wet alright! From running through a stream back to the location of my death numerous times. My level 1 self kept getting mowed down by a level 75 wolf. In fact, all the critters in the area were high level. The wooden spear was useless.\n\nAfter 20 minutes of doing this, I decided to do the starter mission instead, hoping it was a little easier. It was. The starter mission needs to be completed in 7 days - I thought this meant in game days - no it means real world days, so I no longer felt burdened by the timer. Predators and critters were more my level. Note: Make a spear ASAP because there will be a wolf coming for you! \n\nI found the game a bit boring at first. Nothing to do but forage rocks and sticks - of course, that is pretty standard with most survival games. However once the levels started coming and I had points to invest in blueprints and talents, the game began to become more appealing. By the second hour, I was hooked.\n\nSome of the highlights of my first few hours were:\n\n- Accidentally killing my first deer by chopping down a tree. Yes, falling trees hurt! \n\n- Experiencing my first major storm and playing \"whack a mole\" with my repair hammer as the storm shredded my little thatched hut. Advice: Get to wood as soon as you can. During a storm, trees can fall on your hut causing lots of damage. \n\n- Killing a fish with a bow for the first time - it's pretty easy!\n\n- Watching a tree get struck by lightning, causing it to catch fire - and then a major forest fire erupted.\n\nLong story short (too late) - if you like non-hand-holding survival games, try this one out!

On a high end gaming PC the game looks beautiful.  Unfortunately, you pay a price for this quality.  There are numerous problems:\n\n* Moving around exhibits constant micro-stuttering as it pages in the terrain geometry and textures.  I have a 24-Core/48-Thread Threadripper 3960X, 64 GB of RAM, a RTX 2080 Ti, and the game installed on a Hyper Quad M.2 RAID v2 with 4x Sabrent Rocket NVME drives.  It [i]constantly[/i] micro-stutters as you move from grid cell to grid cell. Happens in both single and multiplayer. There have been reports turning off animal health bars helps to minimize stuttering but sadly that did not for me.  Setting FOV to max is also reported to help (I haven't tried.)\n* Shadows constantly flicker due to the shadow's algorithm implementation.  This may cause headaches.\n* Worse, there is no option to turn shadows completely off, you are stuck with a Low setting.\n* The game is too dark with no brightness / gamma setting.  Turning shadows to Low allows you to see in caves.\n* Lighting is hideously incorrect.  Inside walls of a house will be lit up even though the sun is occluded!?!?\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nWhile it doesn\u2019t have [i]New World[/i] level of audio polish the audio quality is OK.  \n\nThe music tends to get repetitive.  [i]Satisfactory[/i] is an example where each track sounds fresh each time it is played.\n\n[h1]UI[/h1]\nIcarus continues to miss basic Quality-of-Life features.  For example, there is:\n\n* No \u201cTake All\u201d key bind so you manually have to click the button every time you loot a corpse,\n* No way to replay the last prospect with the same settings so you have manually click all the options every single time,\n* No \"use\" hotkey to open your drop shop, and\n* No  \"use\" hotkey to Return to Station.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is filled with bugs and bad game design decisions.  For example:\n\n* Want to sleep at 7:01 am? Nope, can\u2019t! WHY does the game need to [b]micromanage my time?[/b]\n* Why do I NEED a campfire/fireplace close to my sleeping bag [b]to sleep indoors?[/b]\n* Why does [b]no in-game time pass[/b] when I go to sleep and wake up the next day?  i.e. Ores don't smelt in the furnace, storms haven't progressed, etc.\n* Why does the map always have a fog of war? We don't have the technology to [b]bring a paper map[/b] with us?!\n* We can launch to/from space but we can't craft firearms or bullets in the space station to bring down with us? But we can bring a bow + arrows with us??\n* Why can't my base survive between missions? A base not persisting on the surface I could MAYBE see with the excuse of surface storms (how do the wildlife and plants survive though?) but if my base is [i]built in a cave[/i] it should persist between missions.\n* Who magically comes to [i]restock all the ores[/i] between prospects?\n* Why can I carry 2,400 wood but I can't more then 1 extractor?\n* Sticking an animal carcass in the skinning bench stops it from decaying. This bug has been around since Beta. Does QA even play the game? Do the devs even listen to QA?\n* Why can\u2019t I use a rock to kill a Scorpion??\n* Why do animals not scuttle for covering during a storm?\n* Why do [b]wolves and bears SIMULTANEOUSLY[/b] gang up against YOU even though they are [b]enemies in real life?[/b]\n* Do you like chopping down a tree only to have it spontaneously fall on your head?  Then you will enjoy Icarus.\n* Having a gamepad plugged in but using the mouse+keyboard will cause the popup tool tips to constantly flicker.\n* There is no way to skip the annoying landing / take-off cutscene.\n* The game is a P-I-G to load.  A prospect mission timer will count while you are [i]still in the landing[/i] cutscene! By the time landing is complete the mission timer will have already wasted 45 seconds.\n* While you can sort your Loadout in the space station [b]any changes do not persist[/b] due to stupid auto-sorting. How do you screw up [i]basic inventory management [/i] in 2022???\n* You can bring arrows down from the space station but the instant you use 1 arrow you can no longer bring the [i]remaining arrows[/i] back with you up to the space station!  Stop nickle-and-diming my gear.\n* Certain missions have [i]horrible directions[/i] such as [i]Waterfall: Expedition[/i].  Be prepared to watch videos on YouTube to clarify what you are supposed to do.\n\nIgnoring bugs the biggest problem is the bad design and incomplete features:\n\n* It is TEDIOUS to have to keep rebuilding a base. EVERY. SINGLE. MISSION.\n* The crafting costs for  Tier 3 and Tier 4 are too high. Most are them are a complete waste of time.  [b]NOTE:[/b] There ARE mods that fix this but players are left on their own to track them down.\n* When you die you lose ALL your XP for that level.  [b]Stop STEALING my XP when I die![/b] [i]Diablo 2[/i] and [i]Path of Exile[/i] did this garbage decades ago and it gets real old real fast.\n* Movement speed is too slow for how big the world is.  There are no vehicles in the game thus you are left playing [i]Walking Simulator 2000[/i].  I haven\u2019t had a chance to try out the new mount update but allegedly the travel speed is not any better.\n* The [i]Repair Bench[/i] has been \"Coming Soon\" since December.  It has been 9 months since the game has been out and the Tech. Tree is [i]still[/i] incomplete.  This is an [b]EARLY ACCESS game[/b], not a v1.0.\n* Workshop has numerous nickle-and-dime items that are lateral \u201cimprovements\u201d instead of [i]meaningful[/i] improvements.\n* Level is soft-capped at 50 but there is no way to take [i]all[/i] the talent points in offline play, or at the very least, max out all the solo talent points (since you are only given 25 solo points out of 50.)  [i]Conan Exiles[/i] has a popular mod that increases the level cap from 60 to 300.  Icarus needs an option to allow the max level to be configured by the host.\n* Why am I limited to 3 character slots?  What is this? A console game from the 1990s??\n* If you abandon a mission via \u201cReturn to Station\u201d you can NOT re-join it. Be careful if you leave your friend's game!\n* Mission types lack variety.\n* Playing in Outpost mode lacks missions.\n* No official way to change your Output difficulty. There is in unofficial way to make another another outpost with the same name and delete your previous one but I haven't verified this.\n* No way to rename your character.

I did a couple missions and really started enjoying it again so I tried a longer more involved mission that required a bit of farming and meat grind hunting. Sounded different, and it was! I was sooo close to finishing the farming after 4-5 hours of play (fresh level so I had a lot of grinding to even be able to make crop plots) and then it happened.... I had to STOP playing for a work meeting. Little did I know that a basic, ancillary function of the game was currently bugged and when I came back, almost all of my resources had vanished. Many hours wasted... I can understand bugs but it's not okay to have a save function bug out after being on the market this long and charging people for it. This is a failure to properly test your code and or database orchestration. Unacceptable. I'm not even sure WHY the server would overwrite my local save if there are no other players? The source of truth should be my machine in a single player game. I could understand if there was some fear of hacks or cheats, etc. but this game has no ladder or economy so that point is... well pointless.\n\nOld review:\nLike so many others... it's hard to review this. There are great things, and other things that are just... well really bad design choices.\n\nMake it better with the following:\nAdd logic. No Oxygen makes no sense. Remove the oxygen / space suit thing all together, it's pointless and doesn't fit with the rest of the world. What's everything else breathing? No don't answer that, it's dumb no matter how you answer. I get the lore, poison air, adapted animals, exotic mutation, etc.. Still silly!\n\nRunning back to your spaceship every missions is NOT fun or exciting in any sense. Remove it. I know it's part of the core story ... but it's also dumb. It's like asking a race car driver to do 500 laps backwards after finishing the race.\n\nDon't drop people in far off places just because. There is nothing more annoying than seeing your new target location is the place your last mission dropped you right next to but your current missions makes you walk to for 1/2 hour. SpaceX can land a space craft anywhere in the world within inches... you're telling me this far in the future you can't land us within 10 feet? If you REALLY MUST do this at least claim there was a malfunction or something from the planet attacked the drop pod etc... make my pain at least part of an interesting plot.\n\nThe whole premise of not taking anything with you but the magical / super special versions of things is also really dumb. It would be much more fun if I could bring tools I made with me and or expensive things like furnaces with me (I know they wont fit but we threw logic out the window a long time ago!)\n\nYou need to stop the clock when logged out in multiplayer games. Maybe someone thought it was cool or cute but some people have real lives and sometimes can't get back to playing for a week. When I come back to finish a mission and my character is completely deleted because I didn't get off a planet... what do you think the reaction is? \"WOW this is challenging game!\", no it's more... \"hrm, how about that, guess I'm done with that game\".", "timestamp_created": 1640029654, "timestamp_updated": 1651514269, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 617, "votes_funny": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828751623630523682", "comment_count": 34, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134096386": {"recommendationid": "134096386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154961188", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 35978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16140, "last_played": 1710726302}, "language": "english", "review": "Changing my review to a negative.\nThe game was sold as a seamless multiplayer experience, using centralized servers, so no dedicated host was needed.\nThis feature has been removed. \nI cannot stand by a product that removed core features that they used to sell the game.

There really is something in this game for everyone regardless of your play style and it's done [b] well. [/b] If you're on the fence about buying this game, trust me, buy it.\n\nThis is the first LONG review I've written; so it should be clear that I really love this game and think you will too.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nI'll break this review up into three sections:\n1. Why You'll Love Icarus\n2. Things that Could Be Better\n3. Historical Context\n\n\n[h1] Why You'll Love Icarus [/h1]\n\n- [b] Wonderful multiplayer support: [/b] This is my groups GO TO game to play together\n\n- [b] The game has something for everyone: [/b]\n\t- Building structures is easy and flexible (see the Could Be Better for some hints)\n\t- Cooking (Food buffs)\n\t- Hunting (character trait bonuses and stealth add bonuses)\n\t- Mining \n\t- Crafting (Tech tree has so many tiers of items you can learn to unlock)\n\t- Farming (lots of vegetables you can grow and gather in the wild)\n\t- Mounts (Dinosaur Chicken and Buffalos you can ride or use as pack animals)\n\t- Exploration (the map is HUGE)\n\t- Boss fights\n\t- Fishing (new)\n\t\n- [b] Icarus does the basics WELL: [/b] You can tell the devs poured a lot of time into making the basic, repetitive tasks (chopping trees, mining, hunting) enjoyable and run smoothly. It makes the game very enjoyable.\n\n- [b] 3rd Person view: [/b] Honestly this doesn't get enough wrap. If you're a person that suffers from motion sickness and 1st person view makes you nauseous, then Icarus's 3rd person mode (default: press \"c\") has got you covered. It's well done and you can do everything you can do in 1st person.\n\n- [b] Traits: [/b] The trait system (bonuses that your character can unlock) add wonderful flavor and customization to your character. Want to focus more on hunting? Put more of your trait points in to the hunting tree. Mining? Put them in the mining tree. There are like 12 different traits trees that you can mix and match. As you level-up you get more traits points you can spend. Love it.\n\n- [b] Constant Updates: [/b] The devs have been updating the game weekly since launch. As of the writing of this post, we are in the 80-something weekly updates. Most of the neg reviews you see are people who were upset about the way the devs handled character migration. I came in after that update so I cannot speak to that. However; I can tell you that almost all of the updates I've experienced have been net positive improvement. \n\n\n[h1] Could Be Better [/h1]\nThese are things I think could be better. And [i] even [/i] with these, I still [i] 100% [/i] would recommend that you buy this game.\n\n- [b] Newbie understanding of tech tree: [/b] This has been improved a bit in the last update that revamped the tech tree. Starting out as a newbie it was very difficult to understand how different tech tree items related to each other. So you'd end up spending your tech points on 3-out-of-4 of the items you needed and would then have to wait to level up to get more tech points. Items dependencies aren't clearly articulated.\n\n- [b] Injuries: [/b] Injuries in the game (a negative buff on your character) feel a little flat. I would encourage the devs to make them feel more real. A good example of how to do it well would be Green Hell.\n\n- Honestly, that's all I can really think of. There are bugs here and there but I've seen SO many bugs get fixed each update thanks to the built in reporting tool. Seriously. Just get the game.\n\n\n[h1] Historical Context [/h1]\n\nWhen I was looking to get this game, I saw the \"Mixed\" for All Reviews and I thought, \"ehhhhhhhh, IDK if I want to spend money on it.\" I bought it and bought a copy for a friend. I tried it out and died by a bear within the first 10 minutes. I closed the game and thought, \"what a bust.\" But wait, you say, I thought you love this game (I do).\n\nThankfully, my friend tried it out and convinced me to give it another go. We've played Valheim, Green Hell, Satisfactory, Space Engineers, Terraria, you name it. So when he said, \"Woah, I think this one might be the best thus far\" I had to give it another shot. [b] GLAD. I. DID. [/b]\n\nIcarus combines so many of the elements that make each of those games great, and it does it well.\n\nWhen the game first launched it was rough (hence the mixed reviews), but the developers kept iterating, kept improving, kept fixing bugs, and adding meaningful content. You can tell this game is a labour of love for them.\n\nPeople will always be mad about change. And the ones most upset will be the most vocal. \n\nI love this game. My friends love this game. I think you'll love this game. \n\nSo what are you waiting for? Just get it and try it out. (or watch some let's play on youtube).", "timestamp_created": 1687793163, "timestamp_updated": 1687793163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 98, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824385702610015869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121365018": {"recommendationid": "121365018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091940075", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 23080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16212, "last_played": 1700054597}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR: Missions are too long, doing anything of use is unengaging while also taking too long and EVERYTHING feels unrewarding including perks, mission rewards, shop equipment and anything else.\n\nI will break this into two sections, in the first i will explain the problems the game has in order to inform those may seek to purchase the game, in the second i will offer possible solutions with multiple options that would be better suited to the game as a whole in an effort to aid the developers and perhaps offer ideas for the community to rally behind or suggest themselves.\n\nFirst and foremost however i will begin by stating that i do not believe the game needs to make structures permanent and i firmly believe that doing so would altar the identity of the game and its premise so drastically that it may as well be a different game entirely.\nWhat i do believe however is that they need to change things and fast, regardless of it \"breaking\" balance as the balance is already non-existent and the game ultimately stands pointless and purposeless and i do not mean that it lacks story or narrative, i mean there is no reason to progress and no meaningful progress to be made even if there were. It is, by every definition of the words, Not Fun.\n\n1. Problems: there are two ways to do this type of game correctly which is to either make things easy and cheap to get and use however you have to remake them frequently meaning every mission, or make them expensive and time consuming to get yet make them meaningful by allowing you to keep them either for good or requiring occasional maintenance to continue working. As it currently stands Icarus falls into a midpoint where it harnesses the worst of both ideas- it can take hours of only running from one cave to the next just to find the materials required, possibly several more hours to harvest enough then haul it back to base, takes possibly several hours more for them to process so you can use them for said item and all of this after you spend several more hours building a home and the required benches with which to build other benches which you will need to make the station for refining materials for the item as well as the item itself, Then when you are done with just that one singular mission that you will have to do a dozen more of to earn the slightest of permanent rewards,, you leave the planet and all that work is wiped away, you realize that you just threw away an entire day of your life to complete one single mission and the second you hit \"begin prospect\" again you will have to start all over from square one.\n\nthe lesson is that when something is easily gained, you do not mind loosing it.\nwhen something is hard fought and you lose it, you feel cheated.\n\nonce on the station you have The Store, i am glad to say that for once it is not a premium store, instead you can use points you earn after each mission to buy items you can take with you on your next mission and make life easier for you, you would think this would make the pain of saying goodbye to your hard work worthwhile correct? sadly not, nothing here makes a large enough impact and ultimately once you get your preferred setup you just go \"ok what now?\" because you will face mostly the same challenges over and over again and the items do very little besides \"+%25 more gold harvest\" or \"+%30 more leather from animals\". you will not get to a point where you say \" i need to bring heavy fur instead of battle armor because its in the snow\" instead you will bring your battle armor, make a house and workbench and use your armor to kill animals then make fur armor and head off on your mission with both suits in tow. you will not get a point where you say \"i wont bother bringing the pick this time because my friend is the builder\" you will bring it anyway because its best if you can split up to gather resources.\n\nI have to ask the developers: how do you think people will find this fun?, why do you think people will want to play this game this way? why would they play this above other games of similar style or genre? because your special?, your not. and i do not mean that in a disrespectful way, it is a simple truth that nobody in any industry is special when there are competitors in said industry.\n\n2. Solutions: bellow is a a list of things that could be implemented that would resolve issues within Icarus.\nResources: cut the costs of everything on tier 3 and 4 by %50, no questions asked, especially electronics, it makes no difference if you increase their spawns or their yield from each node if i end up sitting in my base for more than 45 minutes watching videos on my phone just to keep the process going. dont like that idea? introduce a minigame where you need to pay attention to the smelter or build components yourself and if you do a good job you get bonus materials, give me a reason to pay attention by rewarding me with less crafting time if i do, however it needs to be significant or it will make no difference, %10-20 bonus will not be enough.\nThe Store: Allow us to purchase miniature crafting stations from the store with research points, allow us to pack it up and take it back with us as well. the idea of having to progress through crafting bench>furnace>anvil>masonry bench before you can make stone is nice at first but after a few missions it gets tedious and tiresome, allowing us to use our points to skip a few steps gives meaningful progression and a good use of our points while also promoting group play and diversity of playstyle, allowing each player to contribute in a more meaningful way. i would suggest a basic anvil, mini-masonry bench, portable forges, collapsible cement mixer, ammo press, cooking pot, maybe even a small portable generator that cant be used for much but takes less fuel and can be used immediately. aside from just crafting stations let us bring firearms as well, perhaps a high caliber single-shot break action which takes ammo you can only buy from the store, something that you want to keep for emergencies and nothing else, or a flare gun that scares away wildlife and it wont come back. let us have a very expensive buggy that has good carry capacity, can be damaged by wildlife, requires fuel and clearing pathways to use well, not enough? make it take up to 3 slots to bring with you on a drop, want fuel? takes an extra slot so your group could end up with a dedicated driver.\nThe environment: The game was sold on aliens, there are no aliens. yes they are coming in the DLC, no that has not made it better. you dont need to go all out before the DLC but give us a better taste or you wont have people to buy the DLC.\nThe Missions: Allow us to select different drop spots that actually matter and offer different obstacles to start with, start in the desert?-better bring a canteen or find water fast. Start in the riverlands?-better bring ammo its bear turf. different areas can be closer to the objective but more hazardous, making ones preparation, gear and experience matter more. currently this is not the case.\nPermanence: perhaps instead of allowing everything to be permanent, allow us to bury a supply cache we can recover and if we dont it gets lost, perhaps we could unlock a transmitter to turn in, get paid for and accept new missions before we leave our established foothold, making the idea of getting out on time a greater peril to keep track of.\n\nThere are many ideas that could quite easily save this struggling title, however as it stands there is simply no reason to play it. who wants to spend hours to build something just to see it destroyed? who wants to spend hours, days even to unlock something that will ultimately not feel much different than before? who wants to buy into a game just to see its whole identity shift away from why you bought it? and why will it matter what it becomes if nobody is around to see it?", "timestamp_created": 1661683498, "timestamp_updated": 1668999140, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 152, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823337197303771973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124678518": {"recommendationid": "124678518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065706557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1698899359}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll update this as I go, but I am about 10 hours into the game with 2 other friends now that persistent open world has been added (10/28/2022) and we are REALLY enjoying it!

And almost all items require one of many special benches to make, and the benches themselves require unlocking and materials.\n\nAs is often the case with these games, some items have a chain of items and builds that borders on the ridiculous, for what can feel like minimal improvements.\n\nIcarus is also mission-based, so you get thrown down to the planet with nothing, start from scratch every time, and can take nothing back with you.\n\nThis means every time you start, you\u2019re almost certainly going to spend your first 15-30 minutes doing the same things \u2013 picking up sticks, rocks, and chopping down trees to make the basic things you need to survive.\n\nThe missions have timers. Originally, these were real-world timers that ran even when you weren\u2019t playing the game. Start a mission with a 24 hour limit, and if you didn\u2019t complete it within 24 hours of real time, you failed. Fortunately, the devs realized this was an unpopular design path and switched it to being \u201cin game time\u201d only. But this has the effect of making the current time limits a non-issue.\n\nMost of the time the tension seems to be \u201chow much grind do I want to do before I start the actual mission goal?\u201d\n\nIcarus understands that the \u201cscrabbling to survive\u201d part of survival games is often the most fun, but making you replay exactly that every time on every level and every mission gets old quick. There are no real shortcuts to get past this repetitive start, either.\n\nUnlike some other games (Valheim, for example), there are no ruins to discover, no items to find, no treasures to seek. You\u2019re in nature, up against regular animals. There aren\u2019t many types in each biome (and it\u2019s the standard forest/desert/snow, too).\n\nThe combat is not great. Even at a high level, if the wrong kind of animal gets the drop on you, you are probably going to die, and probably with your inventory or loot windows open as you frantically try to close them. Combat is mostly sniping from far away, hoping for a stealth kill, and then running like hell or exploiting terrain.\n\nIf more than one creature is aggroed, you\u2019re also probably going to die. Even at Level 50, I am carefully sneaking around and completing many missions by running and hiding, rather than doing things \u201cproperly\u201d.\n\nCombat tends to be either trivial, or \u201coh, fuck this\u201d.\n\nThere is a punitive death penalty when you do die. Plus you have to run back to your corpse to get your hard-earned hand-built stuff.\n\nYou can build elaborate bases, but given the inherently disposable nature of them in missions, you\u2019re going to build the smallest possible thing, usually out of wood, since any of the other materials require a grind completely not worth the benefits for a specific mission. This is also the problem with most of the upper tier objects \u2013 the benefits don\u2019t seem worth the grind.\n\nEven if you build a nice base, a storm might blow it (and the benches inside) to bits, or lightning might set it on fire and burn it to the ground while you are on the other side of the map questing away. Fun or frustrating? You decide.\n\nSome missions are deliberately opaque, and require you to have unlocked a particular technology to complete the mission. The game does not tell you this, however, you just find out on your own once you\u2019re down there. So you either abort and fail, or stay down and grind until you unlock the thing you need to win. Or you can read a Wiki and get instructions before you launch.\n\nOn that note, the world map is fixed. Most of the items always spawn in the same place, and once you know where caves are (for example), you know where to look. But the game does not mark things on your map for you, nor does it let YOU mark things on your map, other than placing a single target waypoint. (My heuristic is anything I can do with a paper and pencil, the game should be doing for me, so give me a persistent map I can mark up, guys!)\n\nThe \u201cmetagame\u201d progression of unlocking items at the base also feels unnecessarily difficult and expensive. You have to \u201cresearch\u201d items for one cost, then \u201cbuy\u201d them after researching them for another cost. The majority of these items seem to be only slightly better than the 2nd tier (of 4 tiers) items you can craft, and you can generally get to that level of crafting after a few minutes on each run.\n\nThe missions seem to fall into a few standard types: Gather materials, go scan at a location, kill some critters, or build a base.\n\nSome of these missions are unnecessarily tedious, like requiring you to build a tower 10 stories high, and having to do it in a particular way so it doesn\u2019t collapse under its own weight (which you can either figure out, or go look up on the internet). Perhaps the designers thought this would be a clever and fun puzzle. Maybe. But then you have to do it twice, exactly the same way. There was another one that required me to set up two different farms at opposite ends of the map, and run back and forth between them waiting for things to grow. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of narrative inconsistency. You have a space suit, you have to fill it with oxygen, the atmosphere isn\u2019t breathable\u2026but you can get pneumonia in caves. You can\u2019t bring stuff down with you, until you can bring some stuff down with you. You can\u2019t bring stuff back, except for the stuff you have to bring back. You have a space suit, but no flashlight. And so on.\n\nThe game does a few things well, though. Icarus feels like it was balanced for multiplayer, and accommodates single-player by having a whole separate \u201cSolo Skills\u201d tree you can unlock, providing boosts for single-player runs only. That\u2019s a clever solution, even if Icarus still feels excessively difficult solo.\n\nThe world looks decent, with lots of detail. There\u2019s plenty of stuff to build. The biomes each present unique challenges, even if the weather is punishing no matter where you are.\n\nI haven\u2019t played multiplayer yet, but it seems like the game could really shine here.\n\nSome of Icarus\u2019 problems are fixable with some balancing and quality of life improvements. Beyond that, the devs added game modes so you can have your open-world sandbox or a lightweight \"permanent\" world without missions, and a paid DLC with what sounds like a proper campaign.\n\nThe base game is hard to recommend as it is, and yet there is something compelling about it. Still, it is ultimately a frustrating experience more than a relaxing or challenging one.", "timestamp_created": 1693022220, "timestamp_updated": 1693022220, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816683590412139893", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "154954574": {"recommendationid": "154954574", "author": {"steamid": "76561199430034870", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1701710459}, "language": "english", "review": "The game itself is actually quite decent. I'd even suggest picking it up during a sale and giving it a try. However, what really stands out in this situation is the fanservice and the way the developers handle their promises and criticisms.\n\nLately, on their official Discord, it seems like all they do is talk about the expenses they're dealing with to make everything happen. Frankly, it gets a bit tiresome hearing about these complaints. They only seem to be active when they're about to release something new, like New Frontiers now. Other than that, they can go for months without any communication. They're going on about how much effort and money goes into creating a pet in the game, costing anywhere from $30k to $50k, and how players don't really understand the work behind it. Then they talk about features like full mod support, which we all know breathe life into games (remember how DayZ did it?), and they claim it would cost millions. They also mention something as simple as character customization being worth a million dollars.\n\n\"Rocket | CEO\" mentioned that those who bought the Supporters Edition will eventually get a significant discount. Depending on how many units are sold, the Supporters Edition might even end up not costing the developers anything, or possibly even causing them to lose money, especially in certain regions.\n\nHonestly, this kind of messaging to the people who believed in them and invested more to receive what was promised is a bit surprising. It's common knowledge that pre-orders and early supporters often get better deals. It's not rocket science (no pun intended). It seems like they're trying to make it look like they're the ones carrying the financial burden, which doesn't really sit right. This is a standard practice, and usually, it's the other way around \u2013 pre-orders are given at a discount.\n\nI can already imagine the defenders who will argue that we should support the developers. It's fine to have differing opinions, but we need to be honest about our concerns.\n\nThe financial equation here is quite simple. The Icarus Deluxe Edition (that was the name of the edition I bought) costs $109.98, yet Styx, which everyone owning the game received for free, has a standalone cost of $23.44 (on promotion). The first DLC, priced at $25.49, brings the total to $48.93. Even if we factor in the $8.99 for Styx and a $5.99 add-on with lamps (which is also part of the deluxe edition), the total comes to $63.91 - and the next DLC won't cost $40 for sure, does that mean they'll start slicing out every little feature and selling them for $3-4 each just to hit that price point?\n\nThe lack of transparency in their communication is baffling. Any expression of dissatisfaction is met with backlash from their supporters, who don't seem to grasp that if you don't voice your concerns, you won't see any improvements. On Discord, you're flooded with messages about how everything is perfect and fantastic, which doesn't make sense for a game that's still in development (and it's supposed to be the first year in Early Access, but that's a whole other issue).\n\nEncountering yet another update that introduces redundant features like two shields, coupled with the ongoing lack of progress in the development of the station shop and the repeatedly emphasized but elusive focus on future improvements, has thoroughly exhausted my patience. The absence of effective communication on these matters has significantly eroded my enthusiasm. I'm left in a state of uncertainty regarding the specifics of what the next game update will bring: what content will be added and how the game will evolve. The broad statements provided often fail to align with the actual changes that emerge when an update is eventually released.\n\nTake a look at the sudden surge in positive reviews today \u2013 it's clearly orchestrated by them.\n\nI'm sharing this negative feedback not because I dislike the game itself, but because I'm disappointed in the way the developers are handling their communication and game development. I'd still recommend buying and playing the game. While it's notably under-optimized, the recent changes seem to make the gameplay more accessible for a wider audience. Whether it suits your tastes or not is something you'll have to decide for yourself.

It's always a game I end up circling back to. I have played several different survival type games before (Ark, Rust, Terraria, Scum ect.) but nothing like this. Icarus is in a league of its own. CONSTANT updates keep the game fresh and interesting. Everything about the game revolves around its core concept, which unfortunately I feel most players miss. It's a SESSION BASED survival game. It plays more like a roguelike than a traditional survival game. Always under constant pressure of the mission clock, you have to get in, get your mission done and GET OUT. 10/10 devs NAIL IT when it comes to this game. You can play 1-8 players at a time, the game feels designed with group play in mind, but solo play is just as fun if more challenging. \n\n\tAs mentioned Icarus is a SESSION BASED survival game. This concept is the main point of negative reviews on this game. This is NOT a classic survival game. You have a mission that needs to be done and you need to leave. If you ever played \u2018the Cycle: Frontier\u2019 i like to think of icarus like that, you have a limited window of opportunity before the area becomes unlivable. Anything crafted or built is wiped after every session. A lot of players resent this as they spent time building bases, weapons, tools, getting tech upgrades and so fourth. In reality though, it is the core of the game. Part of your decisions involve figuring out how much you need to build to survive the mission at hand. Easy mission? Simple wood and bone tools/weapons can get you through no problem. Going into the more hazardous zones? \u201cTech up\u201d to steel/platinum. \n\tThe game plays like a roguelike. Your missions reward you with research and sometimes exotics. Use these in the space station to buy upgrades from the workshop. A 3D printed knife won't last forever, but it will skip the need to make early items and speed up the early drop process. Advancing down the workshop tree IS the game's progression, not \u201cin-mission\u201d building. Only build what you NEED to survive.\n\tIt is a survival game. You will need to find oxygen, food, and water to survive. As well as the harsh weather systems of the planet itself. Falling can kill you, fish can kill you, cave worms can kill you, starving can kill you, the harsh exposure CAN AND WILL KILL YOU. animals can be aggressive or passive, and some will attack when provoked. Icarus is not a safe place to be, and the game reminds you of that constantly. \n\tYou can tailor each drop to your preferred level of difficulty. Each mission will have a general rating scale from 1-4 \u2018skulls\u2019. You can make them easier for less rewards, or harder for more rewards. You can even insure your prospector for full safety, or go in HARDCORE for a true survival experience. There is permanent death for characters left behind.\n\n\tCombat is relatively simple, but has a few layers. There's stealth mechanics with sneak attack damage bonus. Crit mechanics. headshot/weak points (bonus damage). As well as hardpoints (less damage). All tools made also double as weapons in a pinch. Your pickaxe or regular ax won't do as much melee damage as quickly as a well crafted knife, but can save you in a pinch. Ranged weapons seem to be the go-to as it allows you to easily sneak and down hostile animals from safe distances.\n\n\tIcarus is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. Catch a sunrise as it bathes light into a forested valley and take a moment to appreciate the sights. I've played at minimum settings as well as EPIC settings and I have to suggest the highest your computer can handle.\n\nCharacter progression\n\tThere are 3 different progression systems in Icarus. Talent points, Blueprint points and the Workshop.\n\tTalent points: there are two major talent systems. Regular talent points and solo talent points. Every level up to level 50 rewards a standard talent point to spend. Every OTHER level also rewards a solo tree talent point. The SOLO tree is only active if you are on a mission by yourself. If someone joins your prospect, these talents go dormant. Each of your 50 talents can be spent to improve your character's specialization. Gathering, combat, building, survival. Whatever you want to focus on, there's a talent tree for it. Some crafting materials require certain talents so it's an excellent idea to browse and plan your talents as they are limited.\n\tBlueprints: These are more linear and will allow you to craft more complex items. Blueprint points will  continue to accrue even after max level 50. Which means if you play a character enough, you can eventually have everything in the blueprint trees. It's a good idea to always be sitting on about 5 blueprint points in case your mission calls for something you don't have already. \n\tWorkshop: The real progression system of icarus. Workshop items are your major upgrades. Each item helps you skip parts of the early game systems. Tired of making a stone pickaxe on drop? Buy one from the workshop and you can have it with you every mission (as long as you don't accidentally leave it behind OOPS). Workshop items require a steep initial research cost, but much smaller crafting cost, and they can be crafted multiple times if needed. Any workshop item you bring back will be renewed/repaired and available again for your next drop. This progression starts slow but ramps up as you get to the meatier missions. The best ones will cost you your valuable and difficult to obtain exotics, but it's well worth the price. Items include: tools, weapons, armor, suits, special ammunition, modules, and more. Each item has a way to make missions quicker by cutting out a part of on planet resource needs. The first tool/weapon in each branch is ROUGHLY equivalent to iron crafted gear, although crafted items during a drop will be slightly better, you can usually skip to the higher tier items as the Workshop items will last you until you have gathered/built up to them. Further down the tool and weapon trees are more specialized, and are steel or better quality items. These are ENTIRELY worth the hefty entry cost.\n\n\tIcarus punches back. Usually missions start off with light rain or light wind storms and progressively get more intense as the mission goes on. The weather updates on your HUD, yellow -> Red -> Black.  Be wary, a quick built wooden shelter will prevent you from taking exposure damage, but wont itself survive very long. Lightning can set entire forests ablaze, and wind can rip down trees. Exposure to the elements will slow you down, reduce your stamina and eventually start damaging you directly. The Icarus storms will kill.\n\nBeginner tips\n1. Early missions teach you how to survive and build within icarus\u2019 systems. Use these early missions to get easy levels while the game isn't actively trying to kill you.\n2. WORKSHOP ITEMS: MXC-knife, Water canteen, Oxygen tank. These 3 items save you the most time on drop for the cheapest entry cost. Get them.\n3. You can stuff oxite (blue rocks) directly into the oxygen slot of your suit. Its not very efficient but will keep you alive\n\nI cannot express enough gratitude to the AMAZING dev team behind this project. From the \u201crefund no questions asked\u201d beta, to the fulfilled promise of weekly updates. ACTUAL weekly updates. This has been something I find missing in 99% of games on the market. Icarus is easily a 60$\u201370$ game in size, scope, and dev support. They charge HALF that. Even the first large DLC was extra content, at no extra cost. This is INCREDIBLY rare in today's market. Kudos to them.\n\nAfter playing Icarus for over 200 hours I estimate I've completed around 60-70% of the game. Roughly based on my workshop/blueprint progression and the number of unique missions completed. Cant wait to see whats next.\n\n\u201cWe were like cave people in spacesuits those first few drops\u2026.The second you felt comfortable on the surface, you take your eye off the mission clock, and that's how people died\u201d -Sol (Icarus: No Rescue)", "timestamp_created": 1667775555, "timestamp_updated": 1667775555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811308145523071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148434726": {"recommendationid": "148434726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015396245", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 74150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1895, "playtime_at_review": 69418, "last_played": 1713750087}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot recommend this game despite playing for over 1100 hours at the time of post.

Open World is what I was wanting. I'm hoping for more challenging missions than what is offered but again, seems like they are trying. \n\nThey still need to work on the mount system. They die way too quickly when not fed which is not realistic. Personally, dying should take quite a while. Firstly they should debuff it's abilities for a time and possibly make them more audible to tell their owners that they have a problem.\n\nI'm happy with the reinforced glass utilizing water. One of my wants is narrower stairs. Possibly create a piece that has narrow stairs and covered for the other half.\n\nSince refrigerators allow food to spoil, which is realistic, give us an opportunity to create freezers? Or have 4 dedicated slots in the fridge that had a slower timer to imitate the freezer aspect.\n\nAbsolutely PLEASE give us electrical switches for power and lights.\n\nOverall, it's nice to know that what I create won't be erased right after a mission.\n\n\n\n\n********************************************************************\nI've gotta give the game a thumbs down until I see change.\n\nGraphics are the nicest part of the game.  But from day one the play style just didn't really work. Too many loop holes in the lore of the game. I still can't get over catching pneumonia in a cave when I'm in a fully contained suit. Most space suits I know of protect the occupant from severe cold or heat but I get pneumonia? The missions for the most part aren't fun and become exhausting. It's like they haven't found the true direction of this game and it really has so much potential. \n\nThere should be more slots for your load out ...at least a row for expendables. \nThey provide players with missions that they didn't ask for and don't provide  them with things they desire in game.  90% of tier 4 items are unneeded fluff. There's absolutely no reason to build electric benches. \nIf you're going to base this game around one planet then you need to allow us to just live on it and send the missions down to us. Let us build our dwellings and structures and make it a home for the long hull and do the missions. \n\nThe  workshop items are laughable for the most part. Why would I pay  200 Ren TO RESEARCH  a bandage and then 50 to craft it when I can just make one from fiber???  And to add insult to injury it would take up one of my precious slots..\n\nMost workshop items have more drawbacks than what they're worth to purchase. \n\nI'm not sure what this game engine can handle but to be able to scale up a  mountain with a rope and harness or to tunnel in and make your own cave or have the ability to have a parachute or hang glider mechanic seems like a no-brainer. Give us the ability to craft a canoe or raft. It would be awesome to canoe through the Riverlands...  \n\nI see many people asking for the above items however, we're given off the wall things that basically nobody asks for... It's like the developers want to throw easy things into the game  while they \"may\" be working on the cool stuff but if you don't start letting players know what to expect, I for one will be moving on. I love the building, and survival aspect but it's getting old really fast and I know I'm not the only one feeling this way. \n\nFeed off the players wants and desires. Don't think that you know what's best and not incorporate any of our suggestions.  It's the players who pay you and it's the players who'll move on if they don't feel like they're being heard.\n\nPlease give this game the direction that it needs.", "timestamp_created": 1660419211, "timestamp_updated": 1669087515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.805675029754638672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128608138": {"recommendationid": "128608138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161392532", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 458, "last_played": 1707668352}, "language": "english", "review": "***BOUGHT THIS GAME FOR ITS NEW OPEN WORLD UPDATE ONLY!

One of them being that the map is always the same .. its good in that if you know here the caves are now you always will but the bad part is that eventually nothing is new anymore.  You effectively play the same map over and over and over as you're always starting again from scratch and this can make you feel like you've played the game to DEATH.\n\nMap issues are also prevalent such as walls that aren't there, resources you cant get to because of an invisible wall, resources appearing inside rock, mission items that only show up for the host, burnt trees that cause players to fall through the map or cause players sessions to reload the ui (and usually end up with you falling through the map over and over).\n\nPart of the draw of the game originally was the premise in that you did missions to open up items for research and purchase to aid you in the next missions, there is an element of truth in that however let me be clear, once you played for a little while and got the few items that actually help you in game .. forget about anything else.  Outside of them armour and one or two tools there becomes no reason to need cash or exotics and therefore no more reason to really want to do any more missions.\n\nFor me the only real draw anymore has become the building aspect, in that the game also falls short.  the graphics are beautiful up to a point, there are a number of build materials however with recent changes its only worth going up to stone, the changes to the cement mixer now means it takes eons to get a decent amount to build in concrete.  The build pieces above stone are severely limited in terms of what you can place.  Wood and stone can have double wide windows, anything higher than that is only single windows .. that kind of thing.\n\nAbove that the build engine itself is very limited, if you want to only ever build in 90 degree angles .. you're in luck, otherwise give up now.  Before this i played Valheim and the difference in the build system outside of the graphics is huge.\n\nDon't get me wrong they have added in certain things such as being able to build half walls instead of full and less steep roofs however the build pieces they put in are cosmetic only.  Want to build on top of that half wall ? .. nope cause it still sees it as a full wall, want to build a less steep roof but keep the same width of building ? .. nope .. cause the less steep roof is designed to be used with another piece making it the original height but twice as wide, if you try building using just one piece it doesn't connect.  You also can't place anything that is less than a full tile, if you want to have say a balcony well its going to be a full floor.  Yes you could use a half piece to add a balcony but forget about putting railings on the side cause theres no half railing or half tile walls. \n\nNow as i said originally don't get me wrong, i've got my monies worth out of the game but as it stands now .. there is just no draw to play.  Missions are boring and repetitive, starting from scratch every map is a pain (yes i know it said that at launch but once you've played 2000 hours you lose interest), building system is limited and uninspiring .. you will never see the type of innovation such as other games (Valheim).\n\nIf you didn't buy the supporters edition you can also forget about more than one type of biome for outposts, this means if you do want to just build to your hearts content, you're going to be very bored in you're choice of location.  you get a 4 sector radius to build in and thats it, no predators or heavy storms which is a good thing on the surface but a bad thing in that its hard to hunt effectively for food or leather.  resources respawn whenever you load in which is nice but considering the limited building that outpost wont keep you interested long.\n\nNow after all this someone is going to say Hey .. its only been out 6 months and that's true however silly little things like expanding all building options to all materials, so you can have an extra wide window in concrete for instance, should NOT be that hard to implement and its been requested on the suggestions forum time and time again.  I guess in the end this is just a survival game with a little bit of building in it.\n\nYes i still have to recommend it cause after 2000 hours how can i not but I don't see it lasting much longer for me.", "timestamp_created": 1650596066, "timestamp_updated": 1650596506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801001965999603271", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106555667": {"recommendationid": "106555667", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963347201", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 26597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "playtime_at_review": 9332, "last_played": 1713589668}, "language": "english", "review": "RocketWerks = Apple Inc. Make a problem, sell the solution. Next weeks patch notes: \"Stamina bar is doubled!*\"\n\n*only with DLC\n\nAlso lets let the general public be alpha testers. \n\nHands down, never changing this review. Still the same as of 13/08/2022 after it was fully released in December 2021.  If your a returning player, dont bother reinstalling, i was sadly disappointed its barely progressed in terms of playability. Rocketwerkz really know how to flog a dead horse. \n\nShift-bar Exercise Machine (Originally written in Dec 2021 - still applies)\n\n\nUnfortunately, I still have encountered regions where the creatures spawns are somewhat buggy af (the wolf scenario I describe below is still possible) in some areas which can be insatiably RAM hungry for no apparent reason. With every addition of patch I find myself craving the next hoping the next issue is addressed so I remain hopeful especially seeing the efforts the devs are putting in. This could also be a double edged sword since its end-game is very much orientated around patch releases. \n\nPayday - Extraction. Did you even try to test this mission out? This was the decider for me and it was perhaps the least grindy out of all the missions to date - by this I mean, sit down, hold-shift and wait for the cows to come home. I rolled out having read somewhere I'd need 5+ Biofuel cans to complete the deed \u2013 lets not dismiss that as a small task either ie cans not filling but taking ingredients. This game teaches you to look at forums as you will often get to the location to find its like a Russian doll of grindiness that gets bigger as you open it not to mention the mission descriptions are vague and cryptic af. You learn to take these little itches in your stride because the game is beautiful and its environment is captivating with bird sounds and whatnot. Anyway, I finally get out to the location - some 20-mins (REAL-LIFE TIME) instead of the usual 40-mins like the Mammoth hunt mission...another story. You start caring less about the environment when you start your shift-bar routine. Its all about hopping is what I can say. Just like Morrowind and Oblivion. Btw who chose this mission location? I moved my outpost around several times and it feels like I\u2019m trying to render the final scene in Avatar every time I open the Reinforced Door. Oh what\u2019s that? Lovely, wolves can come out of the huge mountain behind me whenever they please and oh don't forget, if they get you, you have the fun hoodie from your fur helmet flapping in your face while your trying to conserve ammo/arrows, shoddy third-person view & having to deal with the plethora of endless wolves that stroll out - does skinning stop them? who knows? they just keep coming. No pattern, no variation, just Quake 3 drop-in spawns. I left with 40 slots of x100 bone. Piles of wolves carcasses icbf skinning filled my outpost. Rinse and repeat that scenario for 6 Biofuel jerry cans that slugged away at 30mins a can..... Some other reviews here said they popped on Netflix, damn I wish I had thought of that. I tried to make a coffee once and I came back to an extractor that was almost cooked from 4 wolves. Btw one wolf can 2-hit a barricade. I trialled walls around it but then you cant see if a subterranean wolf has somehow gotten inside. The best way was to stay TF away from the outpost altogether and sit ontop of a vertical wall that doesn\u2019t look climbable but when you approach a visible entity lifts your feet as you glide graciously up the side. This way the wolves cant get to you and all your stuff isn\u2019t perpetually being damaged from angles unknown. Great spot but good luck sitting there for 2-minutes without the tireless onslaught of blizzards smashing your patience and whats left of your available RAM. \n\nIntentions: I came to play a solo game that was aesthetically pleasing with a dynamic environment as promised by the 'failed terraforming' processes that have occurred. Where are the adaptable creatures that aren\u2019t mindlessly walking around ignoring each other? \nThe culprit: Bugs and useless end-game gimmick items that should have been a tell-tale sign that a car salesman deal was underway.\nFor example: The Electronic Masonry Bench so I can craft 20 stone pillars in 20-seconds as opposed to 60-seconds but requires a monumental number of mats to craft and because whose stone-pillars aren't in a constant need of 'rapid' replacement. The whole Tier 4 needs a re-work and rebalance. Nothing makes sense and the only figures Rocketwerkz has made sure is right are the stamina and walk-speed. They really don\u2019t want you getting to the end and finding out the mission was actually pointless but hey, why not add running all the way back to the dropship for the hell of it, yay! This is usually where I realise I am hoarding lackluster consumables (ie grenades) for no reason and spend about 200 bullets on the way out shooting everything and anything including pumpkins, beyond survival, just a slaughter back to the dropship thinking to myself 'that was kinda lame'.....then 'Storm Incoming' pops up....Get me out. \n \nSadly disappointed as this was what I have been looking forward to playing over the holidays and now I am back to the drawing board of options. I hope in time it will progress from the unofficial \u2018Early Access Game\u2019 it is now to an unofficial Full Version 1.0.\n\nSIDE NOTE: So for me it was 6 Biofuel cans and I took 7.

We're busy updating and adding to the game. \n\nThe session-based structure means we can add new modes, missions and content to the game without unbalancing your existing progress.

I have just finished the PayDay mission and reached level 65.\nYou know what this game really needs? An honest FAQ about game mechanics  :)\n\nJust start with the basics with others also mentioned:\n\nPlayer: - So you can level up yourself and recieving talent points right? \nDeveloper: Yes!  But only until level 40 - No talent points after that, and WE DO NOT TELL YOU THAT INGAME :)  Just a little surprise.\nP: But, you can finish many talent tree right? Using that 45-50 talent points for the best talents?\nD: Not at all of course - Fortunately, we have the talent and the rank system together, so you can enjoys the negatives from both of the system together :)  You have to reach the last rank for EACH talent tree, just to reach the best ones and you have to waste your points on some meaningless talent ofc :)\n\nP: You mentioned in game description the \"savage alien wilderness\", so there is a many different creature and exciting fight and combat techniques?\nD: Not at all ofc! There is only a wolves, wildboar and bear in forest bioms,  wolves, snow leopard and polar bear in arctic bioms.... And to mix up things,  we put cougar to desert biom, along with hiena, boar and elefant. We know the cougar lives in the mountains, but WHO CARE? :D Isn't it?\nSo mostly you can meet with wolves and bears... that's alien enough :D Oh yes, almost forgot - Bears can run up on vertical hills - VERY USEFUL :D\n\nP: Do I have to grind a lot?\nD: Depends, what you mean a \"lot\"?  Only 60% of the game is grinding roughly - The rest is running across maps and reach goals, just to come back to other direction and finish the map instantly after long runs :)\nP: But I only need to grind at the beginning right? And I can build a base and improve myself?\nD: NOT AT ALL OFC!  After every mission, you lost EVERYTHING you build or earned during the session! No tools, food, materials, nothing. You can just start pick up stones and stick AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN, at every mission.\nP: But...but...but - Why you didn't tell this to us?\nD: We telling you - At the and of the mission: If you leave, you gonna loose everything :)  So we let you know just in time :)\nP: But hopefully the recipes are ballanced right?  And I can gather enough from plants?\nD: Depends... 1 coffe bean and 1 tea from a 2 meters bush is enough?  We think so :D   And needs 50 for a drink... that could be 50 coffee bush for 1 drink. Easy peasy.\nAlso, Just to reach Tiear 4 machines - You need 120 electronics for the 2 most important machine.\nP: That shouldn't be too bad...\nD: Well... for the 120 electronics, you need to gather  360 copper bar (720 ore) - That's 90 kg of Copper  and 120 bar of gold - That's 30 kg\nP: 30 KG of gold for 2 electronic machine? ARE YOU CRAZY?\nD: No... this is totally ballanced :)\n\nP: Okay but pls tell me a concept of the game is totally alright!\nD: Yes of course! You have that space suit on, you need oxygen for it, but you can swim underwater with that ofc...  Oh and you get Pneumonia in caves... just to mix things up :) Don't ask...\n\nP: But at least, no bugs in the game right?\nD: Well... \n1. If you try to gather plants from the planter, after its ready, and if you put or just Ctrl click the stack of seeds to the planter slot, BEFORE collecting the plant that is ready... your stack of food just disappears - Not a big deal\n-You just have to do the following all the time:\na.  Ctrl+click the ready plant from the planter\nb. Ctrl+click the plants from your inventory back to the planter slot - 1 is gonna be planted\nc. Ctrol+click BACK the rest of the seeds or food back to your inventory, because it's gonna decay :D \nEasy game mechanics - So intuitiv :D\n\n2. There is a roof triangles - And for the stone triangles we just didn't want to use the correct item, with the correct name.\n-So if you build a left triangle - That's gonna be a right side one\n-And if you build a right side triangle - That will be the left one :)\n-Also, if you upgrade the wood into stone - It's gonna be turned over... funny isn't it? :D\n\nD: Hey, what you doing at the other merchant?\nP: Nothing, don't mind me...\n*whispering* - Yes, a Valheim copy please, thank you.\n\n\nSo, basically this is our story with my friend who already deleted the game today after Payday mission, where  we had 4 hours of suffering, trying to mine the exotics, we killed roughly 50-80 wolves in that small zone, our house collapsed and all the exotic in the house just lost, because not enough if the walls breaks and the loot falls to the ground in bags... after some time the loot will be destroyed to ruin every little joy in the game for those, how just wanna have some fun after work :(\n\nSo, good graphics,  nice looking... but PLS DO NOT BUY :)\n\nThank you", "timestamp_created": 1644970810, "timestamp_updated": 1644970951, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 223, "votes_funny": 45, "weighted_vote_score": "0.791049361228942871", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108182831": {"recommendationid": "108182831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032071147", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 36182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14944, "last_played": 1702392748}, "language": "english", "review": "Updated review 2.25.22! \nMy original review was not to recommend this game based on numerous issues with both the functionality of the game and the QoL of the player, as well as what felt like missing content. There are also much needed changes to really make this game a more well-rounded, immersive experience, but that being said, here are my original recommendations and what has been changed so far, and why I changed my review to recommend this game!\nOriginal Recommended fixes and what's been done: \n1) I don't think the farming/grinding needs to decrease, as that's part of the fun (if there's a reason for it). The time spent actually completing an objective once you're done with farming and grinding should increase to make all of it actually worth it. - This has been a constant review and update process for the developers, and so far it's been going in the right direction, although not resolved yet. With their commitment that they're still reviewing this aspect, paired with what they've updated so far, I'm comfortable waiting to see how this pans out!\n2)Work on bugs instead of releasing more repetitive prospects. - This started happening! So many bug fixes so far! Yes, there are still quite a few, but they don't feel so immersion-breaking or game crashing.\n3)Implement the quality of life changes that were recommended in the beta weekends that don't impact the gameplay or difficulty. - HUGE improvements in this area in the Week 11 and Week 12 content. This has really made the game all around MUCH more enjoyable, including some of the previous aspects that were considered to be very tedious.\n4) Make the tech tree items more relevant, and reduce the cost of higher tier items. - The developers have committed to improving this as well, so also looking forward to these updates! The minor changes to the cost of higher tier items helped, but they're still not viable or feasible for like 90%+ of the missions. \n5) Add talent points to use in the solo branch, independent of the regular branch. - This was done in the week 12 update!\n6) Give the animals more AI. Add more flora and fauna diversity. - Still waiting on this as well. There were some minor improvements made here where animals will now react to sounds differently and don't get stuck on a rock or tree, and they no longer hear or see through stone walls of your shelter (unless they're right next to you outside), but I consider this as still in progress...\n7) Add more lore! - Still waiting patiently for this!", "timestamp_created": 1642391915, "timestamp_updated": 1645803628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790671825408935547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1643696678, "developer_response": "Hi Vexxor, thanks for taking the time to update your review. \n\nYes, we'll continue to update Icarus and agree with many (but not all) of your assessments about the game.

(30 or less fps with a 3070 and even worse during weather events and also while hosting) however I decided to come back and see how much the game has improved and I'm Incredibly pleased to see me getting 144+ fps with the same setup I had back then but with a much better resolution to boot. optimization has improved immensely and I'm glad they actually put effort into doing so. the newly added updates every week between now and then has made the game far more enjoyable and fun for me as well with the game itself being a nice mix of chill relaxing moments and tense sudden ones.\n\nThe good: There Is a lot that Icarus brings to the table\n\nBase building is very aesthetically pleasing, especially once you get to stone and refined wood structures, bases begin to look so comfortable and nice looking. a lot of this game is nice to look at, with lush forests, harsh deserts and oasis and barren tundras.\n\nCrafting and progressing is a chore sometimes depending on where you are, but feels rewarding at least to me. I've always found it nice to finally get away from early game tools and weapons and then upgrade to steel or higher, being able to bring items from the workshop also aids in early advancement and is nice because workshop items aren't OP but they are far better than stone and some iron.\n\nThe world of Icarus feels brutal as everything feels against you, animals both familiar and unfamiliar are always out to get you, and the weather events are there to level everything you've built with only the toughest of bases brushing off these storms. Lightning storms will rage and cause fires that consume anything burnable nearby unless countered, strong winds can level wooden bases before you realize It, sandstorms can burn you out of your home and snowstorms can quite literally crush your base.\n\nAudio Isn't too bad either, animals, player actions and overall noises are great (axe and pickaxe sounds could be lowered a bit) The storms also sound amazing with the game having some of the most Intense sounding weather In nearly any game I've played. \n\nThe bad: The game Isn't all sunshine and rainbows, there are still quite a few issues that need addressing.\n\nCombat Isn't entirely bad but with the game having \"bosses\" that can really ruin your day they need to be made to feel like bosses instead of just stronger variants of an animal. Having attacks that you could telegraph and dodge to avoid damage Is needed heavily instead of every encounter having said creature just rushing you and attacking non stop, this isn't combat its a damage check at that point between you and the enemy.\n\nSpawning Is also a bit of an issue, especially in the desert with random cougars and scorpions just poofing into existence right in front of you and Immediately aggroing you is just bad spawn design, spawns need to be set out of player sights and a distance away so they can perceive the threat and act accordingly on whether to fight or run.\n\nAI isn't terrible but I don't believe all carnivores should immediately be out to kill you, bears are a good example of this, being territorial is one thing but watching a bear traverse a mountain just to come near my base, see me in my window and start breaking my walls to get to me is a bit much. there should be warning calls or ways for animals to basically say \"back off\" and warn the player. Herbivores shouldn't also turn tail and run when the spot you a mile away, they should just notice you're there and keep an eye on you, If you start acting like you're about to attack them or move towards them then yes, run for the hills.\n\nLast but not least the UI needs an overhaul, I hate having to open every fireplace or furnace and physically click a button to turn on, or having to click a button to craft, there should just be a hot key for that. as for the HUD, I feel that needs a rework as well. While It isn't horrid to look at, it feels very bulky in terms of screen space, theres so much unnecessary info being displayed at all times and at times i just end up playing with the HUD turned off.\n\nOverall Icarus Is by no means a bad game, sure It isn't for everyone. but if you enjoy a game that can bring both a challenge and be relaxing at the same time then It may be for you. The devs release new updates nearly every week, they listen quite a lot to community suggestions and are actively working to fix issues that players find.

We can now enjoy it the way it was meant to be!\n\nAn awesome game with huge potential plagued by huge optimisation issues. This game is somewhat a tricky one which the devs really need to take some time to fix the serious issues within the engine. \nI had been following the development of this game for a while before it's main release last year but after being put off from it's initial release just over a year ago due to the lack of a continuous open world mode and the thought of having to start from scratch every time, they finally released and open world mode which was enough for me to give it a shot.\n\nUpon loading into an Open world mode map, at epic detail on my 5800x RTX 3080 32GB RAM system I am greeted with 110-140 fps in a truly beautiful looking world. The tech trees and talent trees can be a little overwhelming at first but pretty easy to understand and navigate once you get to grips with things. \nFarming for resources is very satisfying especially trees, they've really done well with the eye candy and sounds in this game but quite honestly that's where the good stuff ends. \nThe AI is poor and very repetitive and not very realistic and somewhere along my 80 hours of play, the game has just turned into a choppy lag fest rarely getting over 45 FPS. I ran many tests while also running through several guides online to try and gain back my FPS but without success. Initially I though it might have been my base causing the FPS drop so i made a stone 3x2 nearby and put everything into cupboards inside and deconstructed my main base in the hope that FPS was restored. Unfortunately I was to be disappointed as I was getting the exact same choppy 41-45 FPS as before. \nIf I load a new prospect and drop in I get the perfect 110-140 FPS again but it does definitely seem that something, somewhere is causing the game to slow down.\nTwo of my friends also started playing at the same time I did, one of which has an almost identical system to me and they're both experiencing the same stuff. One of them has an AMD card and, well the lag is much worse especially when a fire lit entity is active. \n\nAll in all if you play the missions mode where you drop in to a fresh world each time I think these issues are non existent but open world definitely needs some severe work to get it playable. I understand it's a new mode and is going to need some tweaking, I just hope that the devs honestly DO take the time to sort this out.\n\nRocket Werkz, if you get these things ironed out then this game will be up there as one of the best survival games ever made, but for now it's just going to fade into the background. The average monthly players is hovering around 2-2.5k but if you get this optimisation fixed then that will for sure go up. \nLess focus on adding more in game items please and get this fixed as for now, this game will just sit in my library until i see an update where they specifically say they have made some optimisation fixes. \n\nOh and devs, please dont respond with a generic message asking me to try the latest drivers.

I expected I'd hate them, and as such, I started with the open world. It then proceeded to be one of the most entertaining things I'd done in some time. I intended for this to be something to play in the background while I played other games, and talked with friends, but no, this game consumed me for 3 days straight. I bought this game on Wednesday, it's now Saturday at the time of this review. I have done nothing but play this game, only begrudgingly sleeping when the beautiful storm sounds started to put me to sleep.\n\nI love so much about this game, and I never even left the forest region. I adore games with a level of freeform progression, the style that doesn't force you down an inevitable path, but rather offers you a choice of how you'd like to build your own progression path. I love the building, and the farm required for it. I love the hunting, how it feels to stealth kill your first bear. I love sitting in my stone house, watching the rain fall outside during the absolutely amazing storms that come and go.\n\nI could gush about this game for hours, but I'll stop myself before I go any further. There is, unfortunately, a downside that caused me to lose all my drive for the game.\n\nAs I mentioned at the start, it turns out that the open world isn't really intended for you to dump all your time into. The intended gameplay is within missions, and after playing the opening one, I gotta say, I'm glad I started on the open world.\n\nBeing dumped into that world as I was had so much mystery and wonder, trying to work out through text clues why this was an alien world with Earth's animals and environments. Having some dude just explain everything to you really does break the wonder and mystery behind the universe. I had infinitely more fun floundering my way through a forest with nothing but a stone pick in one hand, and my hopes and dreams in the other.\n\nHad I opened with those missions, I'd have given up long, long before I did. If you enjoy these kinds of games, and enjoy learning without a tutorial, skip the missions and play the open world. It's a far more satisfying experience. \n\nThe problem that killed it for me was the apparent lack of Exotics, the end game currency, and the entire reason you're there. From what I've read and experienced, Exotics can only be obtained from missions, which was such an utter and unbelievable disappointment for me that I simply gave up. I'd reached composite armour, with full tier 4 gear, and was level 40 by the time I quit. I was prepping myself for some incredible end game boss or activity, but none came. The bosses I read about in the medals screen turned out to be nothing but sidequests.\n\nSo, yes, I do recommend it, but I have some serious hangups with the design as a whole. I can only recommend it based on the sheer amount of fun I had playing that one open world map, as the missions really did it in for me. While I likely won't come back to the game, I do appreciate the days of missing my friend's messages because I was too engrossed in building pointy sticks to keep the big bad wolves out of my stone huts.", "timestamp_created": 1673077680, "timestamp_updated": 1673077763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786097407341003418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122686021": {"recommendationid": "122686021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118400064", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 814, "last_played": 1690738273}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a interesting game, but idea of starting over every time you are on a new mission is stupid.

The first question I have to ask you is, Do you love yourself?\nBefore you answer that question read this review about this game. I have played this game for hours solo to the point of burning out my soul.\n\nYou start off on planet Icarus, a terraformed planet gone wrong, It might seem like earth, it might feel like earth, but you can't breathe it's air, You'll maybe see two creatures in this game that will not be earthlike but the rest are either earth and maybe one from past earth to get you excited in the game but that's it, everything else is EARTH. The sci fi aspect of this game adds a mysterious zing to it of what you are trying to do on this planet as a prospector who works for a company the story is you basically are offered quest to drop on the planet and build everything from scratch EVERY MISSION every TIME because the planet is brutal and wipes everything else after a certain amount of hours or days.\n\nSo you got that cool base you build? Don't put value into anything that isn't brought down from the planet because if so, anything on built on the planet everytime you start a new mission so forget about sentimental values and attachments. You can only earn them to bring some down to the planet but whats the purpose? To basically help you farm more and more and farm more or kill better etc, gives a bit of help but overall not much.\n\nAt first the graphics are amazing, everything feels fresh and new and the game is a whoa factor for the first few hours, but after you start playing the quest you start to realize that the mission in this game is pretty pointless and uninspiring because you will prospect plants, you will build outpost, you will kill predators, but best of all you will go scout areas out across the same map over over, Go from point A, to B, to C, and then come back to your dinky ship and take off into space knowing that you did a great job for a company you don't know much about to be rewarded with hard earn money to buy items to help you farm more. \n\nThe problem isn't the farming, but the mechanics of everything that will drive you apeshit up the walls, You got some light source like Torch/Lamps? in your hand? Gotta drop it so you can see in caves so you can mine, stay in cave too long? You get pneumonia in your space suit its brutal and sometimes these brutal aspects can be fun but at the same time begs you to question WHY Can't you hold a pickaxe in one hand while attach the light to your waist? and the pneumonia in the spacesuit getting that every cave will drive you insane, its a tough world.\n\nThe talent tree right now is super limited, its understandable how you can't learn everything but at the same time there isn't enough points so you have to build a certain way if you want to excel at something, I basically built a survival weight ore farmer which helps eases my ore farming but everything else was meh, Iam not good at combat so bears tear me apart or I use more materials than most to build my build and outwit the apex predators but at the same time I wish I could put more points in the tree to actually feel good that I built a certain way but I do not and I have created 3 characters level 40+ doing so.\n\nSure the blueprints are cool to glance at first and you realize OH you just have to go up the tree to get to tier 3 or tier 4 or so on but it isn't until you start doing the tier 4 and farm the amount of electronics, coppers, and Epoxy and so on that you really question your sanity, It took me 15 hours to get to tier 4 and exploring 20+ caves to find what I need to find, to make life easier you need to make a lantern, Copper is plentiful but amount needed along with gold makes it a drag when it comes to farming the material, 15+ hours to get what I needed to get to tier 4 just to find out I NEED EVEN MORE OF it for the quest but not only that limited by the time you will rush becuase if the timer reaches zero ROH OH your character is deleted. So do you want to spend time messing around on the planet with tier 4? NOPE NO REASON TO AFTER the quest\n\nAlong with all these you will be hit by bugs and bad optimization, The memory leaks right now are horrendous and because some of the bugs you will see it will drive you up the wall, literally walls that glitches out you can run into, invisible walls that stops you from visiting other parts of the maps, ORES that stick out of the ground only a quarter of the way so you can only get one hit and so on will make you want to Punch your monitor.\n\nSure people are praising the fact that they are adding new stuff everytime new missions weekly and so forth and hotfixes but does it address the balance issue of the game? Does it address the FUN FACTOR? The Quality of life needed?\nNope not as of yet. The missions added and being praised for is nothing new but the same 10+ missions you been doing already for every biome which is Forest, River, Desert and Snow, Nothing to keep you interested or care about your building on the planet at all, the lore is kinda cool that the planet is evolving at a fast pace but until it is seen probably in DLC you are better off waiting for Avatar if you want to see more aliens.\n\nI have played many fun survival, farming, or even grinding games in my life, The forest, Atlas, Ark and so on thousands of hours and even though I sit around and wait to tame a dinosaur I know I had a purpose, this game makes me feel like I have none at all, no real purpose except to work for the company and make them money which is fine but the rewards aren't enough to make me feel satisfied. You might wonder with the amount of time I played on this game 133.7 which is hilarious and purely coincidence that I would recommend it, but I will not because of the sheer amount it takes for a solo player to farm to get to where they are is completely  tedious to the point I wanted to punch my pinky against a coke can sometimes.\n\nSo basically the game is fun if you have friends and I had those friends who played this game at one point I joined in on them, but then they got bored from the missions and farming and moved on and now I am left alone solo again, so Pretty much 95% of the time I soloed the game and didn't bother looking for new friends again, this game is fun if you play it with people for sure but unless the host has a good connection you will feel like you are playing across 56k and go back to solo, you will end up alone one day once everyone decides to move on to the next best survival game.\n\nAt the end of the day you will sit there and wonder to yourself alone on icarus as you look out from the window of your cement building at the snowstorm/thunderstorm or whatever you are doing maybe down a cave somewhere\n\nDo you Love yourself?\n\nI hope this game improves on many aspect of QOL, MISSION, and BALANCE FOR A SOLO player and become a good game because it has great concept but at the same time poorly executed by someone who is bad at math, it was amazing how this game got out of early access as a full release.\n\nI will look forwrad to it and until that happens I cannot recommend you as a solo player to jump into the game no matter how fun it seems at first trust me you will probably off waiting for a bit or if you don't love yourself feel free to grab a copy.\n\nP.S\nIf you read the full review you can easily tell how the walls of my sanity is slowly tearing down. I will probably revisit this game when it gets better in the following week but as of right now I am so burned out, so burned out That I do not want to touch another survival game of this caliber as a solo player.", "timestamp_created": 1640068232, "timestamp_updated": 1640119671, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782991647720336914", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106835357": {"recommendationid": "106835357", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970348244", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2724, "last_played": 1670027596}, "language": "english", "review": "Had 45 hours into a character.

And its really sad because I was really enjoying it. I absolutely loved the crafting and building. So much so that I got my character to level 20 within the first few hours of playing and then spent literally the next 25-30 hours playing in the outpost mode, building and crafting a permanent base. \n\nThe problems with this game are not game play related. If you love survival games, you'll enjoy the game play. The problems with this game are much deeper. The problems start with the updates. Every other day there is a hot fix or patch being put into place. On its face this is good. However, don't think you'll just be able to download a 200 MB patch and you'll be ready to play, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. You download the 200 MB patch and then have to wait anywhere from 20 MINUTES TO 2 HOURS to actually play the game as is patches and reinstalls THE ENTIRE 48GB OF THE GAME. Hope you don't have much going on in your life because if you do, you probably won't have the time for this game. \n\nThis now leads to the BIGGEST GAMEBREAKING BUG I have ever personally encountered. When I started the game, there were three outpast maps available to choose from. Arcwood (forest region), Holdfast (forest region), and Iceholm (snow region). I wanted to just build a forest outpost, chose Holdfast, and went to work. I built a full on castle outpost, just finished putting in a guard house last night. Come to log on this morning and boom. Another update. So I let it go while I'm working thinking I can hop on at lunch and complete the kitchens. I start the game, go to the outpost page, go to select Holdfast....EXCEPT ITS FREAKING LOCKED. Turns out, that only people who purchased the Supporters Edition of the game were supposed to have Holdfast and Iceholm as outpost options! The fact that I had them as options was a bug. I never buy the upgraded versions of games, always the just the base game. I never even look to see what the upgraded versions are offering because its usually just extra cosmetics or some crap like that. HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD ACCESS TO THE OUTPOST THAT I WAS SINKING ALL OF MY TIME INTO?! I NOW HAVE NO OUTPOST, NO PATIENCE, AND NO DESIRE TO CONTINUE PLAYING THIS GAME.

So they asked me the host to reload the save to fix the issues... when I tried to reload the prospect the client crashed... I tried a few more times and it would crash every time I attempted to load.

I have been having a great time and I'm gonna keep playing it for at least a few dozen more hours and I'll honestly pick up the DLC and get even more out of it. I like \"cozy\" games and while this is not is free of challenge, its a very nice experience to play on normal after a long crappy day at work. You can get on for 20 minutes and do nothing and it feels good. You can play for six hours and go, \"Wow, I really accomplished a lot!\"\n\nThe Bad: It can be pretty grindy, resources are sort of finite. The tutorial is threadbare to say the least. I asked my friends questions on how to do things and even they were like, \"I dunno man.\" That is also good though because there is just so much in the game. So either go in with a group of friends, be prepared for a lot of trial and error, or watch a few hours of YouTube videos that can be wildly out of date from a few months ago. The game is not free of bugs and some things are buggier than other (looking at you electric tool). The dedicated servers need help, badly. They have bugs that just don't exist in solo or peer-to-peer play. You will lose so many mounts by falling through the world. Hot tip, when you starting falling, hit F as soon as possible to dismount and it will save your life. There are too many storms and the storms are too punishing to be out in. I do not like the tech and talent tree system, I could write so much more on how they could be better. Make sure you think way ahead before you put points into something. I would recommend going deep into a single combat tree first and then picking another tree to go into. Guns are fun but resource intensive, bow and arrow is very reliable and steady, but after doing both of those for a while I ended up settling on javelins and knives. I use the hunting rifle and shotgun for the \"oh shit\" moments. Don't feel bad about editing your character or save. \n\nThe good: This will run on a potato, yes you'll have to put the graphics to low but honestly it looks pretty good on low. I can play it on my very aged work gaming laptop. The game looks good but the graphics will need some tweaking for your set up. The building is simple but robust, it uses tiles and snapping which I really like. Some people don't like tile/snapping but there are enough bits and options that it really doesn't stifle creation. The combat is fun. It's very simple and basic, but in a way that is nice. You can just fight and you'll come across something that will just mess you up badly but you never feel like it was cheap, you feel like you learned something. The game and loop is engaging and fun. They give you a lot of things to manage but none of them feel unmanageable. It feels like a good \"life simulator\" but for a fun video game. You have to sleep and get up and drink water and prepare food and tend to your animals as the \"work\" part of the game but all that enables you to do the fun parts and the process of the work is fun too. Unless it storming, then you ain't doing shit outside. Honestly, there are so many good things about the game that I could ramble about it for hours. Don't think you need to play multiplayer, some of the most fun I've had is playing at 3:00 AM in my solo play. \n\nI could see why its overall score is mixed. I am not super familiar with the game at launch as I only started playing a few weeks ago. I think that, right now, this game is more than solid and I have no problem recommending it with the only caveat that you need to be willing to look things up and ask questions. It will not be hand-fed to you. The development team is incredibly active on their official Discord and answer questions and talk to the community about what's going to be added next. They do a patch every week which is just crazy and I respect it. Also no microtransactions! You buy the DLC if you like it and want more, perfect business model! If you enjoy what I like to call \"stick-and-rock-games\" you're going to like this. It's not as punishing as Rust, it's not as kiddy as Minecraft, its not as cartooney as Valheim, it's the right blend of all of them.\n\nEDIT: A few weeks have gone by since I have posted this review. They have actually addressed most of the things I gripe about. Resources respawn to a certain extent and there are additional ways to get things. I still think the EXP progression and minimal amount of points you get compared to amount trees/skills is skewed poorly. You grind a ton for levels and barely have enough points.

They add new features and fix issue on a weekly basis, every complaint I had against this game has been fixed or revised. The open worlds have method to earn rewards and perform missions, and the base portion of the game is much more fleshed out. Reaching the high tiers in the crafting tree is rewarding and not nearly as tedious as it once was. Although the map is still spaced out, the mounts are significantly faster than when they first came out, and the Moas make traveling round the map a breeze\n\nPrevious Review: Mechanics are fun at first, but you quickly realize all the missions are walking simulators. You spawn in across the map from the location you have to perform actions at, run there, place the item you were given for the mission, wait 5 mins, run back.  The combat is stale, all the animals have nearly identical AIs, and killing them is not difficult.\n\nEdit for Week 46:\nMoa mount is cool, and is fast, but dies so quickly its almost not worth it. In the long run a speed oriented build makes the player faster on foot. Combat still sucks, on the harder difficulties the levels attempt to overwhelm the player with sheer numbers, having to fight multiple polar bears at once. Usually the easiest solution is to build a platform and kill from there. \n\nIll be back again, but I hope they add an open world survival that includes the ability to complete multiple missions at once.

There's just so much that clearly isn't finished by the devs. A brief list:\n\n- No online matchmaking. There's a \"quick play\" button that's literally just greyed out and does nothing. \n- You can only play with trusted steam friends, because there's zero anti-griefing mechanics or design implemented yet.\n- Game chugs and struggles on the default settings, frequent stutters and gpu lag. Really unoptimized. \n- Purchased off the shelf art assets\n- Lots of missions with balance or goal issues, like grinding for 20 hours to get hundreds of meat 1 at a time.\n- They are still finishing major, core features of the game. Weekly updates might totally change how core gameplay mechanics work ... because the game isn't finished!\n- Game will frequently crash with \"out of video\" memory\n- Backend servers recently had a 5+ hour outage, where no one could save, pause, or quit their game without losing all their progress.\n\nIf you're fine paying $35 for an EA game that's might randomly crash and wipe your progress, or be different week to week, then sure.
