It is probably the closest a game can get to offering true, (somewhat) realistic engineering challenges based on (simplified) physics simulations.\n\nThe game takes place on a planet or moon of choice, each of which have different environmental challenges. The player is deployed to the planet using a drop pod carrying a small set of supplies and finds themself in a rather desolate procedurally generated, voxel based landscape. Immediately, the clock starts to run; Your oxygen and the battery in your space suit will not last that long, so gathering resources and setting up an elementary life support systems is essential.\n\nIt becomes painfully clear that Stationeers fully deserves to be called a \"survival\" game. Unless you're following a detailed guide, failing and dying is almost completely inevitable the first few times you play.\n\nStationeers is a difficult game with a very steep learning curve. However, part of this is remedied by the excellent in-game documentation of all parts and materials.\n\nWhere most other similarly themed games go for a more abstracted, macro approach to things such as life support systems, Stationeers forces you to dive right into the nitty-gritty details of things. There is very little hand-holding as to how things are supposed to be put together. Instead, an impressive array of low-level components can be printed and used to build your own systems.\n\nAutomation is done by designing logic circuits or even using MIPS programming and IC chips. This is by far the most immersive way to include scripting/programming into a game that I have ever seen. As a software engineer by trade, this is one of my favorite aspects of the game.\n\nThe depth and complexity of Stationeers is truly staggering. For this reason the game also has a very steep learning curve; Something that tends to scare away new players, but this depth is undoubtedly reason for the game's very loyal fan base.\n\nThe development process of this early access game has not always been smooth sailing; Technical limitations have gotten in the way of promised and sometimes half-implemented features at times, especially during the early development phase. This has lead to features being removed and the scope of the game getting reduced.\n\nOriginally this game was clearly envisioned as Dean Hall's vision of what Space Engineers could/should have been. This is evident from early design choices and envisioned scope of the game. Earlier version had both static and movable grids, and many pieces meant to build flyable spacecrafts as well as rovers and static bases. However, technical design aspects of the engine that is used for the game made some of these features non-viable.\n\nInstead of stubbornly chasing the original design goals, the team behind Stationeers has never been afraid to scap non-working concepts (like spacecraft, rovers, etc), and instead to focus on adding enormous depth to the well-working parts, namely base/station building and designing, building and automating advanced life-support systems using in-situ resource utilization. In these aspect, Stationeers far surpasses its source of inspiration.\n\nWhile development of the game has felt stagnated in the past, I'm very happy to say that now in 2024, 7 years after the original early access release, development has noticable picked up again. Updates are being released at a steady pace. It is clear that the team listens to what the community wants and at the same time stays true to core principles that make the game great, even when they are widely critisized and challenged.", "timestamp_created": 1711542745, "timestamp_updated": 1711543022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637885510921478271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160282066": {"recommendationid": "160282066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376508063", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 12329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 447, "playtime_at_review": 9217, "last_played": 1713766360}, "language": "english", "review": "Half of the time when your playing with friends is making sure your base is idiot proof.

This is basically a game where you have to survive the elements and build the most sustainable base. Sounds simple, but it's very complex. You have to battle atmospheric conditions such as gravity, pressure, and temperature as they all play a pivotal role on not only your Stationeer but also your base. \n\nStorms such as blizzards on the Europa planet will send temperatures plummeting and fierce winds your way. If you're not already hunkered down in a pressurized base that has temperature control and backup power, you will be swept away in the icy cold winds never to see your base again. The temperatures will quickly drain your battery reserves, and inflict penalties on your suits o2 system. Rooms that are not insulated will be imposed by these real life thermodynamic conditions.\n\nThis game is great for a hardcore science enthusiast with a keen interest in space. But be forewarned, there is a huge learning curve to this game and tutorials are disabled. You can play outdated tutorials by reverting the game to a previous version in steam, but cycling between the two versions forces a 633MB download regardless if you've downloaded these versions before. So ultimately, you're reliant on youtube tutorials and a lot of trial and error. Your first 10-20 hours will be a bit of a struggle as your brain learns to adapt to the games punishing inventory control system and other mechanics.\n\nI stopped playing as I got burnt out after 2 days of long sessions. Again, you're building a base and trying to survive to reach an end goal of building a rocket. There are features of the game that have been disabled or are not finished, like rover vehicles for example. They were causing issues in the game so they've been disabled for who knows how long. Nuclear power isn't a thing yet, despite being able to mine Uranium it doesn't really suit a purpose. Your characters have emotions but their facial reactions are disabled in the game settings, you might become attached to your character and want this. \n\nAll in all, I think this game has great long term potential. Could it survive in development as long as Space Engineers has? I'm not sure. I would hope so, and that the game doesn't become abandoned. There really isn't quite any other games that come as close to this.\n\nA few things that could be improved upon are the inventory management control and in game guides. The inventory management control is very fatiguing and constantly disrupts your ability to become \"situated\". The in game guides are kind of useless, I mostly used them to see what material / item requirements are and what recipes I needed in smelting.

There are large issues that will get in the way of enjoying this game, however there's nothing quite like it.\r\nIf you decide to get the game, note the pause icon in the in game documentation ( F1 ) if you plan to use it for a while.  You're on a timer, especially at the start, and you don't want to run out of oxygen looking up how to build an airlock.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nThe first phase of the game has you in survival mode, where you're running around trying to keep your suit powered and your character fed, all while scrounging for the materials you need to start building up your stockpiles of water, oxygen, food, and power while trying not to burn, freeze, or explode.\r\n\r\nThe second phase puts you in engineering mode, where you setup cryogenics for compressing gas for storage and liquid fuels, using logic to automate farming, solar panel tracking, or topping up your fuel mix.  Once you inevitably slip up your MIPS or logic settings the game throws you back into survival mode where you need to patch the massive hole that used to be your fuel storage put out the fires in your base.\r\n\r\nThe secret boss of the hidden third phase is, of course, learning and (mis)applying MIPS, the less understandable cousin of FORTRANs that offers less job prospects.  Hope you like branch statements and managing registers\r\n\r\nCons\r\nOptimization leaves a bit to be desired, but I think most should be able to play it without slowdowns.  If you play on a world with storms you can expect your GPU to periodically act as a space heater.\r\n\r\nInventory management is terrible, scroll wheel to cycle which slot you're targetting, or hold alt while drag/dropping.  Opening or closing anything with an inventory will randomly shift which slot and/or inventory you are targetting, making it so you have to hunt your selector down again.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is terrible.  Mechanics are frequently undocumented, or the documentation is painfully out of date.  This goes for n-game help, the official wiki, and since mechanics tend to be tweaked after the initial release, player made guides as well.\r\n\r\nIn addition to lack of documentation and existing documentation becoming outdated as mechanics are expanded and changed, there are no tutorials any more.  There used to be, but they broke years ago and haven't been prioritized.  The studio's attitude appears to be to focus on mechanics and let the players figure it out and share among themselves.  Sometimes they'll drop in with clarification on their discord  with information that'll never be added into the in game wiki. You'll need to sleuth through discord for up to date information, but on the other hand the game is still being developed and I have enjoyed the additional complexity and mechanics that have been added over the years.\r\n\r\n\r\nPros\r\nThe game's decent looking, usually.  You don't have too many options for aesthetics when it comes to functional objects like walls and frames, but what's there can be made to look pretty nice.  Everything casts shadows against your lights, and while sometimes the pitch black shadows at night can be annoying it looks great and you can always add more lights assuming you can power them.  The worlds themselves are bit dull but it's not worldneers.  Most outside interaction can be automated away with various miners.\r\n\r\nIt is surprisingly immersive.  The inventory management embodies the feeling of juggling a bunch of tools and parts while you assemble your space-IKEA appliances.  A lot of items present their information on in game screens like tablets and laptops you keep in your hands or computers and consoles you place in the world.  [i]Most[/i] of the time the absence of quality of life features actually help encourage you to play it as a problem solving game.  Inventory management's still awful though.\r\n\r\nThe game tends to give you multiple ways to handle challenges, each with their own benefits and trade offs. \r\n On top of that your choice of world will change how viable each option becomes.  You can manually mine materials, but probably not on Venus if you want to live.  Dig into bedrock for a random ore mix, but will be missing the gas and ices you could get if you're on a vacuum planet.  Setup and periodically shuffle strip miners, send rockets into space to gather ore and ice from asteroids, or call down traders and exchange renewables for them.  For power you have static solar panels and dynamic solar tracking, wind power if there's an atmosphere, coal or renewable charcoal generators, gaseous fuel generators, turbines to take advantage of pressure changes, and sterling engines to take advantage of temperature changes.\r\n\r\nAlmost every aspect have these tiny annoyances that add up to encourage more and more automation and problem solving.  The first you'll probably run into are with sheets, you need a lot for walls and frames but the autolathe's slow and spits them out into the world one at a time.  If it outputs more than a couple they'll start to get thrown everywhere as they run out of room.

But it is [b]so[/b] rewarding.\n\n[h1]What is this game about?[/h1]\n\nStationeers is about building your own base including all systems and surviving the harsh environment of space (as well as surviving your own mistakes).\n\nWhether you've managed to set up a working airlock or succeeded in making your first solar panels auto-track the sun position (for more efficient power generation!), it provides you with a unique sense of accomplishment and satisfaction only rarely found in gaming. \n\nTo give you an idea of what the above entails, you will not only need to place the basic components (such as airlock doors, vents, consoles) but also set up your wiring and design a working pipe system to support your airlock and pressurisation system. And those are just the basics. \n\nLong-term goals include things like air filtration systems for your base, where you will need to figure out how to set up a network of vents, filters, wires and pipes (thankfully you can colour and label them though!) to keep your air breathable. \n\nIt is currently much more base building and survival than exploration, but this may change during the course of early access.\n\n\n[h1] Is this similar to...[/h1]\n\n[b][u] Space Engineers? [/u][/b]\nThe building and systems are more complex than Space Engineers. A good comparison is thrusters. In Space Engineers, you can put a thruster on blocks, add power and you're pretty much good to go. In this game, you're installing the fuel pipelines and mixtures going to the thrusters.\nCurrently, there is less exploration and less external threats (like space bugs) than Space Engineers.\n\n[b][u] Minecraft tech mods)[/u][/b]\nIf Minecraft mod packs like Beastcraft or tekkit and the challenge of building complex processes appeal to you, you will probably like Stationeers. Keep in mind that those will currently have way more content available compared to Stationeers, but one is new, the other isn't. Stationeers [i]is[/i] being designed with modding in mind though.\n\n[b][u] Space Station 13? [/u][/b]\nThe game is heavily inspired by Space Station 13 mechanics, and many of the early testers were from the SS13 community. There is no rounds or similar though, and currently the game is entirely co-operative. Does not have clowns (yet).\n\n[b][u] Astroneer? [/u][/b]\nIt may have a similar aesthetic, but they are quite different in gameplay. Astroneer is fairly simple in its mechanics when compared to Stationeers, especially when it comes to base-building. Stationeers may be deceptively cute in this regard. From what I have gathered, the art style was chosen for quick iteration and ability to add content. Astroneer currently does exploration much better than Stationeers.\n\n\n[h1]Early Access & Issues you may have[/h1]\n\nAs of this review, the game hasn't even been out in early access for more than a week. The updates so far have been quick and responsive. The devs have clearly taken a good look at examples of early access well done (such as RimWorld and Oxygen Not Included). They are also very active on the official Discord server. If the direction and game loop change during the course of early access, I will update this review accordingly.\n\nDo not be deterred by the inventory system. It is [i]different[/i] to the bog-standard survival game inventory you see in countless other games these days. It may not be as accessible for newcomers and seem clunky at first, but you'll be breezing through it in no time. It is quite fast once you get the hang of it.\n\nThe game also does not do a lot of teaching in its current state, although there is a very basic tutorial. I personally enjoy finding out about mechanics and properties of items myself, but some people may be put off by the lack of hand-holding. \n\nPerformance has been fantastic so far, both in single player and multiplayer settings. Dedicated servers do have issues right now so if you're planning on playing with friends, hosting it yourself seems to be the better option right now.\n\nReady to jump in?

If they didn't, they'd just put out more dlcs or small easy to make content updates. It seems like they have a vision for the game and decided that to achieve that vision they needed to go back and rework a lot of the core systems on the game to get the performance they wanted.

And if you have that itch, absolutely get it.\n\nFirst up, fit and finish. The game is extremely polished for an in-development game. I've never crashed a single time. There are still some bugs with collision and physics, and don't rely on the autosave- an airlock may jam if you load a save in the middle of it cycling, for example. But otherwise, the experience is smooth.\n\nOn to the mechanics- and this game is all about the mechanics. This is a game that, while somewhat obtuse in many ways, is honestly extremely fair. Every system is complex but understandable, punishing but fair. If something went wrong, chances are it's you who neglected to consider something, or plain forgot about it. Anything is possible with the proper planning and some creativity. Planning mostly, though.\n\nThe main systems to consider are power, temperature, atmosphere, and food. Each of these has to be carefully managed, but all of them eventually become sustainable with the right infrastructure in place.\n\nThe planets themselves are set up so that they put varying amounts of stress on each system. Mars, for example, has a CO2-heavy atmosphere, which makes starting a farm easy, and stays within a relatively comfortable temperature range. The Moon has no atmosphere, but solar power is plentiful and easy to optimize. Europa is freezing and has little solar energy, putting massive strain on batteries. Vulcan is a blasted hellscape with punishing temperatures that will literally melt the things out of your hands- ask me how I know.\n\nBut this lets you learn through trial and error, while never feeling that you're thrown into something too deep without adequate preparation. Learning the ropes on Mars, setting up an airtight base on the Moon, before optimizing power production and usage on Europa, then finally attempting Vulcan.\n\nSpeaking of Vulcan, here's how my experience went:\n\n--- Vulcan, attempt 1\nDay 1: This isn't too bad\nDay 1: Arc welder melts in my hands\nDay 1: I can't weld up a tool manufactory to make another\n\n--- Vulcan, attempt 2\nDay 1: Remember to stow away the welder once I'm done\nDay 3: Where's my mining drill gone?\nDay 3: What's up with this weird solar angle anyway?\nDay 4: Accidentally dropped battery, cooked alive inside suit\n\n--- Vulcan, attempt 3\nDay 1: Don't put anything important in hands unless it's at night\nDay 2: Mine with the drill only at night, pickaxe in the day because it doesn't melt\nDay 4: Things are going well, airtight base coming along nicely\nDay 6: Oxygen tank heats up, reaches 10MPa and explodes, taking out the entire lander with it\nDay 6: Confirm previous findings that humans cannot breathe CO2\n\n10/10 would reattempt to colonize hellscape.", "timestamp_created": 1601673196, "timestamp_updated": 1601673196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.844016194343566895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117454346": {"recommendationid": "117454346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008425877", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 119446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "playtime_at_review": 88691, "last_played": 1713024294}, "language": "english", "review": "Facts:\n1. I've sunk a lot of hours into this game.\n2. Dedicated Servers have had major desync issues.\n3. Refactor really slowed major changes to the game over the last year.\n\nNow for personal opinions:\nPros:\n1. The game is a fun space station simulation.\n2. The refactor shows a huge commitment to the game!\n3. Team admitted old net code was handcuffing development, so they invested time to fix it!\n4. They keep fixing bugs post refactor.\n5. Best Space Station simulator out there!\n6. Game create fun opportunity to solve various engineering issues!\n7. If you like creating automated systems to survive, this will be a great game for you!\n\nCons:\n1. Multiplayer is STILL a bit rough\n2. Unable to stay alive offline on dedicated servers, (You always seem to end up dead)\n3. Desync still happens, but not enough hours spent on refactor to tell how bad yet.\n4. Once you get you base livable, there is not much else to do.\n5. Lack of mission system or extra objectives outside of getting a survivable base.\n6. No real advantage to take off your suit other than to eat.\n     - Once you get a 1x1 room temp controlled with O2, you can survive pretty much forever.  You need anotehr small room to grow food, and thaw ice water, but really that's all you need to survive.  I wish there was more purpose to getting a bigger atmosphere controlled base other than bragging rights.\n\nSummary: The game has been a lot of fun.  There's no real purpose other than to survive.  If you have friends who share this interest, its very fun watching them blow up or create engineering issues you need to help them fix.  I wish there were more random things to do, and the economy system feels sort of broken at the moment.  I feel like this is a game that has 75% of an engineering conceptual game complete, which in and of itself is a great makings for a good game.  It would be nice to get some other mission system like a repair and rescue, or some base gets \"dropped\" onto the planet with various broken or engineering flaws that you need to go fix for some form of reward.\n\nAlso, public servers need some sort of land claim to protect your area from being dismantled by new engineers.

Don't get me wrong, the game is actually very fun, but I have to drop it every time I play it because something completely breaks my game and takes away all the fun. \n\nFor example, there's a 3 year old bug about random cell on Mars just superheating out of nowhere (and heat no dissipating, the cell just maintains +500C degree temperature differential with surroundings). If you are unlucky (as I was) this cell happens to manifest on an empty place inside of your base burning everything around it. \n\nOr, there's another 4 year old bug where sometimes 90% of Ores just stop rendering. When you come within 1 meter - they re-appear. No restarts or settings adjustments seem to fix it, you just have to start a new game at this point.\n\nAs about useless features - about a year (maybe two) ago devs added separation of liquids from gases. Which kind of makes sense for realism I guess. To this day there's only one liquid - water, and it flows through liquid pipes no matter if it's at -200C or at +1000C. \n\nOr there are rockets, which go and mine asteroids with zero supervision.

I'm a filthy addict, and the developers know it. I've just now finally gotten around to writing a review. \n\nStationeers is the culmination of everything I've ever wanted to see in a STEM video game, and it's still just in its infancy. I have high hopes for its future and have complete trust in these developers that they will not disappoint. \n\nMathematics. Engineering. Chemistry. Physics. Biology. It all comes into play in one form or another. It\u2019s problem solving and learning science at its best. IN SPACE. It even allows you to gain a better grasp on Celsius, Kelvin, and Pascal\u2019s if these units were once foreign to you.\n\nNot only does Stationeers allow you to be crazy creative with base building, but you have to do it in a way that both works and is practical, yet it still allows you plenty of freedom to create something that is beautiful and stunningly complex. You must create systems that enable your character to survive in the desolate environments of life-hating moons & planets\u2026..and one of the beauties is that you can even work with friends to figure all of this stuff out.\n\nThe learning curve is harsh, this game is not for casuals. Things can catch fire, they can blow up, you can suffocate from lack of power or oxygen, or a rip in your suit\u2026you can even get shot 100\u2019s of meters away from a pipe bursting in your face, but the immense reward and pride you feel from successfully solving a problem, automating a system, or figuring out how to create elements which provide long term survival is unlike any other joy I\u2019ve found from a game\u2026.. \n\nDesigning and building is ridiculously immersive, every different task involves different tools in your hands and different orders of operations\u2026 you begin to feel like an actual astronaut engineering something in space... It\u2019s difficult at first, you may even hate it. Hell, a lot of players will be turned off by the control scheme entirely\u2026. but if you actually give the game the proper time that it deserves, the controls will become second nature and you will actually enjoy them. They force you to actually think which tool you have to use and which order you should drop things on the ground, switch hands, grab something from your toolbelt/backpack, ect. By the time you\u2019ve learned just 10% of what Stationeers has to offer, the control logistics of completing a task as quickly and efficiently as possible will soon be no problem at all.\n\nThe reason the controls are difficult is because the game is difficult, because being an actual astronaut is difficult. Repairing the Hubble Space Telescope while orbiting around the earth at 17,500 mph without gravity and nearly zero dexterity in your football-pressurized EVA gloves is also difficult\u2026... Stationeers does not shy away from this fact, I find this mirrored real-life element that much more immersive.\n\nI\u2019ve built an immense underground base on the moon. It\u2019s fully pressurized and automated at a 70% Nitrogen 30% Oxygen mix, and climate controlled at 20C. The systems I\u2019ve built in the following list were immensely rewarding to design, it took a lot of learning, re-designing, and problem solving to get working correctly, and are all possible without this game even being in a near-completed state. Automated hydroponics, chicken hatchery, manufacturing, smelting+furnace rooms, crew quarters, medbay, battery banks, atmospheric access tunnels, solar arrays, backup power generation, landing zone+ground support equipment for spaceships, and even a laser tag arena. The only thing you are limited to is your imagination.\n\nNext thing I have to talk about is the community and the developers. Stationeers is still fairly new, but the community is already very rich and supportive. If you have a question or are looking for others to play with, all you have to do is hop on over to their discord and ask, you will quickly make friends and everyone is very helpful. Don\u2019t know how the logic system works? Just ask. Having trouble with atmospherics? Just ask. Wires keep melting and you can\u2019t figure out why? Just ask.\n\nThe developers of Stationeers are among the greats. Never have I ever experienced Devs that are only an arm\u2019s length away, or this active and caring within a game community. Have an issue with the game? Let them know and they will help. Found a bug? Let them know and they\u2019ll get it fixed as fast as they can. Have an idea that you think will make the game better? Let them know\u2026If it\u2019s good they\u2019ll add it to the game. You can tell they take great pride in their work and what the future of this game holds. \n\nStationeers is the game I\u2019ve been waiting for\u2026which I didn\u2019t even know I wanted, and it\u2019s still in its infancy. The features and systems to come hold exciting potential and I can\u2019t wait to see what the developers come up with next.\n\n\nSidenote: You can find my underground Moon base on the workshop, and I also stream this game frequently on Twitch at https://www.Twitch.tv/Masoneer\n\n2nd Sidenote: @developers Please eat this review, I hope it sustains you as well as Stationeer potatoes :P", "timestamp_created": 1524519218, "timestamp_updated": 1524520124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826576411724090576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39358776": {"recommendationid": "39358776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009498288", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3428, "last_played": 1679046254}, "language": "english", "review": "First steam review, but felt the need to give my views on this one.\n\nThis is also the first time I've been willing to drop cash on an EA title.\n\n1 - Preliminaries\n\nRight off the bat, if you're going to use DayZ or any other failed EA title as justification to not support the dev right now, stop reading here cos nothing I can say on that will change your mind. All I'll point out is that there are also examples of EA titles that got it right. Don't Starve, Subnautica, Prison Architect, KSP......\n\n2 - Gameplay\n\nI can describe this game in 2 ways. Firstly, it's a relistic physics engine with a survival (or sandbox) base building game built around it. And, although there are still some inacurracies on the science, theres a lot of things present that make for some damn interesting gameplay. A couple of examples from some of my failed starts - I still keep forgetting that it's a vacuum outside my front door and ripping walls off to rewire stuff without thinking, and then wondering where my air went. Also, it's a sealed unit INSIDE my base. So, it's gonna keep getting hotter till I cool it down. If you don't realise this till you've already hit 100 degrees air temperature, that's a bit of a problem. Also, never ever ever decide a good way to melt frozen hydrogen is to bring it inside your base and hold a welding torch to it. It goes boom. And then it ignites the air. The slightest detail overlooked during base design and you're screwed. So, definitely not for the easily frustrated or those that hate starting again.\nAnother, simpler, way to describe this game would be \"You remember when Minecraft first came out, before all the 5 year olds got their hands on it and it was a pretty interesting exploration/building game? Well, remember how it got really boring till things like Tekkit came out and added all those fabrication machines and stuff? Well, this is like that, only for adults who like building really intricate systems and going 'I wonder if i can make it do this....' and messing with logic and switches and air pressure and explosives\". It's kinda like what I always wished Minecraft could provide. You can't ride out the first 12 nights while you lay out the foundation for a huge castle. You NEED something up within the first 2 nights to get power. You NEED to start with a very small space and get it pressurised and then build outwards. You need to think ahead, cos reworking your base isn't as simple as just getting the axe out again, and it's very easy to lock yourself out of your own airlock forever. And you sure as hell need a LOT of iron.\n\n3 - Controls\n\nFlicking through the reviews, the controls seem to be a big gripe. They're very odd to start with (E change active hand, F move from slot to active hand, O turn things on) but after a couple of hours you'll stop accidentally dropping your wrench and after about 10 they'll feel natural. I still occasionally end up pressing E instead of F and wondering why I can't find my wire cutters anymore, but then I occasionally mispress on most games anyway, it happens. Controls can be refined as the dev proccess moves on, but for now they let you do everything you need to in a fairly intuative way and that's the main thing. My first thought was \"I wonder if a controller would help\" but after messing around with a few bindings, no, no it didn't. Might do for you though, so could be worth a shot.\n\n4 - Graphics\n\nVoxel terrain. Hills. Massive craters. Tiny holes in the surface that turn out to be holes to the centre of the moon (much fun when you're out of jetpack fuel. Again, think ahead. No point building an awesome atmospherics system if you forget you're going to want to take gas OUT of it as well). To be honest, the terrain is kinda dull, little to no landmarks and boy is it easy to get lost. But, I'm on a moon. That's kinda what I imagine moons are like. A whole lot of nothing, occasional pockets of minerals, sometimes an odd shaped hill. And no air. Very important to remember that fact. There is no air outside.\n\n5 - Multiplayer\n\nCan't comment. Haven't played, don't want to play yet because I'm only just at the point where I kinda know how to automate solar, get a furnace up and sort out my air, I haven't yet been able to do it consistently without any \"Oh ****\" moments, and the furnace still terrifies me. It WILL either blow up (taking most of the room with it, causing explosive decompression and flinging you halfway accross the moon with no life support battery and a broken helmet. Yay hydrogen), pump out so much pressure that the pipes explode (likewise, big boom, many fire, \"Why am I now outside?\" \"Spacesuit Damaged. Pressure Critical. Power Critical. Oxygen Critical\") or, in the unlikely event you remember to set it up right and it gives you some lovely steel and solder (so you can actually stabilise your power network), you forget about the aforementioned closed system inside your base and it heats up the air to 2000+ degrees so that as you open the airlock after a long days mining you hear \"Temperature critical\".\nCourse, not blowing everything up (or, for my most recent failure, pumping so much air into a room you blow the walls off with the pressure) might be much easier with a couple of people. Then again, I'd be pretty wound up if halfway through programming the logic on 6 solar panels some fool blew up the base. Who knows. Depends on your preferences I suppose\n\n6 - Sound\n\nPretty spacey. I occassionally wonder if my speakers have died while I'm out mining till I remember duh, vacuum, no sound. Nothing special, but no glaring faults I've spotted either. Something the devs want to consider is voicepacks. I'm normally against microtransactions, but tbh I'd happilly pay like a fiver to have, say, TotalBiscuit as my suit voice. I'd much prefer a sarcastic cynical brit in my ear when things go wrong than annoying robotic suit lady. OFC, to keep within the whole realistic thing, I'd still have to actually craft the chip to put in my suit in game. But meh\n\n7 - Summary / TL;DR\n\nFor an EA title, lots of content. I didn't know I was almost at 50 hours till I went to write this, and I've only had the game a week. And I'm in the final year of my degree, so that should tell you just how little free time I have, and it's all apparently gone on Stationeers. 50 hours and I'm still not sure exactly how a lot of the stuff works, and I'm only just at the point where I can get something up and full of air relatively quickly without issue. Course, doing anything other than a 3x3 box with air in it is where things start to get interesting. No idea how I'm gonna separate all of my gasses into tanks and be able to fill canisters with the individual types AND pump a 2/1 H/O2 mix into my furnace without blowing everything up. Probably a guide somewhere, but wheres the fun in that.\n\nIf you don't mind taking a punt on an EA title that already has a tonne for you to do and, from the looks of things, will add new stuff fairly frequently, and you enjoyed the technical mods on Minecraft (or, rather, were excited about their potential till you saw they were still quite limited systems), or you like space, or like survivally/buildery type games, and don't mind occasionally getting things terribly wrong, destroying 8 hours work and realising you hadn't saved for 3 hours, give it a go.\n\n13/10 would do favourable rambling review again. Excited to see where the game goes dev wise, and looking forward to some awesome new content and systems.

The critical reviews for this game are missing a big piece to the puzzle, so hopefully [b]MY[/b] review can add some perspective to help others understand what this game actually is.\n\n[h1]Developer History:[/h1]\nTo understand Stationeers, you have to understand the guy making it: Dean \"Rocket\" Hall. Rocket is the man behind the popular ARMA mod: DayZ. Rocket began developing the DayZ mod as a side-project while he was working for Bohemia Interactive, when suddenly it went viral. DayZ had so much momentum that Bohemia Interactive allowed Rocket to work on it full-time. Soon, more resources were added to the project and Bohemia began working towards taking the mod and building it into a stand-alone game. I was playing DayZ around the time that the stand-alone version was released. I distinctly remember some of the game's new content and mechanics had felt very familiar to a BYOND game called Space Station 13, which I have been playing on-and-off for years. As it turned out, Rocket was a huge Space Station 13 fan and he was actively playing SS13 when he wasn't working on DayZ. Not too long after that, Rocket left Bohemia Interactive to found his own development studio: RocketWerkz. When I first saw Stationeers on Steam, I knew right away what this game was: Rocket is trying to create a modern Space Station 13.\n\n[h1]Space Station 13 (SS13):[/h1]\nIf you are trying to measure Stationeers, you have to measure it against Space Station 13. SS13 is a 2D top-down multiplayer roleplaying game that has been around since the early 2000's. It is a community-developed game which is free to play and still has a healthy player base, despite being built using the BYOND engine. BYOND is a horrible 2D game engine that was created with the goal of making multiplayer game development easy for every-day folk back in the early 2000's. As a game, SS13 boasts an incredible amount of depth and a lot of realism. The gameplay experience is unique and like nothing else out there. The only problem with SS13 is that it is stuck on a crappy and outdated game engine. Over the years many people have tried to do a Space Station 13 remake, but none of the projects ever panned out. Stationeers is Rocket's passion project to finally bring us the 3D Space Station 13 remake many eager fans (myself included) have all been hoping for.\n\nSpace Station 13 features a unique mode of play, and I can see it all over Rocket's roadmap for Stationeers. It is played in 30-60 minute long rounds which usually end when the surviving players call an escape shuttle to evacuate the station. When a round begins, all players are spawned into the game and assigned a job. There are a variety of jobs available and each job has different access levels, equipment, and responsibilities. Some examples would be: Janitor, Security Officer, Captain, Head of Personnel, Chef, Botanist, Quartermaster, Medical Doctor, Staff Assistant, etc.. Each round, a few players are selected to be antagonists and are given a special role with special goals. To mix things up, there are different types of antagonist roles and nobody knows who might be an antagonist or even what the antagonist might be for the given round. The whole game takes place on a realistic working space station. The game simulates electricity, atmospherics, and also includes a really cool medical system. Most of the jobs have a staggering amount of depth and it can take hours of gameplay to master some of them.\n\n[h1]Here is my point:[/h1]\nStationeers may seem like a space building / survival game, but it is likely to evolve into something that can also be played like Space Station 13. Instead of building a space station from the ground up, imagine spawning in the hydroponics lab of a fully-constructed realistic working space station as a botanist. While working on growing a hybrid tomato plant that has medicinal properties, you are blown across the room by a sudden explosion and are badly wounded. You lose consciousness as the room starts to depressurize, but someone grabs you and drags you down to medbay. You wake up on a surgery table to a doctor removing shrapnel from your torso while another doctor injects you with healing chemicals. Meanwhile engineers are making repairs to the botany lab and working to restore oxygen / power to the explosion site. Security is running around trying to find your fellow botanist who has mysteriously gone missing, they REALLY want to have a chat with him. Was he a traitor who tried to assassinate you with a hidden pipe bomb? or perhaps he was the target and you were just an innocent bystander who got caught in the blast? If you feel like Stationeers gameplay lacks direction: it's probably because Rocket is developing this realistic space station simulator which he can use to build his SS13 remake on top of. Space Station 13 was originally an atmospherics simulator, who's source code was stolen and modified to include the multiplayer gameplay layered on top.\n\n[h1]My Opinion on Stationeers:[/h1]\nI'm impressed. This game is very true to Space Station 13, and actually has a real shot at bringing SS13 and all of it's depth into a modern engine. I really want this to succeed, and I think Rocket has the motivation to do it. New features keep rolling in, but it will be a long road. Some of the other reviews I have read complain about the inventory system being clumsy, but it was designed to accommodate for the massive number of different items and interactions that are likely to come. Other reviews complain about how you run out of things to do once you've built a space station, but that is likely to change when Rocket starts working on the round-based features. I expect a variety of gameplay modes to come which will give purpose to the game.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1]\nI hope this review has provided some better context to anyone who doesn't know some of the history leading up to this game.

For now it's pretty much build as you please, and once you are done. Unless your OCD drives you nuts and you have a great idea of how to make a better design of a base. You'll hit a wall and realize that there's a lack of need to building all this stuff. It's cool. But the fun is building it, once you have it. You'll be left wanting something to do with it.\n\nStill, I can't downvote a game I put 80 hours in. But it's a bit of a let down once you reach \"mid/late game\". Also performance takes a bit of a nosedive once you have a base of any decent size. \n\nPerfect game for people who just want to build insane structures and have fun writing logic scripts. But if you aren't the most creative person and will be satisfied once you've reach equilibrium with the environment. You'll probably get 'bored' once you get there.

This game gives a fun immersive feeling of being a 'space engineer' who has to \"science the sh*t\" out of everything in order to survive and prosper on a foreign planet. The gameplay involves a lot of engaging problem solving that requires logical thinking, experimentation, and some knowledge of basic physics in order to build various machines/structures, configure them, and then interconnect them in various ways to build a functional terrestrial space station. The tasks performed in the game cover multiple disciplines, including: structure construction, item/machine manufacturing (including mining/smelting/fabrication), farming and food management, character health/equipment maintenance, power network management, atmospherics management (including gas/liquid networks), and automation/logic programming (including a basic-to-intermediate option and an advanced option using real MIPS programming), In summary, the gameplay is focused on designing systems and applying engineering principles in a space survival scenario.\n\n- The game UI and inventory management scheme (including the simulation of \u2018left hand\u2019 vs \u2018right hand\u2019 on your character) is very different from other games I\u2019ve played and can feel like a lot of clicking at times, but I was able to quickly adapt to it and to me is not as bad as other reviews have made it sound. While I do think that improvements can be made to the UI and inventory management, I also appreciate the fact that devs decided to try something that feels unique and semi-realistic.\n\n- In my first 50 hours (in which I\u2019ve built a small and simple base) I have only encountered one bug related to object interaction but was able to easily work around it. I haven\u2019t encountered any crashes, game-breaking bugs, or significant performance issues.\n\n- The attention given to the game by the devs. The major code refactor completed recently is proof of the devs dedication to further development. I look forward to seeing what future updates will bring to the gameplay experience.\n\n- The fact that the game is designed to take advantage of multi-core CPUs and high-end GPUs. It helps to justify the money I've spent on my PC hardware, and it also means that the game can simulate more things over time without killing performance.\n\n- The in-game Stationpedia and third-party wiki website are nice resources to learn the many complexities of the game, but the extremely active and helpful Discord community takes the learning experience to another level.\n\n- The satisfying educational conversations that I've had with my two young daughters after they see me playing the game and ask me questions about what I am doing and why. The younger one likes to sit on my lap and assist with basic tasks, and the older one (who loves science) is interested in playing multiplayer with me.\n\nMy appreciation of this game has led me to submit this review and to purchase all of the DLC currently available. I decided to do this because I want to see the devs take Stationeers as far as it can go, and also because I generally support the development of games that are based on STEM principles.", "timestamp_created": 1659907263, "timestamp_updated": 1660029330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776763081550598145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42090476": {"recommendationid": "42090476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089108933", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1813, "last_played": 1683485686}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: The QWOP-like controls spoil it all.\n\nThis game shows a lot of promise and gets many things right. For example, logic elements. Huge potential for automation and creativity! Gases and pressure are another awesome feature. I had waited for a hardcore and realistic sandbox like this one for a long time.\n\nDespite all that, my overall experience with this game is negative, and here is why.\n\nThe amount of motions you have to go through to make your character do even the simplest operations is unbearable. Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining that you have to craft and build everything from scratch, little by little. It's not that. Mostly it's the inventory management and what I would call \"hands management\".\n\nA couple of examples.\n\n1) Welding up iron frames. First, empty your hands. You must put the frames in one hand and welder in the other. If the frames are in a container or on the ground, you are lucky, you can pick them up in a single click. If not and they are in your inventory, you must press [3] or [4] or [5] to open the inventory for the piece of your gear where they are stored. Then scroll to select the correct item. Press [F] to put that item in your active hand. [E] to select the other hand. Now press [5] to open the toolbelt (you've got it on you, right? if not, that's another wall of text like this one). Scroll to select this time the welder. Press [F] again to put the welder into your selected hand. Press [O] to turn the welder on.\n\nThis one was easy. Now the real stuff:\n\n2) Replacing the ROM cartriges in your tablet (the concept itself is fantastic, by the way). Once again, empty your hands, you will need them both. [3] to open your backpack. Scroll to the tablet. [F] to take it in your hand. [R] to open the tablet's inventory (that's right, the TABLET'S INVENTORY). Mouse wheel to select the cartrige slot. [E] to switch to the free hand. [F] to take the cartrige out of the tablet and into the free hand. [3] to open the backpack. Mouse wheel to scroll to a new cartrige in your backpack (if it's stored somewhere else, that's a whole new piano party). Press [F] to [i]swap[/i] the contents of that backpack cell and your selected hand, putting away the old cartrige and taking the new one into your hand. [E] to switch to the hand with the tablet. [R] to open tablet's inventory. Scroll to the cartrige slot. [E] to switch hands again. [F] to swap the contents of the tablet's cartrige slot with what you are holding in the selected hand. (Optional) a few more key presses to put away the old cartrige. Finally, press [O] to turn on the tablet and use the newly installed software (the battery better not be dead, replacing it is just as laborious).\n\nHow do you like THAT? That's some QWOP action right there!\n\nI know, I know, realism and all, but I think in this case it's a little too much. Or not a little. The constant hassle of getting the right tools and materials in and out of your hands bugs you and slows down the pace of the game so much that it becomes uneventful and kind of boring. Yes, awesome features await you once you get established: programmable solar arrays and airlocks, pipes, pumps, valves, gas mixing, farms, greenhouses, even ships! But everything is sooo slooow to build and adjust -- and not for any in-game reason.\n\nLast time I found myself burnt out on this game having barely constructed the first enclosed room and an airlock.

If you hadn't played Space Station 13, you'd never possibly know. But if you have, you'd instantly see what I mean. The way the interface that requires you to switch from one hand to another, the HUD (a nearly exact copy, updated for clarity and to make sense), the overly realistic atmospherics and electricity, the double-layering of foundation and wall.\nI think this is a particular sensibility that displays throughout the game design and implementation. To be clear - this game isn't Space Station 13 - and it's never intended to be.

There's no middle ground. It has a very high learning curve. You either stick with it, try things and - over time - learn the ropes, or you give up on it rather quickly, due to the sheer complexity and possibilities it gives into your hand.\n\nI'm a \"veteran\" in survival and building games (ARK, Space Engineers etc.), so I'm used to intricate complexities - but this one takes the cake in that department. The sheer possibilities you can make and break things are astonishing.\nLike, you can even install a programmable chip into your space suit, that you can run a self-coded/pre-programmed script on to automate things with/on/in your spacesuit! How cool is that?!?\n\nThe main thing in this game to \u201c make stuff\u201d, \u201chave fun\u201d with it and how far you can \u201cgo with it\u201d at this point in the stage. The detailed physics/gas simulation (air mixtures are key to live and your plants to grow) is pretty complex. So are the logic-systems built into this game. It isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s for a rather narrow audience for whom experimenting/meddling things to make them work is a sort of Zen. who get a sense of accomplishment to have designed/built a \u2018system\u2019 that actually makes/does a desired thing. It can frustrate you rather quickly. You need to have perseverance to learn the ropes to be able to actually enjoy this \u2018game\u2019. \n\nMy suggestion is, in your first couple hundred hours, you use the Creative Mode to spawn your items you need to assemble/program/configure your systems as you see fit to make them work for you. So you get a hang on them. Otherwise it\u2019ll frustrate you too fast and drive you away from this interesting gem of \u2018engineering\u2019.\n\nThe survival aspect is an added bonus to give you a reason to actually do/make things, so that those things do/make things FOR you.\nI daresay it could be used to get kids into the STEM fields, or as a sort of \u201cis STEM for me?\u201d type of test-bed simulator. It can be a lot of fun in multiplayer together - providing you\u2019ve like-minded, adventurous spirits who also love to try things out.\nCurrently there\u2019s not much to explore in terms of geography/locations/missions other than the harsh conditions of your world/environment, which varies by the world and how drastic effects it can have on your previously on other worlds successfully working systems.\n\nI can see where the Dev-Team is heading with this, which is why I bought-in early: a sort of multiplayer adventurous experience sandbox, where things can go wrong (or right) in most unexpected and surprising ways.\n\n[b]My suggestion to the Devs is: enable at some point a toggle in the game\u2019s settings, that enables/disables \u2018prefabbed\u2019 modules (i.e. Solar Tracker IC-logics, pre-programmed/-fabbed air-filtration systems etc) to implement designs/systems/scripts that are on the essentials list for the not-so-engineering-aptitude-minded players. I believe that\u2019d open the game to more people, and frustrate less people away in the first few hours, dying w/o knowing why and how they died.[/b]\n", "timestamp_created": 1571481889, "timestamp_updated": 1571481889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757608175277709961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49161614": {"recommendationid": "49161614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198822982338", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 25609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22209, "last_played": 1574875829}, "language": "english", "review": "I was initially put off by the negative reviews about this game. I eventually decided to purchase regardless. And i'm glad i did.\nOver 300 hours in i thought it deserved a review of my own. \nI was looking for a mars based space station building game with resource management and this ticked all the boxes for me in that respect. What came after that was a sometimes complex set of engineering procedures to sustain my life on said planet. This is where it goes beyond the base building. You've got to make it work. I understand a few fundamentals of logic and physics, this is not necessary but it helps. There is a great community and youtube to help you if you do get stuck. After a few failures or successes I soon got to understand how things worked. (even if it just means turning a light on) How complex you make your station is up to you.\nA simple setup requires very little in the way of logic and complication, but then you want to expand and want a more elaborate habitat, which also requires more mechanics. For this the learning curve can be steep and frustrating, but if you persevere results can be achieved. The UI is a little overwhelming and seemed awkward in the beginning but I did get use to it and the game plays much smoother than I first thought. Getting familiar with keyboard shortcuts and mouse scrolling felt a little slow to start with, but I soon got to grips with that too. (Although I still launch my spanner into space occasionally by mistake).\nThere are a few flaws which to be fair have not spoiled my game, just early access bugs. Frequent split second screen freeze is my only real issue, but i'm sure it will be addressed in the future. A few items in game don't work or have no function at the moment but it is still early access. Overall very playable with no major bugs that I have experienced effecting play.\nIn my current game I have a fully functioning base with over 6000 items and have yet to utilise the full expanse of this game. It runs nicely at around 50 fps with a 1050ti. Graphics not set highest but looks good still.\nI have only played single player so cannot comment on the multiplayer but i can imagine it would be great to build a base with friends. (I do have friends just none got this game yet)\nPreviously played planet base and surviving mars and enjoyed them both in their own right very much. Stationeers is not like these games. For an engineer it would be like going to work, but there is fun to be had and a well deserved sense of achievement when you get it right.\nSo if you like a challenge, a head scratcher or blasting yourself out of your space suit when you accidentally get things wrong, I would totally recommend this game/simulation and can only look forward to future updates.\nBut also if you are looking for a more casual point and click resource manager with less sense of survival this might not be for you but i would still keep an eye on it.\nGreat game.

First my friend and I express interest in the game, install it, start playing around, enjoy the mechanics and design challenges.  On those merits it's really good.  Then inevitably we stumble into some sort of game breaking bug (usually related to netcode) that strongly discourages us from continuing.  After putting the game on hold for several months or years, an update catches my eye, and we try again from scratch, hoping the issues might have been addressed.  This last update, titled \"The Multiplayer Update\", had me excited, as I had hoped that they had finally redone the netcode.  After going through the patch notes, all that was listed was (re)introducing Steam Peer to Peer (a working feature they had removed prior) and bug fixes.  With our hopes up, we reinstalled the game and started up a new save.  Once again, after making some good progress, the netcode irreversibly removed my friend from his body and forced him to respawn, leaving all the fancy new equipment we just spent all our resources on stranded on his mindless body.  In addition, two more living mindless bodies were inexplicably spawned near the spawn point.  With no good workaround in sight, our options were to either take the L and fully re-equip my friend, knowing that at any point the game could just do this again, or quit playing.  We opted to quit playing.\n\nIt's especially frustrating since the update that brought us back was called \"The Multiplayer Update\".  The one thing that I would have expected to work in this update was multiplayer netcode, and yet somehow despite six years in development the game still can't reliably load a player in with their inventory intact.  This update added nothing but netcode bugfixes, but my friend's gameplay experience was still riddled with desync issues, and also inexplicably could only connect to my game once per boot session, meaning disconnecting and reconnecting required him to reboot the game entirely.  Desyncs happened roughly once every three hours of gameplay, for which the only solution was for him to reboot the game and reconnect.  It is still the most inconsistent netcode of any early access game we've played so far.\n\nOnce again to reiterate, this is after six years in development and an update titled \"The Multiplayer Update\", which did nothing but modify multiplayer code and re-introduce a basic connectivity feature that was removed in a prior update.  It's immensely disappointing.  If any other developer ran an update for their game called \"The Multiplayer Update\" I would expect that multiplayer was added, revamped, or substantially improved to the point that it actually works consistently.  I know it's early access, but Minecraft, Factorio, and Valheim are just a few examples of games that started off small and had infinitely more consistent netcode from the beginning, much less after an update titled \"The Multiplayer Update\".\n\nThe netcode isn't even the buggiest part of the game, here are just a few more irksome things I can remember that have never been fixed:\n- To my knowledge, ladders still can't be always dismounted safely, because they always force you in the north cardinal direction on dismount, whether or not this tosses you back down the ladder.\n- We tried growing chickens, but there's no way to control/move chickens once spawned, and they will infinitely reproduce if allowed.  We ended up having to drain all the air from our base just so that the chickens would die off.  Chickens can survive in the vacuum of space for around an hour, turns out.  Reminiscent of Tribbles.\n- Various atmospherics machines change their throughput and efficiency depending on the size of the pipe network on the inlet.  Because of this it's pretty trivial to generate infinite energy by putting a ton of pipes on the inlet side of one of the machines, causing it to push ungodly amounts of gasses through for a tiny amount of energy, then harvest the energy by creating a duct with vents and wind turbines.  Not knowing about this bug can cause you to accidentally build atmospherics setups with terrible efficiency.  Again despite the game receiving an update called \"The Atmospherics Update\" which revamped atmospherics, this system is still in place, and the developers have expressed no intent to change it.\n- If you spawn on the cold planet, you might notice that you are chugging through oxygen at an unbelievably high rate of consumption.  This is fact not a bug, but a feature that you need to join the discord and bug report about before you understand how the mechanic works, because the game will definitely not tell you, and neither will I.  Personally, I think it would be infinitely more sane to use the suit's built in electric heater to heat air, instead of dumping your air into the waste tank to heat it, but the devs have decided that all your cold air will instead go straight into the waste tank and refuse to change this feature.\n\nThe people on the discord are very condescending if you have any questions or complaints about the game's functionality.\n\nIt's a cool sandbox but at this point I've lost all faith that the developers are going to build the game into a polished enough experience for my taste.", "timestamp_created": 1680487711, "timestamp_updated": 1680487711, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744614183902740479", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124905275": {"recommendationid": "124905275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057863057", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 223593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5605, "playtime_at_review": 173003, "last_played": 1713770818}, "language": "english", "review": "There are countless ways to die in this game - but boredom is NOT one of them.\n\nThis game will kill you by dehydration, starvation, freezing, fire, explosion and (if you are too inquisitive about certain menu functions), big a$$ spider bastards.

I recall the creator saying something like he was tired of how many games used a minecraft-like inventory system so he wanted to make his own. Well, there's a reason so many games use the Minecraft inventory system: Because it's fast, intuitive, efficient, and easy. In other words, because it works.\n\nThe inventory management for Stationeers is infuriatingly convoluted, and there's no need for it to be so. And even if you get used to it and it becomes intuitive, it's still needlessly tedious. (And yes, I get it; it more accurately reflects having two hands to use like you do in real life. But using two hands in real life to get stuff out of your pack is intuitive and simple; emulating that in a game viewed through a 2D screen using menus keyboard commands and mousewheel and stuff is NOT.)\n\nDisclaimer over.\n\nHaving said that: If you can push past that, learn how to use it, and put up with the UI's never-ending tedium, the game mechanics are quite alluring to someone like me. Everything's very granular and complex. When I finally managed to get plants growing in the hydroponics stations in the greenhouse I set up, it was notably more satisfying than growing food in any other survival or simulation game I've ever played, because _I_ had to set everything up:\n\nI had to make an airtight room, composed of separate panels, frames, windows, and routing power and pipes in too.\nI lost some (preciously gathered) gasses to space when I tried to pressurize the room with one of the glass windows missing. (Making the room to gather those gasses was a whole procedure in itself, as was making the filtration and storage area for those gasses.)\nI had to make an airlock, by placing the individual components of the airlock and wiring them correctly. \nI had to place and program the different pipes to mix the correct gasses for the room (pure CO2 would've been fine for plants alone, but I wanted it breathable, so I made it roughly 80/20 Nitrogen-Oxygen, and then mixed that with 3% CO2).\nI had to make sure it was all at the correct temperature and pressure, and program control systems for those too.\nAnd then finally, I was growing crops, and it worked. It was my accomplishment; it wasn't just plopping down a greenhouse room and suddenly the room is capable of producing food.\n\nIf that level of granularity and tedium is not for you, I don't blame you. This game will not be for you.\n\nHowever, if that sounds like fun, then hop right in.\n\n\n...Just, seriously, watch some youtube videos of the inventory management first.

The game features a variety of planets to survive on and provides for hours upon hours of entertainment. That said, it's a niche game and it's difficult. If you are the person who jumps away from games at the drop of a hat because it's too confusing, difficult, or there's a lot of buzzing and whirring going on, look elsewhere. But, if you enjoy getting blown up, lost, frustrated, and then finally being met with success due to your engineering prowess, then this game might be for you. It's certainly a game I have enjoyed for hundreds of hours, but there is a lot of room for improvement and while some of that is expected for early access, read on to find out why I don't recommend this game overall.\n\nI chose not to recommend the game because of the following three major reasons:\n- Basic features which are apparently available through menu interactions do not work. This includes basic elements like tutorials, which do not properly work. It would be acceptable not to have tutorials yet, since the game is still in early access, but offering broken ones isn't good because it disrespects the players' time.\n\n- Simple bugs exist in the game which cause loss of time. If you quick save from the menu, it works fine, but if you try to exit and click save when it reminds you to save, it removes data from your save and can render the world you've worked on completely unplayable with no option for recovery unless you want to dig into the files, folders, to rename and replace them while hoping it all works out.\n\n- The game features a seemingly vast landscape which generates more terrain as you explore further. However, there is no reason to venture out except for introducing distance between locations you desire to build. That wouldn't be so bad, but if you venture just a few km from where you start, physics starts to break and you end up clipping through walls when you get too close. It just becomes a tease and then a letdown, essentially, with more wasted time the first time you discover these problems.\n\nSeeing a theme yet? A fair number of bugs exist today which could waste the new player's time and require them to venture into Discord servers, unofficial wikis which are not up to date, and find workarounds on their own or with others. While that wouldn't normally be such a big deal, the Discord community lately has been unfairly and rudely judging negative reviews, newcomers asking questions or complaining about bugs, and there has been an increase in argumentative discussion when it involves representatives of the community (community contributor, community dev, etc) to the point someone was accused of spreading misinformation for stating a plain fact about how reorienting a daylight sensor will require an offset to be calculated in solar tracking automation.\n\nTo wrap this review up, I want to say it wasn't always this low in quality and in the past the game had very little performance issues for me. That means this low quality phase is probably something which will go just as quickly as it came and we'll be in a happy place again. However, the general release quality and stability has been declining recently as there is seemingly more focus on larger overhauls of the game such as the introduction of new content and phase change mechanics. The default branch which should be more stable than the beta branch has suffered many setbacks wherein features that previously worked no longer do, such as saving on exit. Performance of the game has been declining as well, to the point that running the game on an RTX 4090, with a Core i9 CPU and 64 GB of RAM to match, gives us only 30-40 fps in basic scenes with just a few dozen pipes present; the game will stutter as you pan your camera while the sun sets and casts shadows are certain angles on the pipes as it drops down to less than 15 fps until it just goes back to its usual 30-40 fps.", "timestamp_created": 1703321982, "timestamp_updated": 1703321982, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737292289733886719", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147872135": {"recommendationid": "147872135", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999217003", "num_games_owned": 2571, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 79758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4340, "playtime_at_review": 75747, "last_played": 1713735540}, "language": "english", "review": "The learning curve is steep, but it's really [b]really[/b] worth it!

Each play-through is different!\n\n[hr][/hr]\nI've played for 50+ hours solo, but today I felt like multiplayer - and even found a non-empty server.\n\nSoon my oxygen was too low. So I started making a flexible gas filtration construct - but I was running out of time. A random stranger helped laying some wires and making some gas filters.\n\nUnder \"pressure\", I checked every gas bottle I could find with my PDA (of course using the Atmos Analyzer Cartridge). A little O2 here, a little there ... I could keep myself afloat for mere minutes (really, less than 2 per bottle), then I switched the empty filtration source canister with the waste gas bottle in my spacesuit, so I had even more O2 to filter out.\n\nThen I asked the guy who helped me for his waste gas bottle - I wouldn't have survived otherwise. (I wished we had thought of this: \"How will he ever survive this?\" - \"Your gas is as good as mine.\") Then I also found a welder gas bottle: 75% volatile, 25% oxygen. Another few minutes.\n\nDuring this time, we managed to set up an Ice Crusher at the assembly, I piped things up, and then I was quickly blessed with a few bottles of 8+ megapascals of pure oxygen.\n\nDuring all this, I also ran out of food (But there were reserves around.) and out of water (No reserves ... except the corpse of another player on which I found a water bottle.)\n\nThen we found water-ice, so I prepared the assembly's setup accordingly, crushed the ice, and slowly let some of it into the pipe system (The Ice Crusher can hold a brutal amount of pressure, but bottles can't hold all that much.) - and then we had water.\n\nThere was more that happened there, e.g. the other guy was also running out of oxygen and water, so I shared the water I had found on the corpse. But in the end, we had it all ... and could start playing.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nThere is so much to tell. I've struggled with hydroponics for a while, but now I have canned tomato soup (Long lasting and very rich.) and some seeds. I have yet to construct a faster airlock. I have come up with a hypothetical solution for laying pipes to the outside even after a pressurized base has already been established inside. Etc: Fun-gineering!\n\nThis game will be part of gaming history because of its deep and accurate simulation, and all that in a fast 3D realtime environment which also works (mostly) fine in multiplayer.\n\nThe devs chose a niche that only few people will invest in, so I bought the entire DLC for ~\u20ac27 to support them, and because I like the option of playing as a robot (high energy demands but no food or gas requirements) or as an alien breathing completely different gases.\n\nThis is why I wish that many people buy this game. At full price. I know I didn't, and I don't regret it and wouldn't accuse you. I'm just saying: The world is [b]richer[/b] thanks to what these devs are doing. This game is [b]unique,[/b] you will see! And it will inspire so many games to come.\n\nJump onboard. Try it every once in a while. Once it clicks, you'll be in for the brain teaser gaming ride of a lifetime.\n\nYour player avatar isn't just a camera with health bar! (Though currently, there is only a health value, even though organs are supposedly prepared under the hood, a relatively deep medical system is coming in the future, I heard.)\n\nNo, you have a helmet that you can open/close with appropriate sound changes (just like the sound also changes depending on atmospheric pressure), you can lock it, you can turn off/on the oxygen flow, air conditioning, the gas filters (You have three slots in the starter suit, so you can also breathe O2 mixes that contain hazardous stuff.), can adjust the target temperature, target pressure, can flush the suit in case there's harmful gas buildup (Can't happen if your filters are proper.), you have an oxygen tank, a waste gas tank, and all of it is calculated realistically.\n\nIt's just a blast to work with so many living realistic systems that work together. Pure [i]meaning.[/i]\n\nThe pipes are radiating away heat, there is condensation, you can create a custom refrigeration or heating system, there's a furnace (No, you don't know what I mean, because you're thinking of [i]game[/i] furnaces right now.), there's electricity management (with nice beefy station batteries that you can build rather early), you can even program chips to control your base, or to point the solar panels automatically at the sun, etc. - I think there's even robotics. And it's all still just Early Access. 50 hours, and I have only just (properly) begun.\n\nAgain, get this game. Do it. Your older self will agree.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nMan, I [i]wish[/i] I could let you participate in the intense adventure I had today (single player, Moon, hard difficulty). Words can't transport the intensity of it. How I used a furnace to get greenhouse gases - but it was always too hot, and I couldn't get the AC to work for some reason. So I jury-rigged one. It's too powerful, though: Turning it on for 10 seconds cools the entire ~200 cubic meters room down by 2\u00b0C.\n\nAnd now I have baked potatoes. ... Pure adrenaline experience - the time pressure, all the systems and decisions you have to keep in balance, the long list of things I still have to do to get my little survival base stable and secure. That's actually the thing I realize is the most fun: To keep \"living\" complex systems in balance. And that's what you get with this game, definitely.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nAnother emergent mission / action scene that happened just now: I'm on Earth's moon (aka the Moon) and have, of course, a little greenhouse there. I have some pipes outside with passive radiation emitters. An electric vent blows air from the greenhouse into those pipes, and another such vent sucks it back in (else it would stay in the pipe too long).\n\nIn the computer that I placed there, I had written a little assembler program that reads the gas sensor's temperature value and turns the first vent on to circulate air through the cooling pipe as soon as we reach 23\u00b0C. This only lasts for about 1 second, then it automatically turns off, because the setup is so incredibly powerful that the entire room has cooled to ~22.5 in that time. This happens about every 5 seconds (when the sun warms the room) or every ~20 seconds during the night.\n\nI placed some info screens outside the building to be able to monitor temperature, pressure, and CO2 ratio while building outside. For efficiency reasons, I had this running on the same programmable chip.\n\nBut I decided to move the screens, so I cut the cables. After almost a minute of working, I realized the air was visibly moving in the greenhouse. All the time! FUUUUUUUUUUU!\n\nI ran into my manual airlock (They don't come any faster.) and found the room at about -20\u00b0 Celsius: I had cut the cable to the assigned but now no longer available display screen just when the cooling was active! So it hadn't stopped!\n\nI manually turned off the vent. Were the potato plants still alive? I ran back outside again to the furnace, which I had set up to originally fill the room with atmosphere, tossed some reactive gasses (in the form of ice) inside, and fired it up. Then back inside, I operated the valves I had installed in the gas filtration assembly and turned on the pump. Quickly the temperature rose from -20 to 20 again, because just like my cooling system is completely OP, so is my heating - it's meant to make steel from iron and carbon at high pressures, so yes it's hot gas, which was originally a problem when I filled the room - but now it was JUST what I needed!\n\nAnd that's Stationeers.

The updates I've seen so far contained lots of fixes and content, such as the Ground Penetrating Radar (ore scanner) and the Portable Solar Panel with the last two. \n\nTHINGS I LIKE: \n - The game has a lot of detail. I'm a fan of realistic simulations, even though the game slightly simplifies some things for the sake of performance and gameplay. \n - There's air pressure and flow simulation (two spots can have different temperatures), as well as water, although water seems to be simulated as a 'heavy' gas that once accumulated enough in a certain place turns into standing water.\n - You have to connect things manually with wires and pipes, without it there's no connection and no power, allowing you to separate things on one ship into groups, and being forced to truly engineer your creation's fuel, atmospheric and power needs.\n - There's a LOT to do for an early access game especially this young (<6 months at time of writing)\n - Control scheme allows multitasking as buttons don't interfere with eachother and can be pressed simultaneously (more on that in the THINGS I DON'T LIKE section)\n - It automatically creates save backups (really nice to have with early access games!)\n\nTHINGS I DON'T LIKE\nTake this with a grain of salt, things change constantly\n - 4 Degrees of Freedom. Really guys? I really hope this will be fixed/expanded, as it feels kind of strange to have a defined up/down, especially in space.\n - Control scheme is tedious and overly limiting sometimes. I don't hate it in entirety, there's certainly things I like about it too (like multitasking), and it's okay to have a learning curve, but some things are just rediculous. Okay, you have two hands, but I don't have to press E switch between my hands in real life do I? It feels strange to make your hotbar just your two hands. IMHO it should at least show the current belt you have equipped (perhaps underneath the hands bar? or next to..), and allow you to quick swap between things in the belt and in your hands. That way belts make much more sense, since they're around your waist and easily accessible; it feels weird having to grab items from it the same way I do from my backpack.\n - Putting down wires and pipes is meh at best, and frustrating at worst. Not every type of cable/pipe has the same corner types, and it takes aaaaaaaaaaaaaaages to wire up your station because you have to scroll through 6+ options every time you run into a corner, followed by clumsy keyboard acrobatics with insert/delete/home/end/pageup/down reminiscent of early days Space Engineers and taking on all kinds of weird poses in order to get the cable to do what you want. IMHO: Just automate junctions. Only allow building straight/curved cables, make sure the player has enough cables with them, and then allow them to connect a cable they're running up to a point with another cable by just constructing another straight/curved cable on top of an existing one. That would make the wiring/piping work a LOT less frustrating, and simplifies/unifies the gameplay aspect of it, perhaps even simplifiying the backend :)\n - The game doesn't scale well right now unfortunately, it's rather heavy on servers, even though it does seem properly multithreaded, it gladly uses up 4 threads to full 100% if you build a mid size base and have some junk laying around inside. Every time the game saves, it hangs the server thread, creating 10+ second lag spikes every few minutes after a few dozen hours of gameplay. I'm glad to see they've implemented intensive multithreading though, that will certainly help in the future. \n\nMISC NOTES:\n - There's a lot of simplification, which is fine because this improves performance and gameplay for a lot of people, but I personally like things as realistic as possible. For those interested, here are the details of how the engineering works in this game: \n  Electricity: There's no volts, or amps, let alone resistance or things like AC/DC etc. You only have watts/kilowatts. Above 5kw the small cable melts and above 50kw the large cable melts. There's 5kw and 50kw transformers to modulate power throughput, but that's it. You can connect the same lights and devices to low and high power circuits without it making any difference to their functioning, and there's no real circuits, wires are bidirectional and also carry networking. \n  Gasses: There's only 6 different 'gasses' in the game right now; Oxygen, Nitrogen, CO2, Water, \"Polutants/X\" (i.e CO, toxic gasses)  and \"Volatiles\" (i.e Hydrogen, combustible gasses). This makes up the entirety of all the gasses that can exist. Fuel is Hydrogen and Oxygen.\n   Pipes: There's pressure, you can blow them up with too much of it, and there's temperature.. But water doesn't freeze even at -250c, and nothing changes phase. Also, the entire contents of a pipe are equal, and dead ends do not seem to leak. \nCreating a heating/cooling 'loop' is as simple as making a wall cooler, hooking a single pipe to it to another place where you want to vent the heat, and putting a few 'pipe radiators' on it, and putting some gas in it as medium (Pollutant/X works best). Reverse the process and you're creating heat. There's no flow needed in the pipes.\n - \n\n\n\n\nAgain take this review with a grain of salt, and perhaps consider it invalid if I haven't updated this in a few months, as things will constantly change.\n\n27-4-2018 addendum: few hundred hours and quite some experiments and things later, I wish this game was more mature already :) \ncurrent bugs I'm running into:\n - The logic motherboard doesn't work, meaning you only have chips to automate everything (which are very basic gate-like operations), which is very tedious and means you definitely run into space issues with only being able to put 4x4 chips OR cables on a wall. (aka 1-3 gates per wall effectively for your logic)\n - Pipes are buggy. They clog (suddenly 'losing connection' with the rest of a pipe), they leak (rarely I've found tanks and rooms drained with no obvious cause), or seem to sometimes contain multiple simultaneous gas systems, which combined with the clogging bug causes things like 'infinite kPa/MPa/GPa' and your pipes randomly bursting, not working, or other terrible things. However I've found that if you restart the map the issue is often resolved, and that [i]usually[/i] it's not destructive if you discover the problems in time. It requires some extra engineering though.. just ask a hydraulics expert to build a hydraulics system that may clog or build up high pressure at [b]any[/b] random point for no reason ;)\n - I often find myself falling through the map, and ending up falling forever with no good way to respawn, because there's no way to kill yourself right now, and rejoining a server often means your character is still there (but not always :D)\n - On servers, your character SOMETIMES persists but more often does not, especially over the longer term. It'd be fine if you died when you're not in a sleeper (stationeers version of a space engineers cryo pod) or something, but right now there's no way to reliably persist your character.\n - Items often fall through the ground or floor, causing you to lose sometimes large stacks of items at once. \n - dragging things is rather clumsy, force-pulling something close, which means that something can smack you with deadly force if it's stuck behind something and you click to grab something, and ragdolls of characters are pretty much a sure fire way to kungfu your own suit to ruins if you try and drag someone to safety because they forgot their helmet.\n - the game wastes all of my spare time ;)\n\nI ran out of chara-", "timestamp_created": 1521388119, "timestamp_updated": 1524850237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735445499420166016", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136001634": {"recommendationid": "136001634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021526568", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4773, "last_played": 1680467964}, "language": "english", "review": "This game fails to live up to its promises.\n\nIt wants to be a game about building your own base, putting together atmospherics systems, wiring up machines and automating certain things like solar arrays, all of it under survival time pressure - ideas that appeal to plenty of people that like solving engineering problems.\n\nIt [i]is[/i] a game about building your own base excruciatingly slowly using multi-step construction processes involving extensively tedious inventory management, having your atmospherics systems blow up because you didn't know one of your machines had a magical all-powerful pump in it that grows in power with the length of the input pipe network, struggling with figuring out a wire or pipe layout that will work properly with all of the non-reversible machines that don't connect directly with each other, all while dying to one of the many, many bugs that are ever-present and rarely fixed, or having your game desync or losing your inventory if you have the misfortune of playing multiplayer.\n\nThe most frustrating part about Stationeers is that it's like an abusive relationship - I keep coming back to it for the good parts I remember, only to inevitably have my experience ruined again by one of these myriad issues.

Yes, but they are not at all something that anyone who enjoys the game finds more then a minor annoyance. Also to be quite frank, if you are put off by the controls, then you almost certainly should not even be playing this type of game. \n\nAlmost nothing about this game is casual or meant to just pick up and play. Only after you have learned to play and use the systems in game can you fully enjoy it. With that said, I would not be opposed to streamlining the controls a bit, but the devs focus now is on fixing the bugs and making the rest of the game, but since they won't drop everything they are doing and redesign the controls, people are throwing fits about it.\n\nI also wanted to add it only takes a few seconds to put a different cartridge into your handheld or grab frames from your backpack and grab your welder. Me or my friend never had any issues with this stuff at all like some others apparently do. We took a few minutes to learn the controls and then just played the game and had fun.\n\nIf streamlined controls are more important to you then actual gameplay, then I could see the issue, but the core of the game is here and is pretty good. You can design and build almost anything from the ground up and it works and is fun to do. I barely notice the controls at all when playing. \n\nWhat I have noticed is that I have had more fun designing, building and playing in this game then I have had since the early release of space engineers. This game is what space engineers wanted to be I think, or at least what I wanted it to be. It takes actual design and engineering skills to play Stationeers with much more depth to the game then space engineers has.\n\nI for one am quite excited to see how this game develops and am glad I picked it up. Do not be fooled however, this game is not for those who just want to pick up and play, you will be dissapointed, it is however an amazing game once you take the time to learn it.\n\nGood Luck, Have Fun!", "timestamp_created": 1528228684, "timestamp_updated": 1528229355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733662962913513184", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38524145": {"recommendationid": "38524145", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970691857", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 73564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5226, "last_played": 1679094392}, "language": "english", "review": "If \"Space Engineers\" and \"Oxygen Not Included\" would have a child together, that would probably be this game and \"Factorio\" would probably his uncle or something like that.\n\nIf you like engineering, building stuff, playing around with basic chemicals like oxygen, CO2, Water, Ice, Metals and so on and combing that with temperature, pressure and power/electricity and have a large portion of patience and will to learn you will probably find your new favorite game.\n\nBe warned however, the learning curve is currently rather steep you'll need a lot out outside help (Steam Guides, Forum, Youtube, etc.), a lot of patience and especially nerves sometimes coping with the complex/fiddling input system.

The developers seem to try to keep up to serious issues and is continuing to work on fixes, optimizations and additions. Reaction time seems good so far. It remains to be seen how this develops in the future, but if it continues like that and grows this still very rough stone will turn out to be a real diamond in this genre.\n\nEDIT:\nSome features and notes that might be intresting\n- Gamestart on a Moon with Gravity or in Space (Mars planned)\n- Terrain is voxel-based, allows digging and manipulation everywhere (though not as advanced as in Astroneer)\n- Endless map generation (Map expands when moving near border) like in Factorio\n- Complex Smelting/Refining/Manufacturing (Advanced Materials like composits need to be carefully adjusted in amount, temp and pressure, bad things can happen as well)\n- Complex Gas Simulation and contrary to ONI allows multiple gases in one place\n- also contrary to ONI it sometimes simulated reactions of matter, e.g. fire or explosions for example with burnable or explodeable mixtures\n- Simulates Pressure incl. Overpressure, Leakages and even explosions of e.g. gas containers\n- Simulates Temperature incl. Overheating and Destruction and Dying (with people)\n- Ice and Gases smelt/evaporates and you can see real water as well with ice\n- Conveyor System for resources and items for storage and transport\n- Power Generation via Solar and Coal atm\n- Complex Electricity Simulation like in ONI with high and low-capacity wires, transformers, batteries, generators, switches\n- Complex Automation like Factorio/ONI already available incl.

The manufacturing and overall survival complication is excellent.  The whole atmospherics management is amazing, and the ore/alloy smelting is as engaging as you can get.  I enjoyed dying from venting gas that was too hot into my hab and having it crack glass and blow up from bad pressure regulation.  I wish I could say the same from my first two deaths, which happened while I was just learning the ins and outs of the interface.  The first happened because I couldn't quite figure out how to replace a battery in time and the second because I couldn't get used to the switching between right and left hands--so I just couldn't build fast enough to make progress.\n\nThis game and community really suffer from the curse of knowledge.  They've figured it out and it works well enough once you put in the time and effort to learn it--but I would guess that the devs and players have forgotten how blasted difficult it is to just do simple things like drink water.\n\nWhy can't it just have an action bar where numbers 1 and 2 correspond to right and left hands and pressing a number puts it in the active hand?  Why does the default of pressing the letter \"I\" (as in eye)  kill me instead of open an inventory (it opens your helmet visor)?  Other games have a common inventory that gets expanded based on equipment, and simple utility slots in an equip menu.  Why can't this? Why does every item of equipment merit its own window?\n\nSimply ignoring common gamer training and conventions makes this game extremely inaccessible to new players.  Most those conventions didn't come out of a vacuum, but from testing, retesting, and building on success after success.  Remember the original DOOM controls? (ctrl fired, and arrow keys moved, it was tricky to use)  Right, we do WASD now for a reason.  We do conventional inventories for a reason (makes a player feel like they're growing more wealthy while doing bag maintenance).  We do equipment upgrades for a reason.  The RPG genre perfected this over hundreds of bad game interface designs and got it down so well that every other genre looks to them for UX wisdom.  Figure out which reasons are valid for your creative endeavor and which reasons are genuinely harming your player experience and keeping this from reaching a broader audience.\n\nIf they did this, then I'd feel comfortable saying that this game is appropriate for 1-5% of gamers (as opposed to the 0.1% right now).\n\nAs for unfinished--that's a given, it's early access and still in development.  This is overall a positive thing because they are vigorously updating it.  I would say the open bleeding wounds at the moment are the kinematics and lighting physics. It's possible to get so stuck you need to deconstruct items and what looks like Euler method errors cause some otherwise benign collisions to do damage and send you flying, which is silly because the game looks like it's based on Unity and that provides good speculative collision detection, and more advanced lighting methods than the FPS games of the early 90s.\n\nAgain, I love the game--but I wouldn't recommend it for most players.

The game has some complicated mechanics and as such, the interface is equally complicated. Much to the frustration of some players. You have a tool belt, some suit pockets and other personal storage areas in your spacesuit but, you only have two hands. Consequently, you can only use two things at one.

In the face of overwhelming odds, I'm left with only one option, I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this.\" \n\nUnlike in Space Engineers, where one built thing tends to represent one whole block. In Stationeers one thing can have many layers. Take an airlock switch for example: it first needs a casing, then a circuit board, then a screen. Then a disk inserted to program it to behave like an airlock. Then it needs wiring up to a gas sensor. Walls, to give another example, consist of metal sheets welded to a frame underneath. More complicated items will require using multiple tools. In addition to the welder there is the wrench, crowbar and wire cutters to name a few. \n\nHidden away is an absolute gem of in game computer programming. To automate everything, you must build a smart network of logic nodes. That can sense the environment and respond correctly. This includes learning to write your own computer code into the base terminals in game. The game sneakily encourages players to learn basic programming. As they push themselves toward more elaborate building designs. \n\nBeing in space makes this all more complicated still. Rooms may need pressurising, if you want to walk around them without a spacesuit on. Which means mixing and piping gasses into the area. It also means making sure they are properly sealed to avoid explosive decompression. That means pressurisation chambers, which involve multiple doors and processes linked together by you.\n\nThat's on top of basic human need to eat and drink. In a place that doesn't naturally provide water, food or air. Do you know the scientific composition of air? You soon will do.\n\nMark Watney: \"At some point, everything's gonna go south on you... everything's going to go south and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end.

I was sceptical myself and half certain I'd regret it) check these off:\n- Do you know and love the genre? If you're new to it don't bother, unless you work for NASA or something.\n- Do you enjoy overcoming challenges? Not for the swoosh of the levelup sound or because you clicked faster than the other guy, but because you solved a complicated problem.\n- Do you know, or are you at least interested in, basic physics? If you don't know how temperature, mass, and volume interact be prepared to look it up or die horribly.\n\nThe above sounds harsh, but if Elon Musk can do it why can't we?\n\nThis game is a challenge. I wrote this review purposefully while I was only a few dozen hours in because it's the type of game where once you figured out the mechanics many of the initial challenges are \"Well, duh...\". Then you get new ones. But the fact that those first hurdles are on the surface so simple but in reality so hard to overcome makes this game a diamond in the rough. \n\nJust as an example: You start out (on Mars, anyway) with a boatload of food and supplies, and it feels so easy to build your first little box of air. Then you realize your plants depend on CO2, and don't do well at temperatures above 100C. Then you realize that all those atmospheric filters you so painstakingly built draw a whole lot of power, and you need to logic-circuit your solar panels to get every last little ray of sunshine so you can get through the night without powerloss. Then you realize all that food that seemed so abundant at the start is dwindling quickly and you only just now got your first potato to start sprouting.\n\nIt's not minecraft in space, it's not your run-of-the-mill basebuilding game. It's a challenge, it's complicated, it's rewarding.\n\nCons:\n- Price. Sorry. This is too much for an EA game no matter how good.\n- A few mechanics could do with optimizations. I don't have the playtime to make suggestions, but the amount of buttons that need pressing for some very basic tasks bears rethinking.\n- Mining feels tedious. Maybe there's better ways of doing it in later-game, but fact is it'll be a turnoff in the first 30ish hours.\n\nMixed:\n- Ignore the reviews complaining about the general setup of the controls and inventory. Yes it's sometimes a grind, but it makes sense when you grasp the spirit of the game. That being said: some optimizations might not go amiss, a couple less tools maybe, and some hotkeys for auto-swapping batteries and cannisters? It's Early access, so can't be too harsh on this.\n- It requires something of your hardware. Running this on a 5Ghz quadcore with a 1080Ti, and although the gameplay is smooth my gameroom is getting warm.\n\nPros:\n- Physics. Science. The depth of the mechanics is mindblowing.\n- An astounding array of machines and assorted items to build.\n- Logic blocks (read/write, memory, compute) and ingame programming for when you feel bored with logic.\n- A challenge in an era where games appear to feed off of quick-win gamestyles. \n- You can spend days on this game and discover something new every hour.\n\nWholeheartedly recommended. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1588878207, "timestamp_updated": 1588878207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717574834823608398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93107538": {"recommendationid": "93107538", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988387615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 29028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 49, "playtime_at_review": 2566, "last_played": 1713237713}, "language": "english", "review": "There are four puzzles to this game:\n-How to feed and hydrate yourself automatically\n-How to generate and store power automatically\n-How to provide isolated gases automatically\n-How to create a pressurized habitat in which you can take your helmet off.\n\nEach puzzle takes between 10 to 30 hours to solve, all the while makings staged advancements just to make sure you don't run out of food,water,oxygen, or battery power yourself.\nThere are six planets which change the variables of the puzzles, and dozens of tools to solve them, from pumps and backpressure valves, to logic circuits and gas sensors.\n\nLast week, on breaks at work, I designed (on paper) a filtration system that would vacuum out CO2 from Mars atmo, pump it into a green house until 105kPa was reached, fill a reserve CO2 tank, allow me to introduce my own waste CO2 at any time, suck O2 produced by plants out of the enclosure, and then blow out gasses exceeding 110 kPa one the tank had 50,000kPa in reserve. All this took about 4 hours to implement. If I wanted to set it up so it could automatically conserve power by shutting off certain valves and filtration units when they are no longer needed at the moment, that would probably double the planning and implementation time - but it is on my to do list.\n\n\nLast thing I wanna say is: don't worry about the \"hands\" thing.

I am a BMS controls engineer though, so for me, trying to get the game to do with 20 logic modules what I can do with 2 in a BMS controller, is infinitely entertaining. When you fill up the base for the fiirst time and can control the temperature and pressure and it doesnt blow up, it really feels like an achievement. \n\nI cant really comment about the survival element and multiplayer as I've not multiplayered and have turned off hunger which, asides from power and O2 (which comes fairly easily from the sun and ice mined from the ground) is the main concern. With hunger turned on then the struggle is real and the way you build and setup your base will reflect that as you will need the basics before you can build the ultimate base. With it off, or in creative mode, you are pretty much free to build until your hearts content or the game hangs. Again there are some bugs. There are some great youtubers out there with some very helpful videos that touch on the possibilities available to you. I'd recommend Saddamo De Beers channel and Greyduster as both, in their own way, explain the processes and quirks of the games mechanics and give some explanations into basic logic circuits and what you can do with them, for those less imaginative or technical.\n\nThere are also space flight elements, in that you can build a spacecraft and fly it to other planets/moons etc which I'm sure will be expanded upon as the development progresses. This again adds another challenge with construction, logic and life support etc etc required to make it work.   \n\nThe devs are doing a great job at fixing bugs and are listening to customer feedback and adding new content regularly. \n\nAgain 300 hours on an EA game is something I thought deserved a few words. If you like edge of your seat action and stuff that \"just works\" and hate Voxel mining, then go play Call of Duty. If you want a bit of a challenge and to occasionally have your brain melt with logic programming or your hydrogen tank exploding, and enjoy building stuff AND want to support a game that is being actively developed with a shed load of potential, then don't finish reading this, go buy it now.............no, go NOW........... and stick with it past the initial WTF are these controls bit and you'll have a blast..\n\nPros:\nFun\nChallenging\nRewarding (when it works)\nActive dev team and community, albeit a small one at the moment.\nYou get to build a base on the moon, what more do you want? Mars? Well then build one there too.\n\nCons:\nNot optimized and will lag a \u00a310k rig.\nSome bugs and graphical glitches are really annoying but not priority for devs as they are not game breaking.\nVery steep learning curve with little to no tutorial on the things you really need a tutorial on, again not priority as it is fairly easily learnable but for a new player it would save some googling. (Not sure if this one is a con or just how the game is designed to be but for purposes of increasing appeal to new players a more detailed tutorial should be added, IMO.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI love Stationeers. Absolutely 100% can't fault it (except for its faults, as above) and would enthusiastically reccomend it to most of the people I work with (I'm surre some of them don't know how to use a computer) and everyone else who wants something spacey, fairly chilled, but brain intensive, controls/automation oriented and creative to happily burn up hunders of hours of your free (and sometimes paid) time.", "timestamp_created": 1530726107, "timestamp_updated": 1530726150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71439594030380249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144216388": {"recommendationid": "144216388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198414563229", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4657, "last_played": 1691967477}, "language": "english", "review": "Dev's, please make this game open source so that the community can help you realise the game's potential, You need more hands on this project or it will never be completed...", "timestamp_created": 1692054552, "timestamp_updated": 1692054552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714270174503326416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38388098": {"recommendationid": "38388098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058075753", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 7181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 153, "last_played": 1658245368}, "language": "english", "review": "The review is below this ridicule. Here's a short excerpt on what you might experience during your first playthrough:\n\n*Generates world\n-Hey I have a lot of oxygen\n-Look at all the crates lying all around. Wtf\n*opens one\n- Ooooh construction tools. I get it. I'ma build stuff! This is what I asked for anyways. Yeah!\n*picks up tiny things from the boxes\n- Wait, how in the fuck am I supposed to build anything with these.\n-There are metal sheets and foundations. hmm\n-Need to build foundations\n*builds pathetic foundation\n- Urgh. Is it done? How do I make it into a house ?? I will build a house !!\n*places more foundations randomly\n-I don't understand!!!\n*after half an hour\n- Whoosh. That looks nice. (multiple story foundations without walls)\n- Now I will produce energy. Fuk yeah. I will get this base up and running boy.\n*builds pathetic solar panel\n- Sooo. How does this work? Oh wait it's nighttime :3\n*waits for sunrise\n\n-Let's go solar panel! Yeah.\n- What's that? Why aren't you producing?\n- Omg I need to connect this to something don't I? Because it would be TOO SIMPLE NOW WOULDN'T IT. \n*opens box\n- Let's see, screw this, screw that, drop that. We can throw that away, I don't even know wtf this is. Hmmm. AHA. Area Power Controller. Yes, sir. This should work.\n- Uuh, where do I put this exactly. Here? *CLUNK\n- Wait, I changed my mind. Wait. Well I guess here it is then. Ok so now what. Omg, there are wires in this box. JESUS.\n*Builds wires all over the base with millions of dead ends\n-IS THAT ENOUGH?? COULD YOU WORK NOW PLEASE??\n\n- I also need to make stairs so I can stop jumping every damn time I want to get on the damn platform that I've built.\n- How do I make stairs? How the fuck ??? Oh wait what is this machine. It looks like... it could produce stairs. I need iron? To make stairs I need iron, ok that's fine. Where is iron then.\n*looks around the dead landscape of the moon\n\n*looks back at pathetic base in general\n-How do I make a room? I wanna make a room :((( How do I make a bed?\n- God I can't accomplish anything in life. I am pathetic!! Look at this fucking thing!!\n- Why is there even food here? How do you eat?\n- wait WHAT IS THAT RED THING FLASHING ON MY SCREEN\n- OMG OXYGEN LOW\n- OXYGEN. HOW TO PRODUCE.\n*suffocates\n\nIt is not a bad game by any means. Just... extremely complicated and I mean extremely. There are several games you could compare this to, games where you build structures and systems in space. But this one is by far superior in complexity to any other game. This is definitely not a game for everyone. I could kinda compare it to Oxygen Not Included of the excellent Klei Entertainment, which is pretty complicated too, but this one is more complicated than that game. Yeah. And I mean O.N.I. was pretty damn complicated for ME.\n\nSo if you are looking for a space base builder with *quick* tutorials and *easy* mechanics that will let you set up shop in a basic base in twenty minutes, stay the fuck away from this game because it doesn't let you do so. You will be frustrated and consider suicide. In fact, my first playthrough (more like my battle against the tutorial) lasted for half an hour. My first real mission tryout took 2 hours. If you are looking for a softer exploration and minor building experience, I highly recommend Astroneer, because Stationeers is absolutely fucking insane. Slapped me in the face during my first playthrough. I mean, that is to be expected of course, but the slap was different than the other games that slapped my face during the first playthrough. In those other games, those slaps in the face taught me things, important things about how NOT to die or how NOT to do things. This one, slapped me in the face for like five times now and I still don't know shit. I read several guides on how to start things going and I still do not know shit. I simply do not understand this game.\n\nIn fact, to build up a tiny room with an airlock and a pathetic single solar panel with some pathetic essential devices lying around, is pretty fucking difficult. It took me 2 hours to build all that. Building a simple room with life support inside is absolutely impossible. Building a simple airlock is absolutely impossible. Actually, there are people who can build these things but they must be fucking engineers in real life because this game....\n\nThere will always be something you overlooked that will screw you  because this game has [h1]~ZERO~[/h1] hand-holding policy. The difficulty level is ridiculous and beyond anything I could compare it to.\n\nIn the end, of course I recommend it, because I can see where this game is going, plus the effort that has gone into it. PLUS, I love the premise of these games, hurtling through space, building things, mining, refining, managing resources and building systems. But my taste is a bit simpler. This game was overkill for me.

SUCK.\n\nThis game appears to be about building and managing a habitat in the harsh environment of an alien world, but it's really about unnecessarily juggling a dozen different hand tools, constantly swapping them from hand to belt to hand to belt because even the simplest actions require using multiple different tools in succession. And you have to constantly manage the state of your tools. You pull out your welder to weld, but it doesn't work because it's off, so you have to examine it to press the button to turn it on. Then you get welding, and the next step needs an angle grinder so you pull that out, and the next step needs a screwdriver so you swap it for your welder, and the next step needs a wrench, then a screwdriver again, then a drill, then a wrench, then congratulations, you built one thing. Now you need to go mine, which requires swapping to an entirely different tool belt, and again you have to examine the mining drill to press the button to turn it on, and you go find some minerals and mine a bit so you can smelt them to make the materials to build the next thing. You finish with that and oops, you never examined your welder to press the off button, so you're out of gas for it, so sorry.\n\nThe tool system is tedious, adds nothing to the game, and destroys any sense of immersion.\n\nTo make matters worse, even though this has been the #1 complaint for a long time, and half the negative reviews are \"this game is amazing but the tool system ruins it\" while half the positive reviews are \"this game is amazing despite the horrid tools system\", the developer seems to think that they're God's gift to user interface design and the tool system is the greatest step forward in game mechanics this century, and they've repeatedly ruled out ever changing anything about it beyond letting you tediously use a mouse instead of tediously using the keyboard. Not only has nobody at the studio ever touched a book on UI design or human/computer interaction, they're aggressively proud of their ignorance.\n\nMaking the entire tool system go away would be a vast improvement and would change this from a negative review to a positive one.", "timestamp_created": 1612689935, "timestamp_updated": 1612689935, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 184, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708330631256103516", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88726507": {"recommendationid": "88726507", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983643293", "num_games_owned": 474, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 22958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1324, "playtime_at_review": 1699, "last_played": 1713664056}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to recommend this game, but I can't.

In order to use some tool or build something using some item, you have to HOLD such tool or item (or both!) in your hand(s). So this may annoy you because you have to constantly switch between different things in your hands. \nYou can't use something from your inventory without holding it in hand.\nAlso not every item can be 'stacked' and some items have somewhat low stack size so your inventory size may feel like it's not enough.\n\n[h3]My experience with the UI:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Primary way to interact with the HUD/UI is to hold LALT key to bring a cursor;\n[*]Once you get used it to it you can switch items fast;\n[*]I use some mods (you can find them on Workshop) to [b]increase[/b] stack size of items so you can fit more identical items in your inventory;\n[*]You can manufacture backpacks/belts and put them inside your inventory and/or another backpacks! By doing so you can increase your inventory size massively;\n[*][b]Current UI is not a problem.[/b] Yes, it could be better but I don't find it annoying. It will not be the deciding factor in whether you gonna like the game or not.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Things that WILL affect the way you play the game:[/h2]\n\u2022 [b]As this is still Early Access,[/b] crucial changes can happen. Game is in active development, new devices and mechanics are being introduced while already existing may be redone completely. There was quite a big update recently in early February ([url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/544550/view/3061854440071616923]The 'Go With The Flow' Update[/url]) that impacted already existing saves because of the new mechanics. So players may needed to rebuild their complex setups to account for these changes. Personally I don't mind since it's a natural evolution of the game.\n\u2022 [b]Graphics performance[/b]. I had to disable shadows because they eat a lot of frame time when you have even several lights (lamps).\n\n[hr][/hr] \n[h2]~6 hrs playtime[/h2]\nI managed to not die in the first days after landing on Mars. It took me a while to understand how to get water, I had no water bottles left and 0% hydration when I finally built Ice Crusher and Bottle Filler to refill my bottles! So far so good, although I decided to restart my game since I had no idea what to do at first and my 'base' turned to be a complete mess.\n\n[h2]~50 hrs playtime[/h2] \nOK, this game sucked me in. I want to admit that while I have ~50 hrs, I haven't really progressed much. I mean, I'm definitely familiar with core game mechanics, items, ways of doing things but I don't have something 'smart' (like something automated). \nI experiment with different machines, tools, build/rebuild different parts of my base.\nI play on the same save (it's on Mars) that I started back when I had ~6 hrs.\nMars is easy by the way, definitely recommend it for beginners.\nAlthough I already died multiple times because of explosions xD \nOne time I literally had over-pressured gas tank in my hand and I wasn't quick enough to throw it away.\n\n[b]Below is my current experience / opinion:[/b]\n\n\u2022 [b]it's a chill game.[/b] You define your challenge. You may want just to build a big base, build some automation for resource production/processing, etc. I'm spending my time currently experimenting with various Advanced Furnace setups (Furnace is a machine to smelt ores into ingots and alloys, you use them to build items and different machines);\n\n\u2022 [b]it looks good.[/b] I mean, it's not something like Satisfactory but for a voxel game it looks good.\nTerrain is procedural generated, you can mine using Mining Drill wherever you want.\nMachines, construction items look good as well. You can build something that will look modern, I especially like blue/red lighting combo, looks futuristic xD;\n\n\u2022 [b]it looks mature[/b]. This game is being developed for several years already so things work, core gameplay looks solid. I never thought 'that looks half-baked'. Also I haven't experienced any crashes for my entire playtime;\n\n\u2022 [b]this is a game where you need to think.[/b] You deal with physical problems. You need to setup power production, gas collection and processing, you have to deal with atmospherics pressure and temperature, think of ways to build your power grid, regulate atmosphere inside your base (filtrate pollutants, bring Oxygen etc), plan building pipes for gases and water, etc.\n\n\u2022 [b]for me mining is boring.[/b] I played honest ~25-30 hrs before I got some mods that drastically increase amount of ore you get from mining and decrease ore rarity in the world. This is a cheat though, I decided to use it because I don't have much free time to play it and I didn't want to spend my time mining instead of doing something actually useful;\n\n\u2022 [b]there is in-game reference accessible by pressing F1 key[/b] but it's far away from being actual documentation of available things and mechanics. I often needed to lookup some info online or experiment on my own;\n\n\u2022 [b]UI and inventory management could be better.[/b] Maybe some radial menu would be better to quickly switch between hands and inventory items.

The development seems to be a burning hot mess for quite some time now and the developers don't care about community input. They rather break the game even more with new \"content\" than fixing issues that are around since day one. On top of that they have the audacity to add overpriced DLCs for cosmetics that are so basic that they should be included for free.\n\n---\n\nI played Stationeers for 570+ hours, so naturally i encontered countless bugs and illogicalities within this game. A whole lot of those issues exist since day one, but instead of fixing existing issuses the developers rather add new bug-ridden \"content\" that nobody asked for. The best example for this was the introduction of water-pipes that rendered all your previous savegames basically usesless. Also, they removed the settings for the food and hydration needs of your characters, leaving you with no other choice but to play at default survival settings which means sipping your water bottle every 5min. Also since day one, your tiny helmet-light consumes 15x more power than your suits whole life-support-system.\n\nThe biggest issue i always had with this game is the inability to form closed-cycle-system due to illogical (and physically incorrect) resscource handling. For example burning a H2/O2 fuel mix produces pure CO2 instead of water. Hydroponics \"destroy\" water by growing plants and the resulting food doesn't even give you hydration in return. On the other hand, you can still produce an infinite amount of N2 due to a bug in the combustion cycle.\n\nThe UI navigation and the entry-level of survival is a big show-stopper for many new players. All of my friends would have stopped playing this game after 20min if i had not guided them step-by-step on the way to their first little habitat.\n\nOverall, this game is very inconsistent in its development state. A lot of things feel botched at best. If the developers continue at this rate, you can expect the game to leave Early Access in the 2040s, long after NASA finished the Artemis program.", "timestamp_created": 1665074636, "timestamp_updated": 1665074636, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705202579498291016", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66628065": {"recommendationid": "66628065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021396321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1593849558}, "language": "english", "review": "To be fair to the developers, they do warn that \"this is not a causal game\".

Certain realism eg. you have 2 hands, and you can only hold 1 item on 1 hand at a time - set the game interface different from typical UI.

VERY Complete Thermodynamic and Gas simulation. \n2. Very Complete game for being in pre-alpha. Almost all of the core gameplay is already there, and it's largely bug free in my experience\n3. Getting and mining resources is the right level of difficult, you have to do it, but they are abundant enough that you make significant progress in a day. \n4. The dev made a really good job of making exploring at night undesirable, which makes sense since you're on the fkin moon. \n5. Dropping oxite in your base will actually overpressure and blow everything around in the wind, very fun!\n6. Cabling stuff is actually pretty intuitive\n7. They've got computers and some logic stuff in place already. I like that\n8. This game actually requires cooperation! I became unconscious while mining and a buddy had to come get me, navigate me through the airlock pressurize and take my helmet off for me. It was neato\n9. The voxel mining in this is a great compromise between abstraction and making it realistic. The landscape is low poly which means that you can actually make a flat floor while mining. \n10. A cave will actually hold an atmosphere if it's airtight!\n\nCONS:\nI don't really like the control scheme but it's design was based off of old SS13 so whatever\nI'd like suit modules that you can put in to give you information about your suit / oxygen / fuel whatever\nA lot of the game is just swapping batteries, it would be nice if there was a kind of base battery\nA couple small audio bugs\n\nOverall I really like it, it's hard, rewards cooperation and is a fun time with friends. \n", "timestamp_created": 1516121766, "timestamp_updated": 1516121766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698758840560913086", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117459351": {"recommendationid": "117459351", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961059152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10588, "last_played": 1696700951}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of the greatest and most in-depth simulation games I've played.

This game has been alot of fun, but it def is not for everyone. I would recommend this game for people who are looking for complex problem solving and simulated space enviroments.

The cycling between using both hands is intergral to the gameplay mechanics, simulating both hands allows for more complex actions that would otherwise be hard to implement if the controls were more simple like a Minecraft hotbar. Having two hands allows the combined usage of items and honestly it doesnt take that long to learn and the tutorial provided in the game quickly shows you how it works. \nNext is the inventory system which is again, very close to SS13's. You have pockets or inventory slots determined by what you are wearing and at first it may be a little confusing because it is different it is not that hard to learn if you just apply a little time.\n\nOnce you learn the controls and inventory systems you can start the game.

As you read, you will come across the updates I have made.*\n\nI want to love this game. But for all the good aspects, there is 3 times the frustration. First off, its a hard learning curve. But once you get the hang of it, the game becomes second nature. So I wouldn't say it is as hard as some people are making it sound. It is all about learning the \"game mechanics\". The game has potential. It can be fun building stuff out, then going back to make upgrades or repairs. It gives you that feel that you are really there doing the work.\n\nIt has a great community of players (some that are slowly getting frustrated), and the devs are doing their best.\n\nHowever, here are some of the negative points - and these really need to be addressed\n\n1 - The inventory system. It is bad. Telling people you will get used to it with practice is not \"a fix\". I have been playing for almost 2 months. I am used to it. In fact,\nI am pretty fast with it. It still sucks. It needs a re-work. \n\n2 - Bugs. This game feels more buggy than when I first bought it. And that was before they went from the \"Unstable\" to \"Expect bugs\" status. There are more bugs now. I understand its early access, but I have played games in Earlier Access than this, and not had the type of problems this game brings. Crashes, unexpected death, items disappearing into the ground, jumping over something sends you jumping over your entire base, not being able to walk up stairs, getting stuck on ladders, etc. Also, when you bring this up in discord, you are told to restart the game if things stop working. REALLY?! I shouldn't have to restart a game. (It takes long enough for that! See point 4)\n\n3 - NO PAUSE! How can a game not have a pause?! \n\n4 - Load times. I find that as your session saves get bigger, the load times increase to ridiculous waits. A current game I am loading has to take 4:30 seconds to load, and it is a small base.\n\nUPDATE: They have made some improvements and load times are up about 40%, but still an issue with larger bases.\n\n5 - Logic Chips. I hate them. I don't use them because they are too clunky and they take up too much space. SUGGESTION: Create a menu system where the user can click on an item and set the parameters right there. Most automation games already do this. I shouldn't have to lay big ugly chips all over a floor, and spend over an hour setting up logic arguments to regulate temperature. For example: There should be something like a temp regulator and when I click on it, I can set min and max values and select an action to occur when those values are met. This should be for every logic item. It would make life more simple. \n\nWith all being said, I will say this - the game has potential if just the things I listed get addressed and fixed.\n\nBut I can not recommend this game. Sorry. Now this does not mean the game is bad and you shouldn't buy it. However, I have a problem telling someone else how to spend their money. Buy the game knowing it has issues, some of which might persuade you to ask for a refund.\n\nHopefully it will change for the better. I will keep an eye out for progress. On another note - attacking my review by saying I can't solve problems, or I am not smart enough to play it, or that this \"genre\" of game is not for me,  - and that is why I left the negative review - is ridiculous. First off, I am an engineer in the tech field, so solving problems is what I do everyday. Second, Its a review of a product that I paid money for, therefore I reserve the right to give \"my opinion\" of it. If you don't like the opinion or review that is fine. You are entitled to yours, and I won't attack it. Also, it is not a Negative Review. My review talks about positives and negatives.

The complexity of the \"engineering\" is on par with the expectations created by other games like Space Engineer and modded Minecraft. \n\nObviously, at such an early development stage, you can't expect a full, working game with all the bells and whistles. The UI is extremely clunky and horrifyingly difficult to get used to, I kept randomly getting blown up for no apparent reason (or really, no reason given), it took 4 tries for my friend to be able to connect to my game. The game crashed twice, and for some reason exited to the main menu once for no reason either. \n\nThere's also a complete lack of any soundscape - you'll find yourself wondering if your sound is still working until you weld something, because there's no breathing, footsteps, ambiance music, nothing. The silence is deafening.\n\nThe placement of items, especially pipes and wires, is awkward and needs some work. And, space management is an issue, partially due to the aformentioned UI horrors. It seems throwing stuff on the ground is probably your best bet - even the devs do that on their own streams, so definitely it needs work. \n\nHOWEVER, all those failures in design are excusable - this is an UNSTABLE ALPHA GAME, if you think you can just waltz in and get your money's worth, you need to rethink your expectations of early access games.

Memories of when Space Engineers or Empyrion went EA come to mind. There are mechanics and the supporting content but not much in the way of a game currently.  I'd wager that you'd get burnt out on it before it develops into something more interesting. We're probably talking years until that happens. \n\nAs to the game, I bought it because I look forward to the manufacturing mechanics.  I was a fan of IndustrialCraft or Terrafirmacraft in Minecraft.  I felt that so many games just abstracted away the manufacturing process and its challenges.  Making steel IRL is an involved process as is creating computer parts.  \n\nHowever I am very concerned about how they are going to make a game of it.  The key issue with the sandbox is how to make it engaging.  I started to hate Space Engineers because it got to the point of \"Why?\". I could build a replica of some ship from some IP but or go to that moon, but ultimately there was no reason in the game to do so.  There are so many other games in the survival sandbox genre already that are little more than a box of Legos.  If that's what you are looking for, by all means this game will appeal.  But for me and I think others, without long term goals beyond the next tech tier, its just not fun.\n\nThey have plenty of gameplay elements but how they put them together will be the key issue to track.  Will there be a compelling reason to create a greenhouse other than for the sake of filling a hunger bar?  Are NPCs just going to be present as traders and mindless baddies to shoot at?  Or ultimately, am I building for the sake of building?  The survival genre is littered with games that failed to get past these points.  So for now, add this game to your wishlist and keep track of it.", "timestamp_created": 1515595516, "timestamp_updated": 1515595516, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679469645023345947", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1532100722, "developer_response": "Your concerns about sandbox base-building games lacking an answer to the question 'why' are indeed valid ones, and ones we've shared throughout development up to this point.

This time very deep and for hours and hours... :) Meanwhile I have 1100h in game and there is no reason to not give a \"thumps up\" rating! Well done, devs. \nThe last massive updates and complete rework of the basics results in a much better game! Thx devs!\n\n\n[b]Edit Nov. 2020:[/b]\nBack again to this game after a long break. Read often about the past updates.\nMy main topics in the past reviews were the micro lag every ten seconds and the buggy new features that will never be fixed.\nDid not dive so deep in the game this time and trying until now about 8 hours of gameplay... \nThe micro lag is gone! :) After loading an old save game I got 60fps (in the past it was about 30fps) without any freezing. Wow! Well done, was my first thought... However, after some hours in gameplay where I deconstruct many parts of my base to rebuild it, it appears that the freeze has changed to a \"warp\". \nI noticed that every second the fps falls from 60 to 40 for half a second. While moving the character in the base this will result in a position warp. It doesn't freeze anymore it \"skips\" the freeze now and while running the character warps a bit in move direction, which feels like a jerky movement. The technical problem is still there, but solved in another way. Definitely a better way than a micro freeze. Nevertheless, after some hours in game it feels still buggy.\n\nAdditionally I noticed the character movement is still very \u201cstraight\u201d. If i.e. the shoulder touches a wall just a little bit, the character being blocked and you are forced to do a step to the side\u2026 In many other games the character gets an impulse from this little impact and the direction of movement gets distracted and you will not be blocked. This is a little bit annoying after hours in game.\n\nI tried many of the new features like the new rocket that can fly to another planet. It is a shame a little bit, that the original ship seems to be abandoned. Would be much more fun to build an own rocket with free amount of thrusters\u2019 and handmade systems.. But this is complex and always marked as none working. Now you just print the parts of the rocket. I think better a simple working solution than a complex/interesting none working solution, so I was happy to see the rocket. Flew with it from my home base to mars - and needed about ~10 tries not being bugged at rocket launch. Most of the time the game get confused after launch...  Either landed somewhere in space and stuck there or getting to Mars without the cargo or [\u2026] Nice, but buggy...\n\nIn the last two big updates, I read much of the new Stationpedia - an in game help system. Looks cool, looks complete - wow! However, as usual only at first look. While rebuilding the heater system in my base I needed help for some items. Like \"How much pressure a door can resist? Or \"How I have to use the new dirt canister\" Or \"Which integer number is for colour blue at the LED?\" \"How much power a volume pump needs?\" Stationpedia does not answer any of these questions. Good thought, but only useless information in it. About an LED it just says that it is paintable, at which temperature it starts to burn and it lists the logic properties including \"colour\" but without the important details. \n\nBTW, the LED is still buggy as it was at last review - setting a color \"works\" but the house of the LED shine alway white - only the shadow is colored. Im sure I am not the first person who detects this bug... Why should I report this bug to your Jira? If this simple bug didn't get fixed in 6 months the reason is not not a missing bug report...\n\nSo I googled external wikis to learn how a dirt canister should be used. A new terraforming tool! Cool :) But you may expect - it does not work - buggy! Not a minor hidden bug - a bug which is obviously, which occurs after 10 seconds of using the new tool. I am again disappointed to see that the quality did not really changed :/\n\nBut there are positive changes, too. The sound getting much love from the dev. Much more atmospheric feeling with reverb effects in big buildings, creaking walls with pressure new the limit. Excellent!\nFinally the time has come the devs stopped the absolute annoying strong atmospheric winds while mining, which whirl your body around\u2026 Love this!\n\nI had a bad feeling to leave a negative review for this game I spent almost 800 hours in. Which was much fun and some frustration. Which is a brilliant idea and addresses a special group of gamers that like this kind of complexity. Of course, the fun was much more than the frustration - I never reach 800h of gameplay if it were the opposite. \nBasically the game deserves a positive review because it has so much content and endless hours of gameplay\u2026 Nevertheless, the missing love for the details deserves the negative. Compared with the EA of Factorio there are huge differents in qualitiy. They used beta for unfinished stuff and the release was always absolute stable.\n\nProbably after some time I come back to Stationeers to review my review again and are hopeful to change it to a positive one. It does not take much for that, dear devs \u2013 Shift the priorities a bit more to  quality for the release. The Stationpedia is a good example \u2013 who needs an in game help with useless information? Answer: Nobody. Just fanboys are happy with it.  It so simple - use the beta for half implemented stuff (to get feedback for fine tuning) and use the EA-release for working stuff.\n\n\n\n[b]Edit on February 2019:[/b]\nWanted to give it another chance, got deep into the game again, and tried the new stable branch. \nUnfortunately, nothing has changed at the developing concept. Well known bugs do not get fixed and a new update gets some new features but as usual breaks well working existing features. Reporting them will be ignored. \nThere seems to be no quality control/play testing for the stable release? If they decide to make a release, even untested features of the beta get into the stable. Therefore, the game has many small issues, which are annoying to live with. \n\nThe latest stable took many weeks to be released and I was hopeful they are working on the well-known core problems like the lag/freezing mentioned below. No change :(\nAt a point it gets almost unplayable. The lag happens so often, that flying around will smash you to a wall and the hypersensitive suit (One of the well-known bugs never got fixed) breaks and kills you. With some practice and being careful, you can avoid this \u2013 but that is exactly the thing \u2013 many issues you need to take care of.\n\n\n[b]Original review:[/b]\n\nAt current state I can not recommend this game. Too much anoying problems which will not be addressed by the devs. Reporting this bugs on discord won't be noticed because of the massive message amount there and a chaotic bug tracking of the devs. \nFor months there is an unsolved problem with a massive lag in the game. Devs know about it and said its a garbage collector problem.  It freezes the game every ~ten seconds for about half a second. As more mining you do and exploring the planet, the more the lag will happen. \n\nI wish they would more focus on these seroius problems instead adding more and more silly content like working on a beard charakter face. Bugs with ladders which will break your suit are untouched for months.\n\nIt is a great game but currently only playable for 10 hours until the lag gets too heavy. Yes, it is early access but the development is chaotic. Even the stable version is updated once a week  and full of bugs.\n@ Devs: Less is more sometimes! One stable version a month would be enough.

The atmospheric system is \"the\" complex system, which has obvious and unnecessary shortcomings. With so much attention given to temperature and pressure mechanics, somehow they managed to miss some of the most basic concepts like while heat increases pressure, pressure increases should also generate heat, but don't. The same is true of the inverse. The game decreases pressure when you cool a gas, but forgets that simply decreasing pressure and allowing gas to expand should also provide a cooling effect.  The first one is the key principal of how diesel engines work the second is the foundational concept of refrigeration and air conditioning. \n\nEvery other system in the game is waved away from elementary school level questions with magic. \n\n Power is reduced to just a simple wattage calculation: watts produced - watts consumed. The only depth offered is in the max wattage a cable can carry. What makes this sad is that the real calculation isn't that complex. Its the most basic algebra equation you can make with multiplication and division. Its a two term solve for X equation using  Voltage, Amperage, and Resistance. We don't even need to complicate it with Current types. DC power is all that is needed as the whole purpose behind AC power is for transmission over a long distance.   Watts, under and overloads, as well as  heat transfer to atmosphere from power consumption can be derived from the basic power equation, trivially. \n\nConsiderations to planet composition are an instant face palm.  You land on an Ice moon ( a Water Ice Moon), and the terrain is not actually Ice. It's just voxel \"soil\" and you have to search for water Ice as mineral deposits.  Or you can land on Mars but can't process the soil or rock for resources. Instead, we have this ultra visible shiny node system that spawns pure elements. Most of them require an active hydro-logical system to produce.  Humanity hasn't relied on this type of visibly pure ore's for more than a couple hundred of years. Yeah we look for red to indicate Iron, but we don't look for shiny iron metal in the ground.  Even so, the Chemistry level is nonsensical and only gets a few basic things correct directly applied to human life support and only then at standard sea level pressures. No Nitrogen narcosis at high pressure or the need for pure Oxygen at low pressures. \n\nThe developers added a DLC Alien character that should immediately detonate when it breathes because it breathes-in one element then exhales two completely different elements. In order for that to happen it's lungs have to be a Nuclear Fusion generator as hot as the core of a star going supernova.  Boom! They didn't even have to add any other gasses to make it work. It could have been as simple as it breathes in Hydrogen and exhales Water,  a chemical that at least contains one common element. Or it breathes in Nitros Oxide and exhales pure Nitrogen. Both situations keeping the desired incompatibility with Human requirements. They even could have made the Aliens breathe Hydrocarbons (C, H, and O), making co-habitation with a human as dangerous as routing the exhaust from a car into the passenger compartment.   \n\nAbsolutely everything we know about what the actual survival requirements will be on other planets is Chemistry based. To have that glossed over is insulting.  To have it glossed over, while providing much more difficult to balance and operate atmospheric systems, plus needing programming for end game content,  is cognitively dissonant. \n\nThe most telling design failure of predicting the intelligence level of it's player base, is that the most common questions everyone asks are \"Why is there Coal, a fossil Fuel, on places with no fossils or life?\" and \"How is there solid Oxygen, Hydrogen, and Water Ice on planets that can melt my space suit or have molten lava exposed every few feet?\" \n\nHaving said all of that, the lack of anything better, still makes this the best option for technical immersion out there, but then its bound to be as limiting as having only one politician run in a political race.", "timestamp_created": 1653985866, "timestamp_updated": 1653985866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676773726940155029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55517657": {"recommendationid": "55517657", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960512590", "num_games_owned": 572, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 5703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2213, "last_played": 1656272341}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as I enjoy(ed) this game, I cannot support developers who release paid DLC during early access.\n\nDean Hall, stop your cash grab idea porn.

Conceptually, this should be right up my street. But sadly in execution it's very unrewarding as a builder or survival game, mostly thats down to one of the worst control & UI designs I've ever seen.\n\nStationeers sells itself on it's complexity and realism but I found the systems, progression and building very limited and not very logical. The complexity is largely crammed into the UI and control scheme. Everything action requires going through multiple clicks and menus.\n\nFor instance, deconstructing something usually requires several different tools. But the game limits you to 2 hands only. Thats fine, realistic etc as you only have two hands. So you start thinking its logical. But then you realise to change tools, you have different tool belts which are stored in a back pack and require switching to \"cursor\" mode to navigate. Logic not so important then...  You pick the tool you need, and the UI promptly closes the inventory you need, but opens all the others. So you have to go back, close those, find the one you need again and open that.\nFollowing a logical approach while learning does not help at all. Once you get that you need 3 of 6 different tools to deconstruct anything, as a gamer you start looking for patterns, to understand the rules. Maybe smaller objects need a drill but larger ones need an angle grinder. Maybe you are supposed to use the screwdriver 1st to take out screws, then a crowbar to prise out the panels before angle grinding the frame? But no, it doesn't. Its seemingly random and hardly ever the logical solution. \n\nAnd your reward? Well no sense of realism as it largely doesn't follow any logic or rules. Achievement? well you've gone through an arduous amount of menus and clicks, only to achieve removing something. Its neither rewarding nor fun.\n\nThe parts that should be deep and complex, base design, creating electrical grids to power your machines, processing materials are pretty thin with little to no options on approaches to learn. Again all the complexity resides in the button clicks & menus. There is a severe lack of information and feedback so you are required to watch videos and read wikis. \n\nUltimately it devolves into a preset patterns. You only have enough materials to build the same kind of starting hab and then the same order of survival resources production, then the same order of material processing. Theres none of the gradual tech progression, flexible approaches and tool/material upgrades as you go. You have exactly the right amount of stuff to do one building path. If you deviate from that you die. \n\nThe control scheme as well seems to have been designed to frustrate. With the exception of WSAD, every control seems to have been picked from a list of \"Common PC game buttons\" that has been mixed up in a bag so it always does something completely different to what you would naturally expect.\n\nOverall the skeleton of a good game is there. The current experience is frustrating and unrewarding. But If the dev can separate mechanics that have a point and add to atmosphere and game-play, and the ones that just stall and interrupt game-play without any real purpose, then this could still turn into a good game.", "timestamp_created": 1579537726, "timestamp_updated": 1579537726, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673545479774475098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118522674": {"recommendationid": "118522674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257218031", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1689008053}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game, but has Huge Bugs.\nFor example:\nWhen you load a Save Game and your Friend Joins, you'll be stuck in the Pause Message and can't play anymore.\nSo you must play it in 1 playthrough or play Alone.\n\nAs long as this bug isn't fixed, this will be a No for me.\n\nEdit:\nThe MP Bug was fixed, so like i said i will change my recommendation to a Yes!", "timestamp_created": 1657386795, "timestamp_updated": 1657885284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.67302018404006958", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1657685271, "developer_response": "Good news - this has been fixed!\n\nYou should be able to play with your friends from saved games and regular games just fine.\n\nWe're squashing bugs regularly, so every piece of feedback like this helps us hugely. \n\n(If this issue still happens for you, email support@rocketwerkz.com and we'll see what we can do to sort it out.)"}, "49664781": {"recommendationid": "49664781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133177581", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 6195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4561, "last_played": 1596741133}, "language": "english", "review": "I am hooked.

It is excessively complex. While indeed the game is trying for a realism approach, the [i] game [/i] would be more enjoyable for the player if the UI was a bit more streamlined. It's just too many steps to do tiny things.\n\nThere are some significant bugs, especially major stuttering when you build a large enough base and have explored enough of the world. Obviously this is an early access, and hopefully this will improve but it's absolutely worth mentioning.\n\nMost of all, the documentation for this game is nonexistent. The game is [i] very [/i] complex, which is great, but it's no fun having to get your hand held by YouTube videos just to figure out anything more complex than what the tutorial lays out. Having to watch a video of someone else doing a complex task ruins it for you. This game desperately needs some proper documentation on advanced topics so players can figure out things on their own. \n\nIf you [i] really [/i] think you're going to be into this style of game, it might be worth the money right now; but if you have any doubt in your mind that you might not like this, I would definitely recommend waiting.", "timestamp_created": 1547618543, "timestamp_updated": 1547618543, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667716085910797119", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1658219722, "developer_response": "We recently completed a full refactor of the project that should address many of these problems.

Realistic base building, in realistic vacuum with deep gas plumbing, electrical, logic, health and hunger systems.  Death is meaningful and the world on the otherside of your visor will kill you quick.  This is really a simulation more than a game and it will not hold your hand and whisper it loves you in your ear.  Interface is challenging to new players due to being able to equip and use items in each hand, however it allows for more complex actions over traditional one handed game mechanics once you get the hang of it.  Totally open and deadly worlds, if you can dream it, you can build it if the environment doesn't kill you first.  There is multiplayer coop and it works well.  If you and your friends are into deep building mechanics in a hostile and realistic environment, this is the game to get.\n\nOne of the best EA games based on building and survival that I have purchased and I don't mind supporting the devs.  Game is updated often and regularly.
