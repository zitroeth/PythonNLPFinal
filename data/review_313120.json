You've been warned.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nTutorial:\nbasically useless.\nI had to figure stuff out myself.\nThis would have been fine, but if you put a tutorial in a game, please try to make it actually helpful.\n\nI strongly dislike the combat in this game:\nthe AI is dumb af. Either they are running away from you, or they will just headon fight you to the death.\nThe bossfights are very annoying and take ages, because they are bulletsponges, even with high skills and the best weapons. (possibly several ingame days).\nOf cause you could call this \"challanging\", but its clearly not the way I would want it from a game.\n\nRessources:\nI dont understand a lot of the logic behind the ressources in this game.\nThe only fully grown trees you can cut down are palms. Other big trees you simply can not interact with, wich does not make sense to me.\nTrees will not regrow, which is fine, bot neither will flowers you picked and I dont get why this is, because you can clearly plant them in a farmplot. Just so you actually have to use the farmplot?\nbig BS if you ask me, especially because the remnants of those flowers will stay there for every, like a grave saying \"this used to be the home of an innocent flower UNTIL A BARBARIC MONSTER CAME AND RIPPED THEM OUT!\"\nAnother thing I dont get is, why cou can not pick up certain items. I can carrie a fully loaded chest with 5 logs in them. why cant I carry one empty oil-barrel? Yes, you can drag them, but not put them in your inventory.\n\nStory:\nIf you can call it that... At some point you have to fill up a container with food, but this container does not give a single soletary flying f*** abut what food you give them or if it is even prepared and that just doesnt make any sense to me.\n\nBuilding a raft:\nThis could not be more static.\nI understand that this is not meant to be a game where you only leave your raft to gather ressources, since this is not \"raft\"(the game), but it is not very fullfilling to see how limited the options are when it comes to building yoiur raft and especially to build stuff on top of it.\nBuilding doesnt feel very polished either.\n\nGame-map:\nyou get a map even before you start the game, but I dont understand why there is no option to have a map in game. The only orientation you get are the ocean current, the sun and a compass. Not what I would expect from a game like this. but thats just me being salty I guess.\n\nI really liked the concept of the game, but the way it was made in the end, completely destroyed the fun for me and I got more frustrated with every day that passed.\nI'll rather go back to raft and put a couple of hundred hours into that.\n\nIf you made it to this point, thank you for taking the time to actually read it.\nI hope it helps to figure out if this game is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1708169341, "timestamp_updated": 1708169341, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664361894130706787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161933488": {"recommendationid": "161933488", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976439164", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "playtime_at_review": 9617, "last_played": 1713740352}, "language": "english", "review": "If you ever watched the movie Cast Away (2000, with Tom Hanks) and said to yourself something like \"being stranded on a desert island and having to save myself would be interesting\" this might be for you.

My friend gifted it to me on Steam so we can play together in Co-op mode because his daughter and wife hijacked his console and now he can only play on PC. I know, poor guy, right?\n\n I like that it is a play at your own pace survival game. Co op is the only multiplayer  feature and I like that I can play with friends without having to deal with the sweaty multiplayer aspect. The colors are very rich on Steam, it makes my console color look flat, and I use the same TV for both console and PC. The environmental and ambient sounds and musical cues feel natural and are not to obvious. They blend well with the game play.\n\n There are 3 things that  I would like to see change in the Steam version. The first one is due to my preference to  play with a controller instead of mouse and keyboard.\n\n 1)  often times my player will walk diagonally after walking over something in the environment. It makes it so that even though you have continuously pressed up on the left stick your player crab walks, they do not return to straight forward unless you stop pressing forward and then reapply forward to the stick. This does not occur when I play the game with mouse and keyboard or on Xbox console, using the same controller.\n\n2) the items you equip to your tool belt still occupy slots in your inventory. I think it would be better if they either added an inventory slot for each of the tool belts you have crafted, or add a second inventory in the Quick Equip menu wheel solely \nfor the 4 items you choose for your tool belt. \n\n3) the crafting menu does not have the option to build towers. Towers are handy for both observation points and landmarking at long distances while afloat.\n\n I am a huge fan of the movie Castaway so this game is easy to like.

I am fully aware that it is early days, but i'm also aware they're open to suggestions. I recommend the game as it stands, if you are happy funding development for a game that has SO MUCH potential, and a few solid hours of enjoyment in it's current state.\n\nThings i'd personally like to see:\n\n-Less sharks (they should be terrifying when encountered, dangerous depending on the species, and you shouldn't be able to swim as fast as them and kill them with your pocket knife. Get rid of that stupid music too, a shark attack should be unexpected, this isn't Jaws.)\n-You should be able to break your raft if you hit it with a sharp object... if you're stupid enough to attack your boat, you deserve to die.\n-More island variations: It feels that every island is 'roughly' the same size, and they're all spread out at equal distances... perhaps a few islands linked together, maybe a big island with cliffs (give an element to exploring the land as well as the sea).\n-Seabirds, with eggs that you can steal to eat!\n-Saltwater crocs (danger in the shallows and on the land)\n-A character screen: Being able to equip items would make this game so much fun, like piecing together some torn rags to help shelter your skin from the sun, or making a crappy little hat to help prevent dehydration. Also when you get the diving gear, it gives a chance to equip it/unequip it...\n-Blood: Having 'blood' to monitor might be interesting too, as cutting yourself could lead to unwanted attention in the water... you should be able to fashion bandages to stop the bleeding, giving a new element to your survival.\n-Sharp coral in the shallows (in some places). This will make you have to be careful where you come ashore, as you could cut your feet.\n-Clams\n-illness: I want the fact I don't have a shelter, and it pisses it down with rain, to kill me. Or if I cut myself and don't bother rubbing that one special plant on the wound, the infection to kill me.\n-Variations on underwater wrecks (big/small boats, war planes, a lost town which was swallowed by the ocean!?)\n-Rocks pools (with the crabs in them... instead of just randomly on the beach at 'crab nests') I hate the fact the crabs are so easy to find... this game needs to be about scavenging and surviving, not just sitting and cooking crab after crab.\n-All trees should be destroyable for wood.\n-Torches (as in a fire torch)\n-The ability to build bigger better rafts! Most the time you're traveling, until you find that one 'BIG' island, with the resources to survive, you need to travel, so why not be able to pimp your ride? A wind sail from palm leaves or a rudder from wood. Places to store supplies on rafts.\n-Bee/wasp nests (you need a torch/smoke to obtain the honey safely)\n-Scorpions/Snakes/Spiders: You'll have to be careful where you tread (also going back to clothing, you can fashion shoes from coconut husks to protect your feet)\n***Fires should be maintainable instead of having to make a new one each time (ALREADY IN)\n-More interactive surroundings: For example, I think bigger stones should be movable, so you can stack them to make walls. The starfish should be movable too,  so if you want to pick one up and throw it, why not?\n-More building options: I'm tired of this 'minecraft' style building option all games give... The shelters in the game look more like something the sims would offer. I want to see actual shelters you can build, cut two trees down, place them over the top of  a boat on its side for supports, lash together palm leaves for a roof - bam a shelter. For example, making the rope a 'pin' object would be interesting, so you can 'pin' two items together, and create your own shelters this way.\n-Schools of fish\n-Coral reefs\n-Great white sharks remade (bigger for one thing... and at the moment they look like they're from pixar films)\n-Cave systems to explore (both on islands and in the water)\n-Berries (eat them at your own risk, some are poisonous)\n-A diary\n-More options for various items (improved camp fires? for example, a camp fire 'pit' (requires stones, shovel and more wood). \n\nBasically, to sum it up, I feel the game lacks the survival and creativity it potentially has.

That was Friday. On Tuesday, the devs showed up with the hotfix. Not only did they fix the raft, they improved and patched a whole laundry list of stuff. And added whales! Attentive and competent.\n\nWhy is this the first thing I'm telling you about Stranded? Because it's Early Access, which means \"Dev Attentiveness\" is everything. I couldn't even think of reviewing this game until we'd seen them in action, at least once. Now we have seen them in action, and it was quite impressive. Not unlike the game itself.\n\nStranded is a beautiful little shipwrecked simulator. It's very basic right now, but what's here is all well done, and they've got some clever ideas. \n\nCrafting, for example, forgoes the usual subscreen, and revolves around you piling up the materials on the ground, in physical proximity. Want a spit to cook by your campfire? You can't just build a spit and place it. You can only do it if the materials are right there, next to the fire. It's tactile. It's vaguely clunky, but it's very organic. You feel like you're really standing there, trying, like Robinson Crusoe, to forge a life out of sticks and palm fronds.\n\nThe islands are another interesting design choice. They're very small, and fairly anemic. Sticks and rocks and Yuca twine. The vast majority of the game is actually out there, under the water, with the sharks. Old shipwrecks and reefs and lost containers and such. The sharks are scary. If you're from the ocean/shark phobia branch of unreasonable fears, like myself, you will find the sharks, and their obligatory accompanying obo (edit: piano) music, genuinely terrifying. The sum of all this is that you're in a hyper relaxing tropical island coconut eating game, but if you want to get anything done, you have to get in the water, and play an intensely stressful horror game with roaming bull and tiger sharks. Neat stuff.\n\nIt's all gorgeous, as the screenshots suggest. You'd never know the title was indie, or early access, by glancing at it. I thought the whales were good news, not just because whales are cool, but because it shows us that these devs are invested in their wildlife. Anyone who's played The Forest can attest to how much a robust ecosystem adds to a setting like this one.\n\nAt this point, I only have one major complaint, and that's the ocean. The ocean is too calm. It's beautiful, and the part where it has depth and you're constantly trying to figure out what's below you is amazing and immersive, but you're way off in the pacific someplace, and sea is calm as can be. Even the Gulf Coast of Florida has itty bitty waves. After the great rolling oceans of Assassin's Creed Black Flag, and the slightly less mountainous but still very rolling seas of this game's own indie cousin, Salt, the planar ocean of Stranded is like a dead rat in the punch bowl. In most games, it wouldn't matter so much, but the ocean is the star of Stranded; it rarely, if ever, leaves center stage. The fact that it is lifeless as a dish towel never stops feeling wrong.\n\nAside from that, I can't think of anything to complain about. Had they not just introduced the whales, I would worry about the sharks being too large and scary, and wish for a wider variety of sharks, including all the relatively pleasant ones that fill the real oceans. (Back in the 70s, sharks hired Steven Spielberg as a PR guy, and it was kind of a disaster. It would be nice if Stranded helped them dig out of that, a little.) But, whales. There's probably all kinds of critters coming. If there are still no nice sharks a year from now, I'll come edit this paragraph.\n\nTL;DR - Great start on a shipwrecked simulator. Devs seem to care. All is beautiful. Oceans too flat. Sharks need friends.

I would like to also state, that at the time of writing this review, I only have 3 hours of playtime - and so this is more of a first impression.\n\n[h1]The Positives[/h1]\nUnique game idea. Cast away being one of my favourite movies, it feels great to relive Tom Hank's struggle! And yes, it is possible to get Wilson!\n\nThis game is visually [i]gorgeous.[/i] The sunrises and sunsets look real. The colours spread across the whole sky, and it is absolutely breathtaking. These graphics add a sense of immersion to which I have not experienced in many other games before. \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=380387079\n[i]A sunrise in Stranded Deep[/i]\n\nThe game is realistic (at times). Chipping away at a tree, then finally seeing it fall down is truley incredible, and in my opinion, much better than the Forest. This is as the tree doesn't simply split into pieces like it does in the Forest, but rather you must further cut the tree into logs, and then sticks. Again, this adds another sense of immersion to the game, making the player feel as though they are in fact stranded.\n\n[h1]The Negatives[/h1]\nThe game feels a bit too easy, and repetitive. You can go without eating or drinking for 2-3 days without consequence, even so, there are millions of coconuts lying around which you can drink, and 3 or 4 potato plants in each island in which regrow after a day. It is near impossible to die from hunger or thirst. I would have liked to have seen them focus more on making actual survival hard, rather than worrying about that shark (that in my opinion adds nothing to the game).\n\nCurrently, there is no end game (although they have stated that it is in the works). This wouldn't be a problem at all if actual survival was challenging. \n\nBase building is useless. So what you build a 3x3 home? You just have to move to another island at somepoint anyway. Would be better if they focused more on being able to build an awesome raft, as building a home is useless, and being mobile is key. \n\n[h1]The Verdict[/h1]\nIf survival is your type of game, and/or you loved the movie Cast Away, I would definitely reccomend purchasing this game as is, now! It has so much potential, and I hope to see so many more features in the future. All up, I will give it a 7/10 in it's current state, however it definitely has the potential to be the best survival game on the market.\n\nThank you for reading, should you have a question, feel free to comment, or even add me.

The sense of exploration and adventure in this title is amazing, I often found myself needing a little courage before jumping in the water out of fear of tiger sharks or any of the other predators that lie about. Attention to detail is quite nice to, I killed a crab with my knife and then ate it to which I took damage (I'm assuming either by the shell or because it's raw) I love that this game doesn't hold you hand, it throws you on an island and you have to survive with expirementation. It gives you just enough helpful supplies to make your stay not impossible but not enough to make it easy. Even with only a couple hours of gameplay I can honestly say this game has much potential, I'm not saying it's good yet, that takes more time. But I am enjoying it.\n\nEDIT\n\nCrafting: Ok I tested out some of the crafting aspects now and I can say at the start I absolutely hated the whole drop mechanism for crafting. Basically you bundle everything on the ground and then use items and tools to craft different things from the ground. After a while I really took a liking to it however, I'm not sure why but it feels realistic. If I was on a island I can't help but believe I would start gathering and sort my materials on the ground until I decided what I should do with them, although this isn't huge I really enjoyed this method of crafting. I also like that a foundation can be either a floor or a raft, let's face it, they're not much different just a bunch of sticks tied together, really great idea making both into one craftable item. Overall I really like the Crafting system.\n\nFishing: I only fished for a short while but visually it's great, the fish stick to your spear and wiggle around a bit, feels very realistic (not that I go around stabbing fish).\n\nEDIT\n\nSharks: Shark AI seems very decent. I decided to go out and try to fight one off and it was a very close fight, the movement is what I immediately noticed, they move like a natural predator where they will sneak in for a bite then go into the depths and come back in for another attack. They're also extremely weary of confrontation so if you start swining a knife at it it will swim away. Very nice could definitely be a bit more difficult though.\n\nBugs: Currently theres a very annoying bug that will make you lose your raft in the middle of the ocean, this happened to me twice in a row where I had no choice but to swim to the island. \n\nAgain will update with more info when I see it necessary.\n\nI know people dislike this and feel free to downvote if you agree.

I had a lot of patience with this game, but now, it's completely gone.\n\nI follow the development of this game since its EA release back in 2015. Then they were planning to get this out of Early Access in the same year. It has been five years in which core mechanics were changed, added, removed and reworked multiple times which added to the product that we have today. Communication by the devs (two people btw) with us (us meaning the PC community) grew bad in the last months, updates began to shift from one content patch per month to \"maybe one patch in three months and wait this new update is actually only bringing already existing content from the experimental branch to the stable one\". \n\nBtw this game is broken and I'm not only referring to its bugs, I also heard that a lot of people can not run this game and also this game is freakin' boring. \n\nSo Stranded Deep just released on Xbox One and PS4 after a one-year-lasting hiatus with Beam Team Games trying to reclaim the publishing rights from Telltale Publishing, after they got broke shortly after the announcement of their collaboration. And yes, on consoles Stranded Deep is released, despite still being Early Access on Steam. How does this work?\n\nSo basically you may realized, that SD on consoles has a full endgame which is still missing on PC. But that does'nt mean that the console version has just more features than the PC one. In fact the PS4/XBoxOne version runs on an old build, that e.g. still has the item \"tarp\", which was removed on PC like many months ago. \n\nThe devs already said that they want to add missing features from PC to console and vice versa. But no one knows WHEN exactly we PC-players can expect to get out of EA.\n\nI should also mention that the few patches we PCers got in the last months are pretty scummy. Some months ago, we got new animals like a giant crab. This crab was not made by the devs however, instead they bought a license for it: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/giant-crab-animations-7a914f49409c4e37b7da8d6b12b94a2c \nOf course that's not illegal, but it shows me that they swapped their priorities.\n\nThe most requested feature since 2015 is clearly coop-mode, which also appears on their roadmap. So some time back we got coop, however it happens to be splitscreen coop, which nobody wanted. Like look at a game like The Forest, it got coop very quick and I don't think anyone there misses an option for splitscreen coop. According to the devs online coop is \"on their radar\", but I guess PC release also seems to be \"on their radar\" for like four years.\n\nIf you look on their Twitter you can see that the devs got pretty active in the minute this game came out for consoles. Small streamers seem to get sponsored and there is a lot of communication with the consolers e.g. about upcoming hotfixes and such. However there is no official statement about the PC release, if you want to get an official word on that of a dev, you have to dig yourself into the Steam Forums. Actually they seem to be surprised by getting some negative critique from people who feel scammed by them. And this is what it is.\n\nIf I buy a game in EA I expect to give money to the devs so that they can fund the game I CAN PLAY with the money. Instead they used it to develop a finished console version. Now some randoms that never supported this game before can play endgame content BEFORE the real funders of the game.\n\nAnyway I expect that in sometime (maybe a month, maybe a year who knows) we get a patch that adds the endgame from consoles, the unlimited world (one of the features that was in this game already years ago, but got removed because idk) and then the devs declear this game as \"done\". But then SD will still be nothing more than a neat cheap survival game that gets boring really quick and gets crushed by games like The Forest or Green Hell (approximately same price for well better games with online coop and such).\n\nThank you, Beam Team.", "timestamp_created": 1588004465, "timestamp_updated": 1588004465, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 336, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932425498962402344", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139937610": {"recommendationid": "139937610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198861191761", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1681954621}, "language": "english", "review": "1.

I paddled for ages and was incredibly excited to see the new shore. It was a small island with a wrecked ship on both it's east and west sides. After gathering a sizable pile of rocks to take back to my sad little home island, I decided to pull out my knife and explore the shipwrecks.\n\nAs I swam down into the tiny fishing trawler, I wondered how long I could hold my breath. Long enough to discover a hatchet stuffed away in a locker, and a fuel tank stored in the ship's console, and a spare lighter stored away in a toolbox. I excitedly tossed my treasure on the ground by my raft, eager to see what was located in the other ship.\n\nThis ship was much larger, maybe a crabbing boat or something. It had at least two decks. I couldn't discover the hidden gems in this thing. Oooh! Is that another hatchet? Yes! Awesome! Whoa, a machete?! Sweet, I should probably go up for air. Alright, air is sufficient. Let's go back down. Wait...what is this music? There hasn't been any music before...this sounds...ominous. Please tell me there aren't sharks in this game...OH CRAP, THAT'S A SHARK. SWIM DAMN YOU, SWIM.\n\nAfter escaping what was certain death, I went back to my raft and settled on what to take back home with me. The rocks, the fuel tank, and my beautiful new machete. The rest, I left on the beach for easy access if I ever decided to grow a pair and finish exploring that boat.\n\nAs I began paddling back to my island, I reflected on my performance while I experienced extreme fear after spotting the shark, quite happy with myself. I escaped the wrath of a frightening creature while stupidly swimming around in his home turf. I can outperform sharks, man. I'm awesome.\n\nIt was at this moment of smug satisfaction that I heard the ominous music again and immediately reverted back to fear mode, and looked around my raft in a panic, trying to spot my tormentor. Suddenly my raft was violently pushed by something below me. I flipped out and started mashing buttons in an effort to pull out my new, prized machete treasure. In my panic, I managed to press Q instead, which resulted in my hurling the tiny plastic paddle I was using to transport myself home directly at the shark's head.\n\nRealizing I was now stranded in a raft with no way to paddle back home, being circled by a large sea creature with enough teeth to completely ruin my day, I quit the game and decided to sit in bed for awhile wrapped in a cozy, warm blanket.\n\n8/10 will most definitely play again.", "timestamp_created": 1422658882, "timestamp_updated": 1422658882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 186, "votes_funny": 281, "weighted_vote_score": "0.92624366283416748", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119788333": {"recommendationid": "119788333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198231342788", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 2915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2915, "last_played": 1659215791}, "language": "english", "review": "I have almost 50 hours now. This game has some potential but the negatives far outweigh what could have been a good game. Where should I start...\n\nBuilding mechanics make absolutely no sense. There is literally no gameplay difference between building a twig shack and a brick fortress (apart from costing you significantly more). Not only that, there is zero incentive to build *anything* at all, as buildings won't protect you against rain, wind and cold - they simply do not exist in the game apart from visuals/sound fx. Animals pass through walls so no point in building a base, apart from trying to RP which in this game gets boring fast.\n\nSame applies for rafts - different materials used to build the raft hardly matter at all. Do not read what is written as information - I can barely notice any difference in the way the raft behaves if it is built using different materials. So why you need level 4 crafting to build the barrel raft when a twig one can do as much is beyond me. Or, why do you need to put an expensive brick floor on top of the raft base when you can go around with planks of wood. Also, bricks as a raft floor - are you serious? And if you are trying to haul barrels - no matter how big your raft is, you can barely load a barrel or maybe two (if you are lucky) before the raft starts sinking or going awry in circles. In my game, I managed to transport a couple of barrels using the starting dinghy - so the only reason to build a raft is speed and to be able to haul crates on a shelf. You cannot even build some sort of a half-wall to prevent stuff like tyres and barrels from falling off.\n\nResources are also bland and far not enough. Sure, the basics are there but oh my god, the crafting menu and UI is abhorrent. It is all over the place, you cannot favourite certain items, only pin what you will need to gather before crafting it but not actually craft it unless you go again through all the menus. Horrible. Variety is bad, soon you will end up with dozens of label makers, compasses, underwater torches, vehicle parts which are fairly useless if you already have 1 of each (or a few in the case of vehicle parts). Inventory is disorganised and honestly this is the only game where your empty hands count as a part of the inventory. On top of that, you can easily stack everything in boxes and then pick the boxes with the items inside, game seems to not care. But as soon as you have all the slots occupied and have - lets say 2 axes, you suddenly cannot equip neither as the game tries to split them into two slots - without any logic whatsoever. A total mess.\n\nAI is also incredibly poor for a game this new. Animals get stuck on everything, combat is incredibly clunky and lacking anything interesting. Sound effects are lacking, soundtrack is nice but very short and easily becomes very repetitive as everything else in this game. And why the hell do the tiger sharks make a growling noise when biting?! They are sharks, not tigers. What's next? Horse flies that neigh??? Graphics can either be good or bad - some aspects are nice but they still feel very outdated.\n\nAll that being said, there are some good features. Procedural generation offers some replayability so long you are not incredibly bored by the time you finished the game the first time. The map itself is not infinite as the devs would like you believe, rather it consists of a few dozens small islets but scattered around differently every game. \n\nThere is also an option to create custom maps and islands but the map editor is so frustratingly terrible to navigate, this options is borderline useless. Trying to build a simple island, raise tool actually lowers the land, the other tools are buggy as hell, did not stay there for more than 5 minutes, it was THAT buggy.\n\nOverall, you will like the idea of this game, but not the game itself. There are way better games in the same category out there.\nIf you are still willing to buy, do not buy at full price. This game does not deserve to be priced that high.\n\nEDIT: typos.", "timestamp_created": 1659220646, "timestamp_updated": 1704386580, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 362, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919161140918731689", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38148640": {"recommendationid": "38148640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025101293", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 913, "last_played": 1640629189}, "language": "english", "review": "Review December 2017 />\n\n\u201cWe don't want to work on Stranded Deep forever. If all goes well, we're hoping to have it completed by the end of 2015.\"\n\nComing back after a year since I played, I'm a little disappointed to see it is still EA, as this game has a huge potential. \nThere is a lot to improve, and the devs are certainly taking their time, or simply have given up on the game. \nWhat the game could improve on:\n\n- Bigger, more interesting islands. For instance it would be cool with a beach cove or small caves (with clay deposits). Volcano islands or underwater volcanoes. \n\n- More wildlife. Could be simple thing as poisonous spiders, scorpions, chameleons, mosquito swarms - or bigger ones like iguanas. Including underwater life like whale sharks, groups of dolphins spotted in the distance etc. \n\n- Less coconuts - More varied sources of food. Bananas. Berries (including poisonous ones), papayas, other exotic fruits etc. In its current state it is too easy going from island to island and replenish on food and water from coconuts.\n\n- Different sound effects. Example: Hacking trees or paddling in the life raft should have 3 or 4 sound effects each. Yeah, it does actually make a difference when you do it a whole day.\n\n- Cutting out the cheesy voice lines saying \"Eww, gross\" when skinning a crab and trying to survive. Add more random dialogue that could occur from time to time, like how he's hoping he will be rescued soon, how he's curious about the new island he's arriving on, how he hopes there are no sharks around when he goes for that shipwreck etc.\n\n- Random drops; Traces of previous ancestors, history relics, ancient ruins, message in a bottle etc. Maybe some personal belongings from the people on the plane. \n\n- Less frequent shark encounters. So that you actually have the guts to take a swim but will get more freaked out when you meet a shark. Not having them swimming around your island constantly. \n\n- More objectives/ quests: Would be awesome finding a treasure map / key belonging to another island (in the same island group) that you have to seek out. Maybe a bigger island, having to fight a panther boss or something.\n\n\n\nThey have indeed made a few new improvements, like adding storms with huge waves. But all in all the process is too slow. I'm sure if they pick up the pace and make some new features and more varied content, this will be a 50+ hour game (add multiplayer on top and it's 150+), rather than its current state where you get more or less bored after 10 hours. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a bad game, and with great graphics. I'm just disappointed seeing the progress with just a couple new features since I last played, over a year ago. For me personally, there was no replay value, which I usually have with most games. If it was a FULL release when buying, it would be something different. But I bought it in EA, thinking a lot more content would come. \n\nI'm not at all expecting them to make all the ideas above, but it's just some suggestions to make the game less repetitive. I hope they continue in the right direction and will be more than happy to change this review later on. Like mentioned this game has potential, and could possibly be among the best games in 2018 if done right!\n\nReview December 2021 />\n\nThey have done some things since I last played this four years ago! More wildlife, more objects to make, I can recommend this now. Though they could work on the audio and turn down the shark frequency (constantly being followed by my new pet, hammerhead fella :)\n\nWhat they really need to do is get inspired by Raft; as you can only stay on an island a certain amount of time before it depletes, you should be able to build more stuff on the raft. Also you need like 10 shots of the harpoon to kill a shark, which is too much. You should either reduce it or give the ability to make leather armour for extra protection.", "timestamp_created": 1512724276, "timestamp_updated": 1641482047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919159591197967529", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54058187": {"recommendationid": "54058187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198964895100", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 220046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2876, "playtime_at_review": 9541, "last_played": 1713800532}, "language": "english", "review": "I am 61 years old and havent played a video game since the pacman era(80's)'\nI really like this gaem!

There's just some stuff in the game that doesn't seem very well thought out.\n\nThe reward structure for exploration is just not refined enough.  The basics of survival are easy to take care of, after a day or two in game you should have food and water completely situated.  After that the real progress comes from sailing to other islands and diving in shipwrecks.\n\nSailing to other islands is mostly fine, but your limited inventory space makes it really start to wear on you as you slowly move resources 10-20 at a time back and forth to your main island.  This can be slightly helped by carrying a few storage containers on your raft, but the storage containers aren't very large and they also have a habit of sliding off or flying into the middle of the ocean.  The game would be GREATLY improved if you could build or connect storage directly to the raft.\n\nThe other exploration is diving, which was a frightful experience at the start because there are a LOT of sharks in the ocean.  Once I got over the fear of the sharks though, I realized that they are actually kind of derpy.  They don't do a terribly good job at killing you, and tend to just harmlessly swim straight through you or completely miss you unless you stand perfectly still.  But it's all kind of a wasted effort because 90% of the shipwrecks are just full of worthless flashlights.  I wish the sharks were less common and more impactful, because they're mostly just an annoying way to spend throwing spears at the moment.\n\nThere are some end game bosses that I can't manage to find in my currently game, but I did watch some videos of other people killing them and they seem to suffer from a health pool problem.  With the limited inventory space, you can only carry so many spears at once, and it looks like the bosses have WAY too much health for the amount that you can carry.  The videos I watched had people diving into the ocean just to try and pull their thrown spears out of the boss to reuse them because they ran out.\n\nThe building elements could also use a lot of polishing up.  I built some shelves in game only to find that they didn't actually work, they were just kind of one solid collision block, so I can leave a handful of items hovering a foot above the shelf, but I can't put items on an individual shelf.  It would be nice to have a few cosmetic items thrown into the sunken ships just to make those more interesting.\n\nAnd the final gripe I have with the game is that there are finite resources.  I found myself, for the first time in any survival game, starved of rocks.  The only resource that seems to grow back are the leaves that you can use for fires and to make rope.  There seems to be enough resources in the game to get you through, but it's just kind of unnecessary to make me sail 6 miles just to find a stick.\n\nAll in all, it's a competent game, with a few rough edges that will hopefully get smoothed out in the future.  I can recommend it because it's a decent way to spend 10-20 hours, but it's not as good as The Forest or Subnautica, so definitely play those games first.", "timestamp_created": 1590600868, "timestamp_updated": 1590600868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 130, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.916772842407226563", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55225530": {"recommendationid": "55225530", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987394736", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 12750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7834, "last_played": 1704006740}, "language": "english", "review": "Stranded Deep starts off great, its early game is fun, immersive, with lots to do.

Here's a breakdown of gameplay, graphics, environment, crafting, bugs, and ultimately - why I would recommend this game.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\n\n-Pretty fun to explore shipwrecks and find stuff\n-Made a motorized raft (which totally kicks ass)\n-Conquered multiple islands for my own greedy needs\n-Built a fortress with a lookout tower and used binoculars to spot sharks\n-Still haven't found my good friend Wolly\n-Murdered crabs and ate them in front of their friends\n-Drank then ate numerous coconuts\n-Palm trees are now extinct\n\nGameplay is great, crafting system is really unique and I like it, it seems realistic, like you're actually putting stuff together instead of some wizardry where walls and foundations just appear. Although at this point there's not much to do, this game has really good potential (I'll elaborate more on this at the end).\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\n\nThis game is very nice looking, and has a really nice feel of realism to it. The only thing I'd want more with the graphics is better antialiasing, a fix for the weird lines you can see in the distance separating the areas of water, and further render distance.\n\n[b]Environment:[/b]\n\nThe environment is very nice, there are plenty of sea animals and dangers. Sharks, whales, crabs, many types of fish, and more to come in the future. The islands are all pretty standard and have numerous palm trees, rocks, and a few yucca plants for lashings (rope). My favorite part about the environment is the water and shipwrecks. The water is awesome and it really feels real when you're swimming around exploring. The shipwrecks are interesting to explore and often have very useful loot like buckets (which you fill with seawater then boil to make it drinkable), parts to make an engine for your raft, and other useful items like flashlights and bandages.\n\n[b]Crafting:[/b]\n\nI love the crafting system in this game. I've never seen anything like it before. Instead of having to combine recipes through a crafting menu, you actually put the stuff together on the ground, hold left click, and select the item you want to make. To make tools you hold anything, but to build foundations, walls, and other building materials, you need to be holding a hammer. The crafting is very well done, no complaints about it.\n\n[b]Bugs:[/b]\n\nThis is the least buggy early access game I've ever played. At initial release, there were a few bugs such as disappearing raft, flying sharks, and low sound quality rain, but those were all fixed very quickly. As of now, the only bugs/glitches I know of are the double/triple paddle and flying with palm trees. Very solid game with few bugs.\n\n[b]Why I Recommend This Game:[/b]\n\nThe developers of this game are great, because the game actually gets updates, and said updates [b]actually[/b] add content and fix bugs (looking at you, DayZ). This game has so much potential and with the development roadmap going the way it is, I'd love to see multiplayer co-op and much more content in this game in the future.

It would turn into a RUST style game and that isnt what I signed up for here. \n\nKeep this game single player - story driven. Maybe add some deepwater content on the seafloor or native tribes that want to kill you for invading their territory. Make weather actually affect you mentally. Make your home damageable by AI or weather. \n\nThere are literally so many directions you can go with this game but it seems that they are just stagnating.\n\nIn its current state it is still fun but so limited!\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI like where this is headed now that we have an endgame content. My other suggestions, much I am sure like others have suggested - Leveling system, experience, more land creatures (keep them coming), The chance to be rescued is fantastic. To the co-op-ers out there, I agree - co-op with a friend or random is cool - just not MMO style. I still like this game very much and just a bit more content will put it over the finish line - like making the area larger. I love the editable maps and creators out there who make mission - bravo!

I've played this game for a long time. I've pretty much beaten the game as it stands right now and I feel conflicted. This game was beautiful and a load of potential. Sadly, it seems that the developers for some reason updated this game backward from whence it started, most likely due to formatting to console release. I remember when this game had a beautiful life under the water where you could find sunken ships anywhere even in the deepest parts of the water. I also remember when worlds used to be infinite and very fun to explore. Now the oceans lay barren and empty and the world a limited with an out of place yellow floating ball border with nothing but empty ocean after it. I know that the world is limited for reasons of bosses and island creations, but I still can't help but feel that something great was taken away from me. Something that could have grown into something beautiful.\n        I bought this game near the moment of this release, and I was really excited, I would even go on to play this game for hours on end. I remember when the community for this game was booming and everyone was excited to see what would come next. And for the most part, we were not disappointed. But there was one thing everyone was begging the developers to implement every sing update they posted. Multiplayer, the thing everyone wanted because no one wanted to survive alone. But as the days, months, and even years grew on, they never added it, but they added plenty of things that people never asked for. Eventually, the community started begging and pleading, but as time went on, so did people. The hype died down and the most abandoned hope. What went from people giving great ideas and sharing love with the game soon became people giving small comments of pity as they clung to what little hope they had left for the game. And while the developers watched their fan-base shrink, they decided to take action, but not to give the people what they want, but to instead bring out a console release. At which point I knew they had given up and decided to run for a cash grab before it was too late.\n        The game itself at first is very fun and exciting with plenty of things to look forward to. But after playing long enough you start to realize the grind and just how annoying it is to find the one thing that you need to start doing things that could be actually fun. Like building fun creations. But the building has changed for the worst as they implemented the leveling system that stopped you from building things if you were not high enough level. This leveling system has to be the worst feature I've ever seen in their evolution going backward. The sharks are fun to fight, but they don't even seem to tip over your raft while you sail to another island. Which in my opinion made the game before very challenging in scary. Now sailing to another island is just boring and feels like a waste of time. They also seemed to make the game more complicated as to get the fuel you need to get potatoes, farms, fuel machines, and Jerry Cans. Whereas before you just needed to find a Jerry can with limited fuel already in it. The progression in this game feels more like it's holding you back from experiencing the fun parts until you've experienced the rough buggy hard parts. It took days just to level up enough just so that I could create something that I've wanted through the entire game which I could also acquire in the previous updates just through perseverance and luck.\n        Overall this game is dying if not already dead, and though it may seem harsh to say and I may just sound like an old bitter man saying it, I feel that I have been betrayed too many times to have any hope for this game. Though it was fun and I enjoyed myself, I don't think that this game is worth it, it felt like a cash grab in the beginning, and it stayed a cash grab until what looks like the end. This game has betrayed and left it's fans alone for so long to play a game that can only provide so much fun. Is it really too much to ask for one thing? The one thing that everyone wants? I've said it more than once, everyone's said it, but I'll ask one more time... \n\n                             Beamteam, won't you please add online multiplayer so that I can just                                                     \n                                   have fun with my friends and we can all know that you listen.", "timestamp_created": 1594209902, "timestamp_updated": 1594209902, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 387, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.909965097904205322", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41545895": {"recommendationid": "41545895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071025781", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 665, "last_played": 1449644034}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun for a bit, but sadly this game is stuck in early access hell, buy something else.\n\nhere's a quote from the dev that hasnt aged well:\n\n\"We don't want to work on Stranded Deep forever.

The overall feel of play-style sways towards simplicity, relying on resource shortage and brutal forward planning in order to hold up the game play mechanic. The world doesn't really feel like it wants to open up to the player, instead opting for a feeling of helplessness and an inevitable grind towards success.\n\nCrafting is, at best, basic and, at its worst, frustrating. Creating a raft (your primary item of choice if you wish to survive) is simple, but also tricky to undertake because of physics collisions, weight distribution problems (placing a single vehicle tyre onto your raft can have the entire construction spinning out of control, or cause it to drown) and space restrictions. It's meant to be realistic, but the execution of it is glitchy and immersion-breaking, often adding frustration to your task. On top of that, there is very little you are allowed to add to the raft as a vehicle, ending up with your final creation being uninspiring and boring. Want to build a little sleep area that's enclosed, with maybe something to cook on - Nope! You can construct a shelf system for your crates, a sail, a rudder, a simple stone anchor and, if you're really feeling fancy, you can build an outboard engine. The latter of which requires a contrived, painfully slow process of farming potatoes (from limited resources) in order to distill them into fuel. It all feels a bit over-the-top., while also being incredibly underwhelming.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2839474907\nCrafting on land is marginally more involved, with basic structures that you'd expect from a castaway survival situation. It's not terrible, but it's not particularly inspiring either. With resources being cruelly sparse, requiring plenty of island hopping to support any form of player home settlement, it soon becomes tiring to have to travel vast distances just to get some sticks or enough fiber for crafting [i]and[/i] water production. Some might enjoy the challenge - indeed I did at first - but it soon becomes a grind, taking away the thrill of exploration and discovery and replacing it with necessity. Not really good for anything but die-hard survivalist wannabe's.\n\nAs for the story - I honestly haven't come across anything so far that gives me a clue of what I am supposed to do to get home. It might be something added on final release, but as yet it's a big mystery to me. I see hints of what I can craft from the story (4 items) but there's no connection to them in any form so far in my 21 hours of this play-through (Day 32) that I am attempting in July of 2022. Hopefully that will change. People shouldn't have to look up spoiler guides and sift through forums just to find out what they should be doing. Short of that you will likely just float aimlessly around the game world until you bump into something, which could take little time for the bold explorer, or tens of hours for the cautious gamer.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840476978\nNow to the bugs; There's plenty! Physics causing catapulting of trees when cutting them down, physics glitches with your raft, instability issues and (for me) a flickering shadows problem that has existed for 7 years, with no progress made by the developers to fix it. I am not alone with this glitch. It's apparently quite common, especially the further you explore and on the larger islands. It's not the end of the World, but it breaks immersion considerably and is extremely uncomfortable on the eyes,\n\nVisually (aside from technical bugs), the game is very pretty to look at. The water elements are quite beautiful and there's plenty of wildlife to make it feel alive and atmospheric. Colour use is decent, giving a truly tropical feel to the environment. Indeed, graphically it is a great showcase of what modern game engine technology can produce. Especially when it's designed by a fairly small team.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840476961\nMy gripes: \n1) [b]Graphical glitches need to be prioritized by the developers.[/b] It's not good to have a screen output that's uncomfortable to look at or that ruins all the hard work that's gone into creating this beautiful environment.\n2) [b]The islands are all far too small.[/b] There's too much emphasis on forcing players to island-hop for resources. Encouraging the player to explore can still be achieved without brute force. The island sizes never offer enough space for a player to get comfortable in the game and create something special as a home. It feels like the developers are keen for the player to simply keep moving until the end of the, erm... story?!?\n3) [b]The story is too well hidden.[/b] I want at least some direction when I play games. It doesn't need to hold my hand, but zero information just makes it aimless and uncertain. Not a good way to design a story. This needs significant work.\n4) [b]The grind - there's too much of it![/b] Making a player hop islands (taking up significant time, depending on distance) just to get a few logs to make planks, or resupply an island of wooden sticks for cooking and crafting, because there's nothing left to cut down on the island the player has decided to settle on, is contrived, boring and grindy. There's no need for this. Look at Green Hell or Subnautica for reference. There's an abundance of resources everywhere (for the most part) but it doesn't lock the player into position. Instead it makes preparation for exploration more enjoyable - heightening the excitement of discovering new places.\n5) [b]Challenging survival frustrations.[/b] Staying alive is what this game is all about, but the grind added to make it fit into this genre is bordering on lazy design instead of thoughtful complexity. This is a tricky aspect that I also cover in my likes as well, but needs to be mentioned.\n6) [b]Painfully slow game development for what is ultimately a very small game.[/b]\n\nMy likes:\n1) [b]Gorgeous environmental effort.[/b] The world looks beautiful and the water is realistic feeling and immersive. The developers have done a great job with the overall visual and dynamic environment.\n2) [b]Decent sound design.[/b] It sounds nice and there's plenty of atmosphere created around the player from the various audio elements.\n3) [b]Fantastic colours.[/b] A truly tropical vibe. A lovely water pallet and a vibrant and inviting overall feel for the world space.\n4) [b]Wonderful looking wildlife.[/b] With the exception of over-sized crabs, the overall look and feel of the wildlife is so good you'll likely want to spend time (especially under water) just drinking it in and experiencing the flora and fauna of a tropical dream holiday. It's not at all safe, but it's incredibly immersive. Enough that you don't really need a story if there was more space to explore on land and more emphasis on taking in the wonders of the tropics. Very nice indeed.\n5) [b]Enough building for the simple craftsman.[/b] There's quite a selection of things to build, even if the game doesn't balance it well or give it purpose. It's not enough for impressive creativity, but it lends to the game enough to warrant a mention.\n6) [b]Challenging survival.[/b] Staying alive is tough. You need to look where you are going and pay attention to your needs. it's what the game centers around and it, almost, works. I prefer thoughtful survival mechanics over brute force, lazy design. It's a bit of \"love it and hate it\" as far as this aspect goes.\n\nI'd give this game a somewhat generous 7/10, but must warn of glitches that can potentially ruin your experience.", "timestamp_created": 1658859578, "timestamp_updated": 1658956707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 146, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895376384258270264", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14137934": {"recommendationid": "14137934", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964471157", "num_games_owned": 1167, "num_reviews": 302, "playtime_forever": 5998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 613, "last_played": 1640223634}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm surprised!

Lots of promise and there were moments the game was genuinely beautiful!\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nSince then, while updates have been vaguely regular, they are EXTREMELY thin in terms of new content or feature progress, and most of the time they REMOVE something that was working well and put something new in its place that is broken, half-finished, and just plain not fun to use.  Since I bought the game, they have:\n- Made it all but impossible to see more than 10 feet underwater, making it basically useless to try and dive because sharks will kill you in the blink of an eye and you can't see them coming - and yet sharks actively home in on you the moment you get in the water\n- Replaced a good crafting interface with a clunky and slow one that has performance issues\n- Messed with resource generation and scarcity on the starting island, breaking the early gameplay resource usage and needs curves\n- Made the islands VASTLY SMALLER\n- Removed a variety of crucial tools that were simple and effective and instead put confusing multi-part crafting solutions in their place that aren't even working right and are grindy and not fun\n- Added and removed content seemingly at random with no clear plan or roadmap to a final content set\n- Repeatedly released buggy updates that need a hotfix to solve a gamebreaking bug within the first few days\n\nI make games for a living.  I've worked on PC and Xbox games from large to small, and I know what rookie teams and experienced teams look like based on how they handle development.

The fact that this small Indie a team has a faster, better and friendlier response to its players than other Early-Access games *cough* dayz *cough* should be enough to convince you to buy this, because it means your money did not go to waste, as these devs will fix and solve the bugs you actually post.\n\nBut enough about the devs, lets talk about the game!\n\nThe intro to the game is pretty generic to survival games (crashing off a plane) but at least you get to make your own martini before descending into your doom. It is also very well made, the intro looks realistic and its not just some stupid black screen at the end of it. \n\nAfterwards you wake up on the raft you climbed on before being blown to sh1t with your trusty paddle and you will find a tiny island : your new home.\n\nThere you can gather resources and craft new items and tools necessary for your survival. The crafting in this game is very original, and you will not be disappointed. Instead of depending on a generic crafting screen, this game actually handles that in the physical game world, meaning you have to lay down some sticks, rope and rock before you before you can start crafting your spear.\n\nYou have the ability to hunt crabs (easiest) or fish from the ocean, even bigger fish near the reefs and deeper into the water. Hell, if you're brave enough you can actually chase that stupid shark thats been circling your beloved raft for so long, and kill it, and COOK IT! As of now you cant eat shark fin soup, but you can still eat the fin, and other parts.\n\nThe cooking is quite realistic, you will have to wait a while before your crabs become crispy and tasty, instead of insta-cooking.\n\nYou will have to manage your resources as they are quite finite, which after a while will force you to navigate to other islands in search for more wood and rocks. Especially if you want to build a nice big hut. \n\nThis game has a few bugs, but none of them are game-breaking which is something very worth your money these days.\n\nThe main reason why I think you should get this game is because it has so damn much potential. And when all the amazing new features start coming in you will start to realize how you should have bought this game early on, you can wait, sure. But you'll miss out on alot of fun.

The issue with stranded deep is the developer. Its been in early access for 6 years now with very long periods of silence from the devs and inconsistent updates. for a while i thought that Stranded Deep was dead, or at least i did until the devs stabbed their PC playerbase in the back. They ported the unfinished, unpolished game to consoles for a cash grab and then proceeded to create and release poorly planned, rushed, time exclusive content to consoles that does not make sense or fit the game so they could claim that the game had a half assed ending. They finally got around to releasing the content for their PC playerbase (who make up most of the sales of their game btw, we funded the company by buying this game) but its the fact that they treated their PC players as second class citizens. If this game was the developers priority it would have been out of early access a long time ago, they made more than enough money through PC sales alone (youre welcome Beam Team) and have had more than enough time to fund a team of extra devs and finish the game. If you want to buy the game because you just enjoy survival games then by all means purchase stranded deep, like i said its a fun game.

I was on my raft heading back to a secondary base island after scavenging for resources from one of the far-off islands, a necessary errand since single islands didn't provide many resources and your backpack could only hold 8 things at a time. These were long journeys (~10-15 minutes) and required some intelligent resource managing to make it there and back in good health but with enough new materials to make the trip worthwhile. I began the trip in the evening and soon realized I had made a mistake when heavy rain began pouring down. To allow more backpack room I didn't bring my compass, so with my visilibity reduced to mere feet in front of me I did my best to maintain my direction of rowing. I was feeling pretty confident until the music began that indicates the proximity of a shark, and my heart began to race. Sure enough I saw a dark shadow in the water below me, circling around my raft and making occasional attempts to bump it over.  In short order I became disoriented and realized I had forgotten in which direction I had been travelling. My first thought was, my island was a tiny dot on the horizon, and the chances of me missing it are pretty high; I could try staying stationary and wait out the rain so I can regain my bearings, but the thought of being on top of a bottomless pit of giant monsters convinced me to redouble my navigational efforts and strike out in the most likely direction (which, very fortunately, were just barely correct enough and I eventually reached my intended island). My second thought was, holy shit, this game has absolutely nailed the terror and challenge of this sort of nightmare scenario in a way no other game I've played has.\n\nThe reason why I don't recommend it is because in the years since then, rather than expanding on what made the game so unique, the developments have done nothing but bring the game half-way up to par with the survival genre generic standards, drowning its strengths in the cesspool of bloated crafting systems and meaningless item-scavenging that characterizes nearly every other survival game on the market. Instead of adding more ways to challenge resource-management and survival skills, or adding more risk-reward events and mechanics, there are simply more ways to build your house and hoard all the rocks and branches you can find, and more ways to blow up sharks.\n\nIt still has a lot of potential, but the developers don't seem to know what it is.", "timestamp_created": 1491889145, "timestamp_updated": 1494473254, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 222, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879079282283782959", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "152060047": {"recommendationid": "152060047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179158822", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 152, "last_played": 1709830912}, "language": "english", "review": "My dream has come true.

Well, wonder no more. \n\nStranded Deep where you explore an open world, trying to fight the elements while staying alive. \nThere was always the promise of a storyline, and more in depth gameplay. \nThis has allowed me to sit here and review it for you.\n\nThe action starts with a rather calm setting. \nYou sit in a private jet on a flight to some unknown destination, for some unspecified reason. \nThis peace is very quickly disturbed when the shrill alarms sound from the cockpit. \nA sudden shudder, and you are free falling through the air. \nSections of the body are ripped from the fuselage, followed by the inevitable crash landing into the sea. \nYou somehow exit the wreck and must make it to a life raft, from here your adventure begins.\n\nAs the cutscene ends, you are given full control. \nYou are now introduced to basic gameplay mechanics in the form of a short tutorial, this explains how to gather and craft, how to use your watch to observe your stats, and the importance of building a shelter so that you can save your data. \nOnce the tutorial is complete you are on your own. \nAfforded the freedom to explore your first little island, and the world around you. \nThere really is a lot to see and do; you must hunt animals, farm or scavenge off the land for food and water supplies. \nUse your raft, or build a new vessel to cross the open waters. \nFind new islands to call home, explore shipwrecks in the depths of the ocean, and clamber across the decks of marooned tankers to search for vital clues to help find a way home.\n\nWhatever task you decide to undertake, you must plan and consider the benefits against the negatives. \nNearly every action is fraught with danger, you must stay alert in order to ensure you can live another day. \nSnakes, sharks, poisonous coral, heat, UV, starvation, dehydration, and many more pitfalls will welcome you on your journey. For every negative, there is an action you can complete to overcome it. \nYou can craft weapons to fight, Antivenom to overcome poisons, a shelter can be made to hide from the sun, and water collectors and cooking areas will keep you topped up on your vital statistics. \nThese things are all good while you are at home, but when you go exploring you must be prepared. \nDo not run before you can walk.\n\nThe wondrous thing about Stranded Deep is the freedom to choose whether you live in this dangerous open world for as long as your heart desires, while luck is on your side, or you attempt to complete the story mode.\nIf you do try to escape your new life, don\u2019t expect to be given clues as to how to achieve this, you must discover the solution for yourself. \nThis lack of direction will not be to everyone\u2019s liking.\nThe true hardcore fan will love the challenge of pitting their wits against a harsh and ever changing environment, which has considerably more hazards than it does safe areas. \nThe learning curve is almost unforgiving, so expect to die an awful lot when first starting out. \nOnce you understand the basic fundamentals, you should still expect to perish just as much. \nYou\u2019ll soon learn that the save facility is your best friend. There is nothing more frustrating than being poisoned halfway through a run through, with no Antivenom. \nYou either panic and search like a crazy person for the much needed medication, or you resign yourself to the fact that this is another save that didn\u2019t get you to the end game.\n\nCharacter progression is achieved by completing any given task. Hack down a load of palm trees, and your harvesting skill increases. \nSmash a crab with a rock, you\u2019ll be a better hunter, and so on and so forth, you get the point. A\nction equals reward. Better stats ultimately make the game easier, by reducing the time it takes to finish a job. \nHowever, this isn\u2019t the only way to make your experience much simpler. \nYou start out with rudimentary tools, these are made from sticks and stones. \nAs your skill improves, you can craft better items as long as you have the correct resources. \nSearching shipwrecks and Islands will occasionally unearth chests. \nInside these will potentially be rare resources or advanced equipment. \nYou discover that everything has a limited durability. \nEverything breaks eventually, and if your luck is like mine, it usually happens when you are attacking a predator, this leaves you powerless to overcome any attack.\n\nStranded Deep utilises both a day and night cycle, and varying weather fronts. \nAs the light changes, the shadows work perfectly in creating a sense of realism. \nThe night darkness really keeps you on edge. Why not make a torch? \nI hear you say! If only it was that easy to come across cloth in the early game!\nYour only choices are; walk by the light of the moon, or cower by your campfire.\nThe howling wind and driving rain looks prefect, the trees sway and the rain hammers down on the water and sand.\nOnly the brave and stupid venture into the waters in a storm. \nI won\u2019t ruin the surprise for you, but needless to say, rafts and waves is not an experience I\u2019m willing to go through again in a hurry. \nFor the most part the game looks fantastic, the variety of hot and cold colours transport you to the tropical lands, the sea looks cool and refreshing, and the animal animations are smooth. \nSnakes are renowned for being experts at camouflage, they are practically invisible. \n\nAs you come to expect with a game in this genre, there really is a lot to do. \nOnce you are familiar with the control system the action plays out very nicely. \nThe response rate is very good, and a number of shortcuts have been implemented to help with in game tasks, including being able to pin crafting recipes to the screen to help with gathering resources.\n\nOne of a few title\u2019s that I have reviewed, where I\u2019m barely scratching the surface of what can be done, and how much I can explore. \nThis title is vast, with plenty to make you want to return. \nIf you feel that the designed world gets tedious, then you can create a whole new procedurally generated one to explore. \nYou have the ability to alter the difficulty, and remove the main predators all together. \nThere is a leaderboard to compete with friends, and a plethora of easy and difficult achievements to aim for. \nAs already mentioned, you can spend your whole time surviving and building yourself a home, or you can push to try and escape. \nAll these options make the replay factor of this game incredible. \nI honestly feel the only thing that will prevent you from wanting to keep playing, is the brutal difficulty level. \nI found it quite disheartening, until I decided I wanted back in again.\n\nThe way the action plays out, and the graphical presentation makes this an extremely immersive title. \nI opened by saying that the survival genre is like Marmite. \nYou either love it, or hate it.\nI think that Stranded Deep will emphasise this fact.\nThis is one unbelievably in depth game that will push its fan base to its limits. \nWith the options to live out your Tom Hanks, and Bear Grylls dreams indefinitely, this is one that will ensure that you spend many hours trying to ensure that you survive your isolation.\nGreat value for money, and something that I\u2019d certainly recommend. \nGrab yourself a volleyball, paint a hand on it, and keep it with you.\n Your \u201cWilson\u201d may be the only friend that will help to keep you sane is this lonely existence.", "timestamp_created": 1606440936, "timestamp_updated": 1606440936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.876759767532348633", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32308208": {"recommendationid": "32308208", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970673763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1604866791}, "language": "english", "review": "*UPDATE*\n\nA year later I decided to give this another shot.

It remains pretty as ever visually, but with a crafting system that is frankly just idiotic. Daft decisions like the inability to burn planks remain. I give up - it's clear the designers don't care.\n\n*ORIGINAL from June, 2017*\n\nI really wanted to like this game but ultimately it's just not that fun, though I'd say it does deliver in terms of what it promises.\n\nWhat I like:\n* Graphics are pretty good, it does feel like you're on an island; it's reasonably pretty\n* Great music.. really adds to the mood\n* Controls are fairly intuitive, though there are some things you'll inevitably look up - like how to smoke fish.\n\nWhat I don't:\n* Crafting that makes no sense.. I can have a tinroofing floor for a raft but not.. a roof? \n* Absurd durability.. machetes fall apart quickly but stone tools are invincible?\n* More advanced tools don't work much better than primitive tools.\n* Inventory system scales poorly.. lockers need to carry more stuff\n* Inability to get a lot of use out of furniture\n* Structures that are silly like having to build multiple fire pits if you want a smoker AND a spit AND a regular fire.. etc..\n* Did I mention the crafting system makes no sense? Why is drift wood and regular wood different? Why can't I deconstruct things? Like a crate into planks.. or a raft into a tarp + rope.\n* Too much dependence on wood.\n* Not a lot of opportunities to harvest things from the environment.. there's almost no point in going underwater.\n\nUltimately there simply isn't much to do.. You build a house.. and.. then what? A raft.. so you can go to another island that doesn't have your house? I just don't really see the point I guess. I think the game would be much better if rather than having to island hop between tiny irrelevant islands you instead washed ashore on a tiny island nearer a larger one.. and had to make your way there and then explore it. That would at least give you something to do.\n\nAlso unless I went swimming, I never really felt in danger. Once you build a couple solar stills water is not an issue. Sleep is easy.. and food isn't too difficult.  Getting food and water turns into more of a chore than a struggle. Wristwatch says I need to drink? Okay let me head over to my still and top up.

You seem distressed, no doubt business is taking its toll on you and the plane going through turbulence doesn't exactly help, luckily you are the only passenger. You decide to ease your sorrows with a martini. As you return to your seat to go through some more spreadsheets the plane starts shaking violently until suddenly, you come to realise you might not make this trip. Your fears quickly become reality.\nThe jet's fuselage is getting torn to shreds, the inside becomes a tornado of clutter as all sorts of objects start getting vacuumed outside. You're pressed against the back of your seat, gasping for air, as the plane loses altitude... until it crashes into the sea. As you recover from the trauma, you start swimming toward the cockpit, only to find the two pilots dead. Wasting no time, you escape the wreck and climb into a life raft. You make for the nearest bit of land as to not get dragged down with what used to be your only way back to civilisation. You are stranded. Deep.\n\nWith this introduction, I hope the scenery is set for Stranded Deep, a survival game in Early Access now available on Steam. The scenery is important here, because it is all the story we get at this point in time. You know you're in trouble and have to make the best of it for as long as you can. You start with nothing more than a lighter, a pocket knife, a bottle of water and your life raft (plus paddle). To survive, you will need to stay well-fed and hydrated. Eating crabs, fish or native potatoes and drinking from a coconut or boiling seawater over a fire should keep you covered. There is also a crafting-system ingame, which lets you craft primitive tools for when your metal ones break. \nPerhaps most interestingly, the island you are stranded on is tiny, not much more than a pile of sand and rock with a few palm trees here and there. This means that you will only have access to a very finite pool of ressources like wood. To find more, you must inevitably climb back into your life raft (or a wooden one you've built) and start exploring the ocean around you. The world is potentially huge, depending on how far out you're willing to go, with more and more small islands appearing on the horizon. Exploration doesn't end there, though, as the ocean floor holds more secrets for you to discover. Ship-wrecks scatter the landscape below and do have loot for you to find, like proper tools or other useful items like goggles or a ship motor to stick on your raft.\nCarelessly bathing in the rough seas can be dangerous, though, as a very hungry shark might start thinking about making you part of his dietary plans. Shark AI seems very much unfinished at this point, though personally, sharks really freak me out so just their presence is enough to at the very least be very unsettling.\nIt's not just the sharks that need some more polish, as Early Access suggests. Surviving by doing the same few tasks over and over is all you can really do in Stranded Deep at this point and exploring will just reward you with more of the same. Building shelter has no real purpose and, sadly, there is no way of getting rescued yet, though plans are to include more end-game as development goes on. The two things that Stranded Deep has going for it are its unique setting and the stunning graphics, inviting you to forget about your dire situation and just bask in the tropical sun.\n\nStranded Deep is worthy of at least being followed by survival-fans.

Single-player is fun, if a tad bit more intimidating.

First off, the game is limited to 2-player co-op, which was not expected or easy to find out. Other similar games like Raft or Valheim put this paltry 2-player to shame if you want to play with friends. Second off, the multiplayer feels unfinished, the tutorial is disabled in multiplayer, meaning if you (like me and my partner did) jump right into multiplayer you are given no idea of how to work anything, and the menu does not give much help at all, forcing you to scour the internet for help. Then on top of that, the sync of both player's games is shoddy at best. Recently, after playing together for several hours we loaded in the next day and found that on my screen our house, raft, etc. were in their rightful place whereas for my partner the house was on the opposite side of the island and the raft embedded into it. She could no longer interact with objects I could see and I could watch her float above the ground as she climbed the invisible house.

This is the meat of the game, bugs may or may not be fixed in \"hot-fixes\". \n\nThis is a survival game, clearly inspired by Tom Hanks \"Castaway\". Although new purchasers wouldn't know this because they are still advertising content that no longer exists in the game, such as that plane crash intro - etc. \n\nYou start off on a raft with no paddles, they decided they weren't \"needed\" any further. You somehow dog paddle to shore (whilst standing), and begin \"surviving\". This consists of gathering sticks, rocks, lashing (gathered from their newly modeled Yucca Plants, from one of their \"big content patches\"), and coconuts. \n\nYou build a fire, because that's what you always do in survival games. Then focus on a shelter for the night, because we've been taught that night time is very dangerous. You head out and gather all the neat little materials, and get to building that shelter. This makes you realize that they are only cosmetic differences because there is no competing weather elements to contend with. So now you've seen 75% of the game-play & content. \n\nOnce daylight comes, and you realize there was no threat what-so-ever over the course of the night, you decide to build a raft so you can go explore other islands. You could however doggy paddle in the given raft, but that would be silly because the sound effect for the paddling would drive you insane before you left your home island's shore. \n\nUpon watching the new island pop-in piece by piece like a stop-motion animation, you'll either be lucky and pass by a shipwreck or be unfortunate enough to contend with the pop-in later (assuming you care about finding the shipwreck). After scouting the new island for all of 1 minute you'll come to the realization that whether or not procedural generation is at play, all the islands contain the same resources, and thus it was pointless to waste your time going to this island, and a waste of your time building the raft you used to get there. \n\nThis is where the game fails; That moment you realize that there is nothing left to do. It's a defeating feeling because depending on your experience level, it may have taken you 2.1hrs to discover this, leaving you without a refund option. You now realize that there is no content in the game passed the 1hr mark. There is no survival mechanics minus infection, broken arm, food, hunger, oxygen. These are all easily negated/remedied/avoided. There is nothing that is a constant threat to your survival. All that time in the sun doesn't matter, the nights don't get cold, the wind don't bring in storms that threaten your very existence. Your biggest threat is falling from a tree due to the janky mechanics of tree climbing, rather than being eaten by a shark, of which I haven't even seen in 7hrs of game-play and 8 islands explored. Yes, depending on which version you have played, morphine probably fixed broken arms. But I can assure you that it might not in the next patch due to it breaking in the past.\n\nThe game is pretty to look at, minus the graphical glitches, and pop-in. It's a satisfying feeling to build a structure the first time, under the notion that you must do so before nightfall. But it's disheartening to see that structure floating in the sky-box the next time you login. It's disappointing to know that rebuilding one is inconsequential due to there being nothing in game to harm you or force the need of a structure.\n\nIt appears that the dev's are struck in a rut, and I wonder now if they haven't reached their coding limitations. The updates have consisted of cosmetic changes to systems that were in the game from day one. It's only when challenges are presented that we see their knowledge or lack there of come to light. We have seen this with the original crafting system, and we have seen their solution (however temporary, or however many promises are STILL being made to improve this). We have seen this when they removed the original raft, and motor, only to bring them back 8 months later. We have seen this when everyone was under the impression that they re-coded the engine, only to find that they simply upgraded to Unity 5 which left the game stagnant for nearly 2 months. \n\nAt best this is going to be a slow burn, at worse it'll be abandoned once they fail to find a way to \"Jerry-rig\" together a somewhat working game. That's a sad thought because the game came out with such strong potential. Those bugs in the early alpha releases were of no consequence because we simply didn't know what type of dev's we were dealing with. It's only now that we see their limitations, it's only a year later that we see the only mechanical forward progress has been by way of adding rafts back to the game. Every other change has been a removal, minus cosmetic building materials. \n\nThere simply isn't any confidence left that leads me to believe that this will ever be a true \"survival game\", but I'll happily update my review if that ever happens. Until that day comes though, I won't be updating this review again. They have added/removed so much content in such a short amount of time, it wouldn't even be fair to the dev's to keep making reviews. I only made this one because Sam pretty much challenged me to do so in the comments. But my question to Sam is, when are you going to update your Steam Store Page to reflect the changes in game? You were very direct with me about my \"misinformation\" and \"dated\" review, yet you continue to profit from advertising materials reflecting content that no longer exists in game.\n\nThis is the type of behavior I have experienced in the forums. I was banned for suggesting people find other ways to test out the game. I stand by that suggestion, whether that is through Steam Family Share, or other means. To say that the community isn't toxic would be a blatant lie. One only has to look as far as the comments on this review to see the negative energy coming from the people involved in this game. My review history on Steam, however short it may be, has been very fair. This is the first time I have seen a team act this way. And to suggest that they ban because there are \"kids\" on the forum isn't going to win favor from me, I know what they are trying to do with making statements like that, and I'm not ignorant enough to believe protecting children is their ban motivation. \n\nI'm attaching some screenshots to show the pop-in, and some other minor graphical glitches. They also show that a year later they haven't figured out a way to make cook crab not stack with uncooked crab, nor drinkable coconuts not stack with \"empty\" coconuts. I also took the time out of my day to do a video review, I included a timer in the video as well so you could see exactly how long it takes to reach \"end-game\" i.e. a content wall that's existed from launch day. I'll be appending that video as soon as I get around to uploading it. \n\nAnd for the record, every time I hit \"New Game\" I am given the exact same starting island over and over again. Ben explained that the starting islands are pre-made, and once you get past them they start to procedurally generate. This matters little in the grand scheme of things due to there being no real purpose to ever leave your starting island. \n\n[i]Sam: No one ever said you couldn't post a comment here. Playing victim while implying your ability to comment has been hindered only validates my review further.

It has its bugs here and there, much as most early access titles do, but overall, they don't affect the game all that much.\n\nI don't have hundreds of hours in the game like some people do, but I still feel I can highly recommend this game to anyone at all who enjoys horror/survival games. When you first begin the game, there really is a sense of almost hopelessness. You sit in a raft out on the open ocean, a shark circling nearby. Personally, I have a terrible fear of sharks and the ocean in general, even the video for the game in the store page deterred me at first lol. \n\nMy first few hours in the game were tragic. I ignored the shark and paddled as fast as I could towards the closest island, noticing a shipwreck very close to the island itself. I knew they were very important and felt I should brave the waters just for a chance of finding a compass or a piece of dive gear early on.\n\nHuge mistake...\n\nI jumped out of my raft almost directly on top of a Lionfish. The screen went green and I facepalmed. Having watched YouTube videos of the game, I knew this was bad. I made my way to the shipwreck, but found just a bucket of sea water and a pocket knife.\n\nDisappointed, I exited the cabin of the boat and started to swim towards the surface. I had Regular Show playing through my headset in the background, forgetting that sharks have a warning in the form of music. I never heard it coming. Just as I surfaced, a Tiger shark attacked me. I screamed like a little girl, my girlfriend sitting nearby laughed herself to tears. After it drug me under the water and let me go, I swam in a panic to the island, my heart still racing.\n\nI sat back for a moment and took in my situation. Poisoned, horribly maimed, hungry and thirsty. Great.\n\nI remember my bottle of water from the raft and drink the little amount within it, topping off my thirst. That's one problem taken care of for the moment. I need food now. I quickly remember watching countless YouTubers gathering coconuts. I look around and find that not a single palm tree on the island I first landed upon is even remotely short, but they do have that glorious food and water source hanging from them. I slowly climbed up the tree and clicked my first coconut so it drops. Being still unfamiliar with the controls however, I immediately fall right after my food, breaking my arm...\n\nNow I'm poisoned, maimed and have a broken limb. Fantastic....At least I got my coconut.\n\nI spent the next 4 hours of my playtime making terrifying dives into the ocean trying to find the cures to my problems. 4 hours of constant eating and drinking, gathering coconuts and cooking crabs and sardines. 4 hours of wreck after wreck containing no medical supplies. 4 hours of paddling, injured and poisoned, through waters containing sharks still because I was hurt and way too afraid to jump into the water with them and risk dying.\n\nI found Morphine first, broken limb fixed. The very next wreck contained Antibiotics. Wonderful! No more poison. From that point on, I was able to heal to full, move normally and do my thing how I wanted to, unhindered. Now I have a HUGE home in progress, more food than I could ever need, medical supplies, buckets to collect rain, and much, much more.\n\nAll of that was a wonderful experience for me. Without it, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the game as much as I have so far, and I would definitely not be writing this review lol.\n\nI can not recommend this game enough to anyone who enjoys this genre.\n\nStranded Deep\n10/10\nWould do it all again\n\nI hope you enjoyed this review and found it useful.", "timestamp_created": 1432567803, "timestamp_updated": 1432567803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 130, "votes_funny": 46, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855953514575958252", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50577937": {"recommendationid": "50577937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010500458", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1467473091}, "language": "english", "review": "I got the game in March 2016.

I, for some odd reason, can not host our game. Sync sticks at 1%. My sister is able to host and I can connect to her, and then about every 10-15 minutes I get kicked while doing something. Our ping to US West is around 100, so I'm not expecting a great connection, but lag would be better than getting kicked. After getting kicked I'll go back to join game and enter her code and sometimes nothing happens. Just goes back to the join game screen and won't load. So I closed out the game and rebooted, and the same issue will happen. The only way around it was for her to end her game, close out the game, and re-host. Mind you, I host all of our other multiplayer games, Stardew, Phasmophobia, The Forest, and Green Hell and we have not had an issue other than some lag here and there.

Now this is a game destroyer, when all you want to do is even WALK PAST some damn crates........  bharrrp   bharrrp     bharrrpbharrrpbharrrpbharrrpbharrrp    bharrrp   bharrrpbharrrpbharrrp   bharrrpbharrrpbharrrpbharrrpbharrrpbharrrp    bharrrp bharrrp bharrrp bharrrp bharrrpbharrrp\n\noh F*** off !!!!\n\nAnother brilliantly exectued way to destroy the immersion you had.\n\nbharrrpbharrrpbharrrpbharrrpbharrrp\n\nbharrrp\nbharrrp\nbharrrp\nbharrrp\nbharrrp bharrrp    bharrrpbharrrpbharrrp    bharrrp\n\nbharrrp\n\nbharrrpbharrrpbharrrpbharrrpbharrrp\n\nAnnoyed yet?

I bought this game last year in February so I witnessed the course of development it took the last months. I have waited since then to write a (positive) review because I think this game has a great potential and when I bought it last year it already had a solid and fun base for an EA game. \n\nWhat it lacked back then was the longterm motivation. Once you had your basic food and water supplies there was no more need for exploration. All Island were basically the same, a shipwreck here and there but that was it. So I was very very escited for new content. Because the game is developed by only a small team (2 guys if I remember correctly?) updates take some time to be released. But this is where the downfall began...instead of introducing new content to make the game more of a challenge they implemented.....Seaforts! What? Yeah right, Seaforts. The things build by the British in WW2 in the North Sea (!). Other than being totally out of place they provide an additional loot spawn for things you can also find in ship wrecks. Since then (over a year ago now) there hasn't changed much about the amount of content that was released...\n\nTo be fair, the developers did a great job updating the engine (e.g. new crafting system - some like the old one better but it's okay) and improving the visuals. For an indie EA game Stranded Deep has stunning and very impressive graphics creating a fantastic atmosphere. Sitting at you campfire at night starring up in the night sky...thats just beautiful ..but that only makes the lack of content more frustrating because I really want to play this game.\n\nSo to sum it up: I think the developers are too focused on details instead of expanding the core of the game itself. Wildboars, snakes, tools etc. ... that is all nice to have but once you managed the start the game is basically over. Exploring the ocean and other island...pff, why take a risk when I can sit comfortably in my house once it is build?\n\nThis game needs to take a step forward on the macrolevel, not on the microlevel!\n\nI will gladly change this review to a positive one once this happens, until then buy it at your own risk.

The argument against games in early access are built on the games that took your money and, for some reason or another, never released.  I understand that.  This game isn't doing that.\nThe animals are possibly my favorite thing about this game.  The models are honestly gorgeous, and the variety of marine life is just fun to look at.  The colorful fish, nurse sharks, and rays populating the coral reefs along the coasts of islands, the hammer head sharks in the deeper waters, the tiger sharks... and I haven't even seen all of the creatures populating the islands.  The crafting system is simple enough, and offers a wide variety of possible creations.  There are status effects to worry about as well as ways to counter them...\nHonestly, there are so many elements you would want out of a deserted-island-survival game here, as well as a few ridiculous things as well (such as quests revolving around a Megalodon or a Kraken).

 Yes and No.\n\nYes)  Initially you may be impressed by the graphics.  It is beautifully made and the environment is very realistic, down to the ocean breeze and sound of waves softly washing up on the beach.  So next you look around your first Island getting some basic materials to craft some tools and such.  Building isn't complex, but it's neither intuitive or well thought out.  Build yourself a little shelter, then hop on your raft and check out a nearby Island for more materials.  Very fun and gives you high hopes at first.\n\nNo)  You quickly realize there is no content in the game, content is almost never added, and the feeling that you wasted your money on yet another EARLY RELEASE money scam.  Where is the game as of today (October 12th, 2016?)  About 2 updates away from where it was Oct 12th, 2015).  This is the stranded ocean version of DayZ... but with even less content and more bugs.\n\nEdit:  Feb 28th, 2019.  Where is the game now?\n\nWell I did my review almost 2 and a half years ago, so for an early access game, much should have been done to get it rolling to release, if not released already.  The sad truth is the developer completely lost it and couldn't stick to anything, and after 5 years in development, is less fun, more buggy and further away from completion due to so many changes that just keep messing things up and requiring more and more delays.  If this game ever leaves Early Access, it won't be because it's in a state to be released.  It'll be shoved out because... f*uck it.\n\nThis developer had a great idea... and no plan.  Stranded Deep is the result of that, and as it's name implies, is stranded deep in Early Access, never to be rescued or seen again.\n\nEdit:  September, 2022.\n\nSo I decided to give the game another go after another 3 years.

At the moment the game is still pretty buggy and I've used many four letter words while playing (especially whenever my raft just disappeared and i was lost at sea and surrounded by sharks), but that's just what you have to live with when playing alpha.\n\nWhat I like:\n- The atmosphere: I really feels like \"Cast Away\" or something like that.\n- The freedom: You can travel, build a camp, hunt, craft, and so on. Do whatever you like, just don't forget to eat and drink.\n- The crafting system: it still has its issues (stuff lying closely together can make things being involved that you didn't want to get involved) but i like the general idea of this system.\n\n\nFew things I would like to see changed / updatet:\n- More rocks. Damn, sometimes i had to travel to 5 islands before i had enough rock for a fire pit and an axe! That's really annoying since the islands are usually 3-5 minutes of boring RMB-pressing apart.\n- The islands. They look very nice, yes. I only hope there are going to be more different types of them and also really big islands. \n- More things to craft. A house boat would be nice. Or if one could place the bed *inside* the hut. How about an engine for a boat and more boat types and not just rafts?\n- How about finding stuff on the beach?\n\nGenerally I really like this game and again, I think it has great potential.

In its earlier stages I would have recommended the game just because it was successful at making you feel that you were actually playing a survival game. You started out with a handful of items including a water bottle that would get you to the beginning of day 3, if you were unlucky at finding a bucket for water by then you died. \n\nUnlike now, buckets were primarily found in shipwrecks that littered the ocean floor and provided a good bit of exploration as you scooted a long in your raft and saw a broken mast sticking up and dived down to search the cabnets and lockers inside the ship. You were instantly pitted against the sharks as you dodged them in between surfacing for air and diving back into the ship to collect the loot. When you got to your raft you weren't safe, the sharks were actually good at tipping over your raft and dumping you back into the water giving you a nice panic attack as you tried to flip your raft back over and get on it before being eaten alive.\n\nThe updates they have made since then have made some of the things about the game better, but they have also ruined a lot of what was making the game interesting. You don't see large ships sunken in deep water like you used to, as most seem to be half a ship already parked up on a beach for you. The previously coveted bucket is now everywhere on the islands, in my last go at this game I visited maybe 3 different islands and already found 7-8 buckets. If i had even 2 buckets after 10 in game days of play previously I would have considered it a solid session. It was just enough to give you what you needed to keep going, but also not so much that you still had to manage your time and precious daylight doing things that were actually going to let you live another day.\n\nAs of the time of this review 2/13/17, you will find more than you ever need to survive endlessly in this game in the first 20 minutes of starting a new game. This I guess isn't totally bad but they do not offer you any other game design to replace the hardcore survival aspect. There is no progression, no skills or talents that you slowly grind for to figure out how to make things better and no where interesting to go. Would be a great direction change for them to redesign the entire map of this game and how it is generated, small island perfectly placed X distance apart in each compass direction isn't interesting.
