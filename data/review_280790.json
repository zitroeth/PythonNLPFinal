Oh yeah, they also made sure to LOCK CREATIVE MODE BEHIND A PAYWALL!!! Now that they made the game $25 instead of free, us that played the game before when it was free can't do anything unless we pay money! Our worlds are gone, servers deleted. So if we have time spent, like my nearly $100 hours, that time is just gone. No legacy support or anything for us that were here in the early days, none at all. We were told to pay up or get lost.\n\nMy recommendation? Get Minecraft. It costs only $5 more at $30 and you can do EVERYTHING!!! Servers, LAN worlds, all block types, all biomes, creative mode, survival mode, the ability to switch between modes.

Also, now that the developers have decided to take the game out of Early Access, I felt it\u2019s about time I do a review of a game I've put over a year of playtime into.\n\nFor those who who think my playtime is fake,  I started playing the game after it went free to play (update 25) in November 2015.\n\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n1. The Developers. I've been playing and beta testing games since the dawn of time of computers (remember having to type in your games and not even being able to save to a tape drive?). Even after all that time, I have found that the developers are some of the best I've ever dealt with. They listen to the community and do care about their game and the people playing it. It\u2019s rare to have a developer, even in alpha tests, ask people directly what their problems and concerns are, and you see results within a few weeks, if not immediately. The developers (and the community I play with) keep me coming back for more.\n\n2. Even after all the updates, and the game going free to play; the game has not become pay to win (no matter what other people may think on this). There is no win or lose, except for how you the player view your goals. None of the paid content is required to play. Pro will give you nice, but not needed options, for your world and your character in game. You explore, collect, craft, build, publish adventures and meet people. Unless you want to duel someone in PvP, there isn't a \u201cyou win\u201d for the game. People have 1000+ hours on worlds, and are still building away.\n\n3. Most items can be obtained by playing the game. Blueprints are made with in game items, and usually require no premium blocks. And if they ever do require a premium block, those blocks are easily replaced with any non-premium ones.\n\n4. Updates, lots of updates. They are always adding more to the game. As I said before, the developers listen to the players, and many of the things added to the game is what we, the players, have asked for them to add in.\n\n5. Limited to your imagination, but you can always use a blueprint if you can't get inspired. ;)\n\n6. Hundreds of worlds you can play (yes, even if you aren't a Pro account). There are worlds that have been set up for PvP, PVE, RP, etc, etc. Go into the forums on Steam and you can find people asking for players in the Public Worlds section. So, if you want to be social, you have no excuse not to find a place that suits your play-style. There are worlds out there that are kid friendly, and others that are set up for adult players who want time off from the kids and/or work worries.\n\n7. Solo or multiplayer. So again, choose your play-style.\n\n8. The community is very friendly and helpful. This tends to not be the case on many games where the anonymity of the internet seems to make people think that it becomes a right to be a total... um.. . well you get the point.\n\n\n[b]The Not So Good, But Not So Bad:[/b]\n\n1. Even though it\u2019s a necessary evil, the developers need money to keep the game going, and to feed themselves. I will happily show my support of a game that I enjoy by paying a subscription (even a FTP one) or by any micro-transactions that I feel like getting. Some people believe FTP means everything is free, which of course is not true. The developers getting no money equals the game most likely shutting its doors. :(\n\n2. Bugs... okay, what game out there doesn't have them? But this is minor to me with this game, as under the Good stuff, you'll notice that the developers are always fixing every bug they can stomp flat.\n\n3. No running ads across your screen for you to be annoyed with, which you see in many FTP games (as it\u2019s a source of income). No ads that stop your gameplay every xx minutes like some FTP games either. If you don't go Pro, you get a splash screen when logging into the game loading an area after teleporting that mentions going Pro, and an icon in the corner of your screen mentioning Pro. Some people will not like this, but the splash screen is only up during the period that the area is loading [when you can't do anything in game anyways]. \n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n1. Some people believe that buying things like Pro give you unlimited power in the game, or speed up construction times, etc. Sorry to burst your bubbles, but the game isn't set up to do that. (Not bad in my eyes, but for others who want to pay to win it is).\n\n2. If you are looking for a game with lots of mob killing fun, and difficult bosses to beat, this game may not be for you. They aren't too difficult to kill, especially once you get geared up and figure out the easy ways to kill them.", "timestamp_created": 1494497171, "timestamp_updated": 1511632227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 154, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.903481125831604004", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21600146": {"recommendationid": "21600146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009985903", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1220, "last_played": 1455981233}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]TL;DR - You may as well try it.[/b]\n\nAs a minecraft clone, there are a lot of mechanics in this game that will feel familiar to anyone who has played minecraft. Creativerse, however, adds its own spin on the idea. I will be comparing this game to minecraft throughout this review. Lets go through some pros and cons:\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] Same feeling of freedom you get from minecraft. Really do whatever you want.\n[*] Animal taming system is a really cool optional part of the game, that has been refined from the model that existed in minecrft.\n[*] biomes look beautiful, considering the limitations of block-based graphics\n[*] Server system is much easier to manage than other games of the genre, with jump-in game worlds with user privilage settings\n[*] Frequent updates are adding content and squeezing out bugs regularly\n[*] Free-to-play model works great (Will explain below)\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] Game progression is slower than you'd be used to. It takes longer to get to the better tools than minecraft, and deeper layers are un-minable using older tools. Really don't like this feature.\n[*] Still a bit buggy. Some instances of creatures spawning where they shouldn't and water not acting as it should.\n[*] Too many block types. I will explain this below.\n[*] Some block rarities need to be tweaked.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Review [/h1]\n\nFor some background, I live in a house with 6 of my friends, guys and girls included. Most of us are heavy gamers, and one or two are more casual. I downloaded this game on a whim and within a day the whole house was playing in my world. They had all built their own little houses and we had started organising larger projects and had delegated tasks to everyone. [b]This. Felt. Great.[/b] It was a really cool experience that I personally never got out of minecraft, even when playing with friends. We all really love the features and look of the game, and the fact that anyone can drop in, work on the castle a bit or collect ore from the mines and drop out whenever they want. If thats the kind of experience you think you'd enjoy then this game will be a fun casual time sink. \n\nNow, the free to play model does have microtransactions. As far as I can tell, you can spend money on blueprints (large outlines of complicated designs that let you know which resources you'll need to build.) and consmetic blocks (recipes that unlock blocks with unique textures). Obviously, all of this content is completely optional and purely cosmetic. This is why I think it is a pro for this game. \n\nBlock types... There are hundreds of them. Trees drop different kinds of wood, stone is only found in the shallowest layer of digging, each digging layer is made up completely of different sets of blocks representing rock types. What's good about this is the cosmetic implications. You can pretty much find a block with the exact texture you want for the walls of your dungeon or treehouse. What's bad about this is your poor poor storage space. It won't take long for you to fill up containers of bedrock, limestone, dirt etc etc and it is often hard to tell the difference at a glance which is which. The majority of these blocks are used is at least one recipe. This makes the crafting system quite complex. If I want to make an iron mining cell for whatever reason, I still have to keep flipping back to the recipe page to check what I need, even though i've crafted dozens of them. \n\nBlock rarity. For the most part, rare blocks are very useful for specific recipes. An I tem called rockster rock is very difficult to find away from a beach, so I'd say its quite rare, but it is only really used in weapon crafting. Obsidion, which is found quite shallow under ground, is also rare. I cannot tell you how many times I found a lump of coal and got excited because I thought it was obsidion. Now, contrary to rockster rock, obsidion is used in a huge amount of essential recipes, including the recipe needed to harvest more obsidion. I spend far too much time just looking for obsision, because it is far too rare for the recipes that use it. Obsidion is just one example, it does happen with other block types, but that might ust paint the picture.\n\nAll in all, creativerse is definitely a fun game, Its free, Its not graphics intensive, It looks great, and its easy to play with your friends. It has its problems, obviously, but they are activley being worked on.

That said... Many games have followed trying to pretend it's not Minecraft, but really just a clone. When I first saw Creativerse, I thought Ok it's free for a few days, no harm... Few hours later... \"PURCHASE FOR MYSELF\"\n\nCreativerse, gave me a renewed interest in Sandbox Gaming, I love that it is in Early Access and the devs are actively working on taking the game to further heights. Love the graphics, Love the design, and the gameplay is very smooth. Your ability to create is nearly endless, and it makes you want to Play, Explore, Build, Survive. \n\nI love the way people are banding together, helping each other, building a greater community and relying on each other to grow. In our world: \"The Era RPG Server\" (New Server) we've actually built a thrieving socity based on rules and guidelines, professions, teamwork, trust and communication. We actual have character roles and play out our adventures together.\n\nExploration is very enjoyable, so many different and unique wonders to see, I was exploring and found a spot where 3 biomes met... Beautiful Canyons, Thick Jungle, and Frozen Snow... I was truly amazed at the possiblities of building in places like that.\n\nTheir are ton of mobs, ugly ones, really cute ones, to down right nasty looking mobs... I am excited to see what new functions for pets they will come up with. A few suggestions: \n\nA Pet Whistle to call your pet when they get lost, I like to let mine wander. \nThey should help you in combat, I mean they where kicking your butt while you where taming them what happened to the fight in them,\nA Pet Trough to feed your pets when your away, so when you come back you can gather from them and then give'em a little shower.\n\nCombat is simple Hack and Slash, point and click. For the stage it is, you wont need more than that. However I would like to see implementation of ranged weapons above throwing pinecones, a Bow or Crossbow, maybe the Water Sprayer can deal damage to enemies, implement a flamethower, I KNOW THE ANIMATION IS THERE... Those Firerats will mess you up. Perhaps a Block Button? Just a thought.\n\nHealth should, however slowly, regenerate over time, and recover completely when you sleep. \n\nCharacter Customization is a MUST, even being able to change the simplest details, Skin color(include green), Eye color, Hair color... Hoodie color.... (optional) Ears, Nose, Mouth, Hair style, Shoe color...\n\nA Trade Window, that allows you to trade with anyone in the world. The window pops up, you pick who you are trading to and the item your trading and a request pops up on their screen, they click ok, the trade window opens on their screen.. they add what they are trading, both parties hit confirm... Boom... and they can be anywhere in the world.\n\nThis game can easily set a completely new and different standard for sandbox crafting gaming.\nCreative has the Potintial to Surpass Minecraft in everyway with or without mods.\n\nDEVs PLEASE don't Give up on us! It would be a crime against Gamers...

Some will make u run in terror just at the sight. Some just want to be left alone. I killed a baby crab. Felt evil. Was awesome.\n\n5) Combat system flows really well.\n\n6) Character isn't modable but thats ot a big deal. It could happen in future updates.\n\n7) The cave systems and mining capabilities are simply better.\n\n8) I do however wish it wasn't all server based. Local play would be a great improvement.\n\n9) The grinding element can be annoying but once you locate where certain items are found (aka which biome its in) you can link teleporters and quickly get around the world.

There were other influences, too, like Dwarf Fortress. Minecraft has been overwhelmingly successful; after recently selling to Microsoft, Notch famously just bought the most expensive house on the market in Beverly Hills. Good for him, I say.\n\nMinecraft is not at all the only game to have incorporated Barth's ideas, and look how many Minecraft-type indie games have emerged since Mojang began to enjoy such success.

You have this nifty wrist gauntlet that will suck up blocks and put them in your inventory.  Your first order of business is to upgrade that gauntlet with a wood mining cell.  You'll need to check what you need to craft that cell and acquire the ingredients. So the game goes until you're completely outfitted with top tier armor and equipment.  While you do this, you'll explore many different biomes, and levels to get the needed ingredients.  Some people feel this is the end game, but for me the joy of this game has just begun.  Now You can get down to some creative building.  You can do this solo, or find a good server with like minded individuals and build to your hearts content.  \nThere are also different multiplayer servers you can join, or start your own and list it in the Public Worlds forum for others to join.  \nPVE-player vs. environment is the most common.

There are health potions which you can make and are very useful because there is no cooldown to use them and they are pretty easy to make.

Oct 27, 2016[/h1]\n\nThis game like so many has lots of potential.\n\nI write this review from the perspective of enjoying to build structures and crafts as I have little interest in PvP, and people should learn to be creative together rather than destructive.\n\n[b]Briefly about the game[/b]\n\nLike in \"Minecraft\" you just spawn in the middle of an area with a few supplies and are left to your devices.  You are given a note advising you to find shelter before dark or face the unknown.\nYou have a power glove that can harvest resources by pulling them towards you, which when you have enough can be used to craft and create other blocks allowing you to build what ever your imagination can dream up.\nBlock recipes are learned as you acquire contents, craft other items, find them in treasure chests, or take them from the native life.  Many mobs are hostile all the time, at night and are burned away with the rising sun.\nThis world operates very differently from other mining/building games by increasing the difficulty as you dig deeper and build higher.  The deeper you mine the tougher the materials to break and the harder the native mobs.  At higher altitudes its very very cold and you need a heat source to avoid freezing to death.  In addition to vertical temperature changes you also experience changes as you move from region to region ( for example tropical is warmer than forest or snow ).\nAs the sun crosses the sky shadows of the buildings being created will  stretch forth for a nice affect.\nYou must keep exploring and searching or some recipes will never be known.  Once found they are yours for good if and only if you have paid for the Pro version.\nDuring the progress of the game you can tame various animals, once tamed if feed and washed they will yield some resources or even recipes.   Don't expect to get them without a fight, even in peaceful mode.  This aspect seems a little childish to me.. and probably more oriented to ten year old's teaching them to look after their pets.\nWARNING do not use the free 300 coins to buy any claims, as you will loose the benefit in other worlds.  Only the bought recipes will be available in other worlds.\n\n[b]Pro's:[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]Texture detail is high resolution and merge almost seamlessly with each other making for better looking walls and floors.\n[*]You can hold a large volume of items in your inventory, ( lets face it 1 cubic foot of steel weights 490lbs in reality so its never real ), so as far as gaming is concerned a large inventory stack ( 99 ) saves a fair amount of time.\n[*]You can craft items directly from your inventory as long as you have the stock.\n[*]You don't need to eat to play the game... only to heal yourself.\n[*]You can use TNT to blow up useless terrain, and the rare valuable ores are maintained.\n[*]Ores are more bountiful than some other games.\n[*]You have teleporters to travel almost anywhere, which adds a nice touch.  Each one can be coded to allow access to specific  other teleporters.\n[*]Block orientation within Creativerse has a nice addition, you can rotate most blocks into different positions.  For example slabs can be placed on edge allowing the creation of narrower walls etc...  Tapered roofing can be placed on the ends of gable roofs giving a correct feel and look.\n [*]The wiring and electronics available within the game is superior and does not take up extra space.  You also have number pads to enter values within the game for some nice security features.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Creativerse has no \"Creative Mode\" what a surprise\n[*] Boring, Boring, boring... not sure why the point but I've just spent the last 9.8 hours looking for recipes for the new xmas features to only discover about 60% of them.. basically a waste of 9.8 hours of my life... no building, just mindless pointless jumping around searching for recipes. I've decided to dump this game since the develper obviously does not care about my time.\n[*]This is a pay to keep playing game, even after you buy the \"Pro\" version, you still can't play locally.\n[*]Single Player and offline are not available period, due to server authentication.   So if the server is down or runs out of cash you are done.\n[*]You must claim land by one of two methods, pay real cash to buy coins, to buy land or harvest expensive ores to pay for them.  At first its coal, then obsidian, then diamonds, then lumite (very hard to find in large quantities without wasting a ton of time. \n[*]To smelt blocks and Items you must click once for EACH piece to enter the furnace. ( a very bad idea that can lead to  potential physical injury ( I speak from experience ).\n[*]To process blocks and items you must click once for each piece. They have a collect all button but not a process all, and its 21 clicks to fill the machines.\n[*]To place items you must click once for each piece.\n[*]Recipes found are not retained from world to world unless you pay for the pro version.\n[*]More slab shapes could be enabled in various hue's to better match the building materials in play. This con was addressed by [b][i]R36[/i][/b] now have lots of slabs and new slopes\n[*]Colours in some blocks look like they came from totally different palettes  ( for example 3 iron blocks belong and look in place while the corresponding stairs don't match at all ).\n[*]Their are very few mechanisms, only doors, pressure switches and fans to interact with players.  Currently I'm not aware of a way to hide a pressure plate. ( No pistons)\n[*]I've played the game for a long time and even with a \"Pro\" version I'm missing many recipes.\n[*]Timing errors occur between family members playing over the Lan and obviously sharing a connection to the server.\n[*]Buggy, but they do make an effort to fix them.\n[/list]\nDue to the high high repetition of clicking and the lack of single player  and offline, I can not honestly recommend the game, and personally feel its doomed to fail.  If you are a casual builder that comes on once in a blue moon then you may not have any issues, but serious large scale builders will not be happy if their efforts just vanish one day without a trace.  I also personally feel that if you've got the \"Pro Version\" you should be able to retain the game and play offline, including \"Lan\".\n\nPS..

Blocks are blocks but Creativerse has a lot more things to offer. I'm gonna write this review while in comparison with Minecraft since Creativerse is a lot of time misjudged with it.\n\nThe biggest difference between Creativerse and Minecraft? Mining Cells. In Minecraft, you use Pickaxe to mine on stone materials, Axe to chop wood and Shovel on dirt. In Creativerse, you use Mining Cells aka gloves to literally suck all blocks. There are about 6 gloves in game and with every better glove you get, the more things you can mine, and faster too. \n\nMovement in the game can be a real pain in the ass sometimes since you often feel like you are sliding while moving which you actually kinda are. Yeah the movement is really wacky but that's just my personal opinion.\n\nWhere does Creativerse shine? Blocks. There is a shit ton of blocks in the game. Much more that there are in Minecraft. Not counting that most of blocks have their varients as slabs, stairs or roofs. Also, Creativers has a real cool feature of blueprints. You can find any building you like on workshop and with the help of the blueprint, you can build it in your own world.\n\nThere's also lot of exploring. Lot of biomies, lot of mobs and varients of them. You can explore on the surface, seeking biomes and new materials, or you can go deeper mining through multiple layers having many different materials and ores. Deeper you go, the better materials you can get. Although you're gonna need special potions to stay alive in deeper layers.\n\nTextures of blocks can sometimes look a bit weird but that depends on your own taste. Also, there's a function in the game that allows you to rotate blocks, which can be really useful for builders. \n\nAll and all, I wouldn't say Creativerse is an amazing game, of course not. It lacks some serious features, movement is kinda wacky and it has a lot of bugs. What I really want to say is, that Creativerse is a largely overrated game. Like, everybody's gona tell to themselves when they see the game, \"Huh, blocks, another Minecraft rip-off\", and it really isn't. Is it an amazing game? Not quite. Is it worth trying? Definitely. \n\nMy final rating: 7,5/10\nVerdict: Go play it if you like Minecraft but got bored of it\n\nThank you for making it through the whole thing.

It seems that at the start they were a large team of good competent people, but then they downsized and all the good people left.   Then it was problem after problem.\nFirst the game was Paid in early access, then it went free.   As a \"Thank you\" to the early payers they rewarded them with  an exclusive gold pack.  \nTHEN..... the gold pack was put on the store that anyone can buy.   Apparently gratitude can be a microtransaction to these devs.   \nTHEN they sold blueprints.   After people bought blueprints, they decided that blueprints were Free and the items for the blueprints could be bought instead.   At every change they doomed their great game even more.  Madness.\n\nThey had an in game store where you buy coins to buy items, blocks and costumes.  Now the store is gone, along with any coins purchased.   Gone.\nAs of now, they have changed the game from free back to paid again and give EVERYTHING to anyone who buys the game.   It doesn't matter if you gave them $5 or $500 dollars, they screw everyone who paid over the years \"equally\".   Why charge people money to buy something others don't have when you end up just giving everything to anyone?  It's a slap to the face.\n\nOh, and now all your server games are going to be gone and you have a limited time to back them up locally or you are screwed again.  If you lose your local files, they will be gone forever.  Older players that only come back now and then are going to very upset to find the worlds they have been working on for years are just gone.\n   The devs had a golden egg in their hands and they dropped it, smashed it, and chased the parts on the ground like a bad 3 stooges scene.\n\nIs this game good?

It's a good game. It's visually more attractive than MC, but then, aren't they all? There are some interesting novel new ideas, in the arena of mineral extraction. The character avatars are currently limited to two congenital twin white people with the same armor/clothing. Here's to hoping they introduce more diversity of races, both real and fantasy.\n\nYou could spend a lot of time in this game, like Minecraft, just wandering around. They have plugged in more mobs, and the crafting system is more streamlined. One of their selling points in their own copy was \"No more googling for craft recipes!\" Ok, that's cool and everything, but not exactly original.\n\nWhat needs to happen is for the developers to COMPLETELY disavow themselves of the pay for content model. They need to make an original game that works, right now, that people will flock to, or else it's just another bloated dead beta corpse in the water. When they said they wanted to charge for content and upgrades and rushed completion of contruction (they were/are going to use a pay-to-hurry-completion model similar to every exploitative MMORPG ever), that really pushed them into the margins. It was a major PR messup.\n\nI know I'm probably not the first to suggest:\n\nNPCs that are actually interesting and contribute to the environment in an original way. Vendors are the first thing people make in sandboxes. Okay, what could be more interesting? NPCs that give you missions. Okay, that's great. That would improve the game. What else? NPCs  that form relationships with the characters, that can tell stories.\n\nThe mobs are more interesting in Creativerse than in Minecraft. They have \"special moves\" which seems to promise a lot of potential. Unfortunately, they're a little stupid, although seemingly more dangerous than in Minecraft. \n\nCreate features that are interesting to explore and interact with, not just showcases of a new graphical innovation or mob. Minecraft is minecraft. You can't compete with minecraft by being Minecraft. At this current stage, I see no major innovation in this game. No story, no new angle.

Having to purchase Pro is a bit of a pain, especially since most of the games best items and tools are locked behind this paywall, however, I understand the creator's need to make money off of a game that IS, admittedly, Free to Play. After one hour, I had claimed a plot of land, built myself up to mid-teir mining tools and weapons, setup a home base within a cave, and began a full crafting setup to continue to build up my equipment. A few things about the game to know before you delve into it for yourself:\nYes, its basically a Minecraft clone, however, it is MUCH better than ANY other MC Clone on the F2P AND P2P markets. The dev's take on the Minecraft formula is interesting, and fun to play. My only qualm is that it is WAY more complicated than MC, the crafting recipe's require more resources, both in quantity and variety, and resources for crafting take a lot more effort, exploration, and critical thinking, to acquire. \nThe combat is interesting as well. Certainly more enjoyable than MC's, to me at least, and my favorite part about the combat is the increase in difficulty over MC. In Creativerse, building a home isnt as easy, and you likely wont have one constructed before the first night rolls around. Hence why I setup my homebase in a cave. I recommend using the free 300 coins given to purchase the 100coin Explosives pack (to ease combat), and the 100coin lighting pack (to stop enemy creature spawns). Creatures spawn more often, and due to their method of spawning and the random nature of it, enemies CAN and WILL catch you by surprise. This was fun to me, but may not be to others.\nThe crafting system IS well designed, and intuitive, but nowhere near as \"streamlined\" as MC. You wont be stuck having to lookup recipe's, or using the \"shape-building\" system of MC, as CV tells you exactly what you need and how many of them are required to craft specific items. Again, however, it takes much more effort to get your hands on what you'll need, so be aware of that. It could be more well designed, the menu's can be a bit of a pain to move between, as least for new players, but the overall learning curve is a bit lower than MC's, at least in most aspects. \nCreatures are entertaining, and the fact that their loot drops in bags which can be searched, rather than items you auto-pickup, is welcomed greatly over the traditional MC system of loot drops. \nCombat is also fun, and weapons look pretty cool, in my opinion. Enemies have health bars, and nothing is TOO difficult to take down, but combat CAN be more difficult than MC's at times, again, especially for new players. \nExploration is fun, and the world is pretty and relatively well-built, and top of the line among MC clones. \nLastly, as I said before about coins and packs, you can purchase certain utility items such as lighting, explosives, and materials (such as doors, walls, and decor, NOT crafting materials, not that I saw anyway), and this system is welcomed to some degree. It's a bit cheap, as it encourages Micro-Transactions to ease the beginner's learning curve, and difficulty, but it's done fairly well, and since it does not include weapons/tools/crafting materials, which would essentially be \"pay to win\", as much as it could be in a MC style game, I suppose I can look past the whole \"using real world money to buy in game currency to purchase item bundles\" system. Also, while Pro does increase inventory space, and unlock most of the better items, the space and items available within the Free version are acceptable, and overall, you CAN enjoy this game without ever spending a dime on it. So, not so bad. \n\nOverall Conclusion: Creativerse is a fun, entertaining, and interesting take on the Minecraft formula. While it IS, for better or worse, a clone of MC, it is by far the best one available, and being F2P is a huge plus, even if most of the better items are locked behind a paywall. The variety of items and combinations proves fun and encourages creativity, and as such, offers comparable levels of replayability and time spent in-game to Minecraft. Overall, if you're looking for a Minecraft-style game that can be played for free, or just bored of MC and want a clone of it, or similar game, thats actually GOOD? Then I 100% recommend Creativerse as an alternative. \nMy personal rating? 7.5/10. Gameplay is fun, variety is acceptable, but the learning curve, while easier than MC's, can prove cumbersome, same with the acquiring of crafting materials, and I will almost ALWAYS lower the score when you hav a F2P game with paywalls and in-game currency/Micro-transactions, but perhaps this is mostly just my own personal bias, having been burnt out on Micro-purchases due to their overabundance in gaming, ESPECIALLY on console. \nDefinitely give it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1501491941, "timestamp_updated": 1501491941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.7928963303565979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136486389": {"recommendationid": "136486389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065209502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11955, "last_played": 1681153113}, "language": "english", "review": "Spent around $300 in cosmetics for this game, now all have been taken from me.

I can and do wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone that may be interested in cube based building exploration sandbox type games. For those who don't TL;DR, read on.\n\nYeah, the immediate knee-jerk reaction is \"Ooooh, Minecraft ripoff!\". If you judge books by their covers, then yes, you are probably correct in the same way that all tissues are a ripoff of Kleenex, all copiers are a ripoff of Xerox, and any FPS game is a ripoff of Wolfenstien 3D. This review is not for the knee-jerk reactionaries out there. This is for those who can look at a game and look at the feedback for a game, and base their reactions and judgements on something more than knee-jerks.\n\nFirst off, the core game is free to play. You can download and play with ALL the core features without having to spend a dime. Now, with that said, the developers are not doing this out of the kindness of their heart, they are in this as a business, and businesses require income. So, with a game that the developer wants everybody to be able to play free, what are the financing options? Well, DLC and/or microtransactions. Creativerse has both. The PRO DLC adds some completely unnecessary but fun expansion to the game. The microtransactions are for some premium block recipes that are completely unnecessary for building, but allow you to add some more variety to your builds. The microtransactions also come in if you want to get building immediately, you can buy a set of blocks and a building plan (a blueprint, in Creativerse terms) to assemble those blocks into something interesting. Howerver, you don't have to spend money for those blueprints, you can craft them out of materials gathered in game and then collect the blocks needed to build them in game. And on the odd blueprints that utilize premium blocks you don't have access to, you can swap in a different block to replace it.\n\nSecondly, the core game is free to play. You can download and play with ALL the core features without having to spend a dime. This means that, before you even have to think about paying for something, you can download and experience all the core features of the game to see if it is really something you want to put time and money into. The survival, the material collecting, the crafting, the building, the combat, the farming, the taming, the machine wiring, the exploration; all of it, free. If that's how you want to play, by all means, play without spending a dime. But if you find yourself enjoying it, consider buying something to support the developers and to encourage further development.\n\nThe community of dedicated players is a friendly and helpful one, in general. Yeah, there are some hot buttons that can be pressed, much as there is with any game with a dedicated fanbase. But overall, if you have a question, there's somebody willing to answer it nicely. If you see some premium blocks that you want to build with, there are people who are willing to craft them for you. Oh, and mulitplayer is easy as sharing your world name and password, so someone can come and assist you on your own world, if you so wish. You don't HAVE to play with other people, but it is a very simple process to do so.\n\nThe environments are elaborate and full of character, both the surface and the subterranean biomes. Yes, the ground is not homogenous. Combat has challenge to it, but not in the simple \"blow for blow, toe to toe\" who can heal fastest sense. You can tame ANY mob in the game and then feed and harvest it for materials. Currently 4 different crops and 7 different liquids that allow you to cook various foods that provide different buffs to you, and provide fodder for your pets. Once your mining equipment gets to a certain level, you start being able to harvest lower tiers of blocks without needing to repair it. The machine system is a wireless logic system that allows anything from simple door openers to complex mini games. And if you get tired of building and exploring in your own world, you can Adventure in other people's builds and stories.

However, as any game that there is, Creativerse does have a few drawbacks. \n\n[h1] PROS\t[/h1]\n\n+ [b] building [/b]\nYou have quite many types of blocks available, more can be found throughout the world or unlocked by crafting. It allows you build realistic things and you also have furniture available, so you don't have to pretend some particular stairs and wooden sign make up a chair like you did in Minecraft, but rather craft a real good looking one. It even has many types and color of lighting, with this every room can have different feel and it's literally builder's heaven. I enjoyed my creations much more than in MC and you can actually interact with some of the objects (sitting on chairs). \n+ [b] graphics [/b]\nFinally a building game with blocks, that doesn't look straight outta 2004. Great textures, lively colors, sunlight rays, motion blur, good stability, you got it all. \n+ [b] crafting [/b]\nCrafting is based on discovery upon obtaining certain item or crafting. This means if you want to make diamond sword, you cannot just make it without having crafted all other types of swords that are before it. This could be a drawback to some, but I didn't mind it. Also you no longer have to go and search everything on the wiki, all recipes are shown, no crafting tables, yay! It also tells you where to get the item, so I'd say crafting is fun and rewarding. \n+ [b] mining[/b]\nSomething I didn't like at first, but ended up loving it. If you want to mine, you have to craft an extractor first, yet these are easy to get (you need just wood and stones) and extracting takes some time. It ranges from 1 minute (not exactly sure), but caps at 10 minutes for rarest ore. I didn't mind using it and you can craft better extractors, it adds the futuristic feel to the game and it's not bugging you, as from 1 block you can extract up to 6 ores, so actually you'll end up with more and it's not bad at all. Ores and fairly easy to find, maybe a bit too easy. \n+ [b] free servers for everyone[/b]\nIn this game you don't have to pay for a server, you can just open your own for your friends, protect it with password, etc. Also people can buy these protected chunks of land which are really huge and they cost just a few coals. Prevents griefing a lot so in this aspect it's awesome, easy to play with a friend and secure. \n+ [b] taming and pet system [/b]\nYou can tame any pet in this game, then you should (but you don't have to, it's immortal) feed the pet, wash it for it to give you gifts (useful items). Entire process of taming is a bit tedious, as you just ring the bell in front of the pet and there could be some sort of minigame with multiple difficulties, to make it more interesting, Also, monsters sometimes bug out and they don't attack you, so makes taming easier. \n+ [b] dying system [/b]\nI actually called it dying system, ha. When you die, this game is not as punishing as minecraft. It marks place of your death on your compass and you got plenty of time to get in there and obtain all your items. Also, you got this mini device and wherever you put it, you're able to teleport to it anytime, so moving out of caves isn't digging up and praying to lava gods or getting lost trying to get out then ending up with option #1. \n+ [b] explosives! [/b]\nIn this game you got many options how to f**k s**t up and it's not just TNT. \n+ [b] mining/collecting animation [/b]\nIn this game you say goodbye to axes, shovels and pickaxes, for all of these there's this cool futuristic glove that kind of sucks in the blocks to your inventory, it's extremely satisfying and fast. \n+ [b] funny and original item descriptions [/b]\nI really like to read stuff and based on certain item descriptions or game telling you stuff, the devs seem like funny people and I'd definitely love to see quests in this style as well. \n\n[h1] NEUTRALS [/h1]\n\n= [b] gardening/cooking [/b]\nThis is what you'd see in Minecraft, exactly the same farming formula and same with cooking, except not many meals can be cooked and you'd find feeding them to your pets more than to yourself. Currently there's no reason to eat food, as you don't have hunger bar, only hp bar and meals only extend it, they don't fill it up. To get full health you'll just suicide or get hit by mobs till you die so your hp resets. \n= [b] character customization [/b]\nI put it as neutral, because you won't ever be looking at your character, but if you're a person like me, you'll appreciate it. In this game you unfortunately only change your gender and colors of pre-made outfit. It's not a big deal, but it's something.\n\n[h1] CONS \t[/h1]\n\n- [b] variety of mobs [/b]\nBy the time you'll be a few hours in game and not having spent lots of time with building, chances are, you've already seen all the enemies and  killed them. There are 2-4 (or so) types of enemies per biome and also a few types of night monsters, but if you live in certain biome, it'll get boring rather quick with the variety. But I do believe later on new will be added, as this is still early access game. \n - [b] not enough of things to do  [/b]\nI didn't get to this point yet, but I've got just 17 hours in game (of maybe which 15 is the actually gameplay) and I've already killed all types of mobs and mined the rarest kind of ore and I have loads of it. At this point, only thing I can think of doing is maybe a [strike] diamond toilet [/strike] pet collecting or more building, but you do get the point. \n - [b] combat  [/b]\nNot the most impressive thing you will see. You got a bit clumsy sword swinging and that's about it. It's pretty chaotic and you got no skills, I wish they added bows or guns.\n - [b] water physics [/b]\nIn short, if you want to have more than 1 block deep pool, you'll be pulling your hair trying to fill it up with water. \n - [b] few minor bugs [/b]\nFor example after you teleport you can see underground and it won't go away, also when you randomly walk sometimes you can see all the underground caves, but don't take this in account, as it's just early access game. \n\n[h1] Conclusion\t[/h1]\n\nCreativerse is one of the the better block building survival games and let's not call it Minecraft clone, as everything in gaming industry could be called a clone with this logic. I think if the devs put more work in variety of content, the game will truly shine, but in its current state it's already solid 7.5/10, that I'll definitely put more of my time into. I'd definitely recommend this game.

It's about finding resources and making new items, building more and exploring. \n- EDIT: two years later - it does have creative mode now! Free players can join public creative worlds and claim an area, but not create their own world.\n\nOn the more positive side: \n- It's free. It's no trickery about you getting so and so far and then having to buy the full game. They ask you to buy creativerse pro with few notices here and there, but nothing flashy or annoying. It can be seen as the free version being the full game, and if you want some extra items and advantages, then buy Pro. \n- There are enemies for you to fight, but in general you can build in peace without being bothered, as long as you create a safe, lit room for nightfall. There's more advanced areas you get to when you have better mining tools for example, and that'll give you more challenges if that's what youre looking for. You can adjust how hostile creatures are too, but I haven't really tested that myself. \n- You can make pets, grow crops, cook recipes, build in an endless open world, play easily either with friends, strangers or alone on servers hosted by Creativerse.\n- The worlds/rooms stay when the creator leaves. I'm sharing a room with a friend and it's nice knowing I can go on even if they're not there. Everything anyone does in the world will be saved automatically and instantly. The creator has the power over who has access to do what, so don't worry about strangers coming in and messing up your building (you can also put on passwords if you don't want sight seers either). \n- Co-op and/or PvP is possible\n- You can edit your character, name, server area and world settings whenever you want. All names are available, so the same names can be used by different people (might be a bit confusing, but I like it personally, haven't met anyone with my name either way) \n\nI will say some things are confusing and not informed well, I've spent some time looking things up (like how on earth to get crops to grow properly), but it's easily found online. \n\nAll in all it's an amazing game, and it's free, so if you're curious just check it out. It doesn't take much space at all and it runs fast on smaller computers too. Highly recommended, as long as you know what the game is and what it isn't.\n\n\nEdit: thought I'd add that there's an adventure option to the game too, instead of just joining worlds to craft. \nEdit 2: The devs are honestly very active still and seem really enthusiastic about their game.

There is optional light melee combat, with the ability to slightly increase the difficulty of your battles. The graphics are detailed and quite colorful, although there\u2019s plenty of darker blocks/areas in the game. Creativerse can accommodate all sorts of playstyles, from mining and resource gathering, simple survival, to creation of structures of all kinds.\n\n[b]Worlds:[/b]\n\nThe game can be played solo, or on multiplayer worlds. The choice is yours. Some players prefer solo, but playing with friends (old or new) can be very enjoyable too. Another advantage of multiplayer is that you can see what your friends are building, and even help them create new and interesting structures. Worlds can be password protected so only you (and your friends if you share the password) can play without interruptions, or they can be left open for anyone to visit.\n\n[b]DLC:[/b]\n\nThere are two DLCs available on the Steam Store, although you can play the game for free with a lot (but not all) of the features available. It is perfectly playable as a free game. The Creativerse Pro DLC adds many new abilities to the game, including the ability to create practically unlimited custom worlds, and discounts for the in-game store. If you want to support the developer and do enjoy the game, then I highly recommend the Pro DLC. The Welcome Bundle adds some nice extras, and gives you 2000 coins for the in-game store.\n\n[b]In-game Store:[/b]\n\nCreativerse\u2019s in-game store is [i]entirely[/i] optional, but there are some great Custom Block sets, quite a lot of unique Costumes for your character (with more coming all the time), Rocket Packs, QBits to help you build, and NPC Villagers. Several of the items in the store can also be found in Login Chests that you can earn every 4 hours. The store items will enhance you game play, but are [i]not[/i] essential to your enjoyment of the game. I\u2019ve personally purchased many items from the in-game store, and feel that it was money well spent.\n\n[h1]Types of GamePlay:[/h1]\n\n[list][*]You can become an [b]engineer[/b] creating incredible structures \n[*]You can become an [b]explorer[/b] discovering all there is to see in your large world\n[*]You can become a [b]miner[/b] gathering hordes of useful resources\n[*]You can become a [b]hunter[/b] slaying creatures of all sorts\n[*]You can become a [b]farmer[/b], plowing, planting, and harvesting crops\n[*]You can become a [b]game designer[/b] creating amazing adventures for other players\n[*]And so much more![/list]\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n[list][*]Colorful, detailed graphics that can be fun to just explore and take in the beauty.

So I quit for around a year. Then recently, my friend tells me to try this game, and it just happens to be Creativerse. Yeah, I give it a try because maybe it would make more sense.\nAnd yes, when you begin, most likely you'll be confused. Or bored. I'd say that this game has a lot of good content, but right off the bat, spawning in a boring-looking grassland or woodland doesn't seem so encouraging.\nAnd if you give it some time, you'll find that it's actually quite engaging. The treacherous caves with monsters and pitch-darkness, the high mountains covered in snow, the different layers of Earth. The monsters are scary-looking and have dangerous special abilities. The Earth's deepest layer is dark, empty and corrupt.\nOverall, I'd say this game is amazing. It's free to play, which is awesome. The graphics are simplistic, but just so that they aren't too busy. The creators actually spent time on the 3D rendered carpets and doors and windows. The mobs really freak me out, so I give it a thumbs up! They don't have much variation, but I'd like to say that that is fine by me. The loot bags and chests are insanely detailed. The loot bags even have physics! How about that.\nAnd unlike Minecraft, this game has recipes that you must unlock by venturing throughout the world, and a simple crafting system that is totally cool. Also unlike minecraft, the weapons and other items have more difference than just a color-overhaul. Blocks are detailed and there are so many ways to customize! There's even furniture!\nNow, there are some things I'd change. First of all, the premium recipes. Yes, yes, we all know that the game needs to make money somehow, but recipes? Would it hurt to let people decorate without spending money on a virtual game? Also, there is a shortage of content. Once you reach the Corruption layer of Earth, there's nothing else. I'd like to see more layers. Maybe a weird, misty, glowy layer of Earth with monsters made of light. That would be cool.\nAnd finally, there should be bows as another weapon.

Reasons to ignore they found were always so absurd, for ex.: he speaks English bad, but enough to understand (because our society is consisted of half of English-speaking players) what bug he talks about and moreover all screenshots our society applicated and gave to mods. \nI have only one question after all: do you still want to play a game where devs communicate with players after a WALL of moderators, who doesn't want to really support players by real actions as to tell Devs about the bugs you tell them?!

The difficulty system is really simple and not well thought out, as all it does is increase enemy damage, health, and fall damage (I think). The reason I would recommend this game is that It is really fun on lower difficulties with less focus on combat. I would recommend playing on normal difficulty or below.

Playfulcorp you ***holes, hahaha!\n\nUPDATE 9/11/2015\n\nWell it has finally happened, PlayfulCO has moved up in the world from the \"greedy, lying, misinformation\" company into the \"censorship, theocracy (where they are the Gods), and terrorist\u201d company. What better day for them to transition than on Sept 11th? What better day? \n\nGamers everywhere, if you support this game you are not only supporting a downright evil company, you are the cause of the downfall that is video gaming. You need to pull your heads out of your butts and start opening your eyes. If you support these companies and these business practices you are the cause of the \u201cEarly Access\u201d problems, the cause of \u201cPTW/PTP/PTC\u201d problems, and the cause of video game companies having the right to stifle freedom of information with censorship. You ARE the cause of gaming review companies, personalities, and publications going the way of the \u201csell out\u201d, and why? Because if they don\u2019t \u201csell out\u201d they are \u201csnuffed out\u201d. \n\nToday, on Sept 11th, I have been permanently banned from Sell-a-verse forums. Was I given a warning? Nope. Was I talked to? Nope. And why was I banned? Here, take a look for yourself:\n\n http://steamcommunity.com/app/280790/discussions/0/517141624282545953/\n\nOh, and don\u2019t worry. If they destroy the evidence and that link doesn\u2019t work check out my blog, I have every screenshot needed for you to take a look at. ( http://www.tihie.com/creativerse.html ) \n\nSo what happened? Someone (Will have to censor screenshots as to not get myself in trouble with Steam) whose first language is French, had a problem. You see he bought the game because it says \u201csolo play\u201d in the description and bought the game in a bundle and now finds out that the game is \u201conline only\u201d. He asked for help and doesn\u2019t understand why the game can\u2019t be played offline. I post a comment (in English and then I took the time to translate it into French for him) explaining how the game is going the FTP micro transactions *(PTW/PTP/PTC) route and that is why it will always be online. I also tell him that he should have read reviews before buying said game (hoping that he would do so in the future but also because some of us take the time out of our lives to try and help other gamers, the least you could do is read it and inform yourself). He then thanked me, first for taking the time to respond, second because I translated it into French for him to easily understand, and third for answering his question. \n\nWhat happens next? Enter Fan Boi (let\u2019s call him \u201cBent\u201d) Bent, he wants to turn the thread into how the game isn\u2019t a PTW/PTP/PTC game, basically giving the middle finger to the person with the problem, and then reports me. Within minutes I am permanently banned for helping this French person with the problem. I get a message:\n\n\u201cYou don't seem interested in having a civil discourse with our community and seem to delight in spreading misinformation about our game and business model. We think you'd be happier spending your time somewhere else. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nPlease feel free to read my older reviews for this game on my blog, check out all of my postings in the Sell-a-verse forums, please read that thread above (if they haven\u2019t killed it) and you tell me if I have not been civil, if I have not been doing anything but spreading simple truths. I would be happier spending my time somewhere else, and I shall. More importantly, gamers, so should you. This sort of \u201cpeople in power quelling people\u2019s voices just because they don\u2019t like what they are saying\u201d, THAT is the death of gaming as we know it, THAT is the death of honest game reviewers as we know it, that SHOULD be the death of early access! Who is going to give an honest review when they get censored? Who is going to give an honest review when they will never be given early copies of games and/or have to buy every single one of the games they review? When companies start censoring conversations that scare them and then only give access to those that will say what they want to say what do you have left?\n\nIn my last review (which you can find on my blog) I pointed out that a lot of the reviews had tags/titles that read \u201creviewed with key sent by developers\u201d, since that time they have all removed that tag. Every, single, one of those \u201cgiven free keys\u201d (hundreds of these reviews on Steam) was \u201cpositive\u201d. \n\nOver the course of this game I have given voice to the thousands (literally) that hate the PTW/PTC/PTP game destroying features in this game, features including but not limited to this: http://steamcommunity.com/app/280790/discussions/0/619573787463233789/\nAnd I have done so civilly and with facts. \n\n(*After posting this review PlayfulCO locked my review and deleted every-single-post I have ever made in their forums in a spectacularly guilty attempt to cover themselves and the truth*)\n\nBottom line is this, you want to buy into early access and support this game YOU are the problem with gaming. And how does Steam respond? By putting reviews that get 50%, 69%, and 70% \u201cfound helpful\u201d in the \u201cmost helpful\u201d section because they are all \u201cpositive\u201d reviews when all of the negative reviews are much, much higher. Tell me this isn\u2019t censorship? Tell me this isn\u2019t \u201cbuying away all the negative reviews so no one ever sees them\u2026\u201d If you have a brain, or if you care about gaming in the slightest, do NOT support this game/company or any like it. \n\nTL;CR \nLook, you can\u2019t read because it will fry your brain but honestly want to know what this game is about, then go to Playfulcorp.com/candycraft2 and see for yourself. Honestly don\u2019t know how long that will continue to be up on their website before they take it down, it is a PR nightmare. \n\n*Please don't bother commenting on review to let me know that \"you \u2665\u2665\u2665 need go die in whole yo!\" because I will just delete it... \n**I suppose people don't even get this far in my review before posting troll comments; as I have said, please don't bother, I honestly delete them without even reading them. You don't like something down vote and move on, if you have a reasonable question I\u2019ll try to answer it otherwise all other comments will be deleted. Ignoring this just proves you can't even read this far before having a fan boi explosion in your pants...\n***Older reviews of this game in their completeness can be found here: http://www.tihie.com/creativerse.html\n****As of June 7th 2017, \"Bent\" is still at folks! http://steamcommunity.com/app/280790/discussions/0/1290691937721855215/?ctp=3", "timestamp_created": 1418614487, "timestamp_updated": 1679392810, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2596, "votes_funny": 244, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769131720066070557", "comment_count": 181, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137630669": {"recommendationid": "137630669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218247613", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3114, "last_played": 1682962380}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME IS TRASH NOW.

We played on his world and it was fun. Decided to reinstall today and play for myself and the first thing I'm met with is the fact that I'm forced to pay money to [b] make [/b] a private world that's singleplayer. I honestly dont understand developers like this that have an amazing game and then just, somewhere down the line, decide \"You know what would get us even more players? Making some key features pay to play\". You're stupid if you decide that. You'll lose a lot more people than you gain. I checked the multiplayer worlds (open ones anyway) to see how many people are playing. I checked about 20 before it started popping up empty and even then the highest player count in one server was 2 people in 1 server out of the 20. Back when I played, they still had some cool features locked behind that crap paywall and it had \"some\" reason behind it. It still kind of annoyed me that you couldn't just get that stuff in endgame or whatever to make the game more fun but I just overlooked it. \n\nTips on how this game would get attention again: \nMaybe dont pull an EA and put anything fun or actually good behind a paywall. Putting a price tag on something you thought of is stupid in terms of this game. The only content that's free is stuff you stole from minecraft, you just dont have a variety of tools and only use the gauntlet (I'm probably wrong with this seeing as how the immense paywall put me off from even trying to start up a public world that's not worth wasting my time over so feel free to correct me). The base content is essentially an open minecraft server forcing you to play online so if you have a bad connection/bad internet you're kinda screwed.

It would seem that Creativerse is an automatic \"recommend\" for me, but it's never that simple. I've been playing Creativerse since fairly early in development. I've seen several rethinking phases in the design and gameplay. I've bought all the store recipes, sometimes to support the development and sometimes because I actually wanted the blocks. I've played it on three separate computers over the past few years, and here's what I've seen.\n\nI love it primarily because it's a low-attention-demand sandbox game for building. It's a good expression for the \u201cLego, block building\u201d style of game. Out of the box, it looks better and contains a great many quality of life improvements over the obvious games to compare it to, many of which I also play from time to time. If you want the kind of game that allows you to build, craft, and collect in a beautifully rendered world with distinct personality from top to bottom, yes it's a great game. It has a nice progression of accessibility to more difficult areas, and you can end up wealthy enough in game terms to do almost anything you want, yet there is never a point where you have literally everything you need, and the game compels you to play in different modes to keep up with everything you want to do. \n\nSometimes, you are the explorer, sometimes the miner, the farmer, the builder, the tinkerer, the evil overlord, whatever... It's your game, and you get to decide, yet there is an interesting balance that drives you gently into different aspects of the game. In design, it's a very complete experience.\n\nCreativerse has its problems too. The most annoying for me is that it is riddled with performance problems that seem to actually get worse over time. I do understand that a lot of data is coming with every block on the map. I can ignore the new problem of visual updates that don't happen when adding new blocks or more aggressively when using explosives. I really struggle with frame rate lags as the game struggles to keep up with rapid changes in the view. It seems to be more of a crunch with incoming data than a limit on graphics rendering. As these problems occur, it's easy to imagine a huge chunk of data trying to move from RAM, through the CPU, onto the graphics card, and finally onto the screen. Bear in mind that I'm currently running on a beast of a system that can edit 4K video without a lag or hitch all day, so seeing performance problems in a game is rare for me. \n\nI've learned that reducing the view radius has the biggest effect on performance, but even so, using a teleporter ( a great quality of life feature) means that I will wait a significant amount of time before I can see the environment after I've arrived in a new location. The confounding aspect is that it wasn't always so. My uninformed guess is that as features have been added to the game over time, the level of optimization hasn't kept up.\n\nAnd third, in a game which has clearly given a lot of thought into quality of life of the player in the form of blueprints, etc., there are some obvious missing pieces. If we can have explosives that neatly carve out 7x7x7 cubes of the landscape, why can't we have an explosive that carves a linear one block wide slice? Perhaps the limits of chunks of the world come into play. Why are the circuit systems so limited? We can play with logic and reaction to input, but the physical effects in the world are very limited. It's no redstone system. Why can't we build vehicles that interact with the inbuilt physics of the world in the form of boats, airships, or even rolling vehicles? Including these possibilities might account for the frame rate lag, as a large number of interactions would need to be considered in every block interaction. \n\nThere are certain farming aspects that exist, such as throwing a cold bomb onto tar, followed by a heat bomb to generate a huge pile of diamond. WIth tar, you can create as much coal or diamond as you want. Why are there no similar mechanisms for iron, or lumite? Even if these existed, they still do not eliminate the need for secondary resources at each level, such as magnetite, tourmaline, or corruption dust. They also do not eliminate the need for hunting at each level, such as leather, miru eyes, or warmwood teeth. Or the cold versions of all of the above...\n\nDon't get me wrong. I think one the best aspects of Creativerse is that you must operate as a hunter, explorer, and miner to progress, but I do notice the inconsistency in each of these aspects of the game.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to whether you want a game that follows in the Minecraft tradition with a better game out of the box, with a few problems, or whether you enjoy the endless tinkering that comes with creating the Minecraft game that you want. A younger version of myself may have chosen the tinkering option, but the busier, older version of myself prefers Creativerse, and the arguably more complete quality of creative gameplay it offers. Your mileage may vary....\n\nI'll give it a recommendation, but I still think my monstrous PC should run it effortlessly.\n", "timestamp_created": 1544924837, "timestamp_updated": 1544924837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762731969356536865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129941265": {"recommendationid": "129941265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045916070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1672667046}, "language": "english", "review": "I've owned the game for years and now I can't play it because suddenly you want me to pay even though I technically OWN it?

That being said I'm glad it was a gift from a friend and Playful was kind enough to give me a few keys for my son and some friends to try the game. As the game stands right now myself, my son and the few friends that did play pretty much stopped playing. If you're looking for more of a survival game experience then you probably will enjoy the game. If you're looking for creative freedom to build and explore maybe killing a few of the world's increasing variety of creatures then that's becoming harder to do with the latest updates. Totally put off by the new elemental damage introduced to the game. Forces you to micromanage more now because you need potions to counter the effect where before you could just explore and have fun as long as you stayed a few blocks away from lava or corruption. It takes the fun out of exploring for us. You now also take damage in cold and hot zones even when inside your own home?! No thank you. If you plan on doing little exploring and stick to the level mid surface ground then you'll be fine, bored, but fine. \n\nThe whole server only play isn't always great either. On more than a few occasions I've noticed clunky lag times when playing side by side on the same world with my son. Also you can't play if the server is down for any reason, but luckily that hasn't been an issue up to this point.\n\nWater physics still need work, but are improving. There are some times you need to fight to get out of water or you may get sucked into a pocket of water that's hard to break free from. \n\nUpdate R16 was just such a disappoint after so many hours playing. We went back to Minecraft for its ability to switch between peaceful & survival modes on the fly. Also the ability to have unlimited resources to enable the building of anything as well as all the great mods. Much easier to have creative fun specially for the younger kids playing. We've also started playing lots of Terraria.\n\nI'll keep checking on the game every few updates, but I'll not be playing like I was once.

Your objective isn't to reach the End and defeat the Ender Dragon. Your objective is to do what you yourself want to do. You make the world what you want it to be. Make a giant wood mansion or even go extreme and make a survival entirely based in the lowest layer of the Earth. It's all up to you. But how far you want to go to do those things is based on how long you can make your gauntlet last. Once it's out of power, you're defaulted to lowest tier one until you craft another. And quite frankly, depending on what you mine with it, it can last a week (real time) or an hour.\n\nAlso the fact that every enemy will attack you on sight is a bit ridiculous, even pigs. I can see some of the others, like Mirus and Rocksters, but pigs should not attack you just for walking past them. You can enable \"Peaceful Creatures\" if you own the world, but otherwise it's either you or the creature.\n\nAnd once you get to the bottom layers, suped up versions of enemies appear down there, and they're EVERYWHERE. Combine this with everything attacking you and I'll just say good luck mining a lot of Lumite. It wouldn't be too bad of a problem if they couldn't hit you from (up to) 7 blocks away with melee attacks. I dear hope that is addressed.\n\nThe crafting can be tedious since you need to craft certain things to even know the requirements for others, but once you get them it's smooth sailing. (Compared to Minecraft where if you find diamonds early on, boom. Diamond tools) And a pro compared to Minecraft is that you can rotate blocks after you've placed them and lock that roatation so every addtitional block in that same hotbar slot will be placed in the same way. As well as the equivalant to Redstone, these pieces of ARC technology operate wirelessly, something I wish Minecraft had.\n\nI do wish that the \"Creativerse Pro\" DLC was priced lower, as paying $20 for a flashlight, extra invetory slots and a glider is not worth that much money. Perhaps $10 is more worth it. But after awhile you'll wonder how you played without it, since the bottom layers are super dark and there's health sapping water all over the place down there.\n\nSo, can it be challenging? Yes.

I will leave the game untouched for months at a time and come back to see if anything has improved the lag and stuttering.  So far, nothing has been addressed.  It's disappointing and, for me, makes the game unplayable over time.  My threshold for dealing with the stuttering and lag wanes quickly, and I end up uninstalling it for large chunks of time.

This'll be a medium to long review.\n\nOkay, so first of all, I don't play alot of games like this. The only one I've played similair to this is Terraria.\nThat being said, I was drawn to it because it's free and it looked okay.\nI actually really like Creativerse as a whole, even though I've played for 3 hours total when writing this review.\nIt's open world is quite immersive, and it doesn't take ages to find other biomes and explore. Night-time is dangerous but the creatures look really awesome!\nBuilding/crafting isn't that hard and pretty much explains itself. Which is good in my book.. It's a good book. 'cos it's my book.\n\nRIGHT!\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Graphics: Smooth graphics and it runs rather smooth aswell. Even the blocks have detail! The scenery is often breathtaking even though it's made from blocks. It's beautifull!\n\n+ Relatively easy crafting:  As said above, the crafting explains itself. That being said, recources aren't that hard to come        by in early stages appart from exploring but I figure it'll get alot harder later on.\n\n+ Bestiary: Since I always want to read up on monsters before I actually encounter them, I came across a relatively large bestiary. From pig..things.. to  Things. It's pretty diverse and each spawns within it's own biomes and Lord help me if I find myself in a cave!\n\n+ Biomes: As diverse as the bestiary, as diverse are the different biomes to explore. Didn't take long before I found myself in a jungle.. at night time... getting nuked by creatures I was trying to run from. 10/10 would explore again!\n\n+ Mining: Okay, so it's not actual mining with a mining pick. Why not? Because that's boring. And who uses a mining pick when you have a cell-powered WABBAJA-  ehm.. MINING GLOVE! That's right! You just rip blocks out of their comfort zones and put them in your dark, dusty inventory only to be processed into more usefull things like rods or slabs.\n\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\nI can't really think of any major flaws. It's early acces, what would one expect? Goats stay on the ground? Wrong, I saw a couple fly into the air... Which was quite the hilarious sight, I might add. \nSo... so far so good! I hope the developers keep up the good work as I, and many others, would probably want to see more awesomeness!\n\n11/10 Would recommend to anyone who likes exploring, gathering, crafting, surviving, building your own secret laboratory and slap pigs with a stick! No pun intended.\n\n11/10 Would play again!

The game seems to become more laggy over time. This is my system:\n\n16 gb RAM\n1080 GPU\ni7-6700k processor\nU.2 SSD (intel 750)\n\nThat the game lags with this rig is completely unacceptable when it's essentially just minecraft as far as fidelty goes.\n\nSecondly, the freemium style comes through. You can play it without paying anything, but it does lock exclusive things behind pay wall (such as a glider or increased inventory space). If there was a \"this one payment and you'll unlock everything forever\" option, priced at something, like, say, Minecraft, I'd say fair. But as it is right now you'll never know how many more exclusive gameplay-affecting items it'll lock behind a payment.\n\nThirdly, gameplaywise. To mine ores you have to place a consumable extractor on the ore. This can take several minutes to complete depending on the ore and the quality of the extractor. Imagine playing Minecraft, but every ore you mine you have to spend minutes to finish it, in addition to using resources to craft the extractor for every single piece of ore. As you would expect.. they sell the best extractor in the store. \n\nLastly, I find the whole business model highly scummy. You buy ingame \"coins\" (premium currency) which you can then trade for services. They write on the wiki (which I assume is based on statement(s) from the dev): \"However, to prevent players from spending lots of small amounts of money and in time invest large sums this way without noticing, players cannot pay directly with Steam wallet, but have to buy Coin bundles first that have a fixed price each and aren't misleadingly cheap.\"\nBut it's been studied that offering bundles where you can't buy the exact thing you want for real currency actually makes it harder for the customer to judge how much money they're spending and obfuscates prices. In addition, selling coins in bundles instead of letting you buy an exact amount is a way of psychologically making customers buy more.

All MTs can also be made with resources payment (zone claims, blueprint buys). Ofc comparsions to Minecraft can be made.

You'll be sucked in easily into this cycle of crafting & building, farming  crops, taming specimen and gathering minerals. The receipts are not too unfair. So you mustn't grind long for resources (except Iron ore seems pretty rare).\n\nLittle complaints about the graphics performance: sometimes you see through unrendered blocks down to lavaworld. Also the game seems to run in some Flash webbrowser mode. On my highend gaming laptop it has the same performance than on my old office notebook. And the RAM memory usage is constantly 1.5 gigs.\nAlso the melee fights (only swords as weapons) are pretty unsharp. Enemies hit you from far distance and even through cavewalls.

I have never in my life experienced such a responsive team that quickly implements what people ask for or fixes bugs and will sit there and go back and forth on subjects with you to get the fix you need to enjoy their content. Even better is if you have done something amazing and want to show off you can submit screen shots and they might mention your works or even come build on your world! The player developer interaction I think is important it helps both sides connect with each other and bring more enjoyment to the players game experience and the developers work experience. People ask for more slabs, stairs, and roofs, devs drop multiple new packs, players ask for machines with pressure plates and switches, we get much more than we asked for.

Every world you/your friend creates will save and for example if your friend leaves the world he creates whilst you're both connected, you will remain in world and are still able to play-through the game as per usual. I'm not entirely sure how it works but I have found it rather handy for this feature to be in game.\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1] I personally was expecting this game to be a bit of a bum, probably because I instantly thought of the hundreds of minecraft rip-offs there are but my friend got it so we both decided to take the game \"For a spin\".

Me and my friend have come up with a number of ideas such as 'Goo-Boots' which reduce fall damage/make you bounce without a block being underneath you.

HD graphics out of the box, no special texture packs needed, in fact it's better than HD texture packs for Minecraft. Processing machines are better than vanilla Minecraft.

Everyone is super helpful and nice, very collaborative and community oriented. Let's keep this trend going![/h1]\n\nNow [i]this[/i] is a sandbox game!\n\nI am absolutely loving this game, it's addicing and rewarding, everything about this game is fun to do.\n\nA breif overview of the game.\n\nYou start off in a random location on the world map, which currently there are only 4 variants off which is unfortunate, but hopefully soon they will be procedurally generated. You have a Twig with which to hit things to kill them and harvest their loot, and a basic Mining Core/Gauntlet. \n\nYou go kill Piglets, Boars, Leafis, things of that nature to collect Hide, Tusks, Sinew, Bone, etc. As you travel you can collect the trees, dirt, water, honey, etc in order to upgrade your Mining Core. Build up your core, mine around, explore, fight things, collect flowers/mushrooms. Make a Forge and Processor, create armor and weapons, other neat things. Furniture, what have you.\n\nMining Ore in this game is different. Instead of Clicking on it and standing there until you Pop it, you place an Extractor on the Ore Node which will harvest it for you, giving you time to go and look around for more ore while it processes. Come back and poof, there's 12 Coal Ore, or Obsidian or what ever it might be. It's a very interesting take on it and it's a lot of fun. \n\nWell anyway I'm rambling on about nothing, but it's a LOT of fun and it's still in early access. Tons of fun, and immense potentil. \n\n[h1] Overall Rating [/h1]\n[b] 8/10 [/b]\n\nOh, also, if you are crying about the game having a price tag now, get over it. Grow up, get a job. It's 20 bucks. That's like, what, less than 2 hours of work? I see so many people complaining about how they \"ruined\" the game and made it \"pay to win\" - it isn't. You can either A) Pay nothing and expierence 100% of the game, or B) Pay the nominal one time fee of 20 bucks, and get a bunch of goodies, and be able to create multiple worlds, and also help fund  the dev team for more updates in the future.\n\nStop being so entitled to free stuff.

The update that added Premium, a DLC which entited the owner to new items, new world options, and a exclusive block set. The catch? Well, lets just say you will wish you had the game sooner. The update removed ALL the world customizing options from non-premium owners. If you had a world that had implemented customizers, you were good. If not, you could only have 1 world at a time, with no way to have peaceful monsters, hard mode, reduced spawns, and more. (With the last update, 9/14 I believe, it removed all of my previous cusomizers) But if you have $20 laying around for no reason, this game is for you!\n\nPros:\n-LOTS of different furniture pieces and decorative blocks\n-Varied monsters and creatures\n-Vast worlds with many biomes\n-Many types of ores and nature blocks\n-Free (to an extent)\nCons:\n-Not really free per say\n-Not much for non-premium owners\n-Difficult to collect building recipes\n-Cusomization is a little weak\n\nOverall:\nThis is an ok game for an Early Access. Lacking of certain aspects that could very much improve gameplay, this game has it where it counts. There is a lot you can do when it comes to building and exploring. But, Premium 'punishes' players that did not buy the beta, dramatically removing features for non-premium owners. Overall, this is a good game, far superior to games like Minecraft. But if you dont have any spare change, this game is not all it is shown to be.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this\n(Listed as a negative review only because of the premium... and the glitch that has me mad at this point)\n\nHave a nice day :D", "timestamp_created": 1474417675, "timestamp_updated": 1474417675, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71460491418838501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43594743": {"recommendationid": "43594743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198841582699", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 35194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8520, "last_played": 1627069892}, "language": "english", "review": "Creativerse is a really great block-based, open world sandbox game. The biggest surprise for me is how incredibly feature-rich, polished, and well-rounded the game is for a free-to-play.

I feel compelled to purchase the Pro version simply to support the developers, and ensure that they keep expanding and enhancing this incredibly fun game.\n\nWith regard to the thematic style, the graphics are simple yet surprisingly detailed, the music is unobtrusive yet provides great atmosphere, and the sound effects are cool as well (I love the sound of the forge and processor on headphones). All of these things add to the fun gameplay, and make it a really great game.\n\nWhile Creativerse is pretty easy to pick up and get the hang of things, the option of a quick tutorial at the onset would be a welcome addition, just to give newcomers the choice of learning the basics and pointing them in the right direction. I had a general understanding of block-based sandbox games before starting, and I still got a little confused initially as to how certain things worked. \n\nGameplay is very smooth and responsive on my machine, but it makes my CPU fans spin up like a jet engine. My specs are significantly higher than base requirements, so I'm curious what's going on with the processing.\n\nAll-in-all, Creativerse is a feature-rich and engaging game that's a lot of fun to play.

Personally I have never had an issue beyond the occasional lack of performance when running on an older machine. And as for comparing it to Minecraft.. what's the point in that? After over 500 hours I still enjoy the look, sound, and feel of the game. It has interesting creatures, simply designed mechanics, and a look that is aesthetically pleasing. With each update I have, like others, found something I didn't care for at the time. Such as changing creature and character model designs (Warmworm's original look was much cooler). But overall I've been pleased with my purchase. This latest update (August, 2018) has introduced yet another new player model that took me a couple of days to appreciate. I was sad to see my character go, but have enjoyed the new models slightly more realistic look. Being able to interchange the costumes is a neat feature as well, though I would like to be able to see my armour again. Perhaps in a future update? I also enjoy the battle mechanics in third person. Still some bugs to work out (character model thumb has a freaky curve..maybe its just me) but you're heading in the right direction.\nIt's been a good ride.

The Textures on the blocks are fantastic, and the fanciful creatures are amazing. \n\nThree things I don't like, and I'll share those. Note: I don't hold any hate in my heart for this game. It's well-executed, it's just that the cons outweighed the pros for me. My qualms are easy to pinpoint, since Creativerse is pretty much built off the pre-existing platform of the Minecraft saga, and as such, is directly comparable in most aspects:\n\n1--No 'Creative Mode.'\nI really wanted to just play in the sandbox first, get my feet wet, visit the biomes and navigate block apparance. I'm mostly interested in building the tiny temples, and designing the cozy cottages...and this game is solely a 'Surivial mode' concept. Makes it a bit of drag for those of us who don't have the time to dig up all the materials required to make our imaginations a reality. \n\n2--Say Goodbye to Easy Mining.\nYou get this nifty gauntlet upon game entry, and with occasional upgrades, you can move more/better stuff. It's a swiss army tool for building the world, however, it's not well engineered as a tool past that. This swiss army knife doesn't mine the world's ore AT ALL. In order to mine: you have to build somewhat expensive 'extractors' and apply those directly to EACH ore-node. You build swords for whacking enemies, bells for training creatures, but for some reason, there's no multi-use method (like, oh, say, a pickaxe) for mining. Pretty much all the ore you find, you turn back into extractors in order to mine more stuff. \nCatch-22, anybody?\nMakes it miserable to piece together anything that's not wooden or green-organic matter.\nConsider that your head's up. It's just weird.\n\n3--'Optional Purchasable Concent in-Game.'\nWant to be able to build stuff? You're going to need recipes for that. \nTo my knowlege, thusfar--attaining those badboys can be incredibly difficult. And when you do find them, you can't use them until you unlock a buttload of other stuff. So they pretty much sit in a chest and make jeering noises at your back for most of play.\nOf course if you want access to all the really cool stuff: you have to pay upwards of 15 dollars a pop for various block styles, (which I don't get at all, if it's an integrated part of the game, shouldn't it be a part of the initial game purchase?...ugh. Micro-pay systems are the devil.)\n\nThe reason it's a thumbs down, and the only reason it's a thumbs down, is because the reasons above would make me NOT recommend this game--which is why we write reviews; to share those reasons.\n\nIt's prettily created, the art is worth the look, but in my opinion: the playstyle is not, and the content is just too expensive to get into for a game that similar in concept to another heavy-hitter on the market.", "timestamp_created": 1521863964, "timestamp_updated": 1529285044, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 100, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712745308876037598", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23392331": {"recommendationid": "23392331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248760116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2861, "last_played": 1513973757}, "language": "english", "review": "I hope this the game is Chinese~", "timestamp_created": 1465096384, "timestamp_updated": 1476785989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712627947330474854", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 28, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 10946, "total_negative": 3662, "total_reviews": 14608}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwC9I3PTx9oE": "Mon Apr 22 23:41:51 2024"}}
