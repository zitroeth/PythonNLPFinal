If this was years ago.. I would have recommended the game without any question. However, with the game's current state and direction, I could never recommend it to anyone under any circumstance.\n\nIt's just going downhill and that's the reality of it. They are partnering with anyone in an attempt to stay relevant and keep quarterly stats up but that only lasts for a week and then it's back to being a dead game for the most part.\n\nIf you ever decide to work at this company, just note that your personal account is at high risk of being permanently banned if you are accused of anything and are wrongfully terminated as a result.\n\nThey will not only ban your dev account (which is fine) but your personal account as well, which is actual bullsh*t and petty. I'm living proof of this.\n\nThey won't conduct a proper and thorough investigation behind their claims before terminating an employee and will sh*t all over your 6-years of dedicated gameplay, time spent and work into a product that you once loved and cared for to the point that you even took a job to work on the game to make it better not just for yourself but for the community who also loves the game.\n\nClueless company making clueless decisions on a game that they're clueless about since they don't play it.\n\nI was one of the literal few at the company who has more than 4,000 hours of actual gameplay in the game.\n\nP.S. they still haven't fixed the IP leak vuln that has been the cause of people being DDoSed, doxed, swatted and much more. They've known about it for over 2 years now and refuse to fix something so simple while knowing what the root cause of it is and know what exactly to fix.\n\nJust to give you an idea of how little they care... I brought this up before and during my time working there and it was never fixed. We're now going into 2023 with this vulnerability that's been in the game for over 4+ years.\n\nStill think BHVR cares about you now? Their main focus is and always has been to make money and that's why this issue has never been addressed even though their own Fog Whisperers like Otzdarva, Elix and many others have questioned why they haven't fixed it yet and are victims to these issues.\n\nTheir priorities are all over the place and have no idea how to run a game company let alone keep the community safe. It's pretty evident that these are the facts.\n\nThey would rather ban innocent people than to solve the huge security risks and flaws in the game. It's disgusting and this type of \"behaviour\" should not be condoned.\n\nI'm more surprised Valve/Steam is even allowing the game to remain playable on their platform considering the company refuses to fix these issues that is allowing these events take place.\n\nCheaters? I won't get into that. Everyone knows the answer to this already. The company looks at them as paying customers that deserve respect (direct quote from an employee that's in a leadership role btw) and would rather keep them around than get rid of them entirely.\n\n\n-Safety Depips / Beast / Antiddos", "timestamp_created": 1710961696, "timestamp_updated": 1710961696, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703487277030944824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158046118": {"recommendationid": "158046118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066753344", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2043, "last_played": 1707846634}, "language": "english", "review": "first non-AFK AFK farmer", "timestamp_created": 1707619492, "timestamp_updated": 1707619492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697561025619506836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157721253": {"recommendationid": "157721253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380997729", "num_games_owned": 680, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1189, "last_played": 1689215658}, "language": "english", "review": "Forager is a fun little survival game that's best enjoyed in small doses.

I got the game on release and even 100%ed the game on my Switch. Now I recently had the urge to play again so I started a new PC playthrough and was very disappointed in how it went.\n\nOne of the first disappointments was that I had been waiting a long time for coop, and I remember it being delayed repeatedly and hoped it would be there when I finally came back to the game but unfortunately it seemed to have been cancelled. This led me to reading quite a bit of drama about the developer(s) and what happened behind the scenes which was disheartening.\n\nRegardless I was playing the game and found that some mechanics especially how lighthouses previously worked had been changed. I understand to some extent wanting to balance a game but I love when a game gives you options and the players find ways to break open the games possibilities with the mechanics given. It also feels silly to take away the way lighthouses previously worked when you let people stack droids on droids on droids. This was the first hint of feeling less fun in the game. Honestly though this was a minor gripe compared to its other mechanical problems though.\n\nI found out a few hours into my new playthrough that there is a bug in the game that has existed for at least 3 years that has not been fixed that kills the flow of the game. If you unlock areas in the wrong order, dig spots start only appearing in one portion of the map and lock you out of upgrading some tools, quests, and equipment. You can get the digspots in other areas eventually but it is with a late game building and even then its an waiting game where you use the building for a chance of dig spots that have a chance at a material you need and then waiting for it to reset. The whole mid game makes you feel imbalanced and you know the game isn't meant to be going at the pace you are stuck at. How this is left in the game after all this time is extremely unfortunate.\n\nOnce you do get past that hurdle however, the game started to flow for a little while until you do reach the end game and you hit another moment of disappointment because the game just... ends. You get to a point where they send you inton infinite tower where you kill the same stuff over and over and over. You need some of the materials to get the last few upgrades but that is it, the tower doesn't lead anywhere, it just has a hacked leaderboard of people who did supposed billions of floors.\n\nIt is all very unfortunate. I also can't even play my save anymore as I suddenly just get a white screen when I hit play and I'm not too upset about it because I played through all the content anyway but it would have been nice to clean up most of the achievements. \n\nThis game makes me sad, I was singing its praises 5 years ago and its now suddenly after supposed updates to the game, it feels like much less of what the original game was. I love a good grind in a game and they had the grind right in the beginning but have since ruined that.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1711315469, "timestamp_updated": 1711315469, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507328987121582031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163025153": {"recommendationid": "163025153", "author": {"steamid": "76561199217522879", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1060, "last_played": 1700187185}, "language": "english", "review": "got bored quick", "timestamp_created": 1713327384, "timestamp_updated": 1713327384, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503076910972595215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162372952": {"recommendationid": "162372952", "author": {"steamid": "76561199141180064", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 649, "last_played": 1699312093}, "language": "english", "review": "reviews", "timestamp_created": 1712446026, "timestamp_updated": 1712446026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503018319606781006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91994339": {"recommendationid": "91994339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151413029", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2564, "last_played": 1600053326}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely unfortunate to see a game that had so much potential, end like this.\n\nAfter two years of promised multiplayer, it was cancelled by HopFrog, the lead dev, as he threw his entire team under the bus and blamed them for the lack of development.

[u]Think Stardew Valley, a Clicker game, and Zelda all mashed together, and what comes out will roughly be what Forager actually is.[/u] This game focuses on one concept: [u]making progression addictive, stimulating, and rewarding for the player, and does this extremely well[/u]. Combine this factor with an open-world gameplay including light RPG elements and leveled, perk-based progression, and it all sums up to a very satisfying experience.\n\nStarting from scratch, players will need to start building their very own base of operations, composed of various facilities, divided into types such as Industrial ones, Magical, Farming and so on. Few items to craft are available from the start, as [u]most get unlocked with perks acquired on each level-up from a consistent skill tree[/u]. As player level increases, [u]more resources start to spawn to compensate for the increased needs, limiting grinding to acceptable levels, preventing the game from turning into a grind-fest[/u], still some effort in this regard is required. Crafting equipment, consumables, ammunition and defensive structures (marginally) are also things to do, but for these, the better versions of gear to equip is unlocked right after creating the currently available one.\n\nThere are many things to do in the world of Forager. Apart from [u]the Museum, requiring the collection of more or less rare materials to complete \"collections\" and earn rewards[/u], there are [u]plenty of NPCs with multiple quests each[/u], often [u]rewarding interesting, powerful items[/u] when completed. Dungeons, complete with bosses and secrets, are also a thing, giving out great rewards in terms of currency, materials and items as well. Perhaps [u]the most unique mechanic in Forager is how new lands are unlocked: players need to buy them[/u], with hard-earned coins, coming from trading, crafting or combat.\n\nThe only few \"bad\" things about Forager, which only marginally hinder an overall well made experience, are the combat, often [u]being rather simple and not enough challenging[/u], not even with bosses, and also [u]endgame-tier items, especially those made at a special crafting table, being overly-grindy and boring to acquire[/u], in contrast with basically everything else.\n\n[u]Overall, [b]Forager[/b] is indeed a great indie title for this genre, and fans of many diverse game genres can enjoy it all the same.[/u]\n\n[quote]Liked this review, and want to see more of the same quality? Check out [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39323490]Tamaster's Review Archive[/url] to see all my Reviews in a single, convenient location.[/quote]\n\n[h1] In-depth Feature Analysis [/h1]\n\n\n\ud83c\udfae [b] Gameplay [/b]\nThe gameplay of [b]Forager[/b] is divided into Exploration, Crafting and Combat.\n\n[u]Exploration[/u] of new lands is tied to paying the unlock fee for them, but once unlocked, they give access to different materials, plants, ores, enemies and locations and animals depending on their biome. The total size of the game world is not large, as it can be traversed wholly rather quickly, to compensate, it's pack-full of things to do. \nExploring dungeons works differently, as it's often tied to activating mechanisms, finding keys, or the right passage, to proceed and finally face the boss, which awards always an unique item. While exploring, the main activity is to gather all kinds of materials, instantly transferred to the inventory or to the Base Vaults if present. Keeping an eye out for secrets, such as cracked walls or hints on how to solve some puzzles, is a good idea.\n\n[u]Crafting[/u] in this game uses various workbenches and facilities, each able to produce a specific kind of material or gear piece. Each facility can process one order at a time, without any queue functions, so building many of each becomes necessary. As the game progresses, it is needed to produce more and more refined material types to get the more advanced gear pieces and consumable items, so also organizing well the base layout is a smart move. Gear pieces never break or are lost, so no fear about having to make them again.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 [b] Story [/b]\nApart from the single NPC quests giving out small self-ending stories to them, there is no real plot or main story in Forager.\n\n\ud83d\udc4a [b] Combat System [/b]\n[u]Combat[/u] is rather simplistic in Forager, as expected from this game genre, and is based on hitting enemies with the weapon of choice, be it a bow, pickaxe, sword or magical rods, to kill them. Swords and Bows have their own attack range and patterns, while pickaxes are click-based in attacks. Generally, the variety of enemies is sufficient, but none of them proves to be very difficult, as the player is very superior in damage, speed and capabilities almost at all times. \n\n\ud83d\udcb0 [b] Content & Pricing [/b]\nThe total playtime this game offers depends much on how much of it one wants to complete. There is not a real \"ending\" to Forager, but generally speaking, the game can offer 6-8 hours of content minimum to those who are not interested in doing secondary things, while it can very well go to 12-15 hours for those who really want to do everything there is to do.\nFor a price of 20\u20ac, considering the quality, I'd say the game is definitely worth this price.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [b] Balance & Challenge [/b]\nChallenge level is generally low, while balance tends towards the player if we speak of combat, in terms of production / crafting / materials, unless many Shrine buffs are stacked all together for OP effects, the balance is decent.\n\n\n[h1] Technical Analysis [/h1]\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 [b] Graphics [/b]\nSimplistic, but well polished and charming, pixel-art graphics and effects.

It is in the line of games that homage Terraria and Stardew Valley (such as with the Archaeology museum) but I found it more fun than both.   Also, I was able to get all 103 achievements, and while it took me 329 hours, so what?  That just shows that you're getting your money's worth from the game.  \n\nThe gameplay couldn't be more simple: you start as a little marshmallow-looking guy on a tiny plot of land with only a pickaxe to your name.  With that pickaxe, you mine rocks and chop down trees, and are soon able to build a forge, furnace, and sewing machine.  With these 3 machines, you craft basic items into more complex items into even more complex items.  For example, iron, gold and coal make steel, which with gems makes Royal Steel, which with bottled oil makes Plastic, which is a component of Electronics, which you need for Void Steel, which you need for Cosmic Steel.  \n\nFortunately for you, iron, gold, coal and wood are infinitely available resources that magically repopulate every few seconds.  This means that in the early game you are never at a log-jam waiting on a raw resource.  You are also able to build more than one of any structure, so you can have 5 sewing machines making thread while another half-dozen structures are building glass, which you can combine into many bottles at once.  \n\nNow if this was just a game where you were gathering resources for ever-more complex components, it might get boring quickly.  Fortunately, there is a point to all this foraging: besides your initial island, there are 48 other lands to explore-- grasslands, a graveyard, icebergs, a desert, and so forth-- and almost every land has a puzzle to solve.  One might be figuring out what order to strike pillars, another might be replicating a tune, a third is answering a quiz, a fourth is solving riddles, and another is a classic Lights On/Lights Off puzzle.  There are many such puzzles, and it's not even clear sometimes that a puzzle is a puzzle.  Other times you'll get an obvious clue but won't be sure what to do with it for a bit.  \n\nMy advice is to open up all 49 lands (it's a 7 x 7 grid) before tackling some of the more obscure puzzles, as you may never know where you might find a puzzle or a hint.  \n\nAlso, there are about a half-dozen NPCs that have various fetch quests for you.  Some are remarkably easy, on the order of being asked for a potion when you already have many, and some are very time-consuming, such as requiring 500 manure.\nAll are doable.  \n\nOne very nice bonus touch: every half-dozen or so achievements that you collect unlocks one of the bonus features on the main menu.  These aren't game related, but are instead things like the author's bio, a sample of early rough sketches of the game, a bonus art booklet, and so forth.  \n\nAdditionally, the game has a very lively Discord channel.  It is a family-friendly server, with moderators assigned to make sure that there are no trolls, inappropriate behavior, or advertising.  The channel has it's own bot, the affectionate !beet bot, which is worth the price of admission.  HopFrog and the other developers are there.  I was so impressed with their passion for the game that I became a Patreon supporter.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1585079858, "timestamp_updated": 1585079858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 109, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.901806116104125977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50263173": {"recommendationid": "50263173", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965551808", "num_games_owned": 884, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 3533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3382, "last_played": 1575360283}, "language": "english", "review": "Can you remember when you first played Fez or Terraria or Stardew Valley? Or any other instant indie classic? Well, Forager is one of those kind of games.\n\nI played the demo and after about half an hour, I knew I wanted to buy the full game... and then I continued playing the demo for another 2 hours; I just couldn't stop myself from playing.\n\nI encourage anyone on the fence to try the demo. It's very representative of the game, though the ramp up time in the release version is a bit slower. ([url=https://hopfrog.itch.io/forager-demo]link to demo[/url])\n\nAbout the game itself, I can't say enough good things about it. It's simple yet vibrant. Has a crisp, clean pixel look, as well as a great sense of progression, in crafting, level and combat. But most importantly, it has an extremely satisfying game loop.\n\nYou run around, mining resources, attacking enemies and animals, crafting stuff, gaining skill points from leveling to spend on perks (where future crafting unlocks come from, among other things), buying land, discovering and solving puzzles, over and over for about 40 hours straight.\n\nGranted, I extended the life of the game by going for all 84 achievements and then crafting about 200 droids (helper robots). There was no purpose to the latter other than I wanted to keep playing the game (I also found an exploit which helped).\n\nBut that's the charm of the game. In fact, there are many little efficiencies and exploits that the player can take advantage of once they learn each system and how they work together. Let's say I want to farm for rare fishing artifacts. Well, I should build a lighthouse and make sure my fishing traps are inside its area of effect. Then, I might as well drink a luck potion to increase my chances of rare items, but only after visiting a shrine for a buff that doubles resource drops. And I might as well activate a scroll to speed up my traps catch rate. All the while my droids are automatically collecting from my traps.\n\nAnd it's interactions like that, where you go from chopping down single trees to blowing up entire screens, that Forager's nuance really starts to shine. Where you used to fret over having two pieces of glass to make another bottle, you now have five forges making thousands of glass bottles while you're off digging for relics.\n\nAnd if you want a respite from the crafting and foraging, there are the wonderful npc encounters, puzzles, and dungeons.\n\nFrankly, I can't believe so much good stuff has been packed into one game.

"review": "Has the global pandemic got you feeling down, lonely, and lazy? Well, boy do I have the miracle cure for you. Introducing [b]Forager[/b], a game that is primarily based on foraging anything and everything you can get your hands on. This simple yet satisfying game is guaranteed* to help you forget your woes with its cutely designed \u201ccollect, craft, and expand\u201d model. No longer must you be held down by the darkness that is reality. Instead, forage away in this colorful and magical community where you are in full control of everything. Give in to temptation and let the curse of addiction spread through your veins as you remain happily imprisoned within the world of endless resources, craftables, objectives, and other possibilities.\n\n[i]*this claim is not scientifically proven. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ready2b/]ready2b[/url] is not liable for any back pain, addiction, actions or decisions taken as a result of this review. Proceed at your own risk.[/i]\n\n[u][b]Played with mouse and keyboard[/b][/u]\n\n[h1]\u2714\ufe0f[u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\nThe [b]simple and intuitive gameplay, endlessly-spawning resources, and exponential expansion make for an incredibly satisfying and addictive experience.[/b] Given how intuitive the game is, a tutorial is not even needed; simple suggestions and hints are all you need to progress. You spawn on one island equipped with your trusty pickaxe and off you go. \n\nHours fly by and suddenly your little island has turned into your very own empire. You can now forage a larger array of substances, build new structures, craft more complex compounds, upgrade your tools, beautify your home, visit different biomes, fish, farm, fight monsters, take on dungeons, help NPCs, and the list goes on. Considering that resources, animals, and enemies spawn randomly and regularly (every 30 seconds or so), there is practically no downtime. \n\nSimilar to the likes of Minecraft or Stardew Valley, there is practically no end to what you can achieve in Forager, with only time and your imagination being the limiting factors. The simple, instant, continuous and never ending gratification this game provides makes it a dangerous but ideal pastime during the quarantine. [u]Buy at your own risk.[/u]\n\nIn addition to the satisfying and expensive gameplay, there are some other notable features that I really enjoyed:\n[list]\n[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2257432688]Hilariously[/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2257432356]quirky[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2257431407]wholesome[/url] NPC interactions.[/b] These really add to and fit with the chill/enjoyable tone of the game.\n\n[*][b]Intuitive/clear skill tree and crafting requirements.[/b] The game does a great job at providing sufficient information so I rarely had to consult the wiki page to understand things.\n\n[*][b]Easy inventory management and every item stacks infinitely.[/b] You will have countless items by the end game (millions of rocks for example) so it is really a blessing that items stack endlessly. Vaults can also be easily built to store items. As an added bonus, the vaults clearly show which items are stored in them (from the overworld) and act as extended inventories - which means that newly collected items go directly to the vaults and items don\u2019t have to be withdrawn to be used in craft recipes.\n\n[*][b]Crafting made easy.[/b] As you can [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2278061938]see here[/url], the game makes it incredibly easy to craft multiple of the same item with just a few clicks of your mouse [craft infinite, craft all, craft half, or select number yourself]. I only wish there was a way to input a specific number using the keypad instead of clicking +1 numerous times.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]\u2796[u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]In my experience (with mouse and keyboard) I noticed that it [b]can sometimes be difficult to select the correct item you want to interact with.[/b] Since there is usually an abundance of stuff at all times, whether it be the structures you built, animals and enemies running around, trees, ore, flowers, etc, you are bound to come across situations where things seem to be stacked on top of each other, making it difficult to click on what you actually want to click on. Although annoying at times, based on how the game is designed I doubt this can be fully avoided. At worst, this will only cost you a few seconds of your time and require some mouse-moving finesse to resolve. Perhaps this issue can be avoided when playing with a controller?\n\n[*]There are some [b]additional game modes[/b]: including speed run, single island challenge, and hard mode. I can\u2019t say much about these since [b]I didn\u2019t try them myself[/b] but it is a nice addition if you\u2019re into that. The addition of multiplayer is also announced and expected to come out soon - looking forward to that update!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]\u274c[u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]My main criticism of the game is that [b]the pace plateaus towards the end game.[/b] Once you are close to unlocking all the items and upgrading all your tools/weapons, the excitement and allure of the game drops significantly. By this point, it is likely that your character will be overpowered, so it comes as no surprise that foraging and slaying enemies becomes mundane. Most notably, high-end materials take very long to craft (sometimes several minutes per unit). As a result, I spent most of my end game time idling just to allow my items to be crafted. As far as I can tell, the end game mainly consists of entering the void biome, to battle increasingly difficult waves of enemies, and customizing your world (AKA make it pretty), neither of which interested me much, so I stopped once I was satisfied with my progression. Clearly this is a matter of personal taste and I\u2019m sure some players will spend hours making their worlds uniquely theirs. \n\n[*]It is also unfortunate that [b]dying has little to no consequence.[/b] Most of the time, there is no punishment for dying - the game will simply reset to where you were seconds before you died (like a save-state). As far as I could tell, you don\u2019t lose EXP, coin, or resources, just a few seconds of your time. The worst case scenario is dying in a dungeon or the void, causing you to respawn outside and lose your progress. This discovery came as a disappointment to me as it took away all the thrill of failure; health management no longer had any meaning in the overworld. \n[/list]\n \n[h1]\ud83c\udfc5[u]Verdict:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Simply addictive[/h1]\nForager is the kind of game that you will struggle to put down. It is remarkable that this was all [url=https://hopfrogsa.net]developed by one person. Excellent job, Mariano Cavallero![/url] The expansive yet intuitive nature of the game provides you with near-endless entertainment and rewards you with constant low-effort productivity. [b]WARNING[/b] this is a dangerously addictive combination. The only downside, in my opinion, is the slow endgame. There are more than enough features to allow players to customize their worlds endlessly but at a certain point I simply had enough. On the bright side, the rush of dopamine this game provides is exactly the kind of mindless morale boost that I (and maybe you) need to get through the pandemic. Get your [i]feels-good[/i] vitamins and embrace your inner instant gratification monkey with Forager.\n\n[table]\n[tr][th][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738/]If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up and follow me on my [b]curator page[/b].[/url]\n\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udded\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf0 \ud83c\uddfe\ud83c\uddf4\ud83c\uddfa \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf4\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\uddfe\ud83c\uddf4\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf4\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddf9!\n[/th][/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1606766782, "timestamp_updated": 1674053865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 79, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866422712802886963", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94906355": {"recommendationid": "94906355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070877117", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1703, "last_played": 1619143941}, "language": "english", "review": "The dev cancelled the multiplayer update and then did nothing but insult his team and fire everyone.

Then it starts to get grindy with upgrades taking a lot of resources and islands having a massive jump in cost to unlock.\n\nThe game supports mods so you can head over to the Steam workshop to make it less of a grind. \nI started using the mods about 30 hours in, as i was spending a lot of time just waiting for items to craft.

Most of my gameplay so far has been chopping away at various resources, leveling up, buying buildings, and chopping at more resources. \n\nI *shouldn't* like this game, to any extent. It's very far outside of my usual wheelhouse. I am so against mindless grinding, lack of challenge, and pretty much everything of what Forager is. But Forager is unusual. I'm not one to have very long gaming sessions, and I put 1.5 hours into the game with little to no thought about it. Somehow, in a way I don't understand, Forager makes the grind *fun*. \n\nNow supposedly there are dungeons to go through with some combat, and I'm sure there's other things I'm also missing about the gameplay. I'm not that far in as of this review. I don't think there even needs to be a dungeons system, or decent combat or anything. the core gameplay loop does exactly what it needs to.\n\nThe art is great. I like the cute characters and how bright and cartoony everything is. Controls could use a bit of work (I don't like how specific you need to be with your cursor placement, and inventory stuff isn't perfect), but nothing that hurts my enjoyment. The music is relaxing but could get repetitive. The sound effects fit very well.\n\nIf you like games that are very casual and require a lot of grind and mindlessness, you will be obsessed with Forager. If you are like me, and not the biggest fan of the genre, I don't think you will be obsessed, but you will still enjoy this game.

This isn't a cutesy farming simulator with rpg aspects. This is an automation simulator with cutesy slapped on the top as a selling point for Redditors. Allow me to explain:\n\nOne of the most recent patches, the Combat Patch, added a feature that allows buildings to \"infinitely craft\" as long as there are resources available (rather than build a flat amount of x263 or whatever you have mats for).\n[b]But what does this mean?[/b] Well, now you [u]have to supply the demand.[/u]\n\nNow you have to supply this Forge eating your Gold resources endlessly. Now you have infinite Gold Bar supply, now what do you craft with it? What about Iron? Do you have enough Iron+Gold to craft even higher and higher tier items to sell for more, or do you want to keep it low and craft Gold into Currency and get money like that?\n\n[h1]The game turned from farming simulator into resource, crafting, and space management.[/h1]\nThose cutesy NPC's and awful RPG dungeon aspects the game attempts to force onto you? Those are awful and pointless, [b] the combat in this game is complete garbage[/b] to a point where endgame is eating 400 orbs like candy for a 0.2 dps increase per orb and you hold down left click to carpet bomb the void out of existence, to a point of oneshotting superbosses.\nNo. Those NPC's and awful, awful, dungeons are space you now have to figure out how to work around. Nothing you'll make will be perfect, and you just gotta live with it. \n\nI don't wan't to drag it on too long, but to sum it all up:\n[h1][b]What was the Developers intention with this game?[/b][/h1]\nWas it to be a cutesy farming sim with not enough playtime for 20$?\nOr was it intended all along to be a automation sim that can stretch the gameplay easily into the 100's of hours if you are going for that Trillionaire achievement? (Most of that time will be AFK, but a lot of it will be spending and keeping track of resources spent)\nWhatever it is, I sure hope it's the ladder. But really though if you want a funky little idle game, this is a good pick up. Just don't expect it to \"click\" instantly.\n\nEdit:\n[h1]Coming Back[/h1]\nFor achievement's sake, of course, I returned to this game to obtain the couple of achievement added in the update.\nHas my opinion or review been deemed irrelevant due to this update? Has my opinion changed on this grindfest of a timesink? Well: A tiny bit.\nThe game has added several new mechanics and fixed some old ones in the Nuclear Update, which make the game fairly more enjoyable to play in terms of automation. Every major building can now be upgraded with Nuclear energy to [b]guarantee double drops[/b] produced from those buildings. Which means it's FAR easier to catch up to your supply/demand gameplay on harder to obtain materials that take far too long to craft.\nThe downside to this, is that one of the major crafting elements to Nuclear power, is far too hard to obtain, even when the new Nuclear upgrades make everything drop it. At that point you're PAST needing to farm for things, and there's no automated way to do it, which makes the entire process kind of redundant or irrelevant. Its just double drops after all. You're not missing out on much if you [i]don't[/i] do it.\n\nI would still recommend this game if you are into the \"Factory Builder\" genre, but this one leaves a lot to be desired.", "timestamp_created": 1570560344, "timestamp_updated": 1599498975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 129, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842881739139556885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95276119": {"recommendationid": "95276119", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969830665", "num_games_owned": 588, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 505, "last_played": 1608395585}, "language": "english", "review": "The \"lead developer\" throwing the entire development team under the bus and blamed them for his faults.\nAnd now he is canceling the promised multiplayer extension.\nWhen people criticizing the cancelation of multiplayer in the Forager Steam community or on Discord, they will be banned.\nThis behavior is inaceptable and and has to be sanctioned.\nHere is the detailed story from one of the former developers:\nhttps://twitter.com/YellowAfterlife/status/1381705511754723331", "timestamp_created": 1625684112, "timestamp_updated": 1625684112, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841951191425323486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131578561": {"recommendationid": "131578561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295786046", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1674726600}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is a grift.\nit's been entirely abandoned despite massive support from the playerbase and the developers outright lied about adding multiplayer support.\nthey spent MONTHS hyping up multiplayer only for them to stop all development, regardless of the promises they made.\non top of all of that, forager in its current state has massive performance issues that will never be fixed.\n\ndon't give these people your money.", "timestamp_created": 1674727174, "timestamp_updated": 1674727174, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 154, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835625410079956055", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112799827": {"recommendationid": "112799827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058393380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3708, "last_played": 1612803189}, "language": "english", "review": "So, not only did the developer lie about this being a solo project (sure, it spawned from a solo Game Jam, but it's not a solo project), he threw his team under the bus and blamed them entirely for the failure of the now-cancelled multiplayer release.

You start on an island and forage materials. From these resources, you build structures, craft better tools, and earn money to purchase access to other islands. As you keep expanding, you'll find new biomes with different materials and enemies, as well as occasional quests and puzzles. Each biome also features a dungeon with specific enemies, secrets, and (usually) a boss fight.\n\nPretty much every action earns you experience, and on each level-up, you can learn one of 64 skills. These skills are not limited to character abilities, they can also have major effects on the gameplay such as unlocking new buildings or materials. You also have a few character stats (health, energy, damage) that you increase throughout the game.\n\nThe game scales extremely high - from beginnings where each coin is important, to opportunities for earning billions of coins with a single action in the endgame. I don't think I've ever seen such a scaling range outside of clicker games. This also holds true for character stats - while most are capped at some point, damage can be increased indefinitely. Enemies that seem unbeatable at first, gradually turn into cannon fodder as you keep getting stronger.\n\nThroughout all this progression, the game remains fairly casual. It is practically impossible to _not_ gain experience, and dying doesn't really set you back. Resources respawn so quickly that you'll never run out of them. Farming is equally fast - if you prepare a large field of half a screen, you can harvest the first plants as soon as you plant the last seed. You can also demolish anything you've built and get the materials back, which makes it very easy to rebuild and experiment. In addition to all that, the game goes a long way in minimizing micromanagement and streamlining repetitive tasks: if you build a storage vault and fill one of its slots with e.g. iron ore, then all iron ore that you mine will automatically be placed in that storage slot, even if it's on the other side of the world. And if any building or crafting process needs iron ore, it will automatically be taken from storage. Inventory and storage slots can take an unlimited number of any item, there is no maximum stack size.\n\nIt's worth noting that the game does not have a story, nor NPCs apart from a few quest givers (who have no other function beyond these quests). Instead, it gives you lots of opportunities to set your own goals. It makes it easy to build the base your dreams, with walls and floors in 12 different materials plus 11 different dyes. Or, if you're looking for a challenge, you can fight your way through an infinite dungeon, where you'll eventually be confronted with _dozens_ of _boss_ monsters from the main game - per level. If you like achievements, you'll find about 100 tasks to complete, and each awards you an in-game cosmetic. Or you can complete the \"museum\", a building that rewards you for donating items from all venues of gameplay. You'll also get the ability to terraform the islands to any shape you want. Basically, the world will become your oyster.\n\nOne thing that surprised me, is that crafting items isn't a good way of making money. Each item has exactly the same value as the combined value of its parts. While there are ways to produce additional items for the same amount of source materials, they either only have a small effect, or require a continuous supply of fuel that isn't trivial to get. As a result, selling foraged materials directly is often more efficient than using them for crafting. This is in accordance with Forager's general casual approach to gameplay: you can focus on crafting the items that you need or want to use - if you just want to earn money, you can just sell the raw materials.\n\nIt's also noteworthy that the developer is very active, continuously develops the game further, and also enabled modding through the Steam workshop. There is an active community that keeps expanding the game, and some of these mods have recently been combined in an \"official\" expansion.\n\nI recommend Forager for everyone who likes crafting and building games that also feature exploration, puzzles, and combat. With its smooth gameplay that reduces grinding, and its focus on simple mechanics, Forager is an ideal entry point for newcomers to the genre.

The core gameplay loop consists of gathering resources, crafting items, and forging new tools to make the grinding easier. There are a variety of items to upgrade, granting various bonuses ranging from increased movement speed to even setting resources on fire. Forager is great at making grinding fun - it's incredibly satisfying to be able to finally upgrade your tools and armor.\n\nThe game isn't just grinding, though. Along the way you'll gain coins, which can be used to buy new islands. There are five biomes in the game, each containing their own set of islands. On these islands, you'll find puzzles, NPCs, and dungeons. Most puzzles in the game are simple enough. Upon completing them, you are rewarded with either an artifact that provides a unique and permanent buff to your character, or an item that allows you to increase your stats. I personally googled most of the answers, but I'm sure people with more patience than me might enjoy them. NPCs, while a nice distraction, pretty much offer nothing but fetch quests requiring you to bring them certain items, with similar rewards to the puzzles. There are a few exceptions, but I won't spoil them. \n\nThere are four dungeons in the game, each with their own unique features. Each dungeon features its own set of puzzles, as well as enemies to fight, and a boss at the end. The combat in Forager is pretty underwhelming. There's little to it except clicking, with little incentive to dodge or use potions since most enemies are weak and dying has virtually no consequence. The boss fights aren't particularly memorable, but they work. \n\nYou'll also gain XP to level up as you play. Basically anything you do gives you XP, although in the later game you'll need to supplement your XP using magic. Upon levelling up, you gain a skill point that you can use in the skill tree. Skills range from unlocking new buildings to giving unique bonuses. One gripe I have is that you can't see the entire skill tree, only the skills that are adjacent to the ones you already own. This makes it hard to plan ahead and means you'll probably be stumbling through the skill tree on your first run.\n\nThe artstyle is cute, if simplistic. The game is very laid back and doesn't take itself too seriously, with NPCs that call out the ridiculousness of their quests, and so on. There's no story, and nothing makes much logical sense, but that's not really the point of the game to begin with. The music is fine, although there's only a few tracks that get reused, so I ended up muting the game in my last few hours of play. \n\nThe game has no definite end. By the end of the game, you're undoubtedly overpowered, with millions or even billions of items and coins, and the ability to raze fields of enemies or resources in an instant. A late game item allows you to destroy islands and structures, allowing you to sculpt the world to your will if you so desire. Forager also features 100 achievements, most of which you'll be able to complete just by playing. Several of them, however, are grindy and feel like they just exist for the sake of padding out the game rather than being fun or interesting. (Seriously, who thought an achievement for covering up every water tile was a good idea?) \n\nThe end game is unfortunately dull in my experience. Once you run out of new islands and skills to unlock, the game becomes stale. This is made worse by the absurdly long craft times on late-game items that seem like they exist only to make the game more tedious. Even using all items that increase craft speed, I still had to resort to watching Youtube videos while waiting for things to craft in the last few hours of the game. There's a late game dungeon called the Void that goes on infinitely, which, while a fun distraction, falls flat due to the simplicity of the game's combat.

I really cannot understate how much I've enjoyed my time with Forager and have high-hopes for future updates and QoL changes. If you're someone who loves survival, crafting and resource management games, the chances are high you'll live for this game for a time too.\n\nSo, why does my review come across as hitting only the negative points while missing all the positive ones? Because when a game is as enjoyable as Forager, all the problems and missteps are so much more pronounced. The game mechanics are fantastic, the gameplay loop is equally fantastic and Forager as a whole I thoroughly enjoy and recommend wholeheartedly; but  I'm hoping constructive criticism will make Forager even better.\n\n[b]There will be light spoilers throughout this review past this point.[/b]\n\n[h1]The Gameplay:[/h1]\n[b][u]Early Game:[/u][/b] You're being introduced to the main mechanics at a decent pace. There's a lot going on, but it's well managed and didn't feel overwhelming.\n\n[b][u]Mid Game:[/u][/b] I'm completely addicted. The gameplay loop is in full swing, but there's still always something different to work towards to keep the hooks in.\n\n[b][u]End Game:[/u][/b] This being the Nuclear Update - honestly, it really feels like a backwards step. It cannot be automated, for a return you get guaranteed double drops; but the resources needed for it take up a good portion of a base to produce, and cannot be left while doing other things as you need to constantly make sure each of your 'upgraded' structures are fed enough fuel to last. The Void is very fun and much more combat-focused than the rest of the game, but upgrading structures with nuclear items is something I tried, then steered away from as the huge grind is simply just not worth the effort for double drops.\n\n[h1]The Bugs, Glitches and QoL issues:[/h1]\n[b][u]Droids:[/u][/b]\nThere needs to be an overhaul here. They're paramount to making progress in The Void (and becoming overpowered in the overall game), but they're a massive hindrance to use. They're constantly in the way of seeing literally anything and everything. After you've gained 10 of them, they're in the way of seeing if you've successfully put one on a structure. After 25, you cannot see yourself the majority of the time. By 100 you cannot see a single structure, resource, the void portal or even yourself. There doesn't seem to be a cap - you're intended to amass a large amount due to how often they're in the markets, how easy Spirit Orbs are to come by in late game and with how they change combat, resource gathering and speed up structures.\n\nThere needs to be a new building under 'Magical' with the sole purpose of holding as many Droids as you want so they aren't constantly in the way when you aren't using them. Or instead, since they're essentially an item (as they show as an item obtained in the inventory intake) allow us to simply remove Droids in the 'Gear' section to our inventory. \n\n[b][u]Destroying Structures:[/u][/b]\n[b]1.[/b] The more of a structure you have, the more the next one scales up in cost. Sometimes when you break a structure, it doesn't reduce the construction costs back down. This can become a real problem when each item starts costing 10k+ of a resource.\n\n[b]2.[/b] When destroying structures, you're intended to receive the construction materials back - but often I'll get ~50% of one material and 100% of the others instead.\n\n[b]3.[/b] NPC's and quest buildings (pillars, battery, statues, bells and more) should be removable with the Obliterator once they have been used. They serve no purpose once you have completed them and the associated feats but they continue taking up valuable space.\n\n[b]4.[/b] Conversely, you can remove the Obelisks (which always continue to serve a purpose) with the Obliterator, but they cannot ever be replaced on that save.\n\n[b][u]Gates:[/u][/b]\nThey're very buggy when placing any item/structure nearby. Sometimes an item close to a gate cannot be placed until the gate is removed, the item is placed, then the gate is replaced back down. \n\nGates made from more expensive materials really should auto open and close - I honestly thought this was obviously going to be the case for Electronic Gates, but sadly they're all just different skins with differing HP values.\n\n[b][u]Dig Spots:[/u][/b]\nThis has been an issue as far as I can tell since the games release; dig spots don't despawn from the desert biome, which gives the impression they aren't spawning elsewhere (they are, just much less as they despawn elsewhere).\n\n[b][u]Inventory Intake:[/u][/b]\nTowards the end of the game, you'll have dozens of different buildings crafting items. The inventory intake will therefore update and show new items received multiple times per second. It'd be great to have an option to either change how often it updates (for instance, I know I'm crafting 20k Gold Ingots, it doesn't need to update for every ingot that's made), or change the transparency of those notifications so they are less intrusive. \n\nAlso, while on the outer edge islands the camera is no longer centered on the character, so it easily obstructs a portion of the screen.\n\n[b][u]Show Building Ade Option:[/u][/b]\nWhy is this set as 'yes' by default? Any structure that affects other buildings will turn the area slightly purple, and the more that is placed down, the more it turns an area into always looking like it's night time. I didn't know the option existed until ~20 hours in.\n\n[b][u]Control Issues:[/u][/b]\n1. Using keyboard and mouse, using a single item in the inventory will often change what item I've selected - for example: I've 'used' fish, and the game auto changes the item I've selected to an item closer to where the mouse is now. This happens every single time any item is used.\n\n2. Using items like bottles in the hotbar will auto select the first item in the hotbar rather than stay on the item being used.\n\n3. Using a controller, placement targeting is really buggy. It'll place/remove items that isn't highlighted over, it's hard to place items on top of placed decorative floors (the selected tile just bounces/glitches back and forth) and selecting items/buildings close to one another is very finicky.\n\n[h1]Suggested Features:[/h1]\n[b][u]Quick Stack for Vaults:[/u][/b]\nToward the end of the game, I had more than a dozen vaults. Thankfully they work more-or-less like extended inventories - when items are picked up or created, they'll transfer to the respective vault automatically - but when collecting items in The Void (or any quest building), or when bought from the market, they will not transfer to vaults, and instead go to your inventory. This means needing to sort through multiple vaults to find what item is where dozens and dozens of times throughout the game. Simply having a quick stack feature in vaults would be fantastic!\n\n[b][u]Use-all For Spirit Orbs and Dark Shrines:[/u][/b]\nAgain towards the end of the game, you'll have hundreds of Spirit Orbs... and they can only be used one at a time when both using them directly and when using them at a Dark Shrine. A use-all or muli-use would save a huge amount of hassle when you have 600 to go through.\n\n[h1]Summary:[/h1]\nSo, was this long list of complaints my way of saying to avoid Forager? Absolutely not. I've had a blast playing the game and working towards the last few feats/achievements; this review is more-so made in hopes of helping make this fantastic game more polished and accessible. Every game has its problems - and Forager is no exception - but for me, it's one of those games that I couldn't wait to get back to playing; and that's why I've been so critical of it. I'm really looking forward to seeing where this game is going, and I highly recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1602751274, "timestamp_updated": 1602752554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786523878574371338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67508741": {"recommendationid": "67508741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005485601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1376, "last_played": 1586976362}, "language": "english", "review": "This was probably the game I played for longer without making a pause, almost died in my chair.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1587145045, "timestamp_updated": 1593385251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 43, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786445856094360352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140485770": {"recommendationid": "140485770", "author": {"steamid": "76561199176888474", "num_games_owned": 1819, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 620, "last_played": 1671526445}, "language": "english", "review": "just a good chill game", "timestamp_created": 1687425025, "timestamp_updated": 1687425025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78577035665512085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124040925": {"recommendationid": "124040925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198833281980", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5696, "last_played": 1695477003}, "language": "english", "review": "MULTYPLAYER UPDATE WHEN???", "timestamp_created": 1666122196, "timestamp_updated": 1666122196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784749448299407959", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50243502": {"recommendationid": "50243502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037092796", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 387, "last_played": 1555810030}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun casual game, with no real challenge.

But with some work, it could be really cool.\n\nI'm going to put this as simply as possible - this game devolves down to a clicker game, like cookie clicker or something. By far, the best clicker game I have ever played, but still, it's a clicker game. You start out feeling like a really cute survival game, but by the end, you just kind of sit there AFK and wait for resources to build, which are collected automatically, at which point you put it in the next machine, which starts another job that you have to wait for, all to build another machine that just lets you interact less with the game.\n\nThe first 4-6 hours are really something special, and it feels really magical - who knows what crazy thing you will uncover? After a while you'll discover dungeons, new resources, and you'll even take on a boss, get a potion that automatically destroys all the resources around you while running around, and you feel OP as heck.\n\nSo, you'll keep doing that for a while, discover a new biome, and all the while, you start building more and more resource producing tech. Only it starts to feel hollow. None of the enemies really pose any kind of a threat, none of the buildings besides torches serve any kind of function other than craft more stuff. But that's ok, because you still have meaningful goals - who knows what could be hundreds of islands away.\n\nBut then you hit the end of the map. The map is actually really small, like 7x7 or so. Ok, but there are still dungeons and puzzles! Only they take 5 minutes at most to clear, at which point you may as well just leave them be. Ok, so you restart a new file, to get more random things! But then you realize that the game has a certain set of islands it spawns, you'll get the same stuff every time. Ok, but there is still stuff to craft. Well, kinda, except none of it has any purpose other than craft more stuff (save 4 items - torches, brazier, lanfill, and obliterator).\n\nThis is what this game really needs an endgame. There is next to nothing to do once you have bought all the land, other than the museum (and after that, nothing at all). Adding more creative building options is a great start, but some endlessly scaling content would be great too. Maybe add a dungeon to the center biome that opens with all the seals? Or give us a bigger map? Something has to give here before this game can really be considered great. Minecraft has an infinite world to explore, and building opportunities galore. Terraria too, to a degree. This game needs some reason to sit there and grind for, other than another item that just crafts or gathers more.\n\nA side thing, the UI gets really annoying.

I honestly have no idea why the game screen is zoomed in so much by default and why there's no option to change it. I'm no developer, but CTRL+mousewheel shortcut doesn't seem to me to be very difficult to implement into a game.\n- No quick heal/eat option. The menuing in this game is bad as it is, please give us something to work with.\n- No map. I guess the developer went the realistic route.\n- Sound settings might as well not exist. You'll have to use your sound mixer to control the volume of the game.\n- Poor inventory management system. No option to move or split items in the inventory or the toolbar. Becomes mildly inconvenient in the midgame, when you can't split your resources to sell one half and use the other.\n- Invisible mouse cursor. Seriously, where is it? Should be an option to use your default computer mouse cursor in-game, it's not fancy, but at least it gets the job done.\n- Very poorly coded object hitbox. You will start to think this game wants to fight you.\n- Droid AI constantly obstructs object hitboxes. This game definitely wants to fight you. You're essentially shooting yourself in the foot by progressing through the game, might as well avoid drones altogether.\n- Item feed obstructs 1/5th of the whole game screen. Sure, take it. It's not like I need to see what's happening on the right side of the screen or anything.\n\nQOL issues:\n- Pulsating indicator of selected object or item. This game really favours style over function.\n- No building description.\n- No gear desciption in the toolbar.\n- No stats on items or your character.\n- No option to fast-forward time. We all know that this game is mostly an idle game, the option should be there.\n- Building and destroying mechanics are wonky and inefficient.\n- Electric cubes involved in puzzle solving are very poorly coded.\n\nOverall issues:\n- There's absolutely no challenge in the game whatsoever. The only challenge in the endgame is to be able to die.\n- The game tries to do many things at once rather than doing one thing well.\n- Dungeons are short, dull and unrewarding.\n- Combat system feels cheap and shallow.\n- Item and gear variety is laughable.\n- Power creep is way too fast and unbalanced. You will be constantly asking yourself \"Am I cheating or is this an intended way to play the game?\"\n- No meaningful end goal. You know something is wrong if your game's end goal is to cover the whole map with dirt. It's really a shame. Even some other good idle games have ascension systems in place for a player to have a sense of some sort of end goal.\n\nForager is objectively a bad game. In a clear conscience I cannot recommend this game at this stage and at this price. Hopefully, it can become a game that's worthwhile in the future, but for now, don't waste your money, especially when there's so many great games at lower prices on the market.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you everyone for your feedback, I'd like to adress a few things. Yes, the price of the game did influence my overall opinion of the game, as it should. This review was meant to magnify the game's flaws and I did focus on the negative on purpose. 90% of the reviews here do a great job at explaining what the game does well. I did focus on the flaws, because I honestly want the game to suceed and become the game it claims to be. I did overexadurate a few of the issues, mainly for a comedic purpose. Many of you asked me to share what I enjoyed about the game. Well, let me compare this game to a bad movie for a brief moment. Let's say that you are watching a movie and you're really enjoying it. You like the plot, the dialog, the characters, the soundtrack, everything seems to be right up your alley. But after a while, you approach the ending of the movie, and it just doesn't make any sense. The plot takes a nonsensical twist, the actors break their character they've been building the whole time, the music does not match the emotion meant to be portrayed, and the whole universe of the movie collapses before your eyes. You just have this weird feeling that the ending of the movie was rushed and rushed so bad it ruined the whole experience. That was the feeling I got after my first 10 hours of gameplay. I felt that this game had so much potential to be more than it is and maybe it still has. After I unofficially beat the game, I tried to analyse what makes Forager a bad game of its genre and where it could be vastly improved. I'm relieved to know that HopFrog does listen to his playerbase and takes our concerns seriously. I'm informed that a few of the issues listed above in the review are being worked on as we speak. I really wish the best for the game and I hope that one day I'll be able to experience it in a different light.

I believe that the game had several updates after the last time I played ([i]which was a while ago[/i]).[/b] \n\nForager is a fantastic game.\n\nThis game has a lot to offer for just a $20 game. I purchased it full priced directly through the developer (HopFrog). I do not regret my decision. Not only is this game great, but the developer behind this game is also a genuine and sweet guy. If this game was free, I'd still be a patron!\n\nForager is currently one of my favorite games on Steam. This game gives me the reminiscent and beautiful nostalgia of exploring Stardew Valley for the first time and assures you that this isn't a Stardew Valley clone. It doesn't have the same formula as other mining and farming games. Yes, there are similarities but enough differences to realize you are having a completely different experience.\n\n[b]How does it look?[/b]\nYes, Forager's art style is primarily pixel-art graphics. It does well at sometimes branching away from this, but mostly everything is made of pixel-art graphics. This isn't something to dislike the game for, however. Everything is easy to identify and recognize. The color palette allowed me to always understand where I was and what I needed. Everything was so clear!\n\n[b] How's the combat?[/b]\nNow, the combat is nothing special. This game primarily focuses on holding left click. That's it. There are cool passives that you gather along the way that allows you to avoid combat altogether. I would've liked to see more love and focus given to combat. For what it's worth, there is a good foundation and potential for it to become more than it already is. Bows are next to worthless. I never used staffs for combat. I only touched a sword once I was trying to 100% the game. Killing enemies is easier with your pickaxe because you don't have to switch your currently equipped tool. It just doesn't make sense to have a sword or bow. I hope the Forager team shows more love to the combat in the future.\n\n[b]How does it sound?[/b]\nThe soundtrack for this game was created by Hern\u00e1n Marandino. Marandino does pretty well to fit the simple graphics, but I found nothing special about this soundtrack. One thing I really enjoy about this game is the sound effects. I loved the noises it made when I leveled up or even mined. My only complaint is that I had to turn it down because some things were much louder than others. Later in the game, you hear an excessive amount of noise from everything that's happening. It's hard to appreciate the music when all you hear is popping from your 10 furnaces smelting ores. The sound effects are truly satisfying. \n\n[b]How is the pacing?[/b]\nThis game is advertised as an idler, which is sometimes true. It only becomes an idler once you reach a higher level. There comes to a point where you have to wait for everything to smelt/cook. This would be fine if it was consistent throughout the game, but it isn't. You can spend 5 hours straight progressing just to be brought to a halt due to having to wait on all the resources required to build your new structure. I didn't mind, as I would leave for work while the game ran. I can see how people would get annoyed by this, though. \n\n[b]How is the progression?[/b]\nThis game offers several different types of progression. You have your statistics to progress through, abilities to unlock, items to collect, and structures to build! This game does not lack when it comes to giving you something to progress through. One thing that Forager offers that other games don't offer is that you are introduced to how to progress to where you want to be with some decent transparency. I've rarely ever found myself asking myself, \"what else am I going to do?\" I've always had a list of what to do next. Whether it was grinding for coins or going through puzzles to find orbs that level me up. On top of that, it was all enjoyable!\n\n[b]What else does this game offer?[/b]\nForager is great at providing you with more than farming and mining. There are puzzles to complete, bosses to kill, and people to help! While the bosses are forgettable and easy, the puzzles and stranger encounters are really cool! All of the strangers are unique and have different dialogues. Most strangers ask you to grab them items. Some rare and some common. All of them are relatively easy, but it adds a nice touch.\n\n[b]Overall[/b]\nIf you enjoy Stardew Valley, Graveyard Keeper, or Minecraft, you will enjoy Forager. It has well over 20 hours of gameplay, and that's under $1 per hour of entertainment! I recommend picking it up at full price! \n\nThanks to HopFrog for creating Forager and Humble Bundle for giving Forager a chance!", "timestamp_created": 1558843061, "timestamp_updated": 1678896106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765540003776550293", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55097451": {"recommendationid": "55097451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165119503", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 827, "last_played": 1575085811}, "language": "english", "review": "My rating: 7/10\n\n* Really Enjoy the game, however, sadly I have started playing just a little over halfway through the developers content roadmap where a majority of the content has been already been implemented leaving me wanting more.\n\n---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 Realistic\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Simple\n\u2610 Don't look too long at it\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2610 Amazing\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Below average\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Read a book instead\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2610 Amazing\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Below average\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Buy earplugs\n\n---{Audience}---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens\n\u2610 Adults\n\u2611 Anyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 High\n\u2610 Nvidia tesla p40\n\u2610 Runs poorly on anything\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n\u2610 Could play with guitar hero controller\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Cuphead and Dark Souls combined\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 A little grind\n\u2611 Average grind\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\n---{Story}---\n\u2611 N/A\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Below average\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Amazing\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{Game Time [Hours]}---\n\u2611 Depends on how much you like grinding\n\u2610 1-3\n\u2610 5-8\n\u2610 9-12\n\u2610 13-20\n\u2610 21-50\n\u2610 51-100\n\u2610 100+\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 Only if on sale\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could just invest in VHS tapes\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2610 None\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Quite a bit\n\u2610 Fallout 76 on launch", "timestamp_created": 1568414903, "timestamp_updated": 1664577907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763836681842803955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50201968": {"recommendationid": "50201968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043250032", "num_games_owned": 2472, "num_reviews": 329, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1555710651}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Forager blew my expectations out of the water [/h1]\n\nForager is a top down game that\u2019s kind of one-part idle game, one-part Stardew. Essentially you collect resources to make things, which then help you collect more resources to make other things with. Obviously, there\u2019s a bit more to it, but that\u2019s the gist of it. I was initially very sceptical of this game, as well as its developer but I\u2019m really glad I\u2019ve had the opportunity to play it. This is an incredibly good game, and you can really tell how passionate HopFrog is about his game. \n\nNote: I did not receive my key directly from the developer. I was given my key by someone who won the game in one of the developer\u2019s key giveaways. \n\n[h1]Positives: [/h1]\n[list][*]The art style is really nice. It fits the game well, it's consistent and obviously it\u2019s really nice to look at. Animations are good too.\n\n[*]The core gameplay is that super addictive loop that you find in any game such as Stardew, Terraria or Minecraft. Your little island has different resources scattered across it for you to collect. You can build things that let you process resources or make them into things which then help you collect other resources.\n\n[*]As you get more stuff, you eventually unlock the option to purchase new land. Each new land brings more (sometimes new) resources for you to harvest, sometimes new islands are home to a character that will give you quests to bring them things. There are a few different biomes each with unique resources and enemies. There is an upper limit on how many islands you can unlock, but it\u2019ll take a while to buy them all unless that\u2019s what you focus on.\n\n[*]Some islands also have special landmarks or buildings on them. For example, one island has a building similar to the museum in Stardew where you can submit things (and eventually get rewards). Other things are a bit more puzzle-y. I found some of the puzzles a bit too confusing, but for the most part they\u2019re a welcome addition.\n\n[*]As you play, you earn experience points and then when you level up you earn a skill point. There\u2019s a bunch of different skills in the game. Some of the unlock new things to build, some just improve things you already have. But there\u2019s so much to unlock here and it\u2019s so well varied that it really compels you to keep playing.\n\n[*]Your tools don\u2019t break, but you can upgrade them. You start with a pickaxe but quickly unlock other tools such as bows, shovels, wands etc. Each tool has a specific use but can be used for other things in a pinch (for example the pickaxe can be a pretty powerful melee weapon if you don\u2019t have time to switch to your sword). The later upgrades also add bonus effects to your tools, which is really nifty. \n\n[*]The idle elements are really well integrated. The main thing is that resources respawn on the islands as you play which is how you can keep going even if you only have one or two islands. Eventually you unlock buildings that automatically harvest resources for you, which is really convenient. The resources can get a bit overwhelming, especially if you leave an island alone for a while, so I\u2019m glad there\u2019s auto-harvesting. \n\n[*]There\u2019s a great amount of character customization in the game in the form of body types, head types and back types. There\u2019s a bunch of stuff to unlock, and a lot of the items in the game are references to other indie games (such as Nuclear Throne and Super Meat Boy) which I\u2019m a big fan of. [/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral:[/h1] \n[list][*]Forager doesn\u2019t have a convenient way to pause the game (it only fully pauses if you\u2019re on the skill screen) but the soft pause that\u2019s implemented actually works well. Basically, when you enter the inventory screen/menu, the game doesn\u2019t pause but enemies stop targeting you. This means you can leave the game running for resources to respawn (or accumulate if you have auto harvesting) without fear of dying. [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Forager does have an energy system. Basically, you have a bar of energy that\u2019s used up when you do things, and you have to eat to recharge it. It\u2019s not awful and it\u2019s not like food is hard to come by, but it\u2019s really inconvenient and it just feels unnecessary. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nForager really blew me away with how good it is. The core gameplay hooks you, the amount and variation of things to unlock is what compels you to keep playing. This is one of the best games I\u2019ve played so far this year, and I highly recommend it to fans of games like Stardew. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider following my curator page: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1555606854, "timestamp_updated": 1574825203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763745903968811035", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50290934": {"recommendationid": "50290934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208078171", "num_games_owned": 723, "num_reviews": 555, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 940, "last_played": 1556065248}, "language": "english", "review": "I mean, I completely understand the negative reviews. I agree with part of them too. It's not completely fleshed out and around the 11 hour mark (will vary per user/route taken), you'll just kind of be sitting afk while your buildings work or you spam the shovel and pray to the RNG gods that certain items will drop from the fish traps since you have no control over that stuff. Do not look forward to the end game if you bother getting this \"idle game that you want to keep playing\" because you stop wanting to play it around there. I feel like they ran out of ideas to keep the game fresh and just accepted the idle part as necessary for progression.\n\nThat all being said, I do still recommend this game because at $20 I have roughly 15 hours in and that's really good value. Idk how much a dollar is to anyone else but for me, I've passed that mark.\n\nI also want to say that some games just have amazing beginning gameplay, like Pokemon and some of the old RPG's of the 90's early 2000s, and this is one of them. I just thoroughly enjoyed the beginning and think most people will. The beginning alone isn't really worth the price tag though.\n\nPS: I enjoyed the comic about your motivation to make this game.

Its mostly farming and gathering and tossed in with some easy micromanagement mechanics and fighting . The building ,crafting and collecting  is easy and simple , so its not a chore to do. \n\nThe game works real well with controller. I use this game on my Steam Link and its a relaxing little time killer. The game also supports Steam Workshop for mods as well for adding on content and what not . \n\nI think this is a good game to keep Kids occupied for a good wile with all the Crafting and Foraging that can be done. Most of the older players might find it too easy or a chore . But if you like to play something that doesn't occupy to much of your brain then this is the game for you to play and relax too.

Its addiction factor easily matching that of the legendary trio which was quite unexpected.\nOnly downside is absence of any story or lore whatsoever just pure sandbox, like Minecraft for example, but super rewarding and enjoyable progress loop more than makes up for lack of traditional story telling.\n\nYou start of on a piece of land 11x11 squares across surrounded by water and with some basic skills that let you build structures to produce materials and tools. First you gather some raw resources like wood and stone and if you are lucky maybe you get a piece of coal. Every action yields small amount of XP and before you know it you'll level up. It was no later than that when I was first positively surprised, for the initial 4 skills available for unlock already provide substantial bonuses and introduce significant gameplay changes. Most times bonuses range from 50-100% which was quite pleasant to see after dragging myself through F2P 1-5% bonuses gutter before. In fact lowest bonus comes from attack/move speed of +10% to not break the game I presume. Out of the 64 skills there are maybe only 3 or 4 filler ones. Buildings auto-repair? Yes please.\n\nTo get out of the initial island you have to accumulate enough coins and purchase adjacent lands. The farther the land is the more expensive it gets and serves as a progression gateway. World size is limited to large 7x7 islands of randomized land configuration but each new piece comes with some kind of novelty. Be it an NPC with a quest, temp bonus providing monolith, a puzzle, or a dungeon. What kind you get depends on the biome which are always set up identically but internal configuration varies. Each biome comes with own set of resources and higher tier of existing ones that just yield more.\n\nWhat impressed me is how well done this progression loop feels. Resources respawn out of thin air so you'll never run out. Seems cheap but it works. Helps leveling up through early game quicker and earn valuable new skills early. Production can be easily automated so clutter from inventory is automatically siphoned to production facilities without user input. It bypasses inventory altogether if you put items in storage vaults. While you gather your base is producing bars for a better tool. Basically the game alleviates tedium and rewards players who posses basic capacity to plan.\n\nEnemies are a joke - the hardest thing in the game is to die lol. And becomes harder and harder as you become OP and more OP. A true power tripping fantasy. As it should be because enemies respawn too... but they carry coins and drop resources so... One of the cool things about combat is that it's dodge heavy in favor of player so most hits will miss you and even if they hit it'll be a non-issue. Late-game screen will be filled with bullets and \"dodged\" messages as you stroll around with impunity.\nBesides regular skill you can also level up combat ones: Health, Stamina, Damage, and instant level-up. The last two are a God send for there is no cap to Damage and last one eventually becomes the only way to level up. That is done via special Orbs which are more easily obtained than you might think and come in unlimited supply.\nPuzzles are well done and usually confined to own islands. Often requiring a-ha moment after which they are easily solved. A welcome break from constant gathering and killing. Basically the whole game is pure enjoyment with steady and well balanced influx of new stuff to discover.\nDungeons are pretty nice, not randomized, and come with in different flavors: maze, puzzles, and traps. All are filled with enemies and few secret rooms with goodies.\n\nSounds effects are really well done. You can feel the pickaxe when it strikes and screen shakes. Same with combat. Even constant audio notifications from gathered materials on the other side of the map I learned to appreciate.\n\nPerformance wise it was one of the smoothest games I played. Constant max FPS even though there were more bitmaps on screen than whole games released in the '90s had combined - game didn't flinch once. Okay it did slowed down as I covered water with 1000 bridge tiles but simple Alt+Tab in-and-out restored equilibrium (a first). In retrospect, imagining if the game was made in Unity fills me with horror.\n\n* * *\n\nDevelopment stopped abruptly before Roadmap was complete (real shame) so there are some QoL missing. Apparently there was a conflict between the main and supporting devs related to payment. From what little I've read it came from inexperience and difficult finances rather than malice. Anyway besides few QoL game does not feel unfinished, it just feels weird seeing a Roadmap on the main menu unlikely to ever get fulfilled.\nProduction quantity desperately needs incremental modifiers (x10/x50/x100) to avoid having to click hundreds of times. Because late-game production is iffy to automate and best left untouched. It would just be best if you could set exact quantities of each item in storage for production to meet and then stop until said items get used on something.\nThe other thing is game only remembers designated item destinations if there is already an item in storage, if they all get used up destination defaults to player inventory resulting in clutter. This is why full late game automation is not feasible.\n\n* * *\n\nAchievements are not hard and most will come naturally (no missables). Just start building Banks early and have 40-50 of them clustered together for maximum effect since related achiev is most time consuming of them all. For couple of others there are straightforward guides, or you can even use mods which do not disable achievs.\n\nIn the end I'm pretty satisfied with it, expected a low effort Stardew/Zelda knock-off (judging by store images) but got a solid 5 days worth of quality fun outta it. If you find yourself low on end-game materials just enter the \"Void\" and survive to level 30 so. That loot will cover everything.
