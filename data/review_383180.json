That being said minor tweaks and some polish here and there push riptide to be slightly more enjoyable overall compared to 1. The leveling/xp rate feels much more balanced, and guns feel viable as a weapon rather than being peashooters like in 1. \r\n\r\n That's honestly my favorite part of riptide, as much fun as smacking zombies with melee weapons is, getting a host of guns that felt impactful made the game even more enjoyable.

The gameplay get's stale pretty fast. Head bobbing and fov stutters are way worse than in the predecessor. The upgrading system has been improved slightly.\n\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] An additional upgrading path has been added that levels upon using certain equipment\n[*] A lot of sidequests wherever you go. Most of them are basically the same, but still believable. Everybody would require mostly the same help in such situation.\n[*] Navigation via the minimap is ok in most cases\n[*] Hack n Slash works decent\n[*] Various weapons and mods that you can apply to \"fake\" diversity\n[*] Potential Co-Op\n[*] Your rewards from quests and loot scales with your level\n[*] Enemies scale with your level - so you can remain in the same area while the loot and xp gains grow\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[*] Head bobbing and fov lag when you run around can cause motion sickness.

Same when you want to correct your ADS-aimbot from chest to head. It is just tedious and unreliable\n[*] Not ADS-ing works in close range but later in the game it is required since the weapons are not accurate enough when you don't ADS ...... So you can't compensate it with your own skill.

Rigging of the 3D models, the voice actors, the script/writing/\"plot\", upgrading weapons with money and not salvage etc. are just some of the absolutely horrendous game play experience of this game. \n\nDifferent DPI/Mouse speed in-game and in menus whose sliders does not work the same, and both of them completely different from your native DPI. No amount of settings with my gaming mouse will affect the DPI in-game, only the in-game settings affect it and they're bad. Like, BAD bad. No matter what settings you have in-game and/or fiddling with NVIDIA control panel settings that you do, this game does not want to be optimized. Stuttering that seems to not only be graphical but also due to some sort of intentional delay on the controls for your character creates a jarring experience for anyone used to responsive controls. \n\nThis game does not like to be tabbed out and in of. And god forbid you close the game where all of your other windows(if you have some open like most people do) are now invisibly scaled to another resolution and/or ratio that can only be released by CTRL+ALT+DEL, and sometimes needing to even restart the computer. And in-game together with the previously mentioned controls delay, there is some automatically-downed-by-zombie-to-\"give the player a challenge\" quick-time event shenanigans going on. Combine this with zombies who scales weirdly in difficulty/levels and previously mentioned delays and stuttering, then this entire game is just one giant ****-storm. \n\nBut now for the \"fix-trigger\" part. There is something inherently fun about upgrading gear, salvaging and bashing/cutting/kicking zombies, and since this game still at least has THAT it makes you want to play other games of a similar type. Hence the \"fix-trigger\", as it triggers the need for that fix but also very obviously proves that Riptide ain't the answer.\n\nIf you can get this title for free, play it for 30 minutes or an hour to make you feel like playing real zombie games.

It is very buggy with glitches everywhere, it fails to unlock achievements properly and the characters are the exactly the same as in Dead Island. The only saving Grace this game has is the new character, John Morgan, who is extremely fun to play with. Rather get Dead Island and grab a friend to play with, or if you must get Riptide, get it on sale. I replayed it again and yeah, just as bad as I remember it.\n\nThe piece written above was my initial review of DI:Riptide after playing the game again.\n\nNow that I have played the Definitive Edition, I can say I was somewhat disappointed. The only thing they updated with the Definitive Edition is the graphics, that's about it. In fact, they removed some things from this edition. In the old edition of Riptide, there would be rainstorms that made it harder to see and zombies would attack you during them. It could be a worn out experience after a while, but I always thought it was unique because the previous Dead Island game did not have such a gameplay mechanic. It made sense, there was a rainstorm in the game and everything is flooded and it kept raining, Without this mechanic, it's just annoyingly wet everywhere you go. Felt strange. Everything bad about the old Riptide is still ever present in the Definitive Edition - Dying randomly, zombies one shotting you with a thrown white knife and graphical glitches. I really wish they took their time with the definitive edition to address such problems and polish the game since the old Riptide had a really bad reputation on release. As it stands the graphics is improved and that's about it. You are better off buying the old edition of Riptide, as this one actively takes away some of the experience originally added in the game. Playing the game again made me realise John Morgan is actually somewhat of a jerk. They also toned down his comical overpowered kick the enemies over the map ability, which was very entertaining in the old Riptide. A shame.\n\n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1708943424, "timestamp_updated": 1708943424, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159197307": {"recommendationid": "159197307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353182951", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 1760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1760, "last_played": 1708547955}, "language": "english", "review": "I mean, I understand the hate.

If you are thinking about getting this game, even on sale, don't.\n\nIt's a buggy mess that will cause you almost nothing but misery. Being a masochistic achievement hunter I decided to play through the entire game anyway.\n\n- This game is balanced for multiplayer. If you play it single player like I did, you will die a lot, especially in the early game. No, you wont be dying because you are not good enough like in a fair game like Dark Souls. You will die because you are stuck in an animation and unable to do anything while 3 zombies wail on you. You will die because you get caught on a parasol, you will even die from fall damage in jumps you did a dozens times in the exact same location when you previously never gotten even a little bit of fall damage. I assume this game is less frustrating with friends, but alone it is utter torture.\n\n- Don't bother trying to hunt achievements, a lot of them are bugged. I killed the final boss and ingame it shows I should have the achievement but I do not have it on steam. I did every single one of the 80 awful quests this game has to offer yet the game claims I only did 79/80. I realized that it never counted one of the quest bosses I killed, even though the game also clearly states that I killed 13/13 in my stats, but the achievement for it says 12/13, thus preventing me from having all 80 quests done.\n\n- The game is a chore to get around in. The first map has cars and boats, which are fun to use, but there are many areas they can't get to. Also be extremely sure not to come to close to any object because your vehicle will make a full stop. One time I parked my car, stepped outside and just died from full health for no reason. There is also a fast travel system, but it randomly deletes unlocked fast travel points sometimes. When I unlocked the last one I traveled back to do some side quests and for a while this last fast travel point was usable, until it wasn't anymore.\n\n2/10 Buggy Bullshit", "timestamp_created": 1708618762, "timestamp_updated": 1708618762, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158973489": {"recommendationid": "158973489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109982104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1708139532}, "language": "english", "review": "go play dying light", "timestamp_created": 1708610954, "timestamp_updated": 1708610954, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158956647": {"recommendationid": "158956647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076363877", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 262, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1708527295}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing this on DEAD ISLAND RIPTIDE (normal edition), I didn't remember the first ship fight made me so nauseated with so much melee attack bobbing, ship hits the rock animation, stamina low bobbing being so bad.\n\nI also didn't  notice that the gunfire animation is weak / not as powerful as it was.\n\nGame may be HD but it's a bit out of touch, I guess.\n\nRecommended if you have not ever tried this game before.", "timestamp_created": 1708592181, "timestamp_updated": 1708592181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158936583": {"recommendationid": "158936583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138122070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1708565662}, "language": "english", "review": "Writing is horrible and the gameplay isnt as good as the 1st game.

I still remember how amazing that first reveal trailer was for the game - if you haven't seen it, look it up. It made it seem like the game would be a serious take on the zombie genre, which we were all in the mood for following the release of [b]The Walking Dead[/b] TV show back in 2010. The game instead turned out to be a silly romp, which was still fine, but developer Techland could've been justifiably accused of pulling a bait and switch.\n\nTherefore, I knew exactly what I would be getting into with [b]Dead Island Riptide[/b]. I've considered playing this game for years, even briefly trying it in co-op over Playstation Now's game streaming service (the lag was a bit too intense). Finally, when developer Techland briefly made the game available for free on Steam, my co-op partner and I decided to take a trip to Banoi.\n\nMuch of what was fun in the first game remains fun here. As I've established in other reviews, I love scrounging, and there's a lot of that to be done. You'll not only need the money you find to purchase weapons and items from the vendors, but to repair the melee weapons that you'll dull and crack from constantly dispatching zombies. In addition to finding money, you'll be accumulating components such as wires, rods, batteries, bleach, rubber hoses, etc. You'll use these components to enhance your weapons using the blueprints that you'll find in the game. I was personally a big fan of the \"Shredder\" and \"Hot Rod\" mods, which stack bleeding and burn damage over time effects (respectively) on top of your strikes when you score a critical hit. \n\nSome things are challenging to find in the game world and will appear more readily in the more challenging \"Dead Zones\" that are set apart from the main map. I looked and looked, but was never able to acquire the \"Suicider Meats\" necessary to upgrade the inventory for one of the camp vendors. You'll want to pay special attention to items like \"Canned Food,\" that can be turned in to specific NPCs in exchange for experience. Finding and delivering these items is [i]by far[/i] the fastest way to level up.\n\nThe skill trees, or at least the one available to the survivor I played, John Morgan, were underwhelming. You'll want to make sure that you grab \"One-handed weapon durability\" and \"Optimal Maintenance\" to reduce your trips to the repair bench, but I'd also encourage making a rush to the \"Big Boot\" skill, which allows you to stomp zombie heads for an instant kill after you've knocked one to the ground. Zombies have a lot of health, especially at the start of the game when you don't have many blueprints, and they are excellent at closing the distance and putting damage on you. Big Boot will allow you to make quick work of them and will prove a lifesaver. Each character has a \"Fury\" skill that puts your character in a rage, and while in this state you'll deal additional damage. This was always fun to deploy on Thugs (special, larger miniboss enemies with more health and attack strength) to stop their incessant roaring.\n\nThe physics of the game make your attacks very satisfying, from the slo-mo decapitations of your blades to the backflips zombies do when sprinting into a well-timed boot to the face. I also enjoyed the defense sections of the game, where you'll deploy fences, mines, and even a few miniguns to withstand the zombie onslaught. These were chaotic, but I found it enjoyable to try and divide my attention correctly between the multiple potential entrances to the area.\n\nA few things I wanted to be sure and mention in the review:\n[list]\n[*] To add higher-quality items to the inventories of your camp vendors, you'll need to complete \"team quests.\" These quests are located in a separate menu of the game alongside your inventory and skill tree, and must be activated here instead of by talking to the vendor in question in the game world. Each vendor's inventory can be upgraded multiple times through subsequent team quests. I learned about this system in a wiki - I might've eventually found it while playing, but I don't think it's very obvious.\n\n[*] For the longest time, I didn't realize that I had a flashlight (activated with \"T\" while playing with mouse/keyboard). There are many dark areas in the game where this is useful, although the flashlight batteries drain alarmingly fast. The batteries recharge when the flashlight is not in use, although this also takes more time than I'd prefer. If I had it to do all over again, I might actually try and find a mod that provides me with an \"infinite\" flashlight. I don't feel that the flashlight battery system added anything meaningful to the game, instead just being an irritating hindrance.\n[/list]\n\nIf you enjoy this sort of open-world zombie slaughter-fest and you've already played the first [b]Dying Light[/b] (the best of this bunch in my estimation), you could do worse than taking a trip to Banoi to chop off some zombie heads and stomp on some zombie faces.", "timestamp_created": 1712074092, "timestamp_updated": 1712076041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158279338": {"recommendationid": "158279338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194160486", "num_games_owned": 700, "num_reviews": 205, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1687332375}, "language": "english", "review": "LMAOOOOO they gave this game for free then got hit by negative reviews", "timestamp_created": 1707886137, "timestamp_updated": 1707886137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162746591": {"recommendationid": "162746591", "author": {"steamid": "76561199070653417", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 168, "playtime_at_review": 149, "last_played": 1713026846}, "language": "english", "review": "For the record i HAVE NOT played the first game, but this game is quite bad.

Apparently the NPC Batnam is the most useless person in the game as he is the only trader to hand you Stingray tail.

RPG zombie game with sort of turn based combat?  They certainly took the genre in a different direction from what I expected, but if you have no hope of taking on L4D why even try, so points for creativity I suppose.  Very janky subpar melee combat with strange character inertia, but for free and with friends it was pretty fun.

Releasing such content was already a rarity at that time; you usually make do with DLCs where your best bet is to purchase the corresponding Season Pass instead of individual contents. So, releasing an expansion to an already well-known game seems a pretty cool idea. The story takes place immediately after Dead Island - from Banoi we switch to Palanai, another tourist resort-like location which is taken over by our undead friends. \n\n[b]Anything new?[/b]\n\nYes and no. Yes, as there are some new things in terms of game mechanics but no as they do not significantly alter the gameplay experience. Again, this is an expansion pack so do not expect a completely overhauled and reworked system.  A new addition to the group is John, a 5th member, who is mainly specialised in using brass knuckles. This was the only weapon type left out - we finally have a hero who's expert at hand-to-hand combat.\n\nAnother thing is the introduction of survival sections. As our heroes move from one place to another every time just before they begin their journey we are to make a stand. The top of the screen indicates the strength of the horde - naturally, this is decreasing slowly as the zombies are attacking in waves. We can lay traps and put up fences at the beginning and between waves. Using gatling guns to riddle the living dead with bullets is pure fun in these sections.\n\nWe also have some new zombie types such as the drowner that quickly wakes up (he is floating on the water appearing to be dead) and attacks you. He is not much of a threat but if you do not pay attention you are in for a nasty surprise. Drowners mean a lot of water - prepare to use not just automobiles but also a motorboat to explore the new island's remote locations. My favourite was the screamer - an old lady whose brain is visible and who is able to emit such a loud scream that your hero starts wandering about while trying to endure the loud noise. There are also some bungalow and apartment areas that are full of zombies and they include bosses - expect a difficult fight but usually great reward at the end.\n\n[b]Why is it Definitive?[/b]\n\nBecause it was re-released a couple of years later along with its predecessor. The \"normal\" versions are not available anymore just the remastered editions. Basically, the game was redone with the use of a later Chrome Engine (the same that ran under Dying Light). It is a nice touch as the game looks much, much better (especially the shadows and some of the lights) but then again you have the same gameplay and some of the annoying bugs or glitches remained.\n\n[b]Who is this game for?[/b]\n\nIt is for zombie game fans. Techland's real big hit was definitely Dying Light with its parkour mechanics but if you want to see where the zombie fest started for them feel free to purchase Dead Island and its expansion.

Not a prequel, and not quite a sequel. So is this game worth the buy? Let's get into it. \n\n[h1] [b] The Good [/b] [/h1]\n\n[*] [b] The Setting [/b]\n- The Dead Island game's call to fame is its beautiful setting. \"Its zombies.... But on a tropical island\" was probably the birthing idea for this game series. All jokes aside, Riptide stays true to its predecessor and lets you explore through the scenic island \"paradise\", the flooded jungles, and eventually the urban hellscape that is the city of Hederson. When optimized correctly, these can all be intriguing and visually appealing scenes.\n\n[*] [b] The Nostalgia [/b]\n- If you're playing [i] Dead Island: Riptide [/i], there a chance that you played [i] Dead Island [/i] as well. Riptide knows this and does a decent job of bringing a little joy in from the past with continued references, Easter eggs, and continuations from the previous game. Its always nice to get a little blast from the past. \n\n[*] [b] The Playable Characters [/b]\n- Some may say that playing as the same characters through multiple games is unoriginal and lame. I disagree, for me it helps continue their story. In Riptide, you get have five options this time around. Your choices are:\n\nSam B - Rapper who beats things to death\nLogan - Professional Football player who throws things at other things until they die\nPurna - Security who shoots things to death \nXian Mei - Receptionist and ex-military who stabs things to death\nJohn - Australian soldier who punches and kicks things to death\n\n- Essentially, you can carry over your save from the first Dead Island as whatever character, or choose to play as John, the new character to the story. Never a bad thing to spice it up a little\n\n[h1] [b] The Bad  [/b] [/h1]\n\n[*] [b] The Story [/b]\n- Now... the first Dead Island didn't exactly have the [b] best [/b] story around, but it at least was original for the series (because it was the first game.... duh). Riptide, though, decided to be brave! To be bold! Brazen even! They do this by..... Having basically the same story as the first game? \"No, that can't be right.\" *checks notes*. \"They get stranded on an island deserted with zombies, check\". \"Then, they have to head further into the Jungle, check\". \"After that, they have to head through the sewers or tunnels... to get to the large city nearby... Oh\". ITS LITERALLY THE SAME STORY. LIKE THE FIRST GAME ENDS, AND THEN YOU GET SENT THROUGH THE SAME EXACT THING. It's crazy man... and kind of lame.\n\n[*] [b] The Enemies [/b] \n- Its okay to have use the same enemies from the previous games, even in zombie games. Look at Left 4 Dead. But they at least polished how they act, and added multiple new zombies. From what I could see, there was literally only one new zombie in this game. Every other enemy was just copy pasted from the first game. Speaking of copy pasting ....\n\n[*] [b] The Graphics and Detail [/b]\n- There are like... no improvements in this game. It looks entirely the same. All models (zombies, characters, weapons, etc.) are the same as the first game. This isn't a big issue to me personally, but its part of a larger problem I will address later. \n\n[*] [b] The weapons and Fighting [/b]\n- Multiple issues here. First, there has been practically no improvement from the first game. The melee attacks are still glitchy and clanky like in the first game. Second, all the weapon upgrades and improvements are basically the same. Yeah, there's fire, shock, bleed, and poison options, but there will be like, eight of them, and they all do, and look the same. It honestly feels kind of lazy. Third, the combat does not always register. You see a katana slice through a walker, but it doesn't hit or damage them. Inconvenient for a small fight, deadly for a major one. Throwing weapons clip through the map, making you lose rare and upgraded gear because it shot through a cliff.\n\n[*] [b] The Clipping and NavMeshing [/b]\n- You get stuck on everything in this game. You'll be running down a street being chased by a butcher and 10 infected, and your foot will clip onto the edge of a small trash can, and now you've completely stopped moving and are now dead. You will clip through ledges making you fall to your death. I've even fell through the map once while walking through the jungle. \n\n[h1] [b] The Ugly [/b] [/h1]\n\n[*] [b] The Preformance [/b]\n- Before getting started, no it is not my internet. No it is not my brand new gaming pc. No it is not a problem on my end. Look in any forum or comment string for this game and you see it to. This game... preforms [b] HORRIBLY [/b]. The title screen is sluggish, the actual game is horribly laggy and feels like it can barely run. Its bad enough that you could even get a headache over it. I don't understand what they did wrong, as the original [i] Dead Island [/i] from years earlier, runs perfectly. Smooth as butter. This game is clanky and rough.\n\n[*] [b] The Lack of Originality [/b]\n- This game is not a sequel. It is barely different from the first game, which I believe to be vastly superior. The combat is no different. The story is no different. The setting is barely different, you just moved over a couple islands. The game just does not in any way feel like a separate entity. It honestly fails to uphold the same standards set by the first [i] Dead Island [/i]\n\n[h1] [b] Overall  [/b] [/h1]\n\nDead Island: Riptide is a DLC that pretends to be a real game. It is completely unoriginal and fails to differ from its predecessor in any way, even the PLOT OF THE STORY. It fails to bring anything new or interesting to the table and doesn't excel in any form. It performs worse, looks no better, and plays significantly worse that the first game. The fact that they charged $60 dollars for this should be a crime. They should of just released this as an add-on DLC for Dead Island , charged you $30 and called it a day.  At least if they did that, me and thousands of others wouldn't feel ripped off\n\nDisclaimer: This game IS entertaining. You will have fun playing this. Its just that its not worth the full price as there is barely anything new.

Basically in the game you have a group of survivors, who you can take care of their needs and if you complete them, you upgrade their weapons and wares too. It's not really an in-depth group managing stuff, but it's a great way to level up and making the shop prices lower. I think RIptide is more balanced than it's predecessor. Weapons doing more damage and have better durability overall, skill trees seems more useful too, however enemies still able to take you out easily, if you don't know the best way to eliminate them. There were base defense gameplay parts in the game, where you had to fight against a zombie horde and survive the attack, also protecting your group members, which were all right in general. You can miss it easily, but the soundtrack for Riptide is also better than the original Dead Island one. \n\nHowever you might ask, why I keep comparing Riptide to the previous Dead Island game? I could just review it standalone. Well, that's because both game is basically the same in most parts. In Riptide, you collect different weapons and upgrade them throughout the game, meanwhile you also upgrade yourself and completing missions in an infected filled environment. You can use skills, passives and different type of weapons and mods to uncover more about the situation. That's basically the formula for the original Dead Island.\n\nIf you except something new from the series, you will be disappointed. For me, this game just felt like an expansion. Missions are not so different from each other, they feel blend, however at the end of the game it will start overtwisting some simple looking missions and even the lore itself for no reason at all, which felt annoying to me. The story is pretty weird, thanks to the silly decisions which the characters make throughout the game and to the horrific characters, but at least they tried to make the story a bit interesting in the end. There are more bugs in this one, then the original game. I got pushed into a wall and died instantly a lot more than anything, I also got stuck on certain places, the boat in the game is horrible and jumping over boxes or just doing simple platforming is nerve wrecking and the list goes on. Explosion radius is also unpredictable.\n\nThis game came out 1 and half years after the original Dead Island and I can't really understand why they didn't tried to bring more new stuff to it, however somehow I like this game more then the previous one, even with it's issues. If you want to know more about the Dead Island series or you are just interested in the game, even though you read it's issues, than I can recommend the game for your.

It looks and plays the same as the previous DI games, an open-world, zombie action survival game. Due to the naming of the title, many people assume Riptide is another version of Dead Island, but it's not, it's actually a sequel which takes place almost directly after the ending of the main game. You can even import your character, retaining your level and skills, but not inventory. There's a new character, but if you wanna try him out you must start from level 1.\n\nIn Riptide you explore a whole new area, but it continues the \"vacation island\" theme. In my opinion, the areas of this game looks better and feels more coherent compared to the areas in the first game, although there's no hotel level which for me is the most memorable part. This game is also shorter, about 2/3 or even half of the length DI, which is actually preferable since DI kinda overstays its welcome. Sadly both games share a poorly-done finale, where you must fight through hordes of zombies inside a linear, claustrophobic building to get to the escape vehicle. There's also less human enemies here, which is ironically my favorite fights in the main game.\n\nOne major improvement about this game is how it treats the characters. Playable characters have more personalities, like each of them have unique dialogue when talking to characters rather than some generic variations of \"yes/no\". The non-chosen characters also hang around the other survivors instead of not appearing at all, and you can do some item collecting quests for them to improve their power while fighting in base defense missions. Side characters are also more fleshed-out, although sadly there's not enough character models so many side and minor characters look similar.\n\nThe problems I have with this game is mostly the same with the first one: very poor optimization, hardy zombies + fragile weapons, far away fast travel spots, and too many sidequests are fetch quests. But the improvements are also great, I feel more attached to the characters due to them having more personalities and the maps are not as large so travelling around isn't very tedious. Although sadly both this game and the original version doesn't have any story DLC, it only has some exclusive weapons and a barely-noticeable costume change.\n\nPersonally, I think Dead Island: Riptide is the better game compared to Dead Island, due to more likable characters, better level design and setting, more enemy variations, and a more coherent story. But even with the story recap at the beginning, you should still play the first one. If you like open-world action games and/or zombie games, give the Dead Island franchise a try.

During your 12 or so hours in the main campaign, you\u2019ll meet a wide roster of characters who\u2019ll offer you quests in return for cash and weapon modifications. Interactions with said characters comprise the bulk of the game\u2019s generic plot, and although Riptide takes an occasional break from the zombie-slashing to acquaint you with them in awkwardly animated cutscenes, any emotional impact that could be made is lost due to an overall lack of substantial character development. Trust me, the game does try to inject some meaning into itself, especially when a major character gets their throat ripped open in super-dramatic slow motion, but when these events occurred I was devoid of any response other than, \u201cHurry up so I can get back to killing.\u201d\n\nBut story hardly matters when there are zombies to fight, and fortunately, Riptide continues the satisfying job its prequel did. With a near-endless variety of weapons, each of which can be upgraded, diving into groups of undead only to emerge with limbs dangling from your appendages is just too much damn fun. Meaty sound effects and visual variety in the common infected help stave off initial repetition, as do some awesome takedowns you\u2019ll earn when you reach the higher levels. RPG elements allow you to customise the progression path of your character\u2014in theory making repeated playthroughs worth your time --so that come the end of the game, your character will be so muscled with power-ups that any brawl you encounter, big or small, will become a gore-rich affair in seconds. It all adds up to a good time. If going solo gets dull, the drop-in co-op is still there, staying as chaotic and team-driven as before.\n\nSo, the game looks, sounds, and feels good. Must have really ironed out the problems Dead Island had, right? Ha. If only.\n\nChief among the laundry list of problems is the dreadful stamina system. Inherited from its prequel, Riptide\u2019s characters are reliant on stamina to run, fight, and execute their decaying attackers. An understandable mechanic, in order to keep the game challenging. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if stamina didn\u2019t deplete so quickly and take several times as long to recharge. Without stamina, you can\u2019t fight, nor run away, and this is a problem that really spreads its excrement-covered wings in Riptide. Enemies now are way stronger, faster, and take far more of a punch before meeting their long-overdue end. Several times did the slow-as-hell stamina bar get my behind handed to me, and although there are virtually no consequences to death (you respawn 5 seconds later with a slight monetary penalty), it does become a point of frustration around the fifth time it happens. Add to that regular hit-detection problems (particularly with kicks) and zombies who spawn right behind you in areas you rightly assumed were clear, you get difficulty spikes that occur from rubbish design instead of genuine challenge.\n\nTake note, game developers. Challenge should come from interesting levels and enemies; not from throwing six super-fast, super-strong bullet sponges at me who\u2019ll take nothing short of an atomic bomb to fell. This is a source of frustration that persists from start to finish, no matter how potent your arsenal is, and it is unacceptable that even a game like Dark Souls does a much better job of scaling its difficulty than Riptide.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t forget the bugs, of which there are enough to make Garry's Incident seem like a polished title. Zombies launching into the air and getting caught in environments is a common sight, as is audio cutting out when too many sound effects emit at once. The waypoint system now only works when it feels like it, and the general design of Palanai is so inconsistent with the map that you can be forgiven for pursuing an outlined shortcut only to realise that it can\u2019t be traversed at all, no matter how much jumping or crouching you do. Add to that extremely repetitive quests that demand constant backtracking, you get a game that clearly had to feed off the creative leftovers from its far cleaner predecessor.\n\nAwesome as it feels to drive an electric-powered machete into the chest of some hungry zombie, any fun you have with Riptide will be counterbalanced by frustrating combat, an anaemic plot, shoddy game world, boring missions, and a lack of polish so blatant it\u2019s a wonder the game doesn\u2019t fog up your screen the instant you load it. With or without company, Riptide varies from being a solid zombie slice-em-up to an annoying saga of busywork. Whether you should buy it depends on your ability to accept it for what it is: a vastly inferior product to its prequel that carries over most of the good things but doesn\u2019t try to fix any of the flaws. If more Dead Island with a slippery surface sounds okay to you, check it out next time it\u2019s on sale.\n\n6/10.", "timestamp_created": 1512944566, "timestamp_updated": 1512944688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726628899574279785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93296233": {"recommendationid": "93296233", "author": {"steamid": "76561199151055368", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 747, "last_played": 1643865114}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked the first, this carries on from that.

Change a game too much and it loses it\u2019s magic. Change it too little and it is a rehash and not worth the money. It is a balancing act and one that Dead Island Riptide does a good job at. I had played the original Riptide back on Windows but not much since it would crash often in the first ten minutes. I didn\u2019t have any of those issues with the Linux version of the Definitive Edition thankfully. \n\n\tOnce again you can pick from the 4 different characters to play as. You can import your save file from the original dead Island Definitive Edition if you kept it. The story continues from the first as your group is still trying to escape the zombie outbreak. Without going into too much of a spoiler you get stuck on a different island. This allows the developers to reuse a lot of assets and can be seen as a tad lazy but overall the story was decently executed. It adds several new secondary characters for you to interact with. They all are very similar as the original as they just serve as basic quest givers and don\u2019t go into a deep backstory. The game adds a new mode of travel in the form of a boat. It is fun to use since you can use the engine blade to hack up zombies. It is also optional so if you prefer to walk or drive to places you still can.  The weapons and skills are very much the same as the original which is familiar if not a bit too much so. You can also traverse the landscape by climbing rocks and vines which while is a nice addition, it also is usually required to get to certain places instead of being an optional way to get to a location in multiple ways. Combat is still very satisfying as before and playing solo was still very doable.\n\n\tThere were still some issues that never got fixed from the original such as enemies being able to one hit kill me by throwing knives at me even though they are very low end weapons and I was at full health. I also encountered a glitch where I had to click on a boat to install the motor but the boat wasn\u2019t clickable. I had to reload the game and it was then clickable and I could progress. In another part of the game I crouched to enter a hallway that had rubble so I could search a container for loot but I was then unable to get out as I was too tall to do so even when crouched. Once again I had to reload to before I entered the hallway. Sometimes bodies would flicker for a second or two but never for longer and only a handful of times in my playthrough. One other isuse was there was no option to remap the key you use to throw a flare and that happens to be the button I use to kick. While I could choose another button to kick let\u2019s just say I wasted a great many flares as old habits die hard. A few times a sound effect was missing. Such as when I hit or shoot a zombie no sound would play. Once again this only happened a couple times through my playthrough.\n\n\tI played Dead Island Definitive Edition on Linux. Like the original Definitive Edition it suffered from an issue where the game would crash before loading the main menu. Like the original this was caused by a file called \u201cLibGL.so\u201d. The game was made to only work with a specific version of that file. As you can imagine over the years updated versions of have been made. The game will crash with anything newer than that version and no distro I tried uses one that old. The file is also not included with the game, it uses whichever version your OS has installed. I had to download a copy of the correct version file and drop it into the game folder. Once I did this the game launched just fine. The performance was great as well. I ran the game maxed out at 1080P and my FPS was usually 80-100 or higher. It supported framerates above 60 which was fantastic. There was no manual saving but the game auto saves after every completed task so it isn\u2019t terrible although I would prefer manual save. There was support for Vsync, one AA setting, one ambient occlusion setting, as well as 7 other settings to tweak.  Alt-Tab worked just fine. The game did not crash at all during play. My CPU usage during gameplay was usually around 39%, my system RAM usage was usually around 5.3GB. The game took up 9.45 GB of storage and uses Techland\u2019s own engine called Chrome Engine 5. I played version 1.1.2 of the game.\n\n\tI paid $3.30 CAD for Dead Island Definitive Edition. I can say that for how much fun it was it is easily worth $50 CAD. If you enjoy action games, co-op games, zombie games, give it a try if you haven\u2019t already.  It adds to the Dead Island story well and while not innovating a ton it is still a great game at it\u2019s core. It has some bugs and issues but none overshadow the fun I had.

It's very similar to Dead Island 1, which is practically Dying Light without Parkour. The story was ok but the gameplay was as awesome as before.\n\nThe main issue with this game is it's frustrating at times especially due to its bug and navigation. You will enjoy all its zombie killing with modified brutal skull reaping weapons but during traversal in between main and side missions, the navigation route will suddenly disappear almost all the time! The minimap has no real map in it so you will get mad opening the main map again and again!\n\nAlso, I found a bug in few initial missions if you explore more and reach the point that you are supposed to reach in the later checkpoint, the game will skip the previous checkpoint which logically will not make much sense. I also encountered 2-3 cases where direction to objectives (side missions) were either too dumb or totally wrong for which I had to rely on Google lol.\n\nApart from these, the game is awesome if you want more of Dead Island or Dying Light but you will miss parkour so much.

So we had turned to another zombie franchise Dead Rising, but I'd found it a little tedious for reasons I can no longer remember exactly.  Anyway, playing with good online friends is a blast and we were part way through playing Dead Island when Riptide was released, so I bought it immediately, and started the single player campaign in between playing the 1st game with friends, but TBH, I found Riptide just didn't feel as good; so it was put aside for almost 7 years until this April,  when I'd first returned to Dead Island to play with three other online friends (I'd abandoned both games because of losing my best friend with whom I was playing the first game cooperatively eight years ago.\n\n[b]Fast forward 7 years.[/b]\n\nWe'd thoroughly enjoyed the recent foray into Banai (playing it weekly for a few hours from last Nov 19 to April 20) & after completing all chapters decided to jump into Palanai together.  By this time Riptide had been re-released as the definitive edition, which I presume meant all the DLC from the original release had been incorporated, plus the  graphics had been overhauled. \n\nAlthough I loved the 1st game, my opinion of Riptide  has been totally reversed from my original thoughts.  Not only is it just as good as the original; Riptide has been upgraded to include some excellent changes such as item pick up's which in the first game were only available to the first player accessing the pick up or weapon locker; whereas in Riptide everyone gets to pick the item or weapon up; which in my opinion is much  fairer and leads to less rushing to get the decent weapons etc.  Also, when you first start, you already have some of the perks selected depending on which character you choose to play; e.g. the gun specialist Purna already has some Rage perks added, which give her extra shots when in rage mode. On top of this other challenges have been added that are completed in stages. As you progress, you are notified by messages on screen that you have attained a specific level in that particular challenge, for example cutting of a certain number of heads. When you complete aany challenge you are awarded XP towards your next level. \n\nWe as a group are still only on chapter three of Riptide, and about to enter Henderson town once we've finished the last of the side quests in the first area, so I'll edit this short review at some point, once we've completed the game.  We found that if we played without one of the group the quests would become a little confusing because  whoever had missed the previous game would not have various  quests completed or have missed picking up a decent modification or other important item, and it often led to us having to repeat quests just so they could catch up. Sometimes it was also necessary to have completed a particular quest before you could  accept others.  So when we started Riptide we decided that if one of the group couldn't play, the remainder of the group would jump into one of the many other zombie games or other co-op games available.\n\nThe  original graphics were much the same as the first game, but the definitive edition  that included all the old DLC plus a graphics overhaul doesn't seem that different from the original Riptide.   Despite the games age it still looks great (IMO) despite many official reviews lambasting it for lacklustre graphics.  I've also noticed that when joining the shared game there isn't the same issues as with the 1st one, where if you didn't click on the space bar when the cut scene started, you'd have to sit through the whole scene, and often have to reboot the game before being able to join. \n\nThe game play is similar to the original, apart from the pick up changes mentioned above,  there are new infected with different ways of attacking and although the maps are set in similar environments, the first three chapters based in Palanai & the flooded swamp land look a lot different than the  jungle map in the first game.  I can't comment on Henderson yet. It looks set out differently looking at it's [url=https://www.ign.com/maps/dead-island-riptide/henderson][b]interactive map[/b][/url], and from the images I see it looks more Spanish colonial and definitely different to Banoi town. There's a nice selection of side & repeatable quests that see's your group traversing the area in search of various quest items.  There's no through route for vehicles, so travelling in vehicles is not as enjoyable as the original game.  Overall my group are thoroughly enjoying the co-op experience  and  highly recommend the game to anyone who enjoys playing with friends, especially if you are connected via Discord as well.  As for the SP campaign,  I've only played the beginning & that was in the original version just after it had been released and before it was updated and given an HD overall.  At the time, as already mentioned, I wasn't impressed; but, losing one of the  friends I played with  to cancer and other  games I'd purchase back then  stopped me continuing until now.\n\n[b]Some useful  advice:[/b]\n\nBefore you start the game, or at least once you've  met  each of the different types of infected of which there are 13 types you should check out Dr Kessler's Casebook that's available via the Extra's  button,  which details all of the different infected types as well as their strengths and weaknesses.  You can also change the overall game play via the options to make it slighter harder or easier by  adjusting specific attributes such as  removing or adding hints, removing or adding  navigation on the mini map or removing  place markers on the main map and even the infected's health  bars.For those into collecting achievements, there's at least 35 to collect.\n\nmore to be added once completed.", "timestamp_created": 1594072711, "timestamp_updated": 1594075203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700082540512084961", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114926512": {"recommendationid": "114926512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198912403229", "num_games_owned": 1043, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1384, "last_played": 1651552822}, "language": "english", "review": "I guess I understand why people hated this game.

The game is more traditional open world with only 2 maps, but much more stuff to do in them. The jungle is a much more interesting version of the bases game's jungle, and Henderson is... a much more interesting version of Moresby, especially visually. Sprinkled throughout the maps are small instanced, what I like to call, challenge rooms. They are full of zombies and a boss. Unleashing a fully maxed out Fury on them is recommended, repetitive... but also tons of fun, each and every time you do it.\nSeems to be less serious that the original. It shows even in the main theme being more... funky I would say. There's also the quest for the horror director who, of course, does not care about his crew and just wants to finish shooting his movie.\nThe player characters are much more vocal this time, instead of going just \"uh huh\", \"yes\", \"of course\", when accepting quests, they actually talk with people.\nGameplay wise the import function and additional levels allow you to create a truly overpowered character, full power fantasy. However, since this occurs over the course of two games, I think it's perfectly fine.\nSeveral new mechanics have been added, unfortunately most of them are very janky. The Charge skill sometimes pulverizes an enemy, other times it leaves it with a sliver of health, and there are times where it misses completely and you are barreling down a cliff. The Jump Attack often either misses or gets you stuck, and the \"get-off-my-boat\" QTE makes the zombies fly away as if hit by a Falcon Punch. This really could have been ironed out in this remaster.\nThere are also problems with sound, where it cuts off. It happens with stationary miniguns, mine explosions, and Fury for some characters. I've tried numerous solutions, but none worked.\nThere's a village in the game where tons of assets are misaligned. We are speaking about dozens of trash cans clipping into buildings, fruit floating, crates sinking into ground. There is so much of it, it is literally impossible to miss just by playing the game normally. It's embarrassing. Since I have not played the original version, I wonder whether it's the Definitive Edition's fault.\n\nOverall, I had more fun with Riptide than with the base game, despite all of the jank and technical issues.

The game is the same as the original one (Dead Island Riptide) but this one has improved graphics and more realistic enviroments. Also it includes every DLC of the game such as new weapons, new ''skins'' for your character and many more.\nThe game takes place in some new locations which they were hit by the zombie apocalipse and it continues the events of the previous Dead Island title. The characters who are playable are the same with their unique skill tree and fury but this time a new ''guy'' joins the crew who is almost the God in the game cause he is really difficult to be killed either by zombies or by accidents.\n\nIf you like games which has a lot of gore, blood and some sadistic animations and textures, i recommend buying it.

Only worth getting (on sale) if you're looking to continue the story.\n\nThis game makes it hard to have fun with, because it has a lot of bugs and glitches that have a negative impact on enjoyment. It's very obvious that this game was rushed out of development and hasn't seen much support. It makes this game stink of money grab intentions. This one is rather shameful in comparison to the original Dead Island.\n\nSome combat moves were added that might've been neat on paper but were glitched to hell to the point of being almost useless. You can do a jump attack from above, which is an instant kill to normal zombies, but doing so runs the risk of being stuck in the attack animation. For a few seconds your character is floating slightly above the ground, you can't move, and you are vulnerable to attacks while it's happening. Most of the time, it's not a good idea to use this move.\n\nAnother very strange bug prevents Fury from working when it is assigned to a mouse button. I used to have it assigned to the middle mouse button in the original Dead Island, and that worked well. Can\u2019t do it in Riptide for whatever dumb reason.  Actually, Fury is very spotty if you are importing a character. Most of the time the Rage meter just doesn't fill to max, so you can't even use Fury. On rare occasions it actually fills and Fury becomes available. Another bug that you\u2019d think would be fixed in a patch.\n\nA lot of new explosives put in this game, making a lot of variety if secondary weapons. Most of them are good and you can use some good combos with them. One example is using poison bombs to poison the zombies, putting them in a toxic state, which makes them extremely vulnerable to fire damage. You can follow that up with a Molotov, and it's pretty much an instant kill to any enemy. This is a great strategy for tough specials or bosses (though, vast majority of bosses are toxic already, making them incredibly trivial encounters). On the other hand, new to the game are mines, which are great... when they aren't falling under the map when you place them (this happens a lot).\n\nSome of the quest flow is flawed and you may find yourself missing out of quests and their rewards due to it. Such as Harlow\u2019s team quests where you won\u2019t find the items needed for one of those quests until after the quest fails and can\u2019t be completed. A couple of continuous quests are placed in a very out of the way place in the map, making it tedious and undesirable to do it. One of these quests are actually near a fast travel point, but since the devs seemed to have forgotten to add the location to the list of fact travel points, that fast travel point is a one way trip and you have to manually get back to that location. Seems like a silly oversight that shouldn\u2019t have happened, or at the very least been fixed in a patch. On the other hand, now quest rewards scale with level, meaning that continuous quests are a lot more profitable and make leveling up incredibly fast. There's a quest where you won't find the item anywhere in the game except for a single place on the map, and you need three of those things. There are items in the game that have absolutely no use at all (some that are gotten from the more difficult areas in the game).\n\nThere\u2019s balance issues in this game that show the lack of testing done with it. A new zombie special called the Screamer is a very annoying addition, particularly if you\u2019re playing solo. They have the ability to make a high pitched scream that stuns your character, making him unable to attack and move very slowly, and it calls every zombie in the area to that location. That\u2019s pretty lethal for a solo player, and seems obvious that it was meant for team play. There is another special that has attacks specifically for a group of players in mind, so not a lot of thought was put in for solo play. Then there is the case that just about all the bosses are in a toxic state, making them extremely easy if you have a fire weapon mod on a weapon. Then you\u2019ll likely have to deal with glitches that allow walkers to one shot a full health bar character with a thrown weapon (died more times to this than anything else). Some weapon drops are so rare that you may not see a single one in a play through. Then you have new additions, like the staff, that are so overpowered that you can essentially finish the complete game with that one weapon. You\u2019ll eventually come across weapon mods very late in the game that are completely obsolete by the time you get them. When walkers with weapons scare you much more than a boss does, you know the game isn\u2019t balanced very well. It creates an experience that is either very annoying or very boring.\n\nForget weapon farming in this game. Chest respawns are inconsistent and borked and merchants sale the same thing throughout the game with little variation. It makes loot in the game rather dull. Then there were a lot of odd changes to weapons and especially weapon mods that makes you wonder what they were thinking when they designed and balanced weapons. Some of the changes are nice and allow for more modding options. Then others, like the Tesla mod, were nerfed to hell and back. In a game that is supposed to depend a lot on leveling and looting, it seems rather absurd that looting seems like such an oversight in this game.\n\nAlso, physics in this game sucks, which makes impact mods rather dull.\n\nThere are many more bugs and glitches that make this game a joke and unrecommendable. \n\nThe game also has, perhaps, a fourth of the content that the original game has. This is pretty much an expansion to the original game. Or rather, it plays like act 5 of the original game, starting exactly where the original ends. Yet it is selling for the same price as the original as if it were a fully fledged sequel. I've seen people mistakenly refer to this as \"Dead Island 2\". The asking price is ridiculous because of that.\n\nSkip this one.", "timestamp_created": 1534330135, "timestamp_updated": 1543107972, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669376730918884277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54933074": {"recommendationid": "54933074", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999627397", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1567426405}, "language": "english", "review": "Your better off playing just the first one this one is bland and shit, constant zombies spawning on top of you is not fun.", "timestamp_created": 1567426488, "timestamp_updated": 1567426488, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666976273059844971", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26327966": {"recommendationid": "26327966", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989380471", "num_games_owned": 3591, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 3199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3108, "last_played": 1477876131}, "language": "english", "review": "With the latest patch, that fixes a game breaking bug that stopped me from playing, I feel obliged to change my review.

Previous game felt twice as long with much better writing.\n- Zombies that throw weapons at you with aimbot is broken af as it instakills the player every single time.\n-Almost all of the Boss battles in the game are garbage and revolve around chipping away at a large slow moving enemies health, while they flail around.\n- Fall damage in this game is terrible and you cant fall more than 2 metres without dying.\n- The Ending is so bad and is never explained. I hope they make this game non canon as the cliffhanger is just so low effort and the series has no proper ending to what this story leads into.\n-Copy paste environments everywhere. So many interiors share the same layout. It totally ruins immersion and gives the sense that the devs half arsed a lot of the map making.\n- Most of the guns in this game literally use the same asset from Dying Light 1. I'm not sure why this was done as it does not help the game and ends up advertising a much better zombie game!\n- Inability to change FOV (No slider!)\n- Screamer zombies are terrible as they remove the ability to use weapons for 5- 10 seconds and run away from the player.\n- So many bugs, I will only list the ones I encountered the most:\n[i]1) Enemy spawning outside the map\n2) Getting stuck in the terrain and not being able to escape without suiciding.\n3) Inability to revive coop teammates\n4) Vehicles getting stuck in the terrain[/i]\n-Zombies models being reused and no variation on special infected models\n- Bad lip syncing during cutscenes\n- Hold out scenarios during the story felt far too long at times and just kept spawning in identical enemies from the same areas. \n- Far too much backtracking during quests, especially in the first map/ section of the game.\n- Side quests don't have much variation besides Fetch quests, clear infested zones and saving the odd survivor from about 5 zombies. \n\n[h1]In Conclusion:[/h1]\nUltimately this game feels like a downgrade from the original and brings far more bugs, a shorter story, no bonus modes (like Bloodbath arena for the first game) and no way to return to the open world after beating the game besides starting new game plus. If you missed collectibles or side quests in Henderson, youll have to play the miserable story again just to reach the area.\nI feel like this is less of a sequel and more of a cheesy standalone expansion. If you have finished the first Dead Island and want a proper progression from that game, I recommend Dying Light 1. Although it isnt as arcadey, It is better in almost every aspect than both Dead Island 1 and Dead Island: Riptide.\nAs a result I wouldn't recommend this game, even in coop, as the more players, the higher the chance of bugs.\n\n[b][u]Overall Rating: 4/10[/u][/b]\n\nThanks for Reading and check out my other [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/JA3G3R/recommended/][u]reviews![/u][/url]\n[i]- Kyle[/i]\n[i]Written in collaboration with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198174226161][u]JakeyTurkey[/u][/url] (My coop partner)[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1665895533, "timestamp_updated": 1665895760, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606446027755737305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86393757": {"recommendationid": "86393757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131189128", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 555, "last_played": 1613043047}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly after playing the first one when I was a kid, I really thought the next one was gonna be really good. But after I came back to this game and revisited Riptide, I really found out how bad everything in this entire game is. There's zombies that can just insta kill you by throwing a knife at you, which is completely unavoidable, there's the fact that every zombie respawns when you leave the area, including any screamers or rams you previously killed, there's the fact that these characters can maybe swing there weapons 4 or 5 times before they're just standing there out of breath, and you get knocked to the floor, there's the durability on weapons, which after killing maybe 15 zombies, the weapon is no longer usable, you can get hit while going into cutscenes, get killed in cutscenes, or have zombies walking around in them. Also, most of the zombies they added into this game that weren't in the first one, is some of the worst content they could've possibly added. The screamer makes it to where your character just stands there for 5 seconds, letting all the zombies swarm around you and hit you while they're just holding their head, there's the dude with knives for arms, which looks cool, but is just some dude on crack who hits you enough times to use a medkit everytime you go to attack him, there's the horrible L4D boomer ripoff, which tanks hits, and throws up in a 360 degree radius, there's the wrestler, which is a horrible L4D2 charger ripoff, which is like the tank and the charger together, except completely useless, and there's also named zombies, which are purple skulls, which are usually several levels higher than you, and almost instantly killing you, (and NPC's). Also, there's almost nothing to spend your money on in this game, as none of the vendors sell anything useful. You find more useful gear on someone's lockbox in the middle of their bedroom. (Excluding the items given to you after a completed quest, those are usually good weapons.) Also, most of the story plots, could've been solved if anyone had some common sense in the entire game. We are out here trying to survive a zombie apocalypse, not make best pals and play patty cake in the California sun after it all blows over. The entire time I was just waiting for the game to end. I bought this game for me and a friend to play, but after about 20% in, he said the combat, story, and enemies were all so bad, he would never play it again. The achievement for beating this game is about 17%. and i'm not even surprised. Don't even get me started on the missions where you have to set up barricades, and defend against 4-5 waves of the zombie horde, and while you're doing all this, you need to defend the NPC's against zombies that have grabbed them, because they can't just push them off. If you're playing this game solo, every single NPC will have a zombie on them, that you have to get off, or you will fail the mission. Horrible story, horrible plot, horrible enemies, horrible game. I hate to say it since I enjoyed the first one a lot, but they really dropped the ball on this one, and judging by the 17% of people that have actually just finished the story, it looks like i'm not the only one who thinks like that.", "timestamp_created": 1613044016, "timestamp_updated": 1613044016, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605569183826446533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118709287": {"recommendationid": "118709287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391216997", "num_games_owned": 450, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1709387212}, "language": "english", "review": "fun, story is garbage though.", "timestamp_created": 1657653049, "timestamp_updated": 1657653049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604899406433105469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "155647364": {"recommendationid": "155647364", "author": {"steamid": "76561199508046124", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 3895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2360, "last_played": 1710778784}, "language": "english", "review": "As a fan of the original Dead Island game, I was eagerly anticipating the release of Dead Island Riptide. And I have to say, it did not disappoint. This expansion is a perfect follow-up to the first game, continuing the story of the survivors and adding new elements that keep the game feeling fresh and exciting.\n\nOne of the first things that struck me about Dead Island Riptide was the improvements in graphics and gameplay. The graphics are even more stunning than the first game, with vibrant and detailed environments that really immerse you in the zombie-infested island. The gameplay also feels smoother and more polished, making combat and movement feel more fluid and natural.\n\nBut what sets Dead Island Riptide apart from the first game is the new island of Palanai. This new location adds a whole new dimension to the game, with different landscapes, dangerous new enemies, and interesting side quests to discover. Exploring this new island is an adventure in itself and adds even more hours of gameplay to an already lengthy game.\n\nThe characters from the original game also make a return in Riptide, and their stories continue to evolve in interesting and unexpected ways. It was great to see how they have grown and changed since the events of the first game, and also to meet new characters who bring their own unique flavor to the group dynamic.\n\nOne of the things that made the original Dead Island so popular was its open-world, RPG-style gameplay. And this aspect is still present and well-executed in Riptide. The game gives you the freedom to explore, make choices, and improve your character's skills and weapons, making each playthrough a unique and personal experience.\n\nOf course, a game like Dead Island Riptide wouldn't be complete without its signature, gory combat. And once again, the game delivers on this front. The variety of weapons available, from the classic machete to electrified axes, makes for some truly satisfying zombie-slaying action. And the addition of new special infected, like the Screamer and the Boomer, adds new challenges and strategies to the gameplay.\n\nOverall, Dead Island Riptide is a solid expansion to an already legendary game. It does an excellent job of building upon the foundation of the first game, while also bringing fresh and exciting elements to the table. Whether you are a fan of the original or new to the Dead Island series, this game is a must-play for any zombie game enthusiast.", "timestamp_created": 1704833866, "timestamp_updated": 1704833866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60486447811126709", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 2257, "total_negative": 1069, "total_reviews": 3326}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwYYanW9/d0E": "Mon Apr 22 23:41:06 2024"}}
