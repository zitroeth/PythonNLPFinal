This game is incredible. Even with it's clunky UI (made much better with mod support) and terrible multiplayer support, I've never been so engrossed in an open world survival game. This truly is inspiring to every indie studio out there on what true vision for a game can get you.\n\nHowever.\n\nValheim has sold over 12 million copies at the time of this review.\n\nLet's assume they sold those at an average of $15 each.\n\nThat's about $180,000,000.\n\nLet's also assume that Valve and Coffee Stain (the publisher) take roughly half.\n\nThat still leaves them with $90 million dollars. (I understand this is complete conjecture and not all substantiated but I'm upset so let me do this)\n\n$90,000,000 for a team of somewhere between 11-50 employees according to their linkedin page is an unimaginable number. Reminder that they also started with 5 employees.\n\nI'm left here wondering... where did all that money go? Because the game is obviously not finished. There are so many things left incomplete and broken. I can't tell you how many times I've restarted this game only to find that there is still the same amount of content and fixes that there was a year ago. Even their new \"updates\" come out broken and unplayable. I've resorted to playing the game with the many many mods available to fix and add to the game where the developers seemingly cannot.\n\nIt is astounding to me how something can be in early access for so long and have so little to show for it.\n\nSo please, Iron Gate, after you've had your well deserved post release break, I would expect at least some marginal progress towards a 1.0 launch.\n\nThanks for no micro transactions though.", "timestamp_created": 1709857115, "timestamp_updated": 1711479559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 477, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.934624254703521729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159269111": {"recommendationid": "159269111", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961116735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 20810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20810, "last_played": 1706817913}, "language": "english", "review": "I think I\u2019ve been so engrossed with Valheim and its development over the last three years that I\u2019d forgotten to write a review to comprise my thoughts on just how good this game is.

For starters, the procedurally generated lo-fi purgatory, inspired by Norse mythology, is beautifully rendered. From dense forests to snow-topped mountains, you have a plethora of biomes to explore. The landscapes offer a sense of discovery and danger, where players start as humble Vikings tasked with gathering resources, crafting tools and constructing shelters to survive the harsh wilderness. Fast forward hours and hours, you\u2019ll be delving deep into home raids, magic encounters and ancient relics. \n\nI love the sense of progression through biomes and technology, the ability to pickup and sail wherever the wind may take you, and naturally getting yourself into all sorts of trouble, whether it be a lone journey or a camaraderie-fuelled experience. Hitting over three hundred hours on this game has been effortless, and had it not been for me playing a variety of games routinely, I\u2019d easily sink [i]thousands[/i] into this.

I played through it up to the end of the current content with two friends of mine, and we created a good number of memories doing so. We've agreed to come back for the next major update, having ended on a rather good note.\n\nOf the things I like about the game, I'm rather impressed with the scale of the world and the variety of encounters to be found. The procedural generation of lands and dungeons lends itself well to emergent experiences, and while there were some disappointments to be had as a result of the system, the successes are left echoing in my mind far stronger than the failures. Some high points specifically were complex adventures to retrieve lost items which forced innovative or just desperate strategies, The current last boss is by far and away the best of the selection in the game, with varied threats yet appropriate measures to combat them. Interesting gear with special effects near the end was a delight to discover. Some enemies are absolutely terrifying and a thrill to encounter.\n\nThere are a few things I can criticize. The number of items to be discovered is somewhat low, and the realistic amount of solid \"content\" to be found is on the low side. This leads into by far my biggest sense of distaste for the game: the grind. To be perfectly honest, the amount of engagement to be found in Valheim is likely in the 20-30 hour range, but it's stretched to far longer by the level of material grind required at sections of the game, and most of our sessions were centered around resolving this. The fast travel system, a series of interconnected portals built and linked by the player, is a good one, but prohibits transportation of many materials - primarily metal - that are required to progress the game. This means the game's exceptionally lengthy sailing times are necessary not just for exploration, but the repeated shipping of materials for processing. Combined with an inane level of these materials - especially iron - required, the length of the game is artificially inflated as much as 5 times, and is the only real reason my hours are left above 100 at the end of the playthrough.\n\nLargely for this reason, I would [i]never[/i] play Valheim alone. Were I not alongside friends to elevate the experience, this time sink would have left such a sour taste in my mouth that the game would never have been able to redeem itself in my mind.\n\nI leave Valheim, for the time being, with a positive impression, yet the dangerously low amount of engaging content sets a tone that prevents me from really calling it \"great\".", "timestamp_created": 1708688867, "timestamp_updated": 1708689040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723181068897247314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160160413": {"recommendationid": "160160413", "author": {"steamid": "76561199038855928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 23640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23640, "last_played": 1702944253}, "language": "english", "review": "I had no idea about anything about this game when I first started.

The only reason I give it a thumbs down is because I don't believe the overall rating should be this high.\n\nIn order for me to give this game a thumbs up, the game developers really needs to address and change some basic issues and mechanics.\n\n- They need to drastically increase the number of item slots of your character and stack sizes. The game is almost unplayable without mods such as \"Equipment and Quick Slots\". This NEEDS to be part of the vanilla game and expanded on.\n\n- The game becomes a logistical nightmare. Larger storage boxes and other storage solutions should be implemented. Add a label and sign function to the storage boxes themselves.\n\n- Stamina is the most annoying aspect of the game. Stamina drains too fast and regenerates way too slow.\nTools, weapons, and bows use too much stamina.\n\n- Food does not last long enough. The benefits that food provides should not deplete at the rate it currently does. Needs to be doubled at least.\n\n- Discovery radius on boats needs to be increased by about 3x or a dynamic fog of war implemented.\n\n- A vaulting or climbing mechanic needs to be added.

Go to a biome, make what you're expected to make there, and then go to the next.\r\n\r\n2) It's easy to manipulate the mechanics. It's more effective to build unrealistic designs than realistic ones. I can keep things out with ditches and earthen ramparts which they can't climb or destroy, then build a platform extending out over the enemy, like an Olympic diving platform, rather than building realistic walls to defend.\r\n\r\n3) Here's the big one: I feel lonely when I play it. As far as I can tell there are no other humans in the game. No villagers. It feels like I'm doing everything for myself alone with no one to appreciate or benefit from it, even if they're just NPCs.\r\n\r\nIt's fun at first to build things, but very quickly it starts to feel a bit like there's no purpose to any of it. Moving to new bases all the time just adds to that feeling like I haven't really accomplished anything other than advancing to the next level. I would prefer to build a village with NPCs in it and watch it grow and become more interesting, prosperous, efficient, etc.\r\n\r\nMaybe just me, though. A lot of people love the game and it has interesting artwork (from a distance). I like designing buildings and then sitting and watching the sunset, but after a furious few hours of building I start to wonder what it all was for. I don't like having to repair every building piece. I don't like the unrealistic way things assault your base, nor the unrealistic strategies most effective for defending them.

The homesteading aspect is really cool and addicting and the combat has real potential but the lack of quality of life and other things is really infuriating so I can't give it a yes.\r\n\r\nthere's a lot that i love about this game, conceptually it's so fun but in execution it needs a lot of work - and seeing as I am not that far into the game and its still being updated, I'm afraid to wonder if the devs are just piling on content to appeal to people and forgetting about the current issues.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna list some things that I have an issue with, there's a lot more too it but I haven't given it all that much thought and this is just been about the past day or so.\r\n\r\n- enemies will stay by your grave. makes for a really unfun trip back which might turn into more trips back as you die again, Dev's advice is to make sure you have backup equipment which is shitty, maybe clear enemies around a grave or give ethereal state where you cannot be harmed but cannot interact with anything but the grave instead of putting the issue on the player\r\n\r\n- slight elevation difference between you and the opponent? you can't hit the enemy but they can hit you\r\n\r\n- forced 3rd person camera and yet the interior locations are claustrophobic. in a narrow burial chamber corridor and you can barely see past your own character to see the three skeletons slicing you up.\r\n\r\n-forced 3rd person camera but the foliage between your character and the camera stays visible so you can't see shit when running through the Firs and a troll is thunder stomping your noggin.\r\n\r\n- enemies spawning in a boss fight? all tension and immersion is ripped away when you've got gaydwarves throwin rocks at ya, I was actually having fun with The Elder and then alla sudden I'm playing kissy chase with the peashooters from PvZ\r\n\r\n- not a fan of the weather changing in a boss fight. if it turns night? sure that's my problem, shoulda got that rested bonus, but the gaydwarves showing up and then it raining immediately after just took all the joy out of it for me\r\n\r\n- unintuitive attack animations on animals. can never tell when a boar or a wolf is about to attack me, which is only an issue as a newer player trying to figure out how to parry one but there's very little room to experiment on higher threat animals like a wolf\r\n\r\n- speaking of wolves???? maybe i'm skippin too far ahead but the balancing is way out of wack. tier 3 troll armour and a tier 3 copper shield with perfect parries and i still get two shot. and then I'm readin the same online about people dyin super quick to wolves with full iron? they run faster than you, they do too much damage and they can traverse sloped ground perfectly where I cannot and require stamina to sprint to maintain the same elevation so i can actually hit them.\r\n\r\n- following up on the previous, I went to the mountains because the first thing that I got from the swamp was an ingredient for \"frost resistance mead\", if I'm supposed to be in the swamp as the third region (draugrs  don't two shot me, I know where I'm supposed to be now) then maybe don't have the frost resistance as the very first thing you can get your hands on, it's super misleading and makes the player think \"oh i am ready to face the mountains\" (I was not). put the ingredient for it in a dungeon, like the surtling cores. The surtling cores at the end of a dungeon is proper pacing done right.\r\n\r\n- areas should be graded by difficulty. putting the mountain region in the black forest when it's clearly not the follow up location too the black forest is really misleading. I can imagine that'd take too much work to put it elsewhere but maybe have a star grading system that shows up when you enter a region.\r\n\r\n- lack of direction. bird man and runestones can only tell you so much, and putting vital information such as how to pen and tame a boar in a creative writing majors dissertation feels like a cheap cop out of an actual explanation. some people like hints and objectives, some people don't, but putting it entirely to riddle and exploration is a narrow demographic. i'll pull up the wiki if i have too, but that takes out a lot of the fun.", "timestamp_created": 1710417893, "timestamp_updated": 1710417893, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587058484554290771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158965938": {"recommendationid": "158965938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098214973", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 21016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20320, "last_played": 1709319867}, "language": "english", "review": "We started a second run of Valheim now after not having played since they put out the food patch.

You don't need any 4k texture mods or anything to see that.\n    - Base building is actually useful and a necessary thing to do in order to advance through the game. The vanilla game already has tons of variety in base building that allows you to spend many hours building.\n    - Tons of mods that can help fix some of the quality of life issues in-game.\n\nCons: TLDR - boring, linear combat. Long grind times to craft/upgrade equipment. Limited variety of equipment with an obvious best choice for each enemy type.\n\n    - After the first boss, the game becomes an absolute grind. You need to collect a ridiculous amount of raw materials in order to craft, then upgrade new weapons. This gets even worse after the second boss.\n    - For a game with somewhat soulslike combat, the combat is very unrewarding. Parrying is very easy, and as a solo player, parrying then attacking is essentially the entire name of the game.\n    - You can dodge in combat, but there's little to no benefit of doing so. You use about as much stamina as a parry would and don't get the benefit of staggering your enemy and getting a damage boost for a few seconds.\n    - Stamina feels like an absolute chore in this game. Your stamina is VERY limited unless you gather/cook and eat certain types of food to boost it. However, even with good food \"equipped\" (3 food slots, hp/staming boost, can only eat one of a food item until it wears out), running out of stamina doesn't feel like a tactical decision/blunder. Unlike other souls-likes, it just feels like an artificial block, especially so against the large mob enemies (troll, abomination). Battling them essentially is: parry, strike x3, parry, strike x3, run out of stamina? Abuse the enemies' poor pathfinding and walk around obstacles trying to regain stamina so you can parry, strike x3 again. To be fair, this gameplay mechanic would be less annoying when playing coop. However, as a solo player, it is devastatingly painful. You can eventually craft stamina recovery potions, but that doesn't change the fact that stamina is so annoying.\n    - There is no weapon choice variety in this game. There's three types of non-status damage: pierce, blunt, slash. Pierce are spears/arrows, blunt is for clubs/maces, slash is for swords/axes. Enemies have resistance against certain damage types, so you need to bring all the different damage types to fight against them. However, that's about as complicated as it gets. Bring a blunt type against skeletons/blobs. Bring a pierce type against trolls. Two-handed weapons exist, but are not very useful as a solo player except for AoE attacks. Bows and arrows are essentially useless in solo gameplay except to hunt.\n    - Armor variety is nonexistant too. There's either full heavy armor that slows you down, or lighter armor (troll, vine) that protects against certain status effects, or gives a bonus to a certain skill. For context though, by the time you fight the third boss (and that's going to be after dozens of hours of gameplay), there's only three different armor sets to choose from. For different encounters, there's a very obvious and clear choice of which armor to equip.\n    - Boss design, while initially interesting, becomes very boring. They're not very interesting gameplay-wise. The first boss, Eikthyr has a somewhat interesting mix of parry-able attacks, charge attacks that need to be dodged, and AoE attacks. Second boss, Elder, is slightly less interesting. Summon normal enemies, summon static enemies, ranged attack, parry-able attack. Third boss, Bonemass, I found to be absolutely bland. Parry-able attack, summon normal enemies attack, AoE poison attack. That's it. Just a bigger HP tank that has both close-up and ranged atacks and can summon other enemies. A very obvious choice of armor to protect against poison status effect. This unrewarding fight after a very long grind for equipment was what made me quit.\n    - Lack of vanilla farming. Yes there's mods that you can and I did use to plant and farm berries, but the vanilla version does not. What's the point of spending all this time building up a base if you still have to go on time-consuming scavenging runs for berries (used in stamina-boost foods)? Yes, you can farm some foods like carrots, but many crafting recipes call for consumables that must be scavenged.", "timestamp_created": 1708050366, "timestamp_updated": 1712394118, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558374643325805664", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162185905": {"recommendationid": "162185905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071599369", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 6450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1099, "playtime_at_review": 4179, "last_played": 1713799022}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good game", "timestamp_created": 1712237967, "timestamp_updated": 1712237967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.55638653039932251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160270516": {"recommendationid": "160270516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009565130", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16171, "last_played": 1703600794}, "language": "english", "review": "The games whilst fun and has some very well executed gimmicks just absolutely lacks in content.

I hope maybe with a future update it will change, or you unlock a not so misty version when you slay the boss for this area or something. \n\nAnyways, its a great game and i always recommend it to all my friends.", "timestamp_created": 1706986912, "timestamp_updated": 1706986912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157798034": {"recommendationid": "157798034", "author": {"steamid": "76561199033194965", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12871, "last_played": 1707527543}, "language": "english", "review": "Dev team losing there shit with the mistlands biome,  wow such a good experience.", "timestamp_created": 1707330917, "timestamp_updated": 1707330917, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545076131820678711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157235106": {"recommendationid": "157235106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835693231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 9736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9736, "last_played": 1706670788}, "language": "english", "review": "Whilst I adore the aesthetics of the game as well as the bosses, exploration, and freedom it allows.. I severely dislike quite a few things about this game and some things I absolutely despise. Also, to be honest, building is my favorite thing to do in games and its mainly the genre I like the most so the review is going to be more oriented towards that point of view.\n\n[My Opinion on things I enjoyed, not much to say since I'm sure everyone will have a very pleasant experience with this (: ]\n\nChallenging bosses and reshaping the terrain to suit your needs is so beyond enjoyable. I also loved exploring new areas, finding new mobs, and new crafting recipes which gave a serious sense of progression and development.\nAs well as building a base to suit your needs and developing it over the course of time as you obtain new production blocks and such gives pleasant memories to look back upon if you happen to take as many screenshots going through the game as I do!\n\n[My opinion on the weapons]\nThere are tons of weapons and a large variety to choose from which I absolutely love! I think for the most part everyone enjoys them a lot but..\n\nFirstly, who tf uses a spear like a kitchen knife in the hands of an unruly child? Why would you hold it mid shaft and stab only downwards with it?? Its attack pattern should genuinely be a thrust giving you more range than a small stick since some weapons do that when they shouldn't (Like an axe that doesn't even have a poke bit!)\nThe only thing I can think of is that the devs thought getting extra melee range was too strong so they intentionally prevented you from using the weapon correctly.. and I truly hate it. I don't use spears in this game.\n\nI'll just say this right now, two handed weapons are completely useless to the point its not even funny. With how much stamina cost and time to attack they have, I feel like they should be doing at least 50% more damage than their one handed counterparts. 50% just to make them somewhat competitive. Because two handed weapons take like 3 times the time to swing and use substantially more stamina but only get a measly 5 to 10 extra damage.. like, huh..? Who would ever use them for anything other than gloating rights or fashion? For most enemies, you attack so slowly they see the attack coming from YESTERDAY and casually walk out of range long before you even take a swing. I also do not use two handed weapons.\n\n[My opinions on Terrain Manipulation]\n\nBut the things I absolutely hate the most is the building and terrain manipulation. It's arguably one of the worst systems I have ever seen and the 3 years I've waited they hadn't improved it even remotely in the slightest and it genuinely pisses me off.\n\nNot only am I incapable of shaping the terrain to my liking but it will with out a doubt be disfigured and uneven. Not only in elevation but also length and width wise as well. If I want to create a square piece of raised ground and build a wall around it, it will not happen even remotely in the slightest because what I make after hours of literally fighting the terrain will at best be a completely disfigured blob mound.\n\nThere is also the slight issue where when your cursor is too far away or too close then the game just affects the ground directly beneath you making it extraordinarily frustrating when trying to raise up an area.\n\n[My opinion on Building]\n\nNext major issue is the actual building of walls, floors, and roofs. It never ceases to amaze me how your character is completely incapable of building underneath a floor. If I want a pillar to connect the floor to the ground and the gap is small enough to where my character can't physically fit under it then it WILL NOT HAPPEN.\n\nIt's such a simple adjustment the devs could have implemented day one to reduce the amount of struggle I had to endure with building a slightly raised house but considering it's such a simple issue that hasn't been fixed after 3 years I truly think they're never going to improve the building in the slightest.\n\nYou also often come across inconsistencies and misalignment while trying to build anything other than a square box, but so long as you don't care and manually fill in the gaps it'll be relatively fine despite being slightly annoying if you're a perfectionist like me and need everything even.\n\nI rate whether or not a building system is good based off of whether the tools I have at my disposal will allow me to create what I want and based off my dozens of hours of genuinely trying to build in this game I can say without a shadow of a doubt its a complete failure of a system. I never once thought that what I had made was what I wanted and never once was happy with the outcome. Even after dozens of tutorials, trials, and errors.\n\nI basically just ignored it as much as I could and built only very simple structures because that is the only thing I will be happy with. So yeah, I honestly spent way to much time on trying to get things to be even remotely functional for me to honestly enjoy any of these building systems.\n\n[What would improve the experience]\nHonestly, if you had the farm tools visual effect be a hard cap to where its at and use mouse wheel to change the elevation of where you would build up to or flatten it would make it a lot easier and the mouse would point to what position the farm tool would bring the terrain to.. within reason of course since you won't be able to completely remove terrain like a pickaxe.\n\nAnd another idea is to have a highlight that shows where to raise, flatten, or remove terrain in order to make it actually flat. That would help immensely.\n\n[How I played the game]\nWhen I initially played was at the start when the game was a true grindfest. I often would create worlds with specific seeds just to mine the materials nearby or use worlds to transport items through portals because it truly truly took way to long for my liking. And with that strategy, I beat the bosses in about 110 hours although I did build a big base,\n\nThen recently I came back to the game and used Valheim+ mod which made the game far more enjoyable for me to play and I cleared out the bosses in about 40 hours and also had a big base.\n\n[My final thoughts]\nWhilst the game is very fun at times, a lot of the time its just very frustrating and I don't recommend it for most people. Some will definitely enjoy it but for people like myself I definitely do not.\n\nI could also go on about how absolutely abysmal the games progress at development is in regards to adding new features and content, I don't actually mind as much since what I truly want is for them to improve the already existing experience because the game has a lot of potential and could be even more fun without all the hindrances.\nBut I definitely have to make a note and mention about how much money they made to the level of progress that actually happened over the years because it isn't very pleasing. I really hoped they would ramp up updates over time but it did not and will probably never happen.", "timestamp_created": 1706675289, "timestamp_updated": 1706675289, "voted_up": false, "votes_up":

If we were to base the score just on the details and design of the game, then we are looking at a 9/10 game. However, there are so many tediously annoying and lacking elements that I cannot recommend this game to any average player. \n\nThere are 4 quarters of your time in this game:\n1 quarter is preparing food, cutting wood, and building your base.\n1 quarter is exploring, finding the mines, material, and bosses.\n1 quarter is mining metals constantly due to the large amount of material you need.\n1 quarter is continuously running back and forth from home to your grave because you just can't stay alive.\n\nThe game has a serious issue with purposely making your experience a drag and longer when it doesn't need to be that way.\n\nYou spend so much time trying to get to places because your stamina is so draining and slow to re-gen. You can level up to help with stamina, but when you die, you lose your progress in a negative way. Majority of the deaths you experience in this game is due to stamina being out. \n\nList of tedious things in the game that need fixing:\nStamina re-gen (possibly add stamina re-gen to armor and increase it as gear gets better)\nVertical attacking is not a thing so enemies can hit while you can't hit them if they are a little above or below you.\nMistlands is a terrible region which exemplifies all the bad things in the game.\nEating food doesn't immediately increase your health even when you are rested. This may be because the developers want you to utilize potions which are time consuming to make and cost a lot in material.\nMobs constantly attack your base wasting your time even more because now you have shift your focus.\nMany of the boss abilities are lackluster and horrible to which you usually only use a mix of three boss abilities.\nSkills basically mean little to nothing in this game because you don't feel them. They are there, but the level up reward is minimal and non-explanatory. \n...

Didn't see it as all that impressive, but I could see it's potential in the Terraria-like progression. Held off on playing too much of the game but kept an eye on the updates since I would rather wait until it was actually done. Would often forget about the game for a year at a time, then check it out for anything new.\n\nSo... What's happened in three years? Not much. In the last three years, there have been three \"big\" updates. One update was a new biome, making seven total. One update added a handful of dungeons and an NPC. Then another update added more base building pieces. That's it. \n\nWhere on earth did all the millions and millions of dollars go? Clearly it hasn't been put back into the game to do something like expand the team or scope, speed up the updates, or anything. \n\nI've seen so many people say things like \"they're an indie dev\" or \"it's $20\" or \"they don't owe you anything\". Like... okay...? This small indie dev has (tens of) millions of dollars to work with now, so what's with these snail paced and snail sized updates? And, yes, I feel like I am owed something. I paid money for a game expecting it to be finished in a timely manner, especially considering the huge success of the game. \n\nAnd apparently, reading their little early access explanation, they say there will be \"at least\" another year until they're done (2025), which does NOT seem realistic considering how they've been dragging their heels to put out three updates in three years. There's still two more biomes to release plus \"smaller updates\". \n\nI think this was the first ever early access game I bought, which explains my stance towards them now. That is, I don't buy early access games. Anyway, rant-review over.

Each biome not only challenges your survival skills but also rewards exploration and resourcefulness. The environmental details are stunning, making every in-game sunrise and storm an event to behold.\r\n\r\nCo-op Gameplay: Where Teamwork Truly Shines\r\nThe co-op aspect of Valheim is where the game truly excels. Teaming up with friends to build, craft, and explore brings about a sense of camaraderie that many games aspire to but few achieve. Whether you're constructing a fortress together or strategizing to take down one of the formidable bosses, there\u2019s a shared sense of achievement and joy that is amplified in the company of others.\r\n\r\nCrafting and Building: A Rewarding Endeavor\r\nValheim offers an intricate crafting and building system that encourages creativity and strategic planning. Constructing everything from simple shelters to complex longhouses with your fellow Vikings is incredibly rewarding. The physics-based building system adds a layer of complexity and realism that requires you to think like a true Norse builder.\r\n\r\nCombat: Thrilling and Tactical\r\nThe combat system in Valheim is straightforward yet deep, with a focus on stamina management and tactical positioning. Fighting alongside your friends against the various creatures and bosses requires teamwork and can lead to intense and thrilling moments. The sense of danger is ever-present, making each victory a moment of triumph.\r\n\r\nContinuous Updates and Engaged Developers\r\nOne of the most appealing aspects of Valheim is the active involvement of its developers. Regular updates not only introduce new content and features but also refine existing mechanics. This engagement keeps the game fresh and exciting, making each return to the world a new adventure.\r\n\r\nIn Conclusion: A Must-Play for Any Co-op Enthusiast\r\nValheim is not just a game; it's a journey. It's about building bonds with your fellow players as much as it\u2019s about building your base. The satisfaction of surviving and thriving in a world teeming with challenges and beauty is unmatched. For anyone who revels in co-op gameplay and Norse mythology, Valheim offers an epic saga that only gets better with time.\r\n\r\nSo, to my fellow gamers, grab your shields and join the voyage across Valheim's vast realms.

If you ever thought minecraft was unfair at some points as any sane person would you should stay very far away from this game. luckily dev let us manage settings such as; material gain 1x 2x etc. ores portable via portals, to make it playable in low numbers and for people with shallow dopamine reserves. \n\nthe combat is very clunky and not fun to me. \n\nthe optimization is surprisingly bad...\n\nthere are bugs as expected but they were not many in my experience. It should still be pointed as the game is punishing, what small bugs there is, is a big problem.\n\nthe building mechanics are unintuitive and buggy at times. comfort levels are not enjoyable to me. the requirement to build most stuff adjacent to most others is also very annoying. the giants and what not that can ruin your home is not enjoyable. so there are many problems with this game and to be frank I am sure it outweighs the pros but I still think the game is not that bad. when I played the game my friends left the game soon after and I started to play solo for a while and then I left it till I started playing with another friend. when I finally started to mine iron I realized how much of a grind fest this game was and I asked myself how long it would take to play this game with 5 people and no portal ore teleport. we would probably spend 100 hours just to get full iron set. That was basically an epiphany that made me very much less into the game. grind is not even rewarding so why would you? Don't get me wrong you do get stronger and you do feel it. but the mechanics are not refined enough to let you enjoy it. so I started building and faced many problems I listed above. Then I quit...\n\nThe ogre design and the first encounter, the search for copper and what-not. there were many things in the game where it was enjoyable. building a fortress-like wall around my house especially adjacent to water was also  very enjoyable to me. to people with the taste for survival the game would NEED to be long and slow to be enjoyable. so I get that this is a me problem. for all

I highly recommend this game for those who like survival adventure games. This is the game we all wished Survival Minecraft was. With bosses, monsters, and biomes that significantly increase in difficulty, this adventure survival game provides a full adventure of objectives to accomplish along with a relaxing creative homebase.\n\nPros:\nIndependent Characters. Your character is independent from the world, so you can travel between worlds with the majority of the items in your pack, armor, and skill levels intact. This means you can have your own private world and visit your friends' worlds and it's always still \"you\", not a new character in each world. You don't start from zero when you travel, and there are little to no downsides to having multiple worlds you visit. It always bothered me when I wanted to join a friend's server that I'd lose my progress whether I wanted to or not. It also doesn't make you dependent on your friend being online to log onto your character in their world, because your character is freeeeee. (You can also create multiple characters if you do want a fresh start.)\n\nSystem of skill increasing, which I've long desired in a game. You use a skill/item to increase your proficiency, rather than a skill-point driven system. The more you run, the faster you run. The more you swing a sword, the better your damage.\n\nHomey. The action can get pretty intense in the advanced biomes, but when you stay in the meadows (first biome) it's very chill. You can spend your days harvesting wood, hunting, stocking stores, and creatively building your home with relative calm. So you can definitely have a relaxing session. </p>\n<p>Random Attacks don't seem like a Pro, but they provide a realistic element and spice to the game. Sometimes monsters come and attack your home. Monsters attack you if they hear you closeby, so if you're mining in the woods, you have to keep your ears open for approaching growls and troll footsteps. Not only is that more realistic than games that have monsters stuck in their spawn points, but it breaks the monotony of mining for hours.\n\nCons:\nGrinding. To get all of the materials you need, there is a lot of grinding. Mind you, I haven't even killed the second boss yet at 30 hours. Albiet, I probably could have tried earlier with less upgraded gear and been fine. Nonetheless, I was enjoying the upgrading and the closest spawn of The Elder is further than I have explored so I definitely wasn't trying to go faster. From what I've read the next big material, iron, is going to be a bleep to get all we need. Still less grinding and not as monotonous as an MMORPG.\n\nThe dark is very dark. Turn up any settings for your displays, change your modes to vivid, close your window shades. It's funny to look back now at the first in-game nights where I was running in total black and getting stuck on trees while being slaughtered by greylings and boars but it was definitely frustrating in the moment.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1710442510, "timestamp_updated": 1713283327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160508925": {"recommendationid": "160508925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319317047", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 12805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11581, "last_played": 1712570568}, "language": "english", "review": "Spawn > Collect Stuff > Die > Respawn > Collect Stuff Again > Kill Mobs > Level Up your Skill > Die anyways, Because you went to the Black Forest and your Friendly Neigbourhood Troll Kicked the living crap out of you with his big \"stick\" > Respawn > Try again > Farm resourses > build a house > Have fun > And Die anyways, Because you cant swim longer then 30 seconds.\r\nGame Good.

faster than a Kiwi scoffing down a pie at a footy match, then Valheim's the go. Right from the jump, it's like you're dropped into the wop-wops, with nothing but your jandals and a keen sense of adventure. And mate, the crafting? It's more satisfying than a Saturday arvo Bunnings snag - you start with nothing and end up building a fortress that'd make the All Blacks proud.\n\nThe creatures you'll run into are more varied than the weather in Wellington. One minute you're squaring off against a troll that's bigger than a Hilux, and the next, you're chasing chickens around like you're back on the farm. It's all good fun.\n\nGraphics wise, it's like they've taken the best bits of Minecraft, chucked in some Norse mythology, and then cranked it up until it's as beautiful as the Bay of Islands on a sunny day. The survival aspect is tough but fair, kinda like a rugby coach who won't let you off easy but knows you've got the goods.\n\nPlaying with your mates is where it's at though. It turns into a full-on DIY SOS episode, with everyone pitching in to build up your base, fend off baddies, and occasionally accidentally burning down someone's hut because you got too excited with a new weapon. Classic.\n\nAll up, Valheim's a beaut game that'll keep you and your crew entertained for yonks. It's like a good Kiwi bach \u2013 not too flashy, but it's got everything you need for a bloody good time. So grab your stubbies and your Speight's, and give it a crack.

Progression felt great and the world was nice to explore and interact with. Carving through every new biome was fantastic and felt very similar to Terraria in that way. \n\nDespite the game being simple graphically, it has the most beautiful boating I\u2019ve ever seen in a game. The way the water moves is just mesmerizing. The art direction allows for the game to look quite beautiful in other areas as well. \n\nComplaints I have with the game all revolve around two mechanics, the stamina and the death system. Stamina takes way too long to regen. It\u2019s fine in the early game, but it\u2019d be really nice if there was a late game item that makes stamina regen triple or something. (maybe introduce it around the Plains Biome) The problem is that everything requires stamina, so I\u2019d be stuck in some fights just walking around waiting for my stamina to regen. That\u2019s not fun. \n\nMy other complaint is with the death system, it\u2019s too punishing. Yeah death should have consequences, but when you get to the mid game dying is waaay too harsh. You lose experience AND your items. This isn\u2019t like Minecraft where experience and new weapons are easy to grind out. In Valheim, losing your gear permanently is game ending since new gear is incredibly hard to make. I would\u2019ve rage quit if I lost my gear. Also because I kept losing exp on death, my levels never went higher than 40. If you can\u2019t reasonably make it to level 100, the level cap should simply be level 50 because you will die, a lot.\n\nDespite all this I had a great time with Valheim and am excited for a final boss to be added eventually.

Since its release, it has distinguished itself with its engaging survival crafting loop, intuitive gathering, and building mechanics that allow players to progress from humble shacks to grand Viking halls. The integration of realistic physics adds a layer of depth and enjoyment to tasks as simple as chopping wood, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.\n\nValheim has an innovative base-building system, combat mechanics, and exploration of its vast, procedurally generated world. The building system allows for both precision and creativity, catering to a wide range of architectural preferences.

This game has turned my living room into a Viking saga filled with hilarity and unexpected tree-related accidents. Let me just say, if I were a Viking, I'd be the one known for building a majestic log cabin... on top of myself.\n\nFirst off, the graphics are so good that even Odin would be jealous. I mean, who wouldn't want to embark on a perilous journey across a beautiful, procedurally generated world filled with stunning landscapes and low-poly deer that just want to boogie?\n\nThe crafting system is so intuitive that I'm convinced my character is secretly a master chef. Forget battling mythical creatures; I'm out here creating culinary masterpieces with the precision of a Michelin-star chef. Move over, Gordon Ramsay, there's a new Viking in the kitchen!\n\nNow, let's talk about the combat system. I've never felt more like a Viking warrior than when I accidentally threw my weapon into the ocean while trying to impress some sea serpents. Who needs weapons anyway? My fists are my truest companions on this wild journey!\n\nBut let's not forget the real star of the show \u2013 wood chopping. I've chopped down more trees than a beaver on a caffeine high, and I've got the deforested landscapes to prove it. If tree-felling was an Olympic sport, I'd be the undisputed champion with my gold medal made from recycled wood.\n\nIn conclusion, Valheim has become the epic saga of my virtual Viking life. From accidental drownings to tree-chopping escapades, every moment is an adventure filled with laughter and unexpected mishaps. So, grab your mead, don your finest loincloth, and join me in the world of Valheim \u2013 where even the most tragic mishaps turn into legendary tales!

Maybe the new building materials.\n\nI'm only 30 hours in the game so far, and at this pace I think I will easily reach 200 before I even finish the progression, and then just build new stuff and explore what I may have missed indefinitely, until I eventually get bored.", "timestamp_created": 1706811980, "timestamp_updated": 1706811980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157311059": {"recommendationid": "157311059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881076449", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1707111436}, "language": "english", "review": "i am viking", "timestamp_created": 1706769690, "timestamp_updated": 1706769690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157310018": {"recommendationid": "157310018", "author": {"steamid": "76561199043617044", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7255, "last_played": 1708770441}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good and fun game.

Released in early 2021, this indie survival game has taken the gaming community by storm, offering a unique blend of exploration, crafting, and intense combat. As a Viking warrior, players find themselves in a procedurally generated purgatorial realm, tasked with defeating powerful bosses and unraveling the secrets of Valheim.\n\nGameplay (9/10):\nValheim's gameplay mechanics strike a perfect balance between challenging survival elements and the freedom to explore a vast, beautifully crafted open world. From gathering resources and crafting tools to building structures and fending off hostile creatures, the game seamlessly weaves these elements together, providing an immersive experience that keeps players engaged for hours on end.\n\nThe highlight of Valheim's gameplay is its cooperative multiplayer feature, allowing up to 10 players to join forces and conquer the Viking afterlife together. The sense of camaraderie as you and your friends build settlements, sail the seas, and face off against towering bosses is truly remarkable.\n\nGraphics and Art Style (8/10):\nValheim adopts a charming low-poly art style that adds to the game's appeal. While the graphics may not boast cutting-edge realism, the visuals are consistent, and the art direction captures the essence of Norse mythology beautifully. The game's atmospheric lighting and weather effects enhance the overall immersion, creating a captivating world that feels both mysterious and inviting.\n\nSound Design (9/10):\nThe game's hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, composed by Patrik Jarlestam, perfectly complements the Nordic setting. From the soft melodies during exploration to the thunderous beats during intense battles, the music enhances the overall atmosphere, making every moment in Valheim memorable. The ambient sounds of nature, wind, and crashing waves also contribute to the game's immersive experience.\n\nExploration and World Building (10/10):\nOne of Valheim's strongest aspects is its procedurally generated world, featuring diverse biomes, each with its own unique challenges and resources. The thrill of exploration is heightened by the discovery of ancient structures, hidden caves, and mystical landmarks. The game rewards players who venture into the unknown, fostering a sense of wonder and curiosity that is rarely found in survival games.\n\nPerformance and Optimization (7/10):\nWhile Valheim generally runs smoothly, some players have reported occasional performance issues and bugs. Iron Gate Studio has been actively addressing these concerns with regular updates, but occasional hiccups may still occur. However, the developer's commitment to improving the game's performance is evident, and future updates are expected to further enhance the overall stability.\n\nConclusion:\nValheim stands as a shining example of the potential within the indie gaming scene. Its captivating blend of survival, exploration, and cooperative gameplay, set against a backdrop of Norse mythology, creates an experience that is both challenging and rewarding. Despite minor performance concerns, the game's constant updates and responsive development team make Valheim a must-play title for fans of the survival genre and those seeking an epic Viking adventure.

Most deaths after the first two biomes entail you having to put on whatever sub-optimal gear you have and make your way back to your corpse, by building another boat and wasting 20 mins traveling or hopefully you had the forethought or chance to have put down portals beforehand.\n\n  Making your way back to your corpse with the sub-optimal gear could likely result in a chain of deaths, as you try avoiding every enemy long enough to get back your gear. Your gear and food is EVERYTHING in this game, as skills mean little in comparison to gear and food which makes for a very strict progression. If you're very unlucky a death could set you back many many hours of progression or more figuratively \"to the stone-age\". I can't stand survival games with death penalties, as it not a survival mechanic, but a rogue-like mechanic for the purpose of artificially extending the perceived play-time.\n\n  I remember my 2nd playthrough I had just finished the snow mountain area (the farthest I have gotten so far) and was scouting a place along the plains for a good spot to put a base when a barely visible deathsquito (a plains enemy) flew over to my boat and one shot me while I was wearing the best gear and ate the best food I could get that was expected of you to bring into the plains your first time. Now, I died off the coast in an area at least 20-30 mins from my set spawn point away with no portal nearby and I wasn't just about to suck it up and grind away another boat and waste 20-30 mins to get back to my corpse where I could just as easily get one-shot by another deathsquito, so I said fu_k this game.\n\n  The devs released an early access game and their strategy of keeping the player-base engaged is to create a playerbase of masochists who don't mind having to waste an hour or two of their day just to reclaim their corpse or who just start over from the previous zone and grind up another set of gear/food. Or mind traveling for 30 mins around a long-winded/pointlessly massive (proc gen world) open world where islands have no relevant purpose if they don't contain the next boss you need to fight. Each world seed is so massive if you zoomed all the way out your player marker would be the size of a tiny ant, so hope you don't mind spending an close to a hour sailing the open seas because the next boss is at the other side of the world and if you have happen to die out at sea all that ways away with no nearby portal I think you're either going to uninstall or suck-it-up. The biggest negative of all is that the devs have barely released anything in 3yrs and are more concerned about shilling their merch shop that's even advertised at the game's main menu.

It certainly isn't the innovative gameplay, which is basically Minecraft but worse.\n\nEver played one of those \"realistic\" Minecraft survival modpacks where the creator just substitutes grinding and tedious micro-management for good design and imaginative gameplay? That's exactly what this game is (even including the stupidly over the top shader effects which are there to disguise 3D models and textures that look like World of Warcraft about 20 years ago. Why is everything blurry in the distance? Am I supposed to be a short-sighted Viking?).\n\nNearly every part of the game is designed with the primary aim of being a timesink, even if it makes no sense at all. Here's one example of many. At the start your extremely limited inventory (welcome to inventory management hell) can carry enough weight of wood to build A WHOLE FKN HOUSE. Then a bit later you discover and mine metal ores. One single copper ore weighs 10. Your total max carry weight is 300. You can't even carry one stack of 30 ores without being completely naked. When you eventually get it back to your base and smelt it (very slowly of course) it now suddenly weighs 12 as an ingot. And then it takes 8 of those and 2 wood (total weight 100) to make a copper knife that weighs 0.3.\n\nWhy this nonsense? Because the game wants to force you to use a cart (pulled manually by you) to transport your ore and ingots over any distance (you also can't take them through portals for the same reason). Just another excuse for a timesink. And talking about metals, only in the Big Book Of Grindy Game Design does 2 copper ingots + 1 tin ingot (weight 36) = 1 bronze ingot (weight 12).\n\nWell maybe the combat is more fun? Nope. It's lifted straight from Minecraft. Shield block + melee weapon or kite around with a bow. The enemies have no intelligence at all and are only a real danger in large groups.\n\nThe overall challenge of this game is equivalent to watching paint dry. Dying of boredom is the only real obstacle to progression.\n\nSo if you like that type of game (and obviously some people do) then this is for you. Otherwise stay well clear, there are many far better survival games (including Minecraft itself) which might not have Vikings but do have a lot more interesting gameplay and fun.\n", "timestamp_created": 1712545020, "timestamp_updated": 1712545020, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523575901985168457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162639474": {"recommendationid": "162639474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239955256", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 38488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38488, "last_played": 1706144529}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm turning my 5 stars into one star because of the lack of updates and content that's been released over the years and after all this money they made its so sad...", "timestamp_created": 1712802626, "timestamp_updated": 1712802682, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523262858390808105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161982967": {"recommendationid": "161982967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030115750", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 5622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5622, "last_played": 1698267299}, "language": "english", "review": "ok disregard the negative review for a second. this game is to me, s class. the game play loops and environments really hit all the buttons, its a little jank at times but being straight up vikings sailing to a new land to become stronger and bring hauls back to our giant hall is really fun, setting up tiny shacks then and grand hall, lastly a dope castle cant beat it. honestly its been a game ive been watching like a hawk desperately awaiting ash lands to hop back in.\n\nthe reason im giving it a bad review is the insane gape between updates. there is no reason ash lands to take this long to release. if they don't drop an absolute megaton of new content in other than new floor design 4 they're misusing their funds.", "timestamp_created": 1712009227, "timestamp_updated": 1712009383, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522380352020263672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160089367": {"recommendationid": "160089367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022006245", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 62599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 62182, "last_played": 1709923168}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Survival game out would recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1709887168, "timestamp_updated": 1709887168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522293031215667725", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159266403": {"recommendationid": "159266403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123900107", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 138, "playtime_at_review": 16502, "last_played": 1713389062}, "language": "english", "review": "best game evah", "timestamp_created": 1708885689, "timestamp_updated": 1708885689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522293031215667725", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160264645": {"recommendationid": "160264645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007203227", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14671, "last_played": 1710022230}, "language": "english", "review": "Seemed OK at first, but...  I have a high end machine (albeit 2 years old) and I was able to run at 1080p with pretty good graphics settings...  but only for a while.  By mid game, when you need to build much larger dwellings to house all the extra crafting stations that are necessary for game progress...  the game no longer functions at the original settings.  As I understand it from some research on the problems, every time you modify a landscape (leveling, building, etc. ) the game maintains all this information about all your modifications in a very inefficient way. Eventually it chokes on all the data.  And I am only doing what the game requires in order to progress...  nothing excessive.   Now maybe 1/2 way through the game,  I must decrease resolution and turn off all graphics options in order to run the game at all, and it looks terrible.  The game has been quite a repetitive grind until now, so I will likely never play the second half of the game.  I am done with it.  My take on this... even if you have a high end machine, this game is so poorly programmed that it is a huge waste of processing power.  Maybe try it if you can get a good deal, but don't expect it to match the enjoyment of a heavily modded Skyrim, or Red Dead Redemption (examples of games I can run just fine on very high settings).

It doesn't make me dread starting a new character or even a new server with buddies. I like that its cross-play, games that are not utilizing that are shooting themselves in the foot, I think. This game has potential for role-playing servers, on top of all out PVP servers, i would love to see a dedicated PVP server with clan v clan style combat. make it so trolls can be tamed and used as sentinels or something crazy.

I actually like some parts of the gameplay, specifically building, but the \"souls like\" inspiration feels half baked at best, because most souls like games have a plethora of complementary mechanics to ensure combat feels dynamic and fair, while still brutal. \n\n In Valheim, or as I call it, \"Watch the Stamina Gauge Fill Simulator\", everything demands stamina: building, running, jumping, attacking, blocking, archery, gardening, etc. But for some reason, instead of making this vital resource replenish fast enough to keep the action going, the devs moved much of its regeneration rate to buffs: food, potions and a rested bonus. Since the stamina gauge starts at a measly 50 points, this means the player will constantly stop what they are doing because big tough viking is tired. While not necessarily something game breaking, it was annoying enough to me that I installed some mods to make it less impactful.\n\n Another turnoff for me were the instakills. Valheim has a knack for killing the player intantly even if they are being careful and planning ahead (looking at you deathsquitoes), due to how some enemy spawns work and the lack of balancing for their attacks and attack patterns in singleplayer mode. The boss Yagluth is a prime example of this: there is almost no time frame between his attacks, all of which deal heinous area and overtime damage, making melee builds impossible to use even with good armor and fire resistance.\n\nThe above problems are further compounded by enemy detection that works via GPS. If the player tries to build, mine, chop wood or is engaging an enemy, others will spawn nearby and \n join the fight, potentially leading to a snowball situation in which the odds are so stacked against them their only options left are to run or die. This happens ALL THE TIME, so something as simple as setting a basic shelter or gathering wood takes way longer than it should. \n\n All in all, I don't dislike Valheim but I wouldnt reccomend it to anyone looking for a fair, balanced game. It can be very engrossing at times with its beautiful visuals and lands to explore, but absolutely infuriating due to poorly designed combat and resource mechanics.

The game lacks quality of life features big time.

For example that it is impossible to hit enemies that are slightly bellow you or higher up than you on the ground, whilst those enemies can hit your big puff sized hitbox from any angle. The spear hits above enemies 50% of the time, causing you to miss your attacks. There is no inventory slot for your gear, so you have to have all your armor in what is already from before a tiny little inventory.\n\nThis in combination with a max carry weight of only 450kg (which is nothing in this game.) You constantly have to throw away items from your inventory when you are out and exploring. If you die in some difficult biome you will sometimes have to use cheat commands to retrieve your gear, because the monsters who killed you stay on your body. Occasionally the game will randomly crash and you will lose a bunch of progress because the world only saves once every 30 minutes, unless you manually press the save button yourself.\n\nInstead of fixing these issues the developers came out with a new biome update (that took 3 years by the way) called mistlands. This biome looks cool and all, but really it is the worst biome in the game because there are tall mountains everywhere, and zero visibility because of the mist. You have to keep in mind that there is a stamina system in the game that severely limits your character in every way. After a little bit of running and jumping you are left with zero stamina, even with the best food and stamina boosting effects.\n\nWhen you have zero stamina you have to wait multiple seconds to recover all your stamina again. In the meantime you can't really do much except walk. The mistlands biome is a severe pain and impossible to traverse without running and jumping because of all the hills and mountains. You run and jump, wait 5 seconds, then run and jump again. Over and over. Then all of the sudden a bunch of high hitting enemies will come out of the mist and practically one shot you, hitting through your shield somehow.\n\nAs I said earlier this game can be quite tedious. At least 50% of my hours in this game is spent on mundane traveling. 30% of my hours are spent on mining rocks that take forever to destroy. Traveling with a boat from one island to another island (depending on your destination) can take around 15 minutes. You sit there on your boat and just look at the screen for those 15 minutes. It's like watching paint dry. But at the very least you can set up portals around the world after you arrive to your destination.\n\nRemember to check the \"travel through portal with ore\" setting in your world modifier, or else you will be in for the most extreme boredom of your life, where you have to manually travel back to your base by foot / boat, which can take half an hour or longer. This is the vanilla setting for whatever reason, that I as a beginner did not immediately realize, which almost made me quit the game completely in the beginning. When the game first was launched this wasn't even a feature, but luckily they fixed that.\n\nThe fun parts of the game consists of exploring the world's different biomes for the first time. You have different dungeons, caves, crypts etc. I have always liked the idea of leveling up your character and becoming stronger. I do like acquiring a new weapon or a armor set, but it just takes way too long. Visually Valheim is very beautiful, the music is amazing, but there are a bunch of problems in this game that are not considered problems, but instead labeled as features. I don't want to have to download third party mods in order to have fun playing Valheim.\n\nThe community consists of a lot of cultists that don't want to acknowledge that there are any problems at all. All valid criticism of the game is brushed off as \"get better\" or \"be more creative.\" The stamina system is considered realistic. Well, is fighting trolls and dragons also realistic? When you create a video game you should incorporate the parts of reality that are fun, and leave out the boring parts, if you want a fun game. Valheim is not a survival game. I don't think it should be treated as such. This is where many game developers fuck up.\n\nI also have a feeling that the developers of Valheim purposefully drag out and artificially extend their game to make up for the lack of content. For example an iron sword costs 20 iron to make, whilst a silver sword costs 40 silver to make, for no reason at all.\nWhich again, it takes forever to acquire those pieces of iron and silver. There are a bunch of weapons that you don't really get to try out unless you want to spend literally hundreds of hours pressing mouse 1 on a rock all day, every day. \n\nI want to see these problems being fixed so that I can post a positive review instead of a negative one. Not that it even matters. I very much like challenging games, but there is a difference between a game that is challenging and a game that is just flat out tedious. I don't think the developers play their own game. Maybe it's just because Valheim is early access, but it doesn't feel like it. Some features that would help: add a skill tree where you can manually level up your stamina or other skills.

I mean, alright, that seems cool, right? Trolls and dwarves and maybe some giants and you get a longboat. The basic mechanics are as they always are: you explore, you eat, you build some sort of base, you fight critters, you tech up and your gear has durability.\r\n\r\nThe exploration is satisfying in the sense there are a lot of biomes, but it falls apart in the sense that you are only ever appropriately teched for one biome. The remainder are either trivial or instantly vaporize you. It also falls apart in that every biome appears to have all of one or two pre-placed structures or perhaps one dungeon type, it's very, very repetitive to go exploring. The dungeons in biomes are also either a single room or a grid of rooms where every room is enemies and/or treasure. No puzzles, traps or anything to spicy it up, not even a variety of room shapes.\r\n\r\nEating is, bizarrely, another thing they screwed up. You do not level up in any sense, instead your latest three foods eaten decide your HP and Stamina. However, you are never at risk of starvation and it is trivial to carry enough food for an arbitrarily long expedition, so mostly it exists to annoy you as A) the HP/Stam bars are constantly ticking down until you can eat again and B) if you die and respawn you're not just out your gear until you pick it up, but literally also your core \"stats.\"\r\n\r\nBase-building is surprisingly janky and inflexible, parts are uninteresting, a lot of shapes that you'd want to use are missing, and there's little reason to want to build an elaborate base. You basically need a one-room shack with crafting stations, and then you build a ditch around or a dirt berm around it since most enemies cannot figure out how to navigate elevation and terraforming is dirt simple. There are occasionally \"raids\" but they're the same enemies you always kill that just show up in a family-sized pack and then that's it.\r\n\r\nFighting seems to be trying to be a bit more complex than most survival crafters, with blocks, dodge rolls, multiple attacks for most weapons, etc. unfortunately enemies are braindead, they either run only straight at you or squirm around in mad circles constantly, cannot path to you correctly, and tiny elevation differences(like a foot of height) prevents you from hitting stuff or vice versa despite weapons literally passing through the target's model.\r\n\r\nTech and durability suffers from there being free repairs for everything so you need a relatively limited amount of each resource and then you are done, with each tech-up being guarded by a big boss that has a completely braindead AI and is trivially defeated by obstacles like: a large rock while you plunk arrows into his head over and over. Not giving the bosses pre-made arenas that guaranteed a functioning experience was a strange idea.\r\n\r\nEven the viking aesthetics are busted. You fight weird dwarves and trolls, sure, but then very quickly it's RPG standbys and weird stuff like giant slimes, stone golems and mega mosquitoes. A giant glowing neon-green booger coming at me really destroys the faint aesthetics the game had going.\r\n\r\nEvery mechanic in Valheim is lacking depth, polish or planning to integrate it into other mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1710722966, "timestamp_updated": 1710722966, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51688307523727417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163190775": {"recommendationid": "163190775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038470919", "num_games_owned": 513, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1713576647}, "language": "english", "review": "How does a game that's meant to look retro perform so poorly?

The devs could have at least consider more natural terrain such as having river valleys that would have carved some navigational terrain into the mistlands biome. \n\nThe largest problem I have with this game, is the 3rd party mods.

The game itself is not finished and is the most unoptimized thing you will ever play. I play the game modded 90% of the time, because you kinda have to. If I add anywhere from 10-100 mods the game is unplayable in multiplayer, and if I go solo for too long I just get bored. So a few things to know before buying...\n\n[h3]Pros[/h3]\n- Boating is super fun\n- Exploring the world is [b]ADDICTIVE[/b]\n- Easy to learn\n- Building is by far the best I have experienced in any survival game\n- The world is massive\n- Kinda feels like souls-like combat, too clunky to really add the tag\n- Gives me old school runescape vibes and I like that\n\n[h3]Cons[/h3]\n- Cannot dig tunnels (only dig down) (I love to build in caves and you cannot)\n- Once you get so far say goodbye to your FPS. The game just breaks, have fun making a castle and living in it with 20fps\n- New update? All mods break (feels like the devs don't care about their community that makes the mods)\n- Multiplayer.... Between the terrible desync and the annoyance of losing fps, just makes you stop playing.\nThey do some instancing crap and limit packets being sent and received. I personally don't know how it fully works, but this game looks like a ps2 game, so you'd think it could be played easy through locally hosted servers. GMOD, Palworld, Project Zomboid, ARK, and Minecraft, all have better multiplayer experiences and no desync even with 150+ ping. So how can this game have it so bad? Once they fix how their networking works I will change my review. \n- Ocean content is missing... Their is no underwater features and only two things in the ocean, Serpent and the big Turtle that you mine the stuff on it's back. You can only swim until your stamina is gone and then you start to die. You cannot dive underwater AT ALL so if an item sinks goodbye.\n- Hud is terrible, everything about it sucks! I used \"Project Auga\" but the dev stopped updating it until the game is at a point where they stop changing stuff. He spends so much time having to recreate it whenever they update. Why can't they add it to the main game? It's the best HUD mod I've seen in any game.\n\nI want to be as honest as possible when I write a review, I love this game and wish I can host a singleplayer world and have fun with friends someday. Right now is not the time. Once they fix the stuff wrong with the game and do QOL updates instead of adding useless content I'll try to play it again. It really does hurt me to not recommend this game to others. I've gotten all the way to the end and have died THOUSANDS OF TIMES, and will always come back to it, just I am tired of the issues that keep getting ignored.\n\n[h3]Message to the Devs[/h3]\nPeople mod your game because they love it and want it to succeed, but there is a big part that charge for their mods and making money off of it, I hate it and don't support it. I support mod devs who put their work out for the community to help improve the game for all, I've even supported quite a few through Patreon. Some work I think you guys should look at and would be cool to work with them in the future.

It has an overall progression arc where you will be in one biome, start off unable to effectively handle it, prepare, fight a boss, advance to the next biome while being unable to effectively handle it, repeat.\n\nLet's get something easy done first off. Valheim has stylized graphics, which I think works in it's favor. I've never been a graphics diehard, but I appreciate what they're able to do in their engine generally speaking.\n\nCombat in valheim falls into 3 styles- Light melee, heavy melee, and bows. \"What about magic?\" Seems to suck and isnt unlocked until the last current biome. Light melee sees less armor but tends to have skill boosts, and in one case, movement boost. It typically uses daggers, which have sneak attack bonuses, and parry shields, which allow for ripostes. Parrying is incredibly easy in this game, amounting to \"start blocking after they start their animation, but before they hit\". There's still some considerations (I.E. an attack can go through your shield's capacity to guard) Heavy melee can be divided into heavy weapons, and heavy shield. Heavy weapons tends to use weapons with special animations and use two hands, where heavy shields use tower shields to become a wall of block that cant parry. Bows are self explanatory, and honestly are soft required to be used by everyone. You will have a much easier time having a ranged attack. Biomes will have common enemies, minibosses, and an area boss only fightable at certain altars you have to search for.\n\nBuilding and crafting are tied to progression. You unlock more stuff and options as you go out to get required materials, which brings you to more dangerous areas which requires more preparations. You will go into the forest to get certain metal, than to the swamp. If Valheim didn't have a good building system, it would not have anything near its popularity. By the end you can have a pretty baller base, and I've never really had complaints about it besides the structure system being a bit finicky at times. Building stuff is what I really play for in the end. However, the bigger you build, the more resource intensive the game will be. When playing on a server with friends, I reduced my particular frame rate from 70+ to 30 around the main base I built. I had a 2070 super at the time-not sure server specs. The base had a number of smaller buildings connected to each other, surrounded by a stone wall, as the game felt base raids were a thing it needed. By and large, base raids are....okay. Once you get higher up it's a lot worse. You will need to spend time and resources on a solid defense of some kind.\n\nProgression in this game is very linear. You start at biome 1, gather equipment to cautiously venture into biome 2, then securely venture into biome 2. Then you'll set out into biome 3, which specifically has element associated with it that has no counter play besides resistance potions. That's how you're gated from getting into it early. Then you'll go to biome 4, which has a specific element associated with it that has no counterplay besides resistance potions or armor from that area. then you'll go into biome 5, which....doesnt have an element associated with it, it'll just wreck your shit if you don't thoroughly respect it. THEN you go into biome 6, which...is like area 5, but worse, and now you need a specific equipment to see. Is this the worst? No, it's just really forced. In addition to all that stuff, with biome 3 and 4, you cant really do anything there until you've defeated the previous area boss anyways.\n\nNow, besides everything I've said, I've still got a lot of hours in the game. It's fun to play with friends! It's not a bad price! So why do I have trouble recommending it?\n\nBecause the developer can't seem to do anything with it. It gets a major update about once a year, and maybe a side update alongside that. People were told \"We're a small studio! it takes time to hire and train!\" and cool, that's understandable. We're 3 years out from release, with an ungodly amount of success, and things haven't picked up. They had a roadmap, then scrapped it. Their original roadmap had 4 updates for 2021, and they released only Hearth and Home, the 1st of the updates, that year. 2022 saw a dungeon added to biome 4 in the first half, the 2nd update, then in Decemeber they released biome 6, the 4th update, with the no mention of the original 3rd update. 2023 saw short questline and 2-3 dungeons. 2024 will see biome 7 \"in the first half of the year\".

Pretty much everything is simple, but hard. This makes things like combat and building annoying at first, but they slowly become the best parts of the game. In addition, exploring any location in this game for the first time is magical. Not to mention, the visual style is breathtaking at some points, and the soundtrack slaps.\n\nIf you like open world games, there is definitely something here for you. Now on to what sucks.\n\nThe game has never had much content, but the fun foundation and mods were enough to keep a lot of people coming back. We are well past the point of absurdity on waiting for a SINGLE biome, though. While biomes can take real life days of consistent playing to get through, the majority of it is just grinding materials. I personally don't find the issue to be with the time spent running around and exploring the massive world. The real issue is that there has been NOTHING released to freshen up this grind. The trend from the devs seems to be that once it's released, it's not thought about again unless it's buggy. This happened between the game's launch and Mistlands, and is happening now as we wait for Ashlands. This is fine in a game with lots of content. However, this is a bare bones open world survival game, and the pathetically small release of Hildir's Quest, and a couple new small, mostly empty structures are the ONLY \"content\" updates we've gotten since Mistlands. In my experience, this makes mods a necessary part of the game for any play-through after your first.\n\nNow to put this on a timeline. For those unfamiliar, Mistlands came out Dec 6, 2022. As of writing this on Apr 16, 2024, it's been about 16.5 MONTHS since the last major content update, and just over 10 months since Hildir (June 2023). While posting about progress and doing these bug fixes (of mostly tiny, many years old bugs) is great, dangling the real new content over our heads for months at a time WITHOUT giving a development timeline or even a release date is irritating. This would be fine from most devs, but it's been almost a year and a half since the gameplay has seen a noteworthy change or addition. That's insanity from a dev team that sold 5 million copies in the first month of their game's release, and over 12 million as of Sep 2023. Instead, the devs did a YouTube mini series that is just about as vague as the patch notes and made a brand deal with a plushie company. This game is approaching an all-time low player count for a reason.\n\nWhile I hate to see this incredible game stagnate, it's been made clear that these devs now care more about trying to stay relevant through media and white truths rather than taking community feedback and making meaningful change to their product. It's gotten to the point where everyone I know that has played Valheim since Mistlands, despite having fun, actively recommends against it, myself included. So while the devs are enjoying their time in Bora Bora, I encourage anyone that's considering buying this game to not do so now. At the very least wait till #ashlands2026\n\nTL;DR- good foundation, but lacks substantial content outside of the grind. devs are taking too long to add to it and neglecting their community in the process. either move on or wait for Ashlands, these people do NOT deserve your money as of right now.", "timestamp_created": 1713279050, "timestamp_updated": 1713283696, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514192700386047363", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158669833": {"recommendationid": "158669833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075253977", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11070, "last_played": 1704456430}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game!

I don't mind a grind or having to run and get your gear, but bro the way they do it here is just not it.\n\nthe money spent ratio vs how much game you get ratio... is waaaaay off for this one\nfarming in a generic base building survival game should not be the main point of it. it needs a easy balance between combat and farming.\nIf I die my progress should not be set back literal HOURS\n\nI classify this as a hardcore survival base builder at its core similar to green hell.\n\n(MISTLANDS IS THE WORST BIOME DESIGN I HAVE EVER SEEN SINCE MINECRAFTS MUSHROOMS FIELDS)", "timestamp_created": 1711030089, "timestamp_updated": 1711030730, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511383473873138428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157288070": {"recommendationid": "157288070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198810477729", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 8493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5979, "last_played": 1707606779}, "language": "english", "review": "99% mundane grind, 1% high stakes/stress moments.

It's got great pacing, and is largely self-directed. There's no world level timer you're racing against, you can proceed through everything (or not) at your comfort level. It's got a great balance of base \"chores\" you can do when you don't feel like fighting, but easy to access exploration and combat. With the default settings you're never quite \"safe\" because raids can happen at your base any time, but you can adjust those settings as well if you just feel like building something.\n\nIf you're just starting, there are a couple mechanics that are easy to miss, most critically that food is a mechanic. You can't starve, but you can't heal without eating. Your available HP and stamina are tied to your foods, so it can actually be more critical to have better food than it is to have better armor and weapons. The other one that often catches people is that progress is biome-based. If you haven't beaten the boss of the biome you're in, you're likely not ready to head to the next one. The hints for what the next biome to go to are a little thin as well, but if you pay attention to what the bosses drop you can usually figure out where you should head next.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'd describe it as a viking-themed Minecraft with better combat mechanics, and an amazing atmosphere.

One of the best survival games I have played.  It has a great balance of carrot and stick.  Lots of resource gathering, farming, crafting, building, and exploration.  I highly recommend keeping the difficulty settings at the defaults.  Lowering the difficulty settings other than death penalty can really take the enjoyment out of the game unless you really want to railroad through, but as the game is not complete I do not recommend doing that.\n\nYou can take your cloud characters between games and keep all of their equipment and skills.  Just beware that if you go to a world where the players haven't gotten as far as you have that you may not be able to repair your equipment with the workstations they have.\n\nThe building system in the game is both simple and yet flexible enough to allow creative freedom.  I wish there were more parts you could use to build with, but it feels they were aiming for a level of realism and the build options are fairly grounded in that way.  From thatch huts to long houses, from earthen walls to stone castles, you will be rebuilding your base multiple times throughout the game as your available options open up.  You usually rebuild because you obtained new materials or you expand your base to add the latest workstation you unlocked.  I have logged in just to rework how my base looks because I saw some architectural feature I liked on someone else's build that I wanted to integrate into mine.  I have built castles (after LOTS of stone mining), torn them down, and rebuilt them again.  Every part you tear down returns the materials used to construct it, so do not fear adding a feature to test using rare materials.\n\nCombat is simple, yet tense.  Blocking is fairly critical, especially if you wear the games light armor options.  Parrying is key to taking down large enemies as a properly timed block will stagger your opponent.  The \"backstab\" feature is really just a surprise attack.  Hit an enemy before it knows you are there and you do enhanced damage that varies based on which weapon you are using.  Different enemies are either weak, strong, or immune to different types of weapon damage, so make sure you vary which weapons you use to get your skills up with everything.\n\nBoss fights give you materials and objects that are needed to progress to new areas in the game.  The boss fights are a treat and can be repeated.  Each boss feels unique and so far none have felt overly difficult or too easy.  Revisiting earlier bosses with later game equipment can trivialize them a little, but sometimes it feels good to say hello to Eikthyr and take him down with ease.  Defeating the boss gets you their head as a trophy and placing it on the stones at the world spawn point gives you special powers you can use to help you throughout the game.  Only one power can be readied at a time and they last 5 minutes with a 20 minute cool down period before they can be used again.  Return to the stone circle to hang the latest bosses head or to change which power you have readied.\n\nAt the time of writing I have played 179 hours in the game and I can easily see myself tripling or quadrupling that number before I move on to another game.", "timestamp_created": 1709911520, "timestamp_updated": 1709911520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505494534969329834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160064166": {"recommendationid": "160064166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154360179", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 41856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41856, "last_played": 1703089935}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is beautiful, fun and always something to do.

Combat is snappy and responsive, base-building mechanics are fantastic, and the art direction, music, and minimalist graphics are all wonderful. What's here is well-made and has a lot of charm.\n\nBut it's held back by the uninspired procedurally-generated map, punishing death mechanics, lack of base-related gameplay systems, and grind.\n\n-\n\nIn detail:\n\nThe procedurally-generated map is far too big for a solo player, and too uninteresting to justify its size. The only human design in the game is the biomes themselves, but there\u2019s only six of them. Once you\u2019ve seen them all, you\u2019ve explored the whole game. The computer repeats what little human-designed content there is many times across a world the size of Azeroth. This doesn\u2019t have a hand-designed world like Subnautica or Satisfactory; and areas of special interest are few and far between.\n\nTo justify its size, the game offers a hefty grind. At its default settings, you\u2019d have to mine out a whole island to complete a suit of armor, and you\u2019ll have to spend even more time lugging them back to base, then more time still refining all those materials. To put it clearly, this is the game: Mining resources on a relatively uninteresting map, and bringing them back to base. Thankfully, you can increase the resource drop rate by 3x, which every solo player should do from the start of the game, in my opinion.\n\n-\n\nBase-building is the best part of this game. It's easy to put a home together. The snapping system is fantastic. I loved how the building system is grounded in real objects: You need a rake to flatten the earth, for example, and can equip the rake in an action bar button that makes sense to you. It's not easy to make an intuitive interface for building in three dimensions, and Valheim has really knocked it out of the park. I especially loved building little emergency shelters out in the wild for repairing my items, or taking a rest.\n\nBut the base-building system is hampered by a lack of gameplay around it. The optimal base is a single room, stuffed with storage lockers, with all crafting stations crammed together. Crafting doesn\u2019t automatically take resources out of nearby crates, so you\u2019ll want those resources close at hand. There's a (wonderful) system of heat and ventilation, but it's easy to satisfy. The comfort system gives you a reason to decorate a room, but there's no reason to build multiple rooms! I'd love to see the game present more problems that building would let me solve.\n\n-\n\nSailing is the weakest part of the game, and made weaker still by the fact that you can't build on your sailing vessel, like crates or a crafting station. It takes 20 minutes or more to complete a voyage across the ocean, and along the way you aren't likely to encounter anything interesting. There's only one aggressive creature type in the ocean, and fighting it at sea while solo is so risky that you won't want to try it. And given the very short view distance, there's not much to look at while at sea either.\n\n-\n\nThe combat system is intuitive, snappy, and comfortably challenging. I loved encountering new enemies and learning how to dodge them. I was disappointed by the limited number of unique enemies, however; there are just 6 bosses in the game, and 3-6 aggressive enemy types per biome. I would've loved to see something like rare elites that drop better loot, or treasure goblins, or more bosses, or just something extra to surprise me.\n\nThe exploration and combat system are marred, sadly, by a punishing death and save system. When you die, you respawn with nothing, and must find your corpse to regain your lost loot. It\u2019s especially punishing when this happens across oceans. The save system is more like an emergency backup system (for things like power outages or file corruption), and does not allow you to easily undo mistakes. This punishes limit testing and experimentation. Purists will tell you it increases the tension, but I think the design is more to encourage multiplayer interaction, which is lost on solo players.\n\n-\n\nThere's a ton of promise in Valheim. The foundations for a great game are here. I just tried Enshrouded, and though it might have more features, it isn't nearly as snappy as Valheim, crafting and base-building isn't nearly as good, and the combat system is clunky by comparison.\n\nCould the developers give us a reason to build more interesting bases? Can they make the world itself more interesting, perhaps by hand-designing a map, or adding a unique, hand-designed point of interest on every island? Could they just add in a regular save system? Could they lessen the grind, and add in more bosses instead?\n\nPart of my problem, I think, is that I have played Subnautica, Outer Wilds, and other small indie games with fantastic single-player journeys. I wasn\u2019t going in with the expectation that this could be anything like those giants, but still, my brain can\u2019t help but hope I\u2019ll have experiences like those again.

However, it has many glaring issues and bugs that are just unacceptable. On top of that many tedious and annoying \"features\". I've played this game with a group of friends in a server and we're all extremely fatigued from the many problems we encounter daily and only dragging on since we're almost done with the game(currently mistlands). I'm so over a lot of the issues we've encounter including items such as refined eitr, iron etc. getting voided by their respected forge or forge equivalent machines as well as the dreadful lag. I hope the game improves, I like it fundamentally and as a concept as well as bits and pieces of it but this shit is tiring.\n\nEdit 1: after talking with some of the friends in the group a few glaring issues mentioned above would be:\n1. Hill combat is dreadful. Without the combat mod this is the worse, too often are there times where you're fighting a seeker on a hilly terrain or it's wedged into the small space on the side of a giant skull in a dvergr excavation site. We had one of our friends die to that.\n2. Stamina regen rate. They feel strongly that stamina system sucks. I partially agree with them. I do feel that stamina regen rate should be a percent based on your total stamina. It sucks when you pop 2 or 3 stam food and have 200+ stamina and it takes a few minutes to regen. It should regen based on your total stamina. \n3. Apparently the community feels similar but I did not bother looking at their sentiment(going off of what friends said). The mistlands is not fun. It has many cool elements such as gjall being an intimidating enemy to encounter in the early exploration as well the mystery the mistlands presents. Sadly the terrain navigation is annoying one because of point 2 above and two because of point 1 above lol. The entire biome could work but not within the premise of the current game. Consider the changes above and this biome could blossom more as a great early endgame environment. Also wisp torches should completely clear the area around it, not just a sphere but more like a cylinder because while I do agree with the mist being so high above the mistlands I dont agree with being un-removable because you cant put torches floating in the air or provide other options to remove the mist. Maybe a larger temporary option that is costly for temporary usage for exploration.", "timestamp_created": 1706577216, "timestamp_updated": 1706747858, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50467914342880249", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157884663": {"recommendationid": "157884663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259913821", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2382, "last_played": 1702588404}, "language": "english", "review": "no real updates since i got the game, a year and a half ago.\nif you like the product now, and don't expect updates, let it rip", "timestamp_created": 1707432593, "timestamp_updated": 1707432593, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504085421562194824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162668759": {"recommendationid": "162668759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004263103", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4341, "last_played": 1705785974}, "language": "english", "review": "FOR EVERY LIKE THIS REVIEW GETS, I EAT ONE SPOON OF MAYONNAISE.", "timestamp_created": 1712850457, "timestamp_updated": 1712850457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503816783428192139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161938614": {"recommendationid": "161938614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029897283", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2385, "last_played": 1711795077}, "language": "english", "review": "boring", "timestamp_created": 1711961435, "timestamp_updated": 1711961435, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503759443759918213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162665501": {"recommendationid": "162665501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048618443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1696733805}, "language": "english", "review": "Good concept, but janky at the best of times.

Personally I like the glow of the environment and the look and feel of the world. I like the music and the way the skill system works. There is a lot of good qualities. However; there is too much missing and not enough polish on areas that matter. The game is based on Viking mythology as well as traditional Vikings. To help people understand; Vikings were barbarians and would pillage towns and churches near the coasts. Churches were easy targets for lots of gold and valuable materials. They would raid during storms or fog in order to be under the cover of a distraction. They were brutal. This game lacks any of that. The boats are essentially fishing boats and you can't even use paddles like Vikings. They would have different boats for different purposes. They are missing too much for seafaring as well as missing all end game content. Games like Planet Crafter that get out of alpha in two years is expected. This game has been in alpha longer and has less to show for it. I'm worried it'll be like the infamous 7 Days To Die scenario.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

You won't see extra splashing as you run in the rain, but the lighting and wind is tangible.  Storms while at sea are terrifyingly brilliant\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Whomever designed the combat system should just give up and go into accounting because it is not just terrible, it's frustratingly horrible (0/5).  Too many times you can't hit something because you're elevated on a rock or the targeting system strikes the wall when your cross-hairs are clearly over the target.\r\n- Movement is super jenky and you can't turn in auto-run nor start it once you've started moving\r\n- Arrows need to fly 3x faster and actually fly towards the target\r\n- Swings need to be 2x faster and should Never Queue - I've had 2 strikes queued when trying to jump or dodge an enemy attack.  Nobody can play this type of game with a 3 second action queue.\r\n- Healing takes way too long in the lower levels\r\n- If you don't have a roller mouse you can't progress in the game because you will not be able to rotate walls or roofs for a crafting table to function.  Why???\r\n- Long-range travel (running/sailing) is far too slow and it will take you a very, very long time to get anywhere\r\n- If you fall off your raft, good luck getting back on it - you just die and loose everything you had on you\r\n- Ingredient costs are FAR too high.  How many boars/deer do you need to kill?  Many 100's\r\n- Treading water should refill your stamina; you can drown in a puddle\r\n\r\nAnyone noticing the cons list is longer than the pros?  Yeah, it's probably because the developers don't spend 10+ hours actually playing the game.  I'm sure it works in sandbox mode, but you have to play it to Feel what players will feel.\r\n\r\nPlay this like you would casual Minecraft where you don't dig too deep nor explore too far.

I wanted to have plenty of time put into it with it being an early access title. I've played mainly solo, most games like this I do, just a personal preference until I have beat the game. This game is an early access, the only bug I have ran into is an item tooltip describing what the item is. The game feels completed even though it is not. You can\u2019t say that for a lot of early access games now a days.\n\nLet's start off with the Building aspect this game offers. The terraforming can take a little to get used to. You can\u2019t just dig with a pickaxe underneath the layer above, you must take it all the way down. With you not being able to dig a cave, you must dig the whole area out and build in the area if you wanted to build an underground dungeon for example. You unlock building items as you progress through the game, I like this aspect, I suggest waiting until the final tier if you plan to build fancy. While building you must add support, just like in the real world, cool concept. You must be within a certain distance of a workbench, forge, or stonecutter while building. Certain building aspects require a different crafting table.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about combat. Combat in this game can be very challenging if you are under geared. You can\u2019t go from the tier 1 zone and expect to survive in combat in the tier 3 zone. There are creatures that can 1 shot you if you are not prepared. Eat the right food for more health and have the right gear for the zone on! The boss fights I enjoyed in this game. What more can you ask, fighting a deer with chains hanging off his antlers while metal music starts playing? Mobs from one biome will fight others from another! It seems skeletons will fight any mob even if they are from the same biome. It can be a sight to roll up on some greydwarves trying to fight the skeletons It can take time to acquire the materials to craft gear sense you can\u2019t use a teleport with ore. This means you either walk, or travel by boat.\n\nTraveling by boat can bring a lot of great views. Watching a storm while in the middle of the ocean, a lightning bolt dancing across the sky. Shortly after being able to watch the clouds dissipating, the stars shining with a purple hue in the sky can be mesmerizing. Some people may not enjoy the graphics of the game, say it looks too old. It\u2019s the perfect art style for this game in my opinion. The physics in this game are amazing. You chop a tree down and it factors in slop, chopping direction and wind into its fall direction. There\u2019s rain and snow fall in the game, which can cause you to become \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cfreezing.\u201d \nCrafting in this game is well done for the most part. In my opinion there is a few recipes that need to be tweaked. You shouldn\u2019t need 20 of iron bars but only a small amount of wood to craft a bow for example. Drop rates for crafting mats seem well placed except of ancient wood, my opinion, it needs to be lowered to same levels as the other \u201cspecial woods.\u201d You can plant a garden, plant trees, tame animals to have quick access to furs and meat.\n\nAfter many hours of crafting, combat, building, and exploring, a game that is 1gb (Yes 1gb!) has brought me a ton of fun. Reminds me of the first times playing Minecraft or Terraria. I\u2019ve been looking for a game to bring that feeling back.\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys these style of games as I do! Please if you enjoyed reading this or found it inciteful upgrade this review!\n\nI\u2019ll see you in Valheim!\n\n\nI just want to say thanks for all the awesome feedback of my review.. sorry I live in Texas and have been without power for 3 1/2 days.

Some key features that drew me in and resulted in my slight addiction are below:\n\nSoundtrack and graphics - The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and chill af. There were times i found myself working on my laptop with valheim running in the background, just so i could listen to the calming melodies of the soundtrack and the soft crackle of the fireplace in my base. The lighting and atmosphere are really top notch. The low resolution style was almost a turn-off for me when researching this game and watching videos. However, once inside the Valheim world, i saw it is truly beautiful and worth experiencing. \n\nDiscovery - The second thing that really drew me into Valheim was this feature where once you pick up a new inventory item for the first time, you will then discover crafting recipes associated to that item. This, as opposed to being awarded items for leveling up, felt very enticing. It made me want to explore to find new items, and to push into more unforgiving lands for the rewards the items there may have. This left me feeling like there was always something more out there to discover. There are items in the game which currently have no function, leaving some excitement to see what they are used for once that becomes available. Even after defeating the 5 current bosses and thinking i had complete the game, there were 2 biomes i had never even seen and more items to discover. \n\nDevelopment - The Devs have a roadmap that is widely accessible and clear on their plans for the future of the game. Personally, I have no social media accounts, but even through steam they post development blogs to keep the community in the loop with their plans.  To the prior point on discovery,  after seeing what valheim has to offer now, it is constantly changing. Even in the short 2 months i have had my hands on the game they have introduced a new enemy, new armor set, several QOL updates. They have near-future plans to add caves in the mountains and updates for the mistlands biome; with far-future plans for the ashlands and possibly others. \n\nDifficulty - The game is just hard enough. Like Darksouls, once you die, there is a marker left at the location of your death where you must return to get your items. However, this didn't feel too punishing as you can have unlimited death markers with no time limit to recover them. There were some times my items were stuck in a location that i couldn't immediately run there to recover them and knowing they weren't lost forever was enough to keep me from getting (overly) frustrated by death. Furthermore, the amount of resources obtained from a source vs the resources used in crafting felt very encouraging to building. For one tree, you get 10 wood, which is enough to build 5 walls. \n\n\n1:1 Resource Return - When dismantling a structure, the game returns the full resources used to build it. This means (assuming you had room in your inventory) you can demolish a base and rebuild it somewhere else without any additional grind. Similar games i have played in this genre typically give only a partial return. With Valheim, i felt much more free to try things and then just delete them if they didn't look right or work how i expected. \n\nBuilding -  Lastly, after spending 200+ hours in this world, defeating every boss, discovering and crafting every item, and upgrading all current items to their highest tier, i STILL spend time in this game because the building is fun and satisfying and easy. Chop one tree and you can build 5 walls. Clipping is easy and forgiving, even round walls and roofs look great once constructed. And <spoiler alert> the devs make it very easy to 'cheat' and enable debug mode. This allows the user to fly which makes gathering resources for building awesome structures much easier. They even permit using this in official building competitions. \n\nAll in all, great experience. Highly recommend. \n", "timestamp_created": 1640019917, "timestamp_updated": 1640019917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 686, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.965286731719970703", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86017855": {"recommendationid": "86017855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129042293", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 658, "last_played": 1672369833}, "language": "english", "review": "Has more game play, less bugs, and is polished better than most AAA games while still being in early access.

[/b]\n\nAt the time I'm writing this, [i] Valheim [/i] is still in early access. This is something I genuinely have to regularly remind myself because so far, it actually feels like a finished product.\n\nIn my 900+ hours of play time ( [strike] shut up [/strike] ), I could count on a single hand's digits the times I've run into bugs, and all of them were minor things that a simple log out/ log back in immediately fixed, with no consequence whatsoever.\n\nFrom gameplay to graphics, every aspect of the game is so polished that when you take into consideration the fact that this is a work in progress made by a small team of indie developpers, it's enough to put some of the biggest names in the industry through such amounts of shame that they'd wish they were Activision Blizzard right now.\n\n\n[b] -Ok, but what is this game about? [/b]\n\nBasically, [i] Valheim [/i] is some sort of cross between Survival Craft, Adventure and Sandbox set in an open world.\n\nThe (pretty huge) map is comprised of several different biomes you'll have to explore in order to find crafting and building materials, fight monsters and eventually face bosses. It is procedurally generated at world creation, which means that no two maps will look the same, thus contributing to a unique experience.\n\nProgression is based on the improvement of your gear through crafting, which requires materials you'll get from various sources in the world; some of which you'll only have access to after defeating bosses.\nRecipes are unlocked either by putting said materials into your inventory or interacting with crafting stations for the first time. This means that if you join a world in which the other players have already defeated bosses and stored materials, breaking into their homes and rummaging through the crap they've been hoarding like a real Viking should allow you to catch up on their progression without having to do the exploring and fighting yourself (and possibly ruin your experience in the process, as well as earning yourself the title of Lazy Bastard).\n\nTo help you achieve your goals, you have a system of \"skills\" which are improved through pure practice. For example, the more you sprint, the higher your sprinting skill value gets, which progressively allows you to sprint for longer while using less stamina.\nIn other words: practice leads to efficiency.\n\n\n[b] -Sounds nice, but what's so special about it? [/b]\n\nIf you've played other Open World Survival Craft games before, like [i] Ark: Survival Evolved [/i] or [i] Conan Exiles [/i] (which are pretty damn good in their own right), you might notice some similarities with Valheim in terms of mechanics and gameplay.\nWhat [i] Valheim [/i] does that others don't in that regard, is either improving on or getting rid of these elements that happen to mostly cause rectal discomfort in other games from the genre.\n\nEver spent four hours farming the stone required to build the three missing walls from your crappy shack in hope of preventing your untimely death from pneumonia caused by a sudden summer breeze, only to be on your way home and suddenly die of dehydration because more than three minutes have passed since the last time you drank?\nAnd then you spent two more hours just running to your corpse on the other side of the continent, dying 475 more times in the process because some local flock of seagulls have deemed you the perfect sacrifice to their dark god?\nBut when you finally managed to reach the location of your body, you only found undisturbed dust and sand as even the scorching sun seemed to laugh at your absolute despair?\n\nNo such tragedy in [i] Valheim [/i].\n\nAlthough you can -and will- die in the welcoming embrace of your friendly neighborhood wildlife, the game is designed in such a way that most of the frustration you'll experience could only be blamed on your own lack of foresight.\n\nExamples of this would be the following:\n\n- [u] You cannot die of hunger or thirst, although eating is necessary to increase your health and stamina in order to survive encounters with monsters or sudden falls from steep cliffs [/u]\n\n- [u] The amounts of materials required for crafting and building can be gathered without necessiting to quit your job and survive on potatoes bought on the internet with healthcare money [/u]\n\n- [u] Weather only affects your health and stamina regeneration rate (except if you plan on climbing snow-covered mountains in your birthday suit, but I'm no one to judge, we've all tried this IRL at least once) [/u]\n\n- [u] Player corpses have no time limit and will never disappear, even after a server restart [/u]\n\n- [u] As long as there's four walls and a roof around them, beds can be placed anywhere and the last one you interacted with will act as your next respawn location until you manually disable it [/u]\n\nNow don't get me wrong: the game absolutely does not lack anything in terms of challenge, and at times you may potentially suffer flashbacks from that time you tried [i] Dark Souls [/i] while drunk with your neighbors' newborn baby howling like a tasmanyan devil in the background.\n\n\n[b] -Have you considered seeing a therapist? [/b]\n\nDon't need to; don't want to.\n\nPlus I don't have to do anything you tell me to since you're not even my real mom.\n\n\n[b] -Sounds a bit too perfect, there must be at least some downsides [/b]\n\nThere are, but as surprising or dubious as it may seem, there aren't many in my humble opinion:\n\n- [u] Technical optimisation isn't the best as of yet. I'm more specifically thinking about the fact that being in an area with several player-made structures can cause severe framerate drops, even on decent computers. This can go to the point of unplayable on lower-end computers, as it happened to one of my chums who eventually stopped playing for now because of it.\nHopefully it will be fixed with an upcoming update. [/u]\n\n- [u] The damage dealt to structures by some higher-tier creatures just feels like the equivalent of card castles in a room full of chimps with ADHD. [/u]\n\n- [strike] (Used to rant about auto-pickup here, turns out I'm just blind) [/strike]\n\nKeep in mind, however, that the game is still in early access at the time I'm posting this review.\n\n\n[b] -Final words [/b]\n\nSomewhere in-between thrilling and relaxing, [i] Valheim [/i] is a very well-balanced game made with love and passion, and it really shows.\nThe ability to alter the terrain by digging / flattening / raising the ground is pretty dope.\n\nRegardless of what you think about the retro-ish style of the graphics, this game is [u] gorgeous [/u]. You'll know what I mean.\n\nFrom the very first time I got ganged up on by a group of monsters while peacefully picking berries, to when I took a sip of mead as I watched the horizon from the top of my fortress decorated with the heads of their brethren, I enjoyed every second of this journey I'm still far from being done with.\n\nIf you are tempted, just buy the game; I promise you won't regret it.\n\nAlso, f\u2665\u2665\u2665 Greydwarves.", "timestamp_created": 1636381279, "timestamp_updated": 1675478626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 820, "votes_funny": 277, "weighted_vote_score": "0.95898735523223877", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151341439": {"recommendationid": "151341439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055437647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 114328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1541, "playtime_at_review": 61721, "last_played": 1713798825}, "language": "english", "review": "This is hardly a game although it provides massive pleasure;  it is more of an experience, one that is as highly addictive as  it is fun to play.

While I don't think it's perfect, it does a lot of things right that other survival games don't. It's surprisingly well thought-through with many elaborate systems in place which make a lot of sense in the context of a survival setting. Valheim is a single or online multiplayer co-op survival game that combines elements from Minecraft, Rust, souls like games and even Elder Scrolls and adds a lot on top of it, to round out everything into one game which makes it feel \u2018whole\u2019 and well designed. It constantly makes you think about how you want to approach each of the game\u2019s aspects, whether it\u2019s building, combat or exploration.\n\nYour main progression goal is to defeat the game's 'forsaken' bosses which in turn not only give you new items to progress with but also grant you their power. These powers come in form of an unlimited use, but long cooldown AOE-Buffs. Unlike many other survival games, you're not only progressing through your equipment, but also directly with your character, as almost all in-game actions correspond to a skill that you can level up by simply doing it a lot. You need to be careful though, as deaths become increasingly punishing, because they will set you back a percentage of your skill progression (and drop all your items in the place you died in). This skill system feels really good in my opinion, because it offers room for everyone, ranging from generalist to specialist and anything in between. You might want to be the sword and shield wielding, heavy armor type of player, or you might want to be the sneaky backstabber or even the swift archer. All of these playstyles work, but neither of them will be ideal for all the situations the game will throw you into. Whichever you choose, so far I've never felt like I had chosen the 'wrong' way to play, where progression seems completely impossible without putting more time into leveling up some other skill. Furthermore you\u2019re never required to reach a certain skill level to do a specific thing, you\u2019re only ever getting better at doing it by leveling up your skills.\n\nThe base or home building game is another aspect of the game that I think the game does really well. While the game offers you the ability to build strictly grid based, you can build nearly anything however you like, should the grid as well as the half size options not fit your needs. The game also actively rewards you for a lot of the furniture and decorations you can build by increasing the 'comfort'-level of your housing. Basically higher comfort will give you a longer lasting buff when you rest inside. As you gather more materials you will unlock more crafting recipes, which will make sure you're never overwhelmed with too many options all at once. When building a house, you'll find that you'll have to keep a lot of things in mind. First of all structural integrity is not a given, hover over your building pieces with your building hammer to see how stable your structure is. If it goes too far into the red it will break unless you build additional pillars or walls for support. Other stuff to worry about include the rain putting out your fires and the smoke of fires hurting you if you let it build up in your home, so plan your house to keep stuff like this in mind as you learn more. If you're the type who would rather shape your surroundings to your likings instead of adjusting your buildings according to them the game also offers terra-forming options for that, so digging a moat or raising your foundation high above everything else is an option!\n\nExploration in the game feels great. There are a lot of biomes to see and the landscapes are beautiful. There is never a shortage of new things to see, although some biomes are by design harder to survive in than others, so don't wander into new territory carelessly. The game will usually intuitively let you know where you should look for progress next, either through item naming (For instance if you get a swamp key, that means you can go look for a swamp) or through the tutorial bird, who always shows up when you discover something new that isn't self explanatory. Be aware though that building a base in a more dangerous area than the starting one will definitely require you to defend it against foes, either through fighting or through clever base design.\n\nLastly, the combat in this game. It's mostly inspired by souls like games, with stamina, blocking and dodging all playing an important part. What I like here is that this plays very well together with the skill system in the game, as you will find that certain types of enemies take increased damage from certain types of damage (i.e. blunt weapons, slashing weapons, piercing weapons). So leveling up your sword and spear skill could potentially help you in some areas, while leveling up only one will result in the maximum damage from that type of weapon. Some enemies will be easier to block, while for others you'll want to dodge their attacks (and some are just better dealt with at range). Generally I'd say the combat in the game is fun, although sometimes it gets frustrating to run out of stamina frequently.\n\nGenerally the game felt the best to me, when I saw how well the different aspects of the game work together. Crafting, building, gathering, fighting, exploring, looting- They all go hand in hand with each other. For instance when you're crafting your armor, you'll find that you can upgrade it with additional material, but it also requires a higher level workbench, which you'll get if you built your home with one or more of the workbench improvements near the workbench. You want to gather a lot of wood or stone? You might want to make a cart to drag it behind you and carry a lot more, but first you'll probably also want to have a path so that the cart doesn\u2019t get stuck on every rock or bush. There's a river in the way? Build a bridge! But make sure it's stable enough and while you're at it, maybe give it a roof as well, so it's safe from the rain. Later you might want to come back and build a better bridge from stone and make a paved road for what might now be an important travel route for you. And transporting stuff will always stay relevant, even if you get better methods of transportation a little into the game, so planning for some means of moving stuff around will definitely pay off.\n\nHere's a couple things I didn't like about the game: Firstly the stamina system generally works really well, and the higher you level your skills, the less stamina your actions will drain. However there are a ton of ways the game can make you regain stamina more slowly though debuffs like 'cold' at night or 'wet' during the rain and sometimes it feels slow and frustrating to have very limited actions available, simply because of circumstances that you could technically work around, but more often than not simply end up having to accept. Also in multiplayer, when you'll want to equip like 4-6 people with the latest and upgraded equipment it can take a long time to acquire enough materials, especially if you're just playing casually or if you don't plan properly. Personally I've run into some bugs that ended up costing me a fair amount of progress, however from what I can tell that bug has been fixed since. You should still expect to run into bugs every now and then and the game server can be laggy sometimes. Some enemies are also hard to deal with without proper precautions and knowledge, which I personally think is okay, but I know it will cause frustration to some.\n\nIf you like survival games in general and have a couple friends to play with, definitely give Valheim a try. If you liked Rust, but disliked how easily you can lose all your progress to PVP, Valheim got you covered. If you feel like a mix between Minecraft and Elder Scrolls could be fun, that's also a strong indication you'll probably like the game. At about 20 bucks, I'd say the game is definitely worth the asking price.\n", "timestamp_created": 1614305782, "timestamp_updated": 1614305782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1183, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.955172300338745117", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86039993": {"recommendationid": "86039993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022783655", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1670832281}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine if Rust and Runescape had a baby (without the PVP) \n\nYou wouldn't think its early access, we had ZERO bugs, there was about 6 of us, and we haven't had this much fun in a game together in YEARS, the depth of the crafting, building and the world itself is unreal. \n\nI don't often review, but this game is outstanding - truly worth your money. \n\nEdit: I really didn't expect this to blow up like this, thanks for all your kind words and awards, this is the first time anything like this has happened.  \n\nTo answer a few queries \n\n1) No I didn't get paid, sorry I haven't reviewed every product on my account - I took the time to review this because I genuinely had so much fun and it filled a gaming need I've had for the LONGEST time. \n\nIt gave me a feeling of old school Runescape plus the building and crafting, sense of progression of Rust. \n\nThe reason why I reviewed is because its an early access game, I want the developers and community to know that personally enjoyed it and show a token of support. \n\n2) I am aware there is PVP but what I meant was that the progress on the game wasn't geared towards PVP - Which is a love hate relationship I had with Rust.", "timestamp_created": 1612575113, "timestamp_updated": 1613261639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2557, "votes_funny": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.950909078121185303", "comment_count": 44, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86119430": {"recommendationid": "86119430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014843607", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 22466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1087, "last_played": 1703376940}, "language": "english", "review": "It feels like playing Minecraft again for the first time.", "timestamp_created": 1612677919, "timestamp_updated": 1612677919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2221, "votes_funny": 61, "weighted_vote_score": "0.950741171836853027", "comment_count": 41, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132287243": {"recommendationid": "132287243", "author": {"steamid": "76561199038642759", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 117985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "playtime_at_review": 117906, "last_played": 1713788116}, "language": "english", "review": "Been playing for a while now.

Your shelters must be constructed with adequate support and ventilation of smoke in mind, and interior comforts increase the amount of rest you gain, incentivizing you to not just build a house, but a nice house.\n\nYou can construct paired portals to fast travel across the map, but certain raw materials cannot be carried through them, which creates interesting logistical choices between shipping materials over long distances by cart or by boat, and building outposts to process and craft your materials closer to where they are mined.  Additionally, certain crops can only grow in certain biomes, which further incentivizes setting up multiple bases.  Thankfully, the rewarding nature of the building system makes the prospect of building a new base an opportunity rather than a burden.\n\nLike most games in this genre, a good amount of time is spent gathering resources, but the amount you need never seems onerous.  It can be time consuming, but this is often because you will get interrupted by monsters drawn to the sound of mining ore and chopping trees, which breaks up what could otherwise be a monotonous task.\n\nAnd lastly, the game's unique graphical style is gorgeous.  Low polygon counts and simple textures free up resources that are spent on beautiful lighting, atmospherics, and color composition.\n\nThis type of open-world survival/building game isn't for everyone.

Sent by Odin to the world of Valheim, you must survive by gathering resources, building a shelter, training your skills and crafting equipment to fight the forsaken.\n\n[h1]\u2699 [u]Game Description & Mechanics[/u] \u2699[/h1]\nAs with most crafting survival, everything you eat, wear or build is made of various materials and using various tools made from those materials. You start by gathering branches and rocks from the ground, crafting your first axe, hammer and weapon, which in turn will allow you to gather better, stronger and more varied material, found in areas of increasing difficulty. With each material you find for the first time, new recipes are revealed (from your character remembering their mortal life).\n\nProgress is unlocked through defeating bosses. For instance: [spoiler]defeating Eikthyr will give you Hard Antlers from which to craft your first pickaxe, which in turns will allow you to start gathering your first metal ore.[/spoiler] The game is also separated in areas known as biomes, and it is implied that you avoid biomes beyond your level. You start in Meadows where you will find the first boss, after which you can go in Black Forests where you will find the second boss, and so forth. There is no physical barrier to those biomes beyond the difficulty of the creatures found within, and you should have maxed out your equipment made from material available in your current biome before exploring the next, more difficult biomes.\n\nYour stats consists of health and stamina, which have no permanent increase. The food you eat will increase those base stats temporarily, increase which will steadily decline over time. You are limited to eating three things at any given time, which must be different. You may eat raspberries, mushrooms and cooked meat, but not three cooked meats. You will eventually unlock potion crafting made from fermented mead, giving buffs to poison or cold resistance, or filling your health or stamina.\n\n[h1]\u263a [u]What I enjoyed[/u] \u263a[/h1]\nI must say this game can be pretty laid back. I've read that it incorporates all the strengths of crafting survival games, but none of the weaknesses, and it is pretty much the case. If you don't eat, your health and stamina will be pretty low, you won't regenerate your health and will only slowly regain stamina, but you won't die of hunger. If you want to spend days gathering wood and rocks and building your dream longhouse, then you may ignore eating completely. The same applies to sleeping, being dry or staying warm (except for the freezing temperature of Mountain biomes, that is): your stamina won't regenerate as fast, but you can otherwise ignore it if you're not heading into danger.\n\nBut the game is still punishing where it needs to be. If you're cutting down trees and stick around when the trunk is falling towards you, you'll die. If you're climbing on very high rooftops to finish your chimney and fall, you'll die. If you explore Swamps without poison-resistance potions, or Mountains without cold-resistance potions, you'll die, and have no one but yourself to blame. And when you do die, your skills are decreased by 5%, and you lose all your inventory and equipment until you can go back to that location to recover it.\n\nScreenshots won't do it justice. The game uses lighting, fog and weather effects in a superb manner. One morning, you'll be welcomed to a gorgeous sunrise, the next will surround the area in a fog so thick you can barely see an arm's length in front of you, and the next will have windy showers and thunderstorms. It is quite effective at setting the mood, but it will also affect your playthrough. When it rains, you're wet, you don't recover stamina as fast. When it's windy, your boat will get damaged from crashing into high waves.\n\n[h1]\u2639 [u]What bothered me[/u] \u2639[/h1]\nWhile it seems like a good idea to have your crafting progress determined by the bosses, the implications regarding difficulty goes beyond that. There are \"events\" of increasing frequency where your location or base gets attacked, and the difficulty of those events is determined by which boss you've defeated, regardless of how safe is the biome you've settled in. Having boars and necks attack your wooden walls is barely a bother at first, but when multiple trolls are smashing through your stone walls while you just wanted peace and quiet to create a new architectural monument, it gets annoying.\n\nVisuals are pretty, but polygons and resolutions are old-gen looking, reminiscent of late PS1/early PS2 graphics if console gamers want something to compare. Of course, this is an Early Access title, so a stable game with solid and fun gameplay is more important at this stage, but I sure hope this gets taken into consideration further down the development line.\n\nAnother thing the game lacks is a high quantity of craftable items. Decorations are few, so constructing a believable mead hall or village is difficult within the confines of the available pieces. The Hearth and Home update, recently delayed further to later this year, cannot come soon enough.\n\n[h1][b]My Early Access Verdict[/b]: \u2605\u2605\u2605 - [i]\"Why wait any longer?\"[/i][/h1]\n\n[i]Valheim[/i] deserves the highest rating I can give an Early Access game. I had a lot of fun playing it, especially when a friend established a server for a few of us to hop in and out at our own pace, building and exploring together. Since release, it's been patched to a very stable and bug-free experience. More updates are on their way, slowed down by the extremely high quantity of players giving feedback. Yet, the included content is already enough to have plenty of fun! There's no need to wait for it to come out of Early Access, you can go right ahead and get this one!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n[i][b]This was just my opinion.[/b]\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CJsOpinions/]reviews[/url].[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1622945323, "timestamp_updated": 1648688566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 669, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.945861995220184326", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86290626": {"recommendationid": "86290626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139026085", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 745, "last_played": 1707863034}, "language": "english", "review": "Accidentally played for 12 hours straight, going to make some dinner now.

These are my initial thoughts and the mechanics used in the game.  \n\nValheim is like a Minecraft version of dark souls with Fallout building/survival. \n\nMechanics:\n\nYou gather resources and use a work bench to craft shelter, weapons and armor.\n\nThe tools, weapons and armor wear down with use but can be repaired at the work bench. \n\nThe building of structures snaps together pretty well but sometimes the piece disappears until it\u2019s in the right spot. \n\nYou attack, run, sneak, block and dodge with a stamina meter. \n\nYou sleep in a bed to set your respawn point. Sleeping turns night into day and you get a temporary bonus for sleeping. \n\nYou cook food at a fire. When you eat you regenerate health. Rainy and cold weather debuffs you. These survival aspects makes you think a little more but is not a chore.\n\nThere are no experience points but there are skill levels. You get higher skill levels by doing those actions. E.g. run skill goes up when you run. \n\nWhen you die you leave behind a tombstone with all your gear. You have to go back to the place where you died to reclaim your gear. Once I died and looted all but one thing. I then died again. A second tomb stone was made. I was still able to go back and loot that one thing from the first tombstone. \n\nThoughts / play experience / tips:\n\nAs soon as I landed I was attacked by four different types of enemies in sequential order while I was naked and bare handed. That let me know what I was in for. \n\nThe trees are out to get you. When you chop them down run away. You have been warned. \n\nWatch your cooking food just like you would in real life. \n\nMark all the shelter you come across on the map in case of bad weather. \n\nThe first boss fight was done well. \n\nI played using the keyboard and mouse but I\u2019m thinking my Xbox controller may be the way to go. \n\nThe Viking flavor of the game is subtle in some aspects.

If you have friends who enjoy it, buy the game and purchase a server. Also take a few days off work. You won't regret it. Ok let's talk about it now.\n\nGraphics: Believe me, they are better than you think. They just are. Don't look at screens, don't mind low poly textures, (but enjoy a meager 1gb download for the game), don't worry about anything. The game is GORGEOUS.\n\nNow that we talked about it... Should I tell you about how awesome and immersive the feeling of exploration and adventure is? Like how you look around trying to see in the dark and take out a torch? Or how you see a troll not-so-distant in the fog and freak out?\n\nOr like the game being low fantasy, so requiring good effort and how you start an expedition not knowing what you'll face and where, set up a camp, run from enemies or challenge them, find new loot, mark resources....\n\nMaybe we should talk about the joy of settling down in a village. Building with the just enough amount of realism, working together on tasks, building up resources...\n\nOr we can just talk about cool viking stuff. All the weapons you can forge, enemies you can kill, ships you build and sail with...\n\nWhatever I tell you, it won't do the game justice. Even after its fresh release in EA, Valheim is one of the best games of its type. For me, it's Terraria+UO+7DtD in the best way possible. For you, it may be something else. \n\nPlay it, then let me know what you think in a comment!\n\nEdit: I'm at 120~ hours right now after a week and I've only loved the game more. For anyone commenting/reading comments, here are a few remarks:\n\nGraphics: Yes, the graphics are low poly but it's stylized similar to World of Warcraft. More importantly, unlike WoW, it has really good effects. So if you want to see a detailed face, you aren't getting it. But when you look at nature, the sun rising, how a storm feels, how the light plays out under rain etc. it's incredibly beatiful. I didn't say the graphics were cutting edge, I said it's gorgeous and I stand by it. I'll upload some screenshots after this edit, feel free to check them out. But again - screens don't do it justice because the organic feeling can only be felt when the trees are moving, the waves are rising, the rain pours etc.\n\nServer: As clarified, you do not NEED a server. What I meant was that we took such an instant liking to a game, we wanted to play it under best circumstances. I also need to add that I play with 3 friends and in total we are spread to 3 cities in 2 countries. Plus, dedicated server allows anyone to connect to the game world at any time they want. This is the same with games like Terraria etc. Not a requirement, just a big convenience.\nFor Terraria I had used gameservers but I couldn't find it there (maybe they added since) so I used gportal, as also promoted by devs.\n\nUO: It does mean Ultima Online. Going out to nature, mining, cutting lumber, coming back to smelt and craft and being sandbox is what makes me think of it.

This game puts AAA studios to shame, seriously.\n\nI'm 25. Last night my two friends and I (also 25) stayed up until 7am playing this game. We all have jobs and two of us are in school and have homework due today that we haven't started. We are normally very responsible; this game is f****** GOD TIER. \n\nI haven't even begun to scratch the surface on the amount of things you can do and I have 50 hours into this game. There's literally too much to tell you about it. The best description I've heard is: \"If Terraria, Skyrim and Dark Souls had a baby, it'd be this game.\" \n\nThat's basically it, except I like to say it's more similar to Minecraft. \n\nThere's literally endless possibilities for you as a solo player or a crew. While roleplaying is not required, it's inherent to the game and the atmosphere and you'll come across all sorts of people who are enjoying themselves and would like to rest by your hearth to gain some buffs before continuing their adventure. \n\nLet me TRY and tell you some of the reasons I love this game - know I'll never be done explaining - and I don't even know it all myself.\n\n- Procedural Map, no same experience\n- Ocean exploration, new continents/islands and biomes being found constantly, the more you're willing to venture into the sea. Be wary, there may or may not be monsters waiting to swallow your little raft.\n- Extremely intuitive building. Ever played Rust? It's like that except 10x better building. Snapping works really well, pieces can be clipping and instead of the game screaming at you, it understands and allows you to make seamless additions.\n- Manipulation of the very land you stand on. You can level ground, raise ground, pickaxe into the dirt and make holes to hide things, pickaxe into the mountains (can't tunnel yet though), make paths, etc. \n- Did I say the ocean? It's beautiful, it's scary, you're a f****** viking. There are parts of the game (dungeons) you need to clear to progress. At a certain point, the starter continent on multiplayer worlds will have had their dungeons cleared already. This things do not respawn, forcing you to venture into the deep blue sea and find your wealth elsewhere. \n- Monsters. Monsters based on biomes. Monsters you wouldn't even think of. \n\n***SIDE NOTE***\nAs I'm sitting here writing this review, we got a special event where two trolls decided to come rail us in the dark crevice and destroy our walls and attack our base. \n****************\n\nGuys, I'm leaving so much out.

I am so impressed by many things in the game.  It's incredibly engaging and provides a great deal of fun besides defeating bosses and winning the game.  I feel the various stages of the game -- as you progress through those boss battles \u2013 are very well balanced!  You can feel like your character is badass and is able to easily wipe out the enemies in the early biomes, and then the next biome is challenging again for you.  I hope the biomes and later stages of the game that I haven\u2019t reached yet are just as well balanced.\n\nI have only battled the first two bosses because I enjoy all the other activities in the game so much and am taking my time in them.  Building in the game is especially rewarding, and I\u2019ve built many scouting bases as well as large, elaborate bases.  I\u2019ve also reclaimed abandoned structures and farms that we\u2019ve discovered in convenient locations.  I look forward to finding a village and restoring it in the future, and I have plans for a castle to build when I've reached the late game stage.\n\nExploration is extremely rewarding and the world is massive.  There\u2019s so much to see that I\u2019ll probably explore the entire map before facing the final boss.\n\nI love the graphics and art style of the game.  It\u2019s a blend of modern graphics and old school RPG elements.  I was immediately immersed in the game because of those familiar looks, and it made me get into role playing as a Viking as soon as I arrived in the strange realm that Odin exiled his enemies to.  \n\nThe setting is amazing and I enjoy encountering outlandish beasts with complete suspension of disbelief.  One night in the game, I witnessed a dark apparition in the distance and cautiously approached it \u2013 only to watch it vanish as I drew nearer.  I later learned that it was Odin maybe checking up on my progress fighting his enemies, or perhaps to inspire my conviction to do his will.  I look forward to learning more about the lore of the game as its development continues.\n\nI like that you can play the game solo, jump into a friend\u2019s game hosted on their computer, or join a multiplayer game on a server, AND use your existing character(s) across all those game experiences.  You keep your skill progress and all the items in your inventory when you play your character in other games.  You also have control over PvP and can turn it off if you don\u2019t want to fight with other players in multiplayer games.\n\nAs an Early Access game, I expect it to take at least another two years to be finished.  The first major update was recently delayed until the autumn, which I find encouraging, to be honest.  It shows me the devs aren\u2019t going to rush and put out broken updates just to keep up with an optimistic road map of planned feature updates.  My hope is that the game will continue getting better as it reaches the end of the EA phase, while providing a smooth and enjoyable experience for the existing player base.  I don\u2019t like to be forced into starting a new game every time there is a major update to a game.  I understand that it can be necessary sometimes, but I hope Valheim will not go through this cycle during its final years in development.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game to all players who enjoy survival games and building unique structures.  There is so much to do, see and love in the game already.  If you\u2019re comfortable trying out games in Early Access, you should definitely try Valheim!  It\u2019s definitely one of the best survival games I\u2019ve played.", "timestamp_created": 1624103216, "timestamp_updated": 1624103216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 221, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925759971141815186", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87553455": {"recommendationid": "87553455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961128651", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3871, "last_played": 1615603703}, "language": "english", "review": "There are so many things I want to say about Valheim but I'll keep it short.\n\nAs I suspect happened to most, this game came out of nowhere for me. A PvM experience perfectly suited for you and your gaming buddies to band together and tackle. If your group is like ours, we typically dive into a game together and get bored within the first few days but not this time.\n\nThe strength of Valheim is the drip-feed progression without ever slipping into tediousness. I never have to spend significant amounts of time in Valheim doing maintenance work or the like. Food doesn't spoil, exposed wood never fully decays and anything you build can be refunded easily. This translates into an experience where every minute spent adventuring is ground gained.\n\nI'm not sure how they (Iron Gate) did it but at release they nailed setting continuous, clear goals for players which can be trusted to lead to meaningful progression once completed.

I normally tell people that this game reminds me of Minecraft meets Vikings because that's the simplest analogy. You craft your way up from the usual naked meatbag into being a flaming-sword swinging, steel-clad wrecking ball. Your first house is probably going to be a pathetic wooden box behind whose walls you'll huddle like a scared ball of uselessness, BUT by the end you're living in a massive ego-stroking fortress of awesomeness and striding forth from its halls in fearless search of whatever baddy is too damn stupid to run screaming from the terror you've become. Longships, sea serpents, massive storms on land and sea (no, really- the waves are ridiculous), flying serpents, the undead, blobs (because of COURSE there are evil blobs), and even giant leeches. I guess the mind behind this game is a fan of The Princess Bride? My friends and I have built more castles than a Norman king, killed more dragons than a library full of Dragonlance novels, and shot more seagulls than Florida Man could ever dream of. The drop-in co-op is solid and makes an already good game great. If you like viking games, builder games, or survival games, then this game is a no-brainer. Buy it, play it, enjoy it.

There's not a lot here that would be called \"innovative\", but all the usual survival staples are here (nourishment, status effects, environmental concerns, etc.) and some with fresh takes. \n\nThe food system in particular is something every other survival developer should be looking at -- instead of penalizing the player for not eating (through starving to death, hobbling the character, etc.) the food system rewards players with added health and stamina, in some cases greatly, for the extra work they put into obtaining the items and stations needed to make the food. It's the player's choice to pursue that.\n\nIn fact, there's a great degree of freedom of choice in Valheim. Enterprising players who think outside the box can progress just fine in the game, acquiring almost everything they need without having to beat any of the bosses. (The fourth boss requires defeat at this time in order to unlock all crafting options.) \n\nValheim is not without its blemishes. The graphics style is decidedly low-res which can be offputting to some in the age of 4K+, and can also be a little misleading -- do not think system requirements are lower just because of the heavily-pixelated graphics. This is particularly true in the Mountains and Deep North (not yet released) biomes during blizzard/snowstorm weather events, where a loss of up to 70% framerate and performance can be expected even for strong GPUs. It does bear reminding that the game, at this time, is still in Early Access (and being worked on by a really small team; I'm very impressed with their work given the developer's size!) so that may not always be the case, but it is at present.\n\nOne area where the game currently lags behind its contemporaries is a lack of difficulty/health/production parameters that can be tweaked to adjust the game to taste, like one finds on games such as Ark and Conan Exiles. There may be mods for this, but all of my time so far has been on the vanilla version. Also, be advised that most admin commands do not work on multiplayer/dedicated servers, even for the game owner. Some still do, but things like God mode, flight, invincibility and spawn-in of items are turned off for dedicated at this time.\n\nAll told? This game, even in its Early Access state, is definitely worth adding to any survival fan's collection for $20, esp. small groups of survival fans. I can safely say it's a great feeling to be sitting there in the mead hall with your party after the last boss is down, dumping most of your mead down your armor's chestpiece and puking on your friends to celebrate victory. (At least until the last three biomes are released!) \n\nI'd give it about four and a half outta five. Very strong entry in the survival genre by Iron Gate.

Mining excluding copper? great.\n\nCombat feels  very satisfying with quite a few weapon options. Enemies have certain strategies with select weapons being more effective to fight with against them.\n\nBoss fights feel very satisfying and give a good sense of progression excluding Eikthyr and The Queen, the first being super easy and needing no gear and the latter will be a bigger breakdown below.\n\nI think up until the Mistlands the game feels very complete and really well made.\n\nNow onto the Mistlands, This may come across as biased? but i have looked around on reddit and the feeling seems to be super mutual. The mistlands feels more like a chore rather than something to actually take in and enjoy, despite having Iron Padded armour that is fully maxed out which black metal weapons that are completely maxed out. I don't expect to walk with this gear into mistlands and breeze through it. However, I also don't expect to become a blood smear on the impossible to traverse terrain from a couple hits unless I'm running Bonemass Buff.\n\nI spent 40 hours+ looking for the Infested Dungeons in the Mistlands fine combing through MULTIPLE of the mist biomes. i knew what i was searched for because after around 10 hours in I had to search up what they looked like because I thought I was somehow missing them? It turns out we had came across a few derelict structures that were MEANT to have the dungeons attached but for some reason did not?\nAfter about 30 hours of having zero luck with dungeons we used a website where you could basically see everything on the seed and we were surprised with how few dungeons there were and how spread out they were. after managing to find several dungeons this way we could also not find a single Lore tablet that would ping the boss altar and had to use the website to find that also. I just think with how bad the terrain is. Its a great concept but why must I have to traverse this terrain which is also ridiculous with the energy consumption and then have to be super paranoid about having a swarm of seekers or a gjall nuke me to high heavens because visibility is poor? Sure I can place down torches but only in areas that I haven't been.\n\nThe Queen Bossfight herself we had also found ridiculous, we were buffed, Level 2 carapace gear and weapons. it took us a while, we found all previous bosses quite fun even the last couple that had some challenging mechanics but we never sat there and went yeah, that boss fight sucked. Why does the Queen's health pool have to be so large? despite all of her attacks none of them were surprising but there were zero pauses in the fight you're a melee user? be prepared to get thrown across the fight arena every time you get close. you're a bow user? yeah no damage. This boss fight is nothing short of complete frustration, not to mention with how much HP she has. you will break your Mistlands tier weapons before even getting her down half her HP, is this annoying? sure. but even with a maxed out black metal shield and a maxed out mist walker sword which seemed to be the most efficient way of killing her, we could not stand toe  to toe without Bonemass buff. This is the only way we found that we could stand our ground.\nIf you are hit by the queen without bonemass buff and you dont time the block like a parry. you take an immense amount of damage which combined with seekers that she spawns is pretty much a death sentence. you can only pop Health pots every few minutes which means that the downtime is insane and I can understand why some people opt for cheesy strategies that involve multiple bows and hundreds of arrows or hundreds of bombs and sitting in spots where she can't reach you.\n\nTo conclude I think the game is super satisfying to play up until the Mistlands where the game feels like it changes genre's from a nice survival type of game with a good sense of progression to the new end-game biome where it feels like it transforms into a souls like game while wearing a blindfold of mist. where you have to perfect parrying and dodges in order to survive\n\nIf Mistlands were to receive some power tweaks to the mobs or increase the gear dps by a small amount it would certainly help, or even being able to see more with your wisp pet.\n\nShouts out to Bonemass for having our back in the fight else we would have probably resorted to cheesing her with bombs and bows", "timestamp_created": 1678379079, "timestamp_updated": 1678379378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 170, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.890676796436309814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86773978": {"recommendationid": "86773978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308055278", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2011, "last_played": 1647447721}, "language": "english", "review": "Its that game where you make good memories and cry about it couple years later. xD 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1613456248, "timestamp_updated": 1613456383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 634, "votes_funny": 85, "weighted_vote_score": "0.890411555767059326", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149382863": {"recommendationid": "149382863", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087612625", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 59185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54500, "last_played": 1711228726}, "language": "english", "review": "Lasted 3 Different Girls and still going", "timestamp_created": 1698942357, "timestamp_updated": 1698942357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 282, "votes_funny": 192, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889851927757263184", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85835129": {"recommendationid": "85835129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076558737", "num_games_owned": 1151, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 75381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1712281855}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a good game. \n\nI put 160 hrs into the Beta and the EA release version is quite similar. The devs said that it's around 50-70% complete so expect more items and content coming to it.\n\nAs an EA title, it's quite stable, I had no crashes or freezes. Runs well on Nvidia 1050Ti and Core I7 8th gen from SSD. \n\nThe game itself is VERY hard. it's easy to loose your stuff quickly or get killed in an instant. The first instinct would be to corpse-run, but it's actually more hard to pull off than in other games, since when you die, your HP will reset, you have no stamina to run, no HP to soak damage. Food is key in this game. And the better you treat yourself the more HP you have. Berries and mushroom can sustain, but only gives a little HP. You have 3 food slots, and depending on what you eat, the more or less HP you will have (for a while, because it counts down, foods loose the effect after a while). So if you ear low quality food that is abundant, then you only have like 50 HP. If you find and cook the beast meats, you can have 150+ makes night and day difference in fights. Suggestion: If you die, don't run immediately back, instead make an extra shield and axe, extra set of armour, make sure you eat the best food you have THEN go back. learn to block, parry and counterattack. \n\nThe negative stuff: unlocking new items can be hard without any knowledge of what you supposed to do. You usually unlock more stuff as you pick them up, build what you can, some items you build will unlock further stuff. Most brewing is tied to Honey which I haven't for for until ~150 hrs into the game. Didn't even know it was an option and and it unlocks a ton of stuff. Your life  can be absolutely go tits up in seconds, you can loose you ship, your armour, your weapon, on another island in the middle of the swamp.

Like Terraria only mobs and food respawn so if you clear an area your done there. But there is a lot to explore. Boats and carts are available to help bring stuff back to your base and you can make portals to get about easier, however you cant bring some resources through them, hence the need for boats.\n\nCombats fun with different styles of play depending on the weapon, theres a lot to craft and also boss fights. The boss fights a very cool and the music and atmosphere during them is metal as f**k.\n\nBuilding is great but needs a bit of working around, you cant build out or down very well so need to stand on the side your building towards, you can build from the side but some times things dont snap in place. Once I got used to it I find it better than Ark and Conan's building.

What they have so far is well worth the money, gives you a lot to do and has so much potential for the future.", "timestamp_created": 1612530704, "timestamp_updated": 1612530704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 149, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.886429488658905029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88304596": {"recommendationid": "88304596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028743774", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11519, "last_played": 1666616534}, "language": "english", "review": "Got comfortable with the game.\nTackled the 2nd boss with 2 of my friends.\nWatched them and our longboat get one shotted by a 1 star Troll outta nowhere.\nDied 3 times trying to get our stuff back and lost another 2 ships.\nCried due to laughing so hard.\n10/10 would recommend. \n", "timestamp_created": 1615561419, "timestamp_updated": 1615561419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 158, "votes_funny": 49, "weighted_vote_score": "0.886249244213104248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86722918": {"recommendationid": "86722918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086525318", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5594, "last_played": 1615164175}, "language": "english", "review": "Much more polished than any other \"early access\" game I have played. Very fun and engaging. Model resolution is a little lacking, but it's so fun I barely notice and don't care. 92 hours as of this writing and only killed the second boss. I can easily see myself putting in 1000+ hours. Great value for the money. My favorite feature is that I can play solo or wirh friends, that is what was missing from Skyrim and Fallout 4 for me. This game is batter than Fallout 76 imo. The base building is amazing, and a double bonus VIKINGS!
