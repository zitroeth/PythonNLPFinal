But as it is right now, the balancing needs some big fixes. I'll outline a few issues ive been having that have made the game less fun\r\n\r\n1. Biggest issue ive had, the reactor system. Please, PLEASE either make it a lot less restricting, or remove it entirely. One of the best parts of the old game was being able to make massive machines that tore through everything. now every fight is agony because I get all this new fun stuff that I cant use because of some arbitrary limit put on by the devs. It makes hunting down parts basically useless once you've reached your limit.  At the very least, let us disable it in single player worlds.\r\n\r\n2. The resource grind is a lot. at first it wasnt too bad, it was still fun gathering resources and bringing them back. But again, due to restrictions like a tiny inventory space, you have limits to how much you can explore. this one I feel can be remedied by either taking away multi slot objects, or making it easier to increase inventory space. This one just needs a few tweaks tho\r\n\r\n3. the amount of enemies can be a bit much at times. It wasnt too bad in the original game because weapons would auto aim. but now you can only fight one enemy at a time. and when you have 3 or 4 techs swarming you, it gets rather difficult to not get destroyed completely. I do like being able to aim, but it would be nice to have some weapons auto aim still. maybe reserve aiming for resource weapons, or set some hot key, kind of like an aim down sights thing.\r\n\r\n4. Whats with the lack of normal blocks? all I can find are these weird connector pieces that restrict me on what I can build. It makes shaping my tech how I want more difficult, especially with the reactor system holding me back.\r\n\r\nNow, I would love to talk about what you guys added that I love so far.\r\n\r\n1. the graphics are fantastic! massive improvement and I have had no issues running it so far. mighty impressive, especially for an early access game. you guys definitely put some time into performance and it shows.\r\n\r\n2. the base building now is pretty awesome. I absolutely love how it has been improved in this one.\r\n\r\n3. having multiple worlds that are actually coherent instead of a randomly generated endless plane will be quite awesome. Super stoked to see how that turns out\r\n\r\n\r\nSeriously guys, great job. I had a ton of fun for the first couple hours until the issues got in the way. then it became a grind. Fixing those issues and giving players more freedom will definitely improve the game a lot. once those issues are fixed and the game is fun after the first couple hours, Ill definitely come back to it and change my review. I want to see this game improve a lot.

More info on it can be found here: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2313330/view/4168717862237664899?l=english\n\nSpecific responses to your points:\n\n1. In the update (that is live right now), we've expanded the reactor capacity and efficiency points of all cabs. the early game ones have been pushed up to a combined total of 220 to 250, the later cabs are now at a total of 360 to 400 across both reactor capacity and efficiency points. these new limits allow for much more freedom in Tech builds. Beyond this most recent update, we will be reintroducing the aux reactor blocks too soon. They're attachable Tech blocks that increase your reactor capacity. They were present in the demo but reliant on constant fuel burn, we're currently reworking them to occupy a restore (one of your three auto rebuild charges) instead. We also have plans for further progression-based expansions to enable even larger Tech builds beyond that too.\n\n2. Resource grind has been reduced in multiple ways. Resource lasers consume less power and generate less heat now, and the health of many of the resource givers (ores, rocks trees etc.) has been reduced. The common uses for resources have also been reduced too, carbon generators now burn raw carbon for 1 minute (up from 20 seconds) and many of the ammo recipes have been made cheaper and crafted faster. Once you build a fragmenter you'll also find that it yields more resources than before too. The cargo space for many of the cabs has been increased and the objective which teaches you how to build small cargo blocks (cargo expansions) has been updated to make it a clearer flow. All of that is in the current update. In the next update (likely coming next week), we're also taking further steps too (like stack size increases for all resources).\n\n3. We've not reduced the number of enemies in this update, but we have increased the number of blocks that they drop (back up to demo levels) and also increased the amount of ammo that they drop too, making it easier to stay in the fight. In the next update (coming next week) we have adjusted their combat behaviour to be less relentless (for example they won't fire continuously without any pauses anymore and their accuracy has been adjusted to make things more fair).\n\n4. Fair comment, our thinking was based on the idea that giving the GSO one block  (1x1x1 with 6 APs) at the start of the last game undermined interest in other hull blocks that came later (why use a 2x1x1 block when you can just use more of the old reliable one block?). Progression curves usually follow that you get weaker/more limited items early in the game and unlock better/more useful items later. But you're not alone in this feedback so we're considering options. Nothing concrete yet, but thanks for the feedback there.\n\nThanks for the positives in your review too and thanks for trying TTW out. I hope you like the update. Please let us know what you think once you've had a go.\n\nThanks,\nKris\n"}, "161227273": {"recommendationid": "161227273", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970944550", "num_games_owned": 832, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 2709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 719, "playtime_at_review": 1156, "last_played": 1713318147}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Day 1 Review (see additional headings below for updates):[/h1]\n\nLoved the demo, couldn't wait to play full release. I'm neither impressed nor disappointed. This is largely what I expected after playing the demo and as someone who has now played the original Terratech, the Terratech Worlds Demo, and now the early access release (day-1 at the time of writing this review), I'm frankly perplexed by many of the reviews left by others so far.\n\nLet's start by addressing some actually valid complaints: \n\n1) At EA launch, he game isn't MUCH bigger than the demo was. There are a few new parts here, a few new resources there, one additional biome, and a few previously permanently locked items are now unlock-able. One might have expected a bit more between the demo and now, but it really hasn't been that long since the demo, and has only been in \"early access\" for one day. Overall, I'd call this a minor but valid complaint at this time. Only time will tell if it will fester into a bigger problem or be quickly solved as the developers have more time to work on the game.\n\n2) The early game grind has indeed gotten a bit silly since the demo. Perhaps this is an attempt to slow down players while new content it being worked on, but it does feel bad taking significantly longer to do anything than it did in the demo. Had I not played the demo and therefore not had that point of reference, the speed might not feel as unnaturally slow, however in that case I'd also not have the knowledge that allowed me to make efficient use of my first few hours, which brings me to my next point.\n\n3) The progression and early base building mechanics are not well communicated. Without having discovered all this in the demo already, my first few hours would have been hopelessly lost, with basically no progress being made between trying to learn the basics and fighting the aforementioned grind. This point, especially in conjunction with the previous point, could be serious problems that turn away new players before they are able to give it a real shot, and need to be addressed asap.\n\n4) There are still a few notable bugs left over from the demo, and there are a few new bugs and quirks introduced since. No big deal, but it would have been nice to have seen them fixed since receiving feedback during the demo.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, lets move on to the points that others have made that leave me scratching my head:\n\n1) Everyone is claiming the tutorial cannot be completed. This is simply not the case. The tutorial is voluntary and can be skipped (which makes all the complaints of getting hard locked in tutorial nonsensical) but I played though it again here to see for myself what people were talking about, and had absolutely no issue completing the tutorial as expected. I'm going to have to consider this one user error or just straight up parroting misinformation. There's nothing that seemed like it would be hard for others to follow in the tutorial so I'm not even sure where someone could have gone wrong, but my only advice for new players is maybe actually read and follow the instructions, or skip the tutorial if you really just aren't interested.\n\n2) Game performance is not worse than the demo. It seems to be just about the same. \n\n3) The game is not crashing more than the demo. In fact it has not crashed at all for me so far while the demo crashed every few hours. \n\n4) The game is not some far cry from the original Terratech. The core gameplay loop is nearly identical between the two and just about every aspect of the game is an improvement from the original. There's more raw stuff in Terratech, but with nearly a decade of updates vs this game's first day in early access, that goes without saying. The only things that are truly missing and not just altered (and IMO improved) from the original Terratech are flying crafts and the R&D DLC. Both of which were updates and were not present at launch of the original game either. \n\n5) The game not being worth 27 bucks is... well its entirely subjective, but also a odd take in this day of soulless 80 dollar sequels with another $20 of all but required day-1 DLC, in-game payshops, gambling mechanics, battle passes, etc. Even the original Terratech is still 25 dollars, and adding the R&D DLC bumps that up to 32. Now add another 16 bucks for skin packs if you want the basic (and totally free in Worlds, by the way) feature of painting your creations. It's totally cool if 27 bucks is too much money for you personally to drop on an early access game, but the attempt to bill this as an objectively poor value is pretty wild.\n\n[h1]First major update (5 Days into Early Access):[/h1]\n\nI have personally put 20 hours in to the game since EA launch now. Unlike the demo, I have not experienced a single crash yet. Today's update has allegedly improved stability for others who have been experiencing crashes however. \n\nAdditionally, it cuts out a huge amount of the grind that I had mentioned on my day-1 review. Nearly everything that matters has been sped up, increased in yield, and/or reduced in cost as applicable. There are still a few spots where things feel off, like scrapping a piece of light ammo taking just as long as scrapping a 3 meter offroad wheel, but that's a minor late game inconvenience rather than the brick wall of early game grind that players were experiencing less than a week ago. \n\nPerformance remains steady and has not degraded as I've built up my base, teched up my vehicle, and triggered huge numbers of enemy spawns and debris all over the ground. In fact it should be noted that not only has performance not degraded since the demo, but the install size of the game is currently significantly smaller than the demo, despite the world being bigger and there being perhaps twice as many parts available. As such, I continue being perplexed by reports of poor performance.\n\nLastly, the camera height has been adjusted to match the demo. This is a welcome change and should address several of the early negative review complains.", "timestamp_created": 1711174108, "timestamp_updated": 1711613740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 140, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858720600605010986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161400659": {"recommendationid": "161400659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059479456", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1207, "last_played": 1712247255}, "language": "english", "review": "Having played TerraTech since the original early access days, TerraTech Worlds feels like quite a strange, but not unwelcome departure from the original. It's flaws are numerous, and the many negative reviews it has recieved are not without good reason. Despite all this though, there is something very interesting TTworlds does that the original TT never did:\r\n\r\n[b] Your resources are inherently more limited, therefore the way you utilize them actually matters. You can't always just build bigger, therefore you have to build smarter.  [/b]\r\n\r\nI think what truly defined the original TT was how the building system was both super easy to use, and allowed you to do really incredible things even without needing to put a whole lot of effort in. It was a very freeform creative experience that could go just about as far the player was willing to take it. However, to its detriment, it could rarely if ever present an actually interesting challenge. With the godlike powers of infinite storage which you could access anywhere at any time, effortless and easily farmable money, and after a bit of mission farming, an infinite source of every block in the game, standard campaigns weren't all that far removed from just playing creative mode. You could make the most incredible contraption, but it'd almost inevitably end up just curbstomping the AI without any need for much thought. \r\n\r\nTerraTech Worlds is an entirely different experience. Your storage is only handled locally through your base structures and cargo blocks. Your tech has a power limit on how many parts it can support at once. Most of your weapons require ammunition. Thrusters require jet fuel. The world is no longer an infinite randomly generated flat plane, but a handcrafted globe with a more deliberate chain of progression.  Heat, cold, and other environmental effects can influence your tech as you progress through the games biomes. You are no longer a god, but a mere mortal in a much smaller universe. \r\n\r\nNow, this more limiting direction removes the core strength that the original TT had of a super freeform creative experience, and trades it for a much more grounded and slower paced problem solving experience. As previously mentioned, it has its fair share of faults, but it also makes a concentrated effort into removing a lot of the originals weaknesses. While the two games are visually reminiscent of one another, in a sense, TTworlds shares very little game design ethos with its predecessor. It's not TerraTech 2, nor is it really trying to be.\r\n\r\nWhat I think TTworlds does really well is urging the player to keep building new techs/bases, or tweaking their existing techs based on what they're doing next. Starting out I built a jack-of-all-trades tech, but found myself switching over to building more specialized vehicles as time went on. Ammo felt a little scarce/slow to produce at first, but once I had a production chain from a silo going, I had more than enough to keep me going. As I started branching out and building multiple bases, the distances started becoming long enough that I felt it was reasonable to start producing jet fuel for thrusters. I felt compelled to build combat focused techs, harvester-focused techs, and cargo-focused techs not merely just for fun, but because it was genuinely impactful to dedicate my entire tech towards a role, whether that'd be for efficiently carving my way through enemy techs and hostile flora as I traveled to new places, collecting higher tier resource chunks in later biomes for processing at a forward base, or moving large amounts of resources/parts between bases. The way the game is set up made me feel as though I could only thrive if I worked for it, which I found rather satisfying in the end.\r\n\r\nNow, to some, this might all sound like tedium, and that'd be an entirely fair stance to take. It's clearly going in a different direction than the original, revolving around limiting the players resources, and that's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. Inventory management is also quite cumbersome, and base automation is very lacking in features as well. On top of that, the way you unlock part blueprints is tied to an unfinished money system, so the only way you can unlock all the parts for crafting is through replaying the game and doing the same missions over and over. Case in point, the Early Access title isn't just for show.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I think TerraTech Worlds is built on a really solid idea, but just hasn't quite stuck the landing just yet. It's just a bit too rough around the edges, a bit too grindy for the amount of content, and a bit too cumbersome for its own good, but the core design idea is great, and I've definitely had enough fun to at least recommend it as an interesting experience. Rarely do creative vehicle building games set out to challenge the player into constantly improving their craft, and TTworlds managed to do that to me in spite of all its flaws. I wouldn't recommend it in its current state as something to play long term (hopefully updates will come to change that), but I can recommend it as a fun little fresh take on the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1711329666, "timestamp_updated": 1711329666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846446037292480469", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162657424": {"recommendationid": "162657424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274459567", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 440, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1712867829}, "language": "english", "review": "I really feel that this game has loads of potential but i think that the devs misunderstood the reason many of us gamers loved TerraTech.

Seems like a lot of good ideas that aren't fully compatible with each other.\nBase building is defs an upgrade, but the automation aspects are a complete downgrade to how it was in TerraTech.\nVisually it is a step up from TerraTech.\nThe aspect of specializing with parts and cabs is cool.\nResources do not seem to respawn, so you will be scrapping A LOT of parts, and then the resources from parts.\nBase power system is... weird. You do not produce power per say, but rather, you have a power capacity. I'm still not sure what base batteries do exactly, or how they work. Machines take power capacity from generators. Generators will always consume carbon as power.\nAutomating using 'conduits' is a horrible process. One input One output. No filtering. No splitting. Inferior to conveyors.\nGetting to any sort of non-burnable power generation seems to be VERY far down the progression line.\n\nAs a whole, in my opinion, seems like a complete downgrade from TerraTech (Specifically, in mechanics) . I really hoped a lot of lessons learned on what was good in that game, were transferred to Worlds, but seems like they decided to ignore those aspects and start from scratch.\n\nI would say to give them some time and pick it up later down the line. For now , I cannot recommend.\n\nAddendum: Playing some more of the game, more issues crop up that I will add below:\n\n- Base building has a few cool ideas, but there is a HUGE downside to it, and it's not automation. Mobility. The base is static, where you build it the first time is where it will stay.\nYou can build multiple bases, but you have to build it part by part, you cannot blueprint one, nor can you move the original base without a full deconstruct... part by part (Or stacking everything to a single block touching ground, and removing that block).\n\n- Combat. Combat . Is. Horrible. It does not feel satisfactory at all. Techs have near infinite ammo and battery pools, and near infinite range on weapons. Your weapons do not. They have a limited ammo capacity, your battery is slow to recharge (no battery boosters or generators on tech of any sort). Lasers do not always shoot where you want them to. Projectiles have insane spread to them, and seem inneffective.\n\n- Difficulty and Exploration: For a game focused on exploration, you are significantly limited how far you can explore because of how the game is at it's base. Your tech has a capacity things on it. The combat issues really come into a perspective when you try to find some rarer resources, only to be swarmed by tech in an area.\n\n- Progression. This goes back into exploration. Resources for upgrading yourself can only be found deep into exploration. You cannot infinitely scrap enemy tech parts to upgrade yourself due to cab limitations, and the sheer fact, that you cannot get upgrade/rare resources by scrapping tech parts of enemies. Defeating a 'difficult' opponent, who has infinite battery, ammo, and range, is not rewarding. It just leaves behind common parts worth starter resources.\n\n-Design direction. And this is the BIG ONE. The devs decided to put experimenting with power limits and block gimmicks, above creativity. Blocks are shaped in a variety of forms, but a lot of those forms are very limiting. Everything seems to go along the lines of \"If I us X block, I HAVE to use Y block, which means I have to us Z, etc\". It's not a choice, you have to... like a very limiting class system. Blocks dictate design, not creativity of design.\n\nPS: If people didn't want this to be compared to Terra Tech, shouldn't have called it TerraTech:Worlds. A certain degree of \"We learned from previous game\" should apply. This is not it.

There's lots of detail, I appreciate the time you spent sharing your thoughts.\n\nWe've completed a balance pass today. It addresses some of your points of concern (power consumption and Tech reactor limits). \n\nOn some of your other points - We'll be adding splitters and mergers for base automation soon (they were in the demo but had to be removed for the launch because of some issues) and filters will be coming after that (neither of those will make the balance update, but will follow after)\n\nOn base power we are updating to only consume power whilst machines are in use, this is a common bit of feedback and we're listening. I felt like it would be simpler to just keep it as a headline power requirement number, but players understandably find it annoying having to turn things on and off to free up power, (again, not in the balance update, but coming after).\n\nStructure snapshots (saving and loading) and building with blueprints (we call this architect mode) will be included along with a load of other base building improvements in the summer update. See our public roadmap here: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2313330/view/4031353167275151705\n\nIn the balance update, we pushed today:\n\n- We have reduced the power consumption of resource lasers. The issue that you describe where your lasers are not aiming where you are pointing may be because of nearby blocks built around the laser which are limiting their turning arcs, if you give them a bit more space they may regain their full arcs.\n\n- The reactor limits on many of our cabs have also been increased (in the coming balance update) to give you more room to build.\n\nThanks for your feedback on unlimited ammo/power issues for enemies, that's a fair comment. We'll impose some firing pauses in their combat behaviours. We can't give them hard ammo limits or else they would eventually sit there doing nothing, which feels broken, but I take your point.\n\nI appreciate that you're not keen on the building limitations, the goal is to avoid the uncapped unravelling that happens at the end of the last game. Without limitations, you don't have to make any choices about which blocks to add and good choices are what make building well an accomplishment (IMO).

Its a great redo of the original TerraTech and even in such an early access its quite dynamic and excels what the original rendition touched upon and has a bright future, though honestly the price is quite steep.\n\n(For casual builders, aka 90+% of players)\nShort answer: If you like building with lots of freedom, like in TerraTech, do not play this game. Yet.\n\nLong answer:\nIn its current state, do not buy the game. The world is out to kill you at every opportunity, you have to grind A LOT to get anything done (ESPECIALLY EARLY GAME!), the temperature mechanic is boggus, the building system (the attachment layouts of tech blocks) is honestly unacceptable, the modifier system is rather obscure and detrimental (suspect to be why blocks are SO HARD TO WORK WITH), and the final area of the game, the arctic, is unreasonable as you go from 190*C to -100*C regularly unless you play and build very specifically and have the block you need FROM the arctic in order to SURVIVE in the arctic PLUS the fuel you need to run said block.\n\nMy biggest issue with this game is the modifier system as that clearly has played into why every tech block I try to use is a nightmare to work with.\n[list]\n[*]I go to make a late game tech with a big turret only to find out the turret piece I want to use has a SINGLE connection point on its top and bottom yet is a 2x2 block. Guess I can't use that.\n[*]I try to use axles to make wheels not ruin my reactor load only to find ALL axles only have effective attachments on their side (only one side too). Guess I can't use that. ...but I have to.\n[*]I try to use the attachments on wheels to work around axles only having side attachments, only to find out the wheel I WANT to use, decided to have a smooth surface rather than a connection point for no good reason other than to be harder to work with. Guess I can't use that!.. but I again have to.\n[/list]\nIn summary, the building system in unacceptable with how much the game screws with you on how blocks are aloud to connect on your tech. I believe its all because its an anti-cheese contingency for the modifier system. Oh also, the build system IN GENERAL is a pain to work with. The game loves trying to place blocks where you don't want them. Side note, the tech size limit is TINY!! IT'S COMICALLY SMALL!!\n\nDuring my 43+ hours, it always felt like the game was TRYING to screw with me. Either with horrible block connections, grind, or with funny plant that launches you 50 meters. Or maybe just an infestation of 10 plants that shoot lasers that make bullets look like nerf darts.\nNot only is the world a chore to tolerate, you also have no proper freedom in how you build in this game. If you are in any way a casual builder, avoid this game. I am still playing it as I am not a casual builder and enjoy these challenges.

As you know from TT1 we're always keen to hear what you think and are updating the game all the time. We've got another update which should be going out end of day today (by around 6 pm UK time). This update should address one of your points, about the Tech build limits. I've reduced all reactor costs of all blocks by either 20% to 30% or one point, whichever is greater.\n\nAs you'd expect, we'll be adding more blocks as we go. The reason we didn't give the GSOP one block with 6 APs at the start (like in TT1) is that it's one of the most powerful/versatile blocks in the game. Progression curves usually follow that you get better items as you go along, but we found that in TT1 players would usually ignore any other hull blocks that they found, because why not just use more one blocks? But perhaps we have gone too far with the limited APs in tricky orientations, we'll have to consider adding more APs or additional blocks at the start that are a bit easier to build with.

If you own Terra Tech (TT), enjoy that for a bit longer. If you don't own any of these two games, either buy TT or give this one some more time. \r\n\r\nMy Feedback \r\n(I am aware that this is early access and will update this review as time passes. Hence the date above):\r\n- The biggest issue has to be with creating the techs (vehicles) themselves. I assume that one of the pillars of this game is to build fun, creative techs and then going out to test them. That's very lack luster in this game. Even with the chassis the game gives you for completing missions I can not evolve my tech as freely as I do in TT. I've killed dozens of enemies and my tech has barely changed, because of how specific the parts that drop are. Blocks fit in VERY specific ways. resulting in gathering pieces to not meet the situations to use them. After hours of playing my tech looks SLIGHTLY different from when i started. Compared to TT, this experience has been disappointing. \r\n- The UI is a bit turn off. Starting with the way the name of items slowly blend into each other when selecting selecting through items or structures. That needs to stop. A step back is needed to evaluate functionality over aesthetics. \r\n- The base building revamp and limited storage for parts and resources anchors you to your base. Venturing too far out just to play Tetris with your inventory when you finally find some good parts and leave some behind is a bummer (Think Diablo style inventory). The exploration aspect of this game compared to TT is not even close because of that. Having to constantly go back to base to empty inventory and building silos to store resources and blocks (the tons of blocks that don't fit each other and can't make a decent tech) is not fun to me.\r\n- It's not optimized. I started with everything on Ultra and my PC fans were going nuts. Had to bring the graphics down and cap the FPS to 30. The game looked nice while it lasted, though.\r\n- The intro video was gorgeous and brought context to why we are there.\r\n\r\nIf the devs behind this game are the same as the guys who made TT, Given enough time, I can see this game reaching the heights of TT. It's the only reason i did not refund the game. As of right now, Terra Tech World just makes me want to play Terra Tech. The game has a strong foundation in place. It has a lot of potential.

But this one should have stayed with the developers for longer. Clunky. Weird mechanics. Building is a nightmare atm and NO AUTOMATION as fart as I can see it. \nSo if you want to feed every machine with the stuff it needs and not do anything fun in the meanwhile, buy this game.\nPlayers of the old TerraTech should give this one a few more months. Not worth the 30\u20ac.\n\nEDIT: Read some of the devs answers. All I read is \"we're working on it\" and \"we didn't want the easy blocks from the last game because people might find them boring\". I don't get that. Also I don't understand that a 1x1x1 block it the most powerful block because of 6 connections and we will get that later. Hu? Why did we get it from the start in TT1 an dhad so much fun with the game?\n\nI'd say the game is worth 15\u20ac at the moment, not 30\u20ac. You can drive, you can build (if you have the nerves) and you can shoot (with bad weapons that need ammo all the time and that you always have to aim yourself)\n\nWhat the game needs: \n\n1. More Clarity!\nI don't know how to build a new tech. I don't know how all these weird shaped blocks with just 2 or 3 connections work or how it would benefit me. I don't understand the reactor and why it can only power a Ford Fiesta when I need a Hummer to kill a lightning tree. I don't understand the mods on some parts. Do I really have to have an excel sheet open and calculate in advanced what to put on the tech? There is no real Wiki yet. There are videos on youtube from demos that feature parts that arent in the game right now because..... too much fun?\n\n2. More SIMPLE!!!! blocks\nI'm an engineer and when I play this game I think of work. How fun.\n\n3. AUTOMATION (just the basics please, and soon)\nWhy can I connect a silo to a machine in demo but not here? Why do I have to stand next to the scrapper to scrap all the weird shaped parts stack by stack? Even at the start of the game. Or maybe give me 3 tasks to do and give me the conduit then. Not 50 tasks and 2 updates later. (Coming back to \"it's out too soon\") \nBecause this is the game right now. Do tasks that get you money you don't need because where do I spend it? Then you drive around to get resources and bring them back to proccess stack by stack. At the same time (if my 2 generators and 2 batteries permit) I scrap all the parts I don't need or understand (mostly that) to get more resources to build.... well nothing because HOW DO YOU DO IT? \n\n4. More than one tech?\nAre we going to be able to have more than one tech? Are we able to have that now? I wouldn't know because I don't know how to build in a game that is 50% about building. \n\nWith all these flaws, I'm actually annoyed and think the devs just needed money and threw it on the market without having the game done to a degree that it's actually a game and not work.\nThere better be some No-Mans-Sky-esque update on the horizon and very soon.\n\n2. edit: 28.1h into the game and it's over for me. I don't have the patience to collect 100 Strontium when you get maybe 7 per trip before you get destroyed or have to run back to the base because you're badly damaged. No 100 Strontium means no new blocks to unlock or anything to unlock at all. For the last 10h I haven't gotten a new unlock. It's boring now and a waste of my time and money.

SMASH SMALL ROBOT! HAHAHA GO BOOM\" while they drool on themselves.\n\nIts insanely stupid how the devs managed to cater to the most crybaby playerbase from the original game.

Etc.\n\nThe ONLY thing holding this back from being a positive review, is the god damn UI. It causes so so so many issues. It is a terrible implementation and the devs absolutely REFUSE to fix it/change it/get rid of it. The devs do not even acknowledge any post or bug report about it. They are doubling down with it even tho it is a huge problem with the game.....\n\n------------\n\nFirst and foremost, this is absolutely not worth the 30 dollar price-tag. A buggy early access game that somehow manages to be worse than the limited demo from a few months ago? Nah. Nah nah nah. WTF did they do???\n\nNot only is the tutorial borked because they didn't update it to reflect the changes made to the game (when it worked fine in the demo), but it is way laggier than the demo, the camera is an absolute abysmal shit-show compared to the demo, overall crafting and base system is worse than the demo, etc etc etc.\n\nJust.... gimmie the demo back. lmfao how sad is it to say something like that?

Many aspects of progression are tied to building a base, but doing so ties you to a variety of mundane, repetitive chores just to keep the lights on. For example, your generators have a limited amount of output so they can only support so many active buildings at a time. If one too many of your structures are active at once, the power is tripped, forcing you to find and turn off devices until you can reset power. Buildings use power even when they're idle, so to avoid the busy work of literally turning things off and on to get work done you're encouraged to build power supplies. The first power supply you have access to requires Carbon to function and must be refilled regularly. A starting base will require 3-4 power supplies to keep all buildings active and that means you're either constantly refilling generators with carbon, or turning everything off but the one or two buildings you actually want to use at one time. This is just one example of the frustrating design decisions here.\n\nFurthermore, apparently TerraTech Worlds uses Epic Online Services - something I didn't know until EOS went down, literally preventing me from loading a saved, singleplayer game. It also doesn't work at all if you block Epic's data-harvesting endpoints. It also means you have to be online to play your singleplayer \"offline\" save. So that's great.\n\nI'd refund this if I could. My advice to prospective customers is to give this time.

I saw a negative review stating this is an incomplete game/full release and it isn't. I wish Steam would prevent people from leaving reviews who have a deep misunderstanding of how EA titles are rolled out. I don't mind seeing the negative reviews, but the ignorant reviews are mind-boggling.\nThat being said, I like the game. I'm easy to please, however. I've only got about 10-20 hours of gameplay into the original TT that I bought last week so I'm not \"set in my ways\". This game was sort of like coming out of a lava tube and having ice water thrown in your face as the building/constraints/etc. are completely different from the original. This is a bit annoying as others have pointed out since your tech is extremely limited.I think I'm almost tapped on Nibiru and I have yet to see a reactor expansion (not saying it isn't there, I just haven't seen it yet).\n\nConstructive criticism:\n1. Loosen up the spawn clusters. In some instances you'll be up against a 7-block scout and a fully beefed out Centurion will sneak up on you and donkey punch you.\n2. BBs. Need a viable way to continuously get these early (25 per quest doesn't help much). Or just have the tech unlock when you kill the right mob and remove BBs altogether.\n3. Axles and Frames - Make these make sense. If you're going to put a reactor limit on me, at least make it where I can hook the axles directly on to the frame instead of having to put 3 connectors on just to hook it in. Not sure if this was an oversight or just some drunken programmer wanting to make things asymmetrical, but my OCD can only take so much of this.\n4. Make optimization a priority. Things quickly turn into a slide show around the arctic/swamp. I've had to edit my config file to tone things down a bit. I have to do this with all EA Unreal Engine games until they're optimized so this isn't a hit, I just know someone is going to complain about it.\n5. Put in a fast travel system from base to base. Having to roll through giant clusters of annoying mobs taking constant pot shots at you to get from one base to another only to get caught on a jagged hematite node and I get smoked because I can't lift my chassis otherwise my tech starts melting is a bit much. The world appears to be around 20x20km and it feels like I'm being hazed every time I have to go get more Niobium. - Not a deal-breaker for me, just a wishlist item :)\n6. I don't know who calculated your land mass, but Nibiru is either 3/5 or 4/5 water. 69% land mass, unless you're counting the gigantic f off mountains, is hilarious. I crossed the ocean from west to east and I can honestly say, water covers more than 31% of the planet. Way more.\n7. World map. The mini map is cute, but I'd like to be able to drop waypoints on a world map.\n8. Stationary fragmenters - Who thought this up? Let me put this thing on a flat bed instead of having to tear my base down and relocate it every time I strip mine an area. Alternatively, get rid of seams and make mining a minigame like Star Citizen where you keep an even heat on the rocks or you lose your yield.\n8. If the answer to all of the above is \"Just play with friends and it'll be easier\", I'd like to introduce you to my anti-social self. I have all the friends I want and none of them play multiplayer games aside from my son. If I wanted to play a game with other people, I'd pick up FFXIV again.\n\nI have more thoughts, but I've been playing this fairly nonstop since release and I need sleep.

Aside from the grind, the most offputting moment in this game is the abnormal amount of open canvas that feels like there should have been more brushstrokes: an ore vein, more trees, or a baby in a trash can. This was not the case in the demo with more trees and veins, and in addition, the demo accidentally alleviated this by having a ton of enemies that resulted in a bucket of chaos. But now that we are in release, something went wrong, and the world feels empty.\n\nWell, there is only one planet and it is labeled \"easy,\" so I guess the fun unlocks when I wait for longer. \n\nSo why did I leave a positive review for this game? For me, it's novelty. I love Terratech and its style of basebuilding mixed in with survival, and now there are constraints, so I want to support this project. You should not take this gamble; I do not recommend this game in its current state. But despite all those years, the developers are still updating Terratech, so perhaps they wanted to make a good game that makes me want to see more.\n\nTLDR; If you like Gregtech New Horizons modpack from the hit game Minecraft, you will like this.", "timestamp_created": 1711161301, "timestamp_updated": 1711162200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696879029273986816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161297419": {"recommendationid": "161297419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042515043", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 401, "playtime_at_review": 322, "last_played": 1713118398}, "language": "english", "review": "I never leave reviews but saw this getting a lot of negative posts so wanted to try and share my experience..

Now that I've been working and have my 2nd or 3rd version of my scout and some facilities going at my home base... the grind doesnt mean anything to me.. in fact, if anything it makes me want to take care of my rig vs just crashing into an OP battle for no reason..  crafting ammo may be the only exception to that.. but even with crafting ammo...the required resources are pretty plentiful and allowing them to queue/craft while you are out and about really isnt a bad way to go...I think it's balanced and appreciate what the devs are trying to do here.\n\nI think part of the negativity is because we all remember TerraTech end game.. build whatever you want because you've got all the stuff in silos... If you expect to just jump into Worlds and not be challenged to try and progress, then maybe stick with the original.. but this game has promise and I am hooked.. in fact, i paused to write this but am headed right back into the game to continue trying to improve my base.\nwho knows where this leads... but after getting used to the UI, controls, and game progression... i noticed that i was having fun..and it felt like the TerraTech i've loved for years.\n\nApologies for the spelling and grammar here.. but im rushing cause i want to dive back in.\n\nOh..one last thing..for the Devs - WE NEED THE BATTLE MUSIC BACK... even my 8yr old (who has spent countless hours watching me play the original, commented that we need the battle music).. that is my only gripe..but im sure they will resolve it for us :)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1711231723, "timestamp_updated": 1711231723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695561647415161133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161448392": {"recommendationid": "161448392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018139299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1712336216}, "language": "english", "review": "graphically better than the og but they really took away from what made the first game so amazing.

Beyond this most recent update, we will be reintroducing the aux reactor blocks too soon. They're attachable Tech blocks that increase your reactor capacity. They were present in the demo but reliant on constant fuel burn, we're currently reworking them to occupy a restore (one of your three auto rebuild charges) instead. We also have plans for further progression-based expansions to enable even larger Tech builds beyond that too.\n\nFair comment about the block set, our thinking was based on the idea that giving the GSO one block  (1x1x1 with 6 APs) at the start of the last game undermined interest in other hull blocks that came later, why use a 2x1x1 block when you can just use more of the old reliable one block? it's the most useful/versatile building block you can get and we give it right at the start. Progression curves usually follow that you get weaker/more limited items early in the game and unlock better/more useful items later. But you're not alone in this feedback so we're considering options. Nothing concrete yet, but thanks for the feedback there.\n\nI hope you'll give the update a try and let us know what you think.

The main problem with this game is two fold.  One the camera system when building bases is a MAJOR TURN OFF and yet that is one of the focuses of this game (building a base).  The 2nd major turn off is the conduit system or should I say the majorly broken system.  When you have to add 3x more conduits to make something work 1/2 way its not fun, its more frustration, especially in their original TerraTech game they had a working system.  They have added and fixed somethings but for now I am not playing the game till another update comes.\n\nUpdate:  After the 4/4/24 update the game got even worse.\nDoing the certifications missions will cause two issues.\n\n1. Once you craft and install the small storage on your tech, base building and moving around large items from your tech to base, etc will become harder as only drag and drop will work.  Anything larger than 1 storage block will no longer be able to use the shift click, control click, etc because your tech default storage will be the small one you added.\n\n2. Doing the Certification mission gets ever more broken once you get to where you need Chlorine.  2 patches before you could find at least 1-3 nodes to mine around the beach so you could do that mission.  The patch before removed it and had only 1 that you could get two without too much trouble, just a short drive away and running by some shooting plants.  After the last patch however it can only be found near the lightning tree, good luck noob player, you will die.

However, it can take about 10 to 20 minutes to collect resources. Sometimes, it can take about 1-3 hours, which feels like a waste of time.\n\n\nSome guns require ammo; mostly, enemies drop ammo.

I thought I was skipped from that demo because I can't remember it, but this mission seems to have no failures or issues. Sometimes it's just boring for no reason, likely because expert players have already completed it before. Additionally, there is no loot drop upon finishing this mission, unlike in the original TerraTech. It feels somewhat limited, and I'm not sure why a license payment is required, especially if it was deemed too expensive to unlock.\n\n\nController: 7.5\n\n\nI don't have a problem with playing it, but you can remap controllers easily, and it supports controllers. It would be an advanced custom controller option for expert players, and custom firing would be nice.\n\n\nEnvironment: 3.5\n\n\nEh, I suppose that's alright, but the hazard area with the lightning trees and plants thingy is quite okay. I'm sure you can use a counter, like a Mobile Lightning Rod, to protect against lightning trees. I thought it was a cool concept to have stones and trees that can be destroyed easily, but it took hours to collect resources. I feel like I'm wasting my time, especially when there are occasional bugs that cause plant explosions that can kill you once or twice. It's just really annoying overall.\n\n\nUser Interface: 1.5\n\n\nThe user interface is causing me discomfort and confusion, and it also seems to have some bugs that need to be addressed.

But, I've noticed a little issue when trying to set the frame rate limit higher than 60. It won't go beyond that unless I set it to unlimited. Maybe this only happens when I play the game in windowed mode or there's some other small detail causing it. Anyway, it would be awesome if there was a way to tweak the settings and get around this limit.

More info on it can be found here: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2313330/view/4168717862237664899?l=english\n\nTo your points specifically:\n\n1. Resource grind has been reduced in multiple ways. Resource lasers consume less power and generate less heat now, and the health of many of the resource givers (ores, rocks trees etc.) has been reduced. The common uses for resources have also been reduced, for example - many of the ammo recipes have been made cheaper and craft faster. Once you build a fragmenter you'll also find that it yields more resources than before too. The cargo space for many of the cabs has been increased and the objective which teaches you how to build small cargo blocks (cargo expansions) has been updated to make it a clearer flow. All of that is in the current update. In the next update (likely coming next week), we're also taking further steps (like stack size increases for all resources).\n\n2. Can you please tell me more about your issues with base building? We have plans to improve the structure block placement soon, being able to lock to just change the depth axis when trying to position a structure will be useful.\n\n3. You're not alone in your UI frustrations, again, if you could please share some specifics it would help us knock issues out in the right order.\n\n4.

It is horribly grindy, resource stack sizes are just downright microscopic (30 units in one slot, awful.) which forces the player to spam storage units everywhere, which, by the way, take forever to craft.\n\nWhat happened to Plumbite? Fibrewood??? You already HAD fantasy resources, why did you transition to boring real life space crap like Carbon and Niobium? Where are the missions? Factions??? Licenses for those factions- OH, oh, I see, you have to buy individual parts in the shop after grinding your balls into a fine paste and factions are all but gone, thats cool.\n\nYou know, you guys had a really, really good thing with the original, what exactly happened here?\n\nLets go down the list of what isn't in this game, shall we? So we get an idea of how ABYSMAL this game REALLY IS. Conveyor belts no longer exist, the cute, funny, fantasy ore names are gone, techs no longer drop from the sky on drop pods and instead poof into existence from thin air, shops don't exist, you don't have an SCU (Containment unit, inventory for your blocks), delivery cannons, pace makers. Planets aren't procedurally generated, missions aren't procedurally generated, Corporations don't exist (Which might I add, means you don't unlock licenses for them anymore) components are gone, pumpjacks are gone, anchors are gone, underground resource nodes are gone, and airplane parts don't seem to exist anymore.\n\nDIRECT. DOWNGRADE.\n\nEDIT: SO! I have played this game for a few more hours, having gotten into the intricacies of crafting and primitive automation (I say primitive because HOO BOY, THERE'S SOME ISSUES HERE, WHY do we only have corners and straight line \"conduit\" pieces??? WHY???), I've experimented with some of the weapons, played around with structures and found Points of interest (Apparently, points of interest are... \"Fist cargo drums\" around the map that... sometimes have loot and.... sometimes have structures, sometimes.). I don't understand why each of our Tech Yards have to have a separate storage capacity, when in the game's established lore we have black hole storage units that just suck everything up and hold onto our entire block library for us to play with at our leisure, I get why it was done for balance, but why does it have to be so much of a slog to carry stuff from one point to another? I have to drive for 30+ minutes to get around the planet with horribly restricted inventory space, which means I end up leaving blocks, parts, ore, materials and stuff just laying around everywhere because I can't carry all of it (It really does not help when some weapons and blocks take up four inventory slots), now this wouldn't be such a big deal if stuff maybe despawned after awhile or if we had the aforementioned and previously lore established black hole storage units, but we don't, so I end up having to devote another 40+ minutes to trash pickup, god forbid something gets stuck in a tree or in an area protected by 8 shotgun plants, because then I have to waste more time I could be using exploring, mining or trying to figure out how to not freeze to death in the arctic poopy zone shooting stupid health bloated stormtrooper plants.\n\nNow onto the automation side of things, this one really peeves me because we had such a good thing established in terratech already that I don't see why it needed such a dramatic change, firstly, lets set an example in the original game: I drive up to my base, I park the rear or wherever my resource collectors are on my tech in front of a collector (Which usually also has wireless chargers for the batteries on my tech) or group of collectors wired to conveyor belts attached to my base structure, the collectors grab all the resources from the containers on my tech and begin moving them into delivery cannons, silos, to refineries, or to an already started project in one of my fabricators. The base has filters, so each silo only holds a specific type of resource, fuel goes to generators, refined stuff goes to the delivery cannons, etc. This is how it was in the original game, and it didn't take long to begin finding anchors and conveyor belts, there were even little missions where you get to go meet other techs that teach you stuff, you didn't even have to do these if you knew what you were doing, but you were rewarded with parts and blocks to use to improve your tech and base structure if you chose to do them!\n\nIn this game, you get NONE OF THIS, NONE, the conduits only pull from one specific slot in a crafting station and can't even be interconnected with things like junctions or what have you (Because they seemingly don't exist.) , so you end up having to devote an entire mega silo to a single object like the scrapper, which has four slots and 5 connector points, assuming you want to connect all of this, you need like 20 conduits to get all four of those fricken connection points all wired up to A SINGLE SILO! ONE SILO! ONE FRIGGIN SILO!! so you end up having to WEAVE a CONVOLUTED WEB of conduits and silos to get stuff where you want it to go assuming you can muster enough willpower to open every individual silo and adjust every individual object in your entire base, that is.\n\nEdit 2: Don't play it, don't buy it, not worth it, not enough content, nothing is properly explained, resource yields are incredibly low, even now.

I love the resource gathering of hauling chunks around after cracking them into peaces. do have one major issue with that system but I'm pretty sure it will get fixed and it's the camera getting stuck on the resources you have on your flat bed. Other than that I just want better tutorial stuff cause I was lost for a while as I didn't notice that plants could be destroyed cause they didn't have any health UI or hit sounds (might be fixed or fixed soon) and I want all the descriptions of everything to know what they do cause I was lost a bit. Also maybe adding some stuff to properly explain all the temperature stuff and reactor and efficiency stuff. Some info on exactly what all the little warning icon mean would help a lot with that. With all that said I'm pretty sure all of those will be fixed in the future if not the next update. \r\n\r\nI am loving the depth added to tech building and the base building. on that some ways to split resources evenly between 2 places would be super nice cause the way I do it now is medium silos cause they have 3 ports all in/out so it can kinda do the same thing but it's bulky and expensive so a 1 block splitter would be super nice. I'm not sure if I actually would want this but it's an idea that could be added depending on how the devs want things to be automated. Smart Automation like automatically only pulling the exact resources needed for making x block into the fabricators when you queue up a block (Like in Space Engineers) is an option but if they want a more satisfactory style system where you need to automate each thing in a factory like setup then maybe we won't get that. Both could work and be great but the Satisfactory style is the only way we have right now and it's not super great. works for automating the basics like bulk crafting things but not good for complex stuff. A mix of both is probably what I would want to see but IDK as the game isn't fleshed out enough yet to say which is more fitting. \r\n\r\nMost of the negative reviews I've seen are just people saying it's not finished which like no shit it's not even been a week of it being out in early access.

B-wait why's the review positive then?\nThe game needs work, But this isn't some overpromise underdev scenario it's just early access. I bought the game in part because I wanted to leave this very review and give some feedback on what I think.\nThis will be coming from the perspective of a TerraTech 1 player.\n\nSo please don't think I'm having a go at you over at Payload, Love your stuff. But I am about to bitch about it a bit in no particular order.\n\nI miss the physicality of the resources that was in the first game, where resources pretty much never get stored in some black box of an inventory, now items exist in a way that they do in most games and I feel the novelty there has been lost.\n\nThe menus, I dislike the angled menus and the cyan blue, Makes me think of ark survival evolved, I just want dark mode, dark grey background white text.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable things in the original for me was being able to effectively build a mobile base, and the later in the game you were- the less tied down to a central base you were. the sheer scale of what you could build was ridiculous in a good way, I feed like worlds may be trying a bit too hard to balance itself? Terratech was enjoyable in part because it was just a sandbox where you had a lot of freedom to build however you like.\n\nThe game is using upscaling at the moment, I don't know the exact details on what type or what settings, But I seriously do not like it, really bad artifacting where it's almost like screen burn in- I can understand if this is just around to make the Early access builds run well but it's just outright bad at the moment.\n\nA bit of Mario in Unreal so to speak at the moment, I think the blocks that make up bases and techs need to have some imperfections added to their textures to ground them better in the environment.\nActually getting on to bases, I don't like that they're a different connection size- like, If you've played space engineers there's small and large grid, that's the case at the moment in Terratech Worlds, This was not the case in the first game and I think I preferred it the other way.\n\nThe automation aspects of the game fall flat, Since techs are by their nature limited in size there's no reason to mass produce parts, and there's no way to automatically gather a limited but abundant amount of resources like the Auto Miners in Terratech 1.\n\nHow buildings handle their input/output kinda sucks, Each output slot needs it's own output pipe, which for machines like the scrapper which end up outputting a lot of different resources ends up with spaghetti conduits.\n\nInventories within a tech don't need to be labelled and separated imo, my suggestion would be that cargo containers (if you keep them) should just expand a unified tech inventory, right now I end up with 3 pages of different inventories and all the shift clicking functions break.\n\nThere's something very wrong with the sound for me, I'm using 7.1 Surround W/ Dolby Atmos, But hearing the sound in game it sounds either Stereo or Mono and quite compressed? Not quite too sure what's wrong but it's certainly not good.\nWhile talking about sound, I miss the bangin soundtrack from the first game, I really hope we get a new soundtrack that's just as good, but in the meantime I wouldn't be opposed to using the first game's soundtrack as a placeholder!\n\nI had no idea how to use the Mobile Lightning Rod at first, Died to a lightning tree thinking it'd activate automatically.\nCompletely missed that there was a Tab where you spend the currency to unlock parts and was very confused.\nI keep accidentally picking up buildings while in menus and it is frustrating.\nPlease add options and filters for what items your tech can currently pick up, my inventory keeps getting spammed with wheels and I don't want any more wheels PLEASE.\n\nThere's most definitely more that needs improving, I'll be checking in each update and updating this review each time.\nI have no doubt this game will do well with some love from the community and developers.", "timestamp_created": 1712390724, "timestamp_updated": 1712390724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564922511577606201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161203219": {"recommendationid": "161203219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987612786", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1713102443}, "language": "english", "review": "whos great idea was it to put ammo in terratech. all bots target you and wont stop following you", "timestamp_created": 1711150567, "timestamp_updated": 1711150567, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561579108238220215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1711576234, "developer_response": "Hey,\n\nThanks for your feedback.\n\nWe've pushed the balance patch that covers lots of areas.

And to repair your vehicle there's no cool green repair bubble nor are there blue bubble shields to protect you from enemies, I loved building my vehicle in TerraTech where I can recharge my twenty batteries with the solar block or something like a block that can produce power with resources.\n\n- Weapons: You start out with a laser turret but with your cab you have two bars of energy which means you have about seven seconds of shooting your laser before needing to wait for your energy bar to charge back up a second later. I point this out not because it's something bad, but because in comparison to the turrets that need crafted ammunition in order to be effective in combat (will not shoot if you have zero ammo) which could be a cool feature for survival but it doesn't make sense to me because the AI's you encounter have an infinite amount of ammo against you...and energy...whilst you have to craft your own ammo. This is a problem, at least to me, because if you want to travel far you need a lot of ammo and to craft a lot of ammo you're then at your base for a good ten minutes crafting ammo but then you realize you need resources so now you're stuck with lasers at two bars of energy and you have to encounter against enemies that don't shoot each other but only you and you're most likely up against three of them because the resources you've mined near home does not respawn...at least not in my case if it does or maybe a long cooldown.\n\n- PvE/AI: The AI's spawn rate is insane and they don't shoot at one another so you'll be up against three on average. They have infinite ammo but you don't...unless you're running lasers.\n\n- Resources: You have an inventory system to store resources which I love, mining is very fun, but this inventory for resources means there's no more cool collector blocks that'll hold your resources nor the conveyor system you'd see in TerraTech that you can visually see your resources being transported to one of your blocks to craft something or sell.\n\n\nMy thoughts: If you want to get rich quick ingame, drive to each enemy bases you see and steal their resources as AI pretty coocoo even with three of them most of the time so easy hunting if so otherwise enjoy the limitation the game provides in comparison to TerraTech...also there's no sorting for inventory I forgot to mention.\n\n\nThis game is still pretty early so may my review hold itself false one day, I hope, for now I'm going back to TerraTech.", "timestamp_created": 1711158925, "timestamp_updated": 1711159427, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559150755405426025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1711404148, "developer_response": "Hello, lead designer here.\n\nThanks for checking out TTW and putting some hours in, thanks also for playing TT1, I was lead designer on that too.\n\nWe've completed a balance pass today and will be testing it tomorrow and releasing it soon after (all being well). It addresses some of the issues you mentioned specifically:\n\nResource lasers now consume less power when being used.\nReduced costs and time for ammo crafting\n\nYou can find more details about it here: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2313330/view/4105666832538508033\n\nSounds like you've spent a lot of time playing TT1. One of the issues we noted was that when we gave you the GSO one block at the start of the game, we essentially gave you the best hull block possible (1x1x1 with 6 APs) it meant that from then on, you could usually ignore any other hull block (why bother with 2x1x1 or 2x2x1? just use more one blocks). Usually, power curves dictate that you get more powerful/useful items later in the game and start with weaker/more limited ones. That's what we're thinking this time around for the block set.\n\nIn addition to lots of other changes, the update above also includes expanded reactor limits for all cabs, making building a bit freer/easier.\n\nYou make a fair point about enemies having unlimited ammo/power. Someone else echoed your thoughts on another review. We'll prioritise getting firing pauses into their behaviours. We can't give them limited ammo or else they would run out and look silly sitting there not doing much.\n\nOn the resource transportation front, we have tractor beams and flatbeds for moving the physical resource fragments to a processing structure for more resource yield. The flatbeds are a little fiddly right now, we'll have improvements for them soon.\n\nThanks for giving it a look, I hope you'll check back again soon.\n\nCheers,\nKris\n"}, "161497459": {"recommendationid": "161497459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003778961", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 248, "playtime_at_review": 1582, "last_played": 1712703244}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently playing in early release and have to say it is very good.

This is a much better gameplay experience.\n\n[h3]Combat:[/h3]\nWith the camera problems fixed combat is now fun again and farming enemy techs for parts is actually enjoyable.\n\nRepairing is still a bit of a sore point with me though. I liked that more batteries gave more repairs in the demo. Batteries were costly and often came at the expense of armor and other parts so it balanced things out. Further if your batteries were killed you lost the repairs that battery could have given you, requiring a more careful building methodology. With [b]repairs no longer being a combat mechanic[/b] in any way (can't repair in combat at all let alone burn a repair early to save a weapon or battery), and it being entirely unrelated to your build [b]the game has become a bit more simple[/b]. Which is a sad development. \n\n[i]I feel that more depth and complexity without being confusing is the heart of Terratech in general. It's why I love how frames and wheels interact in Terratech Worlds as well as the buffs other parts have.[/i]  \n\nThe bugs around repairing and having your tech repaired with parts missing and dropped on the ground will probably be patched in the future but for now that's also annoying.\n\n[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]\nNot much to say beyond this is where the game should have been to start with. Massive props to the devs though for listening to the community and putting together this rebalance patch. As a player it was rough to watch the game go downhill all the while knowing it could be better having played the demo.\n\nGames a bit pricey, if it's on sale make sure to grab it.\n\n[h3]Quick Edit:[/h3]\n[b]Late game is pretty rough... ranging from just lacklustre to outright broken.[/b] \n-Mid game cabs are better than late game. \n-Becomes about environmental survival elements instead of fighting the ever more sparse enemy techs that never get stronger, (except one area in the ice biome).\n-The methods of surviving said elements are tedious and buggy.\n-Dedicated servers crash more and run worse than normal coop.\n\nI'm sure this will get fixed down the road but for now it's pretty terrible.", "timestamp_created": 1711141201, "timestamp_updated": 1712363148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1711572221, "developer_response": "Hello, lead designer here, again, again.\n\nWe've now pushed the balance update that I mentioned before, it's live now.

Laser works by *evaporating* portions of matter.

Reactor load something something. 3 blocks is your limit. So fun!\r\n\r\nIn TT1, you may create fully automated factory to produce anything at a decent rate.

When you harvest for too long, your vehicle temperature will go up and drain your battery faster (at least I feel like it?)\n3. Limit how many blocks player can have on their vehicle  \n4. So many resource grinding instead of fighting the enemy - acquire new blocks - fight stronger enemy.\n5. Base building which comes with too many of steps to gather-refine resources in order to get what you need\n6. Blocks are really expensive to unlock instead of leveling the pass like Terratech 1\n7. You need to manually bringing the blocks that you don't need and transfer them to base. And there is a limitation of 100 blocks you can store at the beginning base.

I would say that, overall, I am enjoying the game so far. It feels like the original TerraTech but is different enough to feel like a game of its own rather than a simple re-skin. I would say that this game, at the current time of writing, is a slight letdown compared to the original, but with a bit of tweaking, it could be just as good, if not better. I know there are a lot of bad points I mention here, but they could easily be turned into good points with care and attention.\r\n\r\nSo, the bad points:\r\n\r\n1. Several of the systems feel overly complicated and clunky. This is most evident during storage and moment of Materials. Even though there is some automation, most moving stuff between containers must be done by hand. There is some effort to link them with \"pipes\", but they often fail to fill fast enough to keep up with production/refinement speed and take materials almost at random from the silos, meaning you have to babysit them.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest things I loved about the first game was the ability to auto-sort various materials vi filters. This particular function is absent this time around. Hopefully, it will be implemented soon. Also, limiting the mounting points on the storage silos is incredibly limiting and frustrating.\r\n\r\n2. The power grid is both a blessing and a curse. It is annoying to have to manually select which buildings are powered or unpowered in a 3D first-person view. It is also painful to have it reset every time something goes wrong. If you run out of power, you must manually turn it back on once you have solved the problem.\r\n\r\n3. Navigation could be better. There is no heads-up compass, the map, when brought up is more akin to a local scanner, and it is far too easy to get lost. The first game was similar in this regard, but this somehow feels even worse. The only easy glance indicator is a tiny disc above your main cab with indicators of any base/dropped crates. The small scanner is also tied to your cab block, which can be obscured if you try to place your cab in a defended position.\r\n\r\n4. Vehicle building is another item that feels like a \"Side grade\" from the first game. The new game acts as if it is deathly allergic to the \"basic block,\" Making any build fiddly and irritating. Awkward mounting points seem to be put there just to drive me crazy when building. This takes away so much of the freedom of design, and I feel it is a massive step backwards.\r\n\r\n5. Many mechanics feel unbalanced and need to be refined. The \"Scrapper\" (it has another name, but that's what it is) feels pointless right now. From what I have seen, it doesn't actually give you any more materials than manual mining and requires more/higher-level tech and power to use. This will hopefully be sorted out soon.\r\n\r\n6. There are no mines anymore. Unlike the first game, you cannot set up mining rigs, so all of your material gathering has to be done manually. There are also no base defences, so you are often interrupted from your already annoying base work to have to defend it.\r\n\r\n7. The amphibious ability is just bad. For the actual speed you can move in deep water, floating techs may as well not be there.\r\n\r\nOkay, that was a rant, but now, onto the good stuff:\r\n\r\n1. I love the closer feel to a survival game they have taken. Ammo, though at first annoying, adds to this, meaning you need to balance the number of things you \"rig\" carries to survive/fight/mine while out in the world. No one rig will be perfect at doing everything, which encourages you to have several \"rig ideas depending on what you plan to do in the world.\r\n\r\n2. The other techs out there aren't the only problem. You will face environmental hazards and native critters that will not like you. I Love this change; it feels great.\r\n\r\n3. When harvesting, finding the weak points on nodes is novel and feels rewarding when you get it right. The density of nodes felt sparse when I started, but a recent patch has fixed this. Good job!\r\n\r\n4. Combat feels like good old TerraTech fighting, bits being blown off, needing to aim for other tech's weak spots to cripple them. I love it.\r\n\r\n5. Self-healing is a fundamental power, and the number of \"block repairs\" powers is a nice touch. Both feel like a medical kit for a survival game. Feels good. Please keep.\r\n\r\n6. The love/hate feeling of the base power grid is here again. The idea that power is linked through the floor is good; please keep that. Fix the other bothers with it, and this is a thumbs up all the way.\r\n\r\nSo as a final note. Like the general direction the game is going, but could be refined.

Not as bad as most of the other reviews say it is in my opinion. Worth it if its on sale.\r\n\r\nThings I Dislike:\r\n\r\nDying can be a bit annoying and resource locations could be made more obvious, but other than that, its a fun game. The main problem is things that aren't obvious. I couldn't figure out you had to shoot the base of the angry plants to destroy them until later. I didn't know where to find phosphorus and spent hours looking for a rock when I was supposed to shoot plants. I didn't know niobium comes from tantalum rocks. I'm still unsure about how tungsten spawns as I only found a single small rock of it.\r\n\r\nThe mission reward system could also change. Every time I completed a mission I felt underwhelmed by it giving me 20-40 BB$. It felt like the reward from the mission wasn't the BB$ but it was the chance to get a better reward from the next mission.\r\n\r\nEven with the tech reactor buff, armor could probably take up less power. I cant build a vehicle with decent weapons and also not be destroyed immediately because of lack of armor. Refining lots of resources can be a hassle as you have to keep shift clicking them in because it only has one input slot.\r\n\r\nThings I Like:\r\n\r\nThe reactor buff after the demo makes building more fun. \r\n\r\nI like the scrapper a lot, it makes common resources so much less of a stress. \r\n\r\nThe biome system is very unique and I actually enjoy how the biomes aren't so vastly different. \r\n\r\nBecause of the lack of weapons at the start, when you see an enemy with a gun you don't have, its even more exiting to try and take it without damaging it. \r\n\r\nI like it that you can forcefully overload your reactor to survive the arctic and that it dosen't damage your ability to regen battery as badly as the demo.\r\n\r\nThe manual aiming system is much more fun to use than automatic.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic terrain deformation with tire tracks in snow and broken resources is really cool.\r\n\r\nThe \"electrici-trees\" are thankfully not covering every single inch of the blue tree biome anymore compared to the demo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestions/Bugs:\r\n\r\nLike I said earlier, things could be made more obvious where to find them or what they do.\r\n\r\nI dont know if this is completely intended but when the reactor is in the \"hot\" range, rocket fuel gets consumed extremely fast when using a booster.\r\n\r\nMining lasers dont get a discount when put on a weapon mount, I'm also not sure if this is intended or not.\r\n\r\nNiobium is way too uncommon when mining tantalum rocks.\r\n\r\nBoth lithium and phosphorus could drop more. Or make electrici-trees breakable again.\r\n\r\nThe swamp rust/poison/whatever should be more obvious on what it does and what it comes from. It also takes too long for it all to expire, even while in water.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1711396726, "timestamp_updated": 1711396726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161406643": {"recommendationid": "161406643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164013764", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1035, "last_played": 1712447635}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and good detail.

I easily filled my 100 slots of parts in a single hour, and thats after I broke down all basic and basic offset wheels, which was close to another 50 parts. When you break down parts, you get resources, and a significant amount I might add. The grind is really not bad, and once you start breaking down parts, becomes almost nonexistent. The part people complain about the tutorial not giving clear instruction is valid. It comes to a point where it asks you to build a small storage, but it doesn't tell you that requires a block fabricator, which wasn't an issue in the demo from my memory.

The devs have gone with a 'push' style of power generation rather than a \"pull\" style. Basically, your generators push out the same amount of power all the time, burning the same amount of fuel all the the time, and then if there are systems that need it, they'll take it. Most other games of this genre use a 'Pull' style of power management whereby the generators only produce what's required by the systems that are using it, and burn fuel accordingly. If a unit isn't actively operating on something, it should have either zero power requirement or at least a very reduced amount. All processing units pull their full power load even when not operating. Further, non-fuel based power systems only work if there is a fuel-based system on the grid and operational. Solar, Battery, and Wind power are not allowed to function on their own if the carbon-burning system is not also turned on and burning fuel.\n\nThere does not appear to be a way to 'clear' an area of mob spawns. You have to fight your way through the same mobs every time you want to venture out away from your base. They are endless hordes and essentially keep you trapped within a few km of your base.\n\nUpgraded cockpit units do not give you more generator power to work with. They seem to have better 'efficiency' but that mechanic is not adequately explained in game in a way that will give you enough information to take advantage of it.\n\nMinor quibble: Mineral mining debris produces carbon, not silicon. There are beaches, but you can't mine them for minerals, most of which would logically be silicon. \n\nI got this for my son and I to play over his spring break and I absolutely regret buying it, but we're past the return point for hours, so I'm stuck with it.\n\nEdit 42 game play hours later: I still have issues with the power system being push, rather than pull. Devs have been responsive to a lot of other issues, however, and have, for now at least, extended fuel burn time as a band-aid. Drop rates have increased but I'm still wondering why there is such a difference between Tantalum and Niobium given that they're listed with the same rarity (common).

If you're new to TTW then it probably seems kind of ok, but if you're coming from TT this game is trash. They added a ridiculous amount of constraints with literally no way to improve on them and there's like 40min of actual content in the game so to help that they made everything ungodly slow. I played the game for like 10ish hrs and both my offence and my mining speed (the two most important parts of these games) were exactly the same as when I started. On top of that the game is just super buggy. A lot of people are having trouble with the tutorial and on top of that the 'Objectives' in the main game have a chance to bug out and the only fix is to restart your save.\n\nAs much as I wanna like this game it really feels like people who are just abusing the TT IP and don't like the player base. It needs a slough of re-balancing before its even bearable to play in single player, oh yea btw, the ENTIRE game, and almost all if not all of its mechanics and numbers are scaled to be played with a party of 3-4 players, so if you have less than that progress is at least 3-8x slower lol. Like any of my friends are going to by a 40$ car wreck of a game.\n\nTLDR: Wait to buy it, either when its much steeper on sale, or in a few years when the game is actually put together.

That being said getting 1 shot by lightning trees or gang banged by 6 techs at once is kinda fun so who knows.\n\nEdit 1: After, i wanna say 2 balancing pathes?

IMO the carbon burns to quickly, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing but when you also need carbon to build your base so you run out very quick. It isn't a challenge to get carbon, but its highly annoying having to always run out to get carbon when you are in the middle of crafting your base, or parts, or other things. \n\nThe camera angles are awkward when base building. You always have to rotate around your vehicle, so if you are base building you are limited to the circle around your vehicle. They should fix this by when you dock your vehicle you get a free roam camera to go around and build as much as you want all over the base.

No. \n\nSometimes to move forward change is needed.\n\nTerratech Worlds is the sequel to Terratech (2018) with a complete overhaul to the game.  One of the things they've done to make it more challenging is the introduction of the \"Tech Reactor Points\"  Basically each cab now puts out varying amounts of energy in the form of Reactor Points, and each part you attach to your cab deducts one or more points.  Some parts can deduct points as well. So you're no longer able to build lag inducing tech's that stretch out to the Horizon.\n\nIn this reviewers opinion..  This is a positive.  Why?\n\nIn the original game it was way too easy to breeze through the missions.  Every thing you killed could be instantly added to your tech.  Once you got to a point where hover-pads were available, you could build a giant floating platform of death.  Too high for the enemy techs to shoot at while you rained down hell from above.  Where is the fun in that?  Where is the challenge? \n\nWhile some reviewers are crying \"It's micromangement hell\" the developers have made some changes to make less micromanagement.  For example: Shield and Repair bubbles are gone.  After a battle your tech heals automatically. You no longer have to pepper your tech with shield and repair bubbles, or worry that you accidentally left one part of your tech naked to the elements.\n\nThis new game also focuses on base building and crafting.  2 things that were optional in the original Terratech. In the original, you could essentially build a base on wheels.  Like a city from the movie \"Mortal Engines\" your tech could just run over the landscape sucking up everything.  This is no longer the case as now base blocks are base blocks, and vehicle blocks are vehicle blocks.   You can't put one on the other which leaves a nice bit of separation of duties.    One thing I see other reviewers complaining about with this aspect is \"Power Management\" but honestly, just build another power plant or two and you're good.\n\nCombat has ditched the \"Spacebar Simulator\" aspect.  You actually have to aim now, and different weapons feel like they have actual mass behind them. For example, you can flip over a tank with your shells to expose the cab, then chew up the cab with your lasers. It can be difficult sometimes because with ballistic weapons you need to lead shots, but that's part of the challenge.  You have to be a little more strategic in how you engage enemies because you are limited now. Hiding behind trees, boulders, or even leading enemies into traps with the Flora.  All of these changes to combat make it feel a little more like a combat simulator, and less like a shooter.\n\nGraphically, it's a huge boost from the original.  Biomes are lush with Flora. Mountains actually feel like mountains.  There are changes in weather, something that was missing from the original, and Water.  People had begged for water for so long.  Everything has been revamped and dialed up to 11, although I think it would be neat if they added fauna in addition to the flora.\n\nCrafting also got a huge revamp. Recipe's have been simplified.  (at least at the level I'm on now) Each recipe is only 4 elements.  Elements are either raw, refined, or pure.  Gone too are the lag inducing conveyor belts, replaced with sleek new pipes.  Some of the factory stuff from the original is there, and some of it is completely new.  One thing new in bases/craft are base additions that give you some resistance to the damaging effects of heat, acid, cold, etc.\n\nNow the game is not without its faults.  I think base management could be improved a little.  For example, highlighting a base component and pressing E.  The way those windows open up takes up nearly the entire screen, and if I have to switch to another base module, it's kind of a pain.  Even just building a base can kind of be a pain just with the funny angles you look at stuff.  Maybe do something like the old NES master blaster, where I can jump out *just* to build and manage my base.\n\nOverall though, I loved the original terratech, and I really like where this one is going.

The developers have issued statements saying they've heard us loud and clear, and they'll try to adjust the tuning to make this game more enjoyable. Not entirely sure why things ended up more restrictive (efficiency cap, things cost more, enemy techs drop less) from the demo to early access, but this is a good start.\n\nTo be clear, this isn't a vote against resource limits. I think they're a fantastic idea and would love more meaningful building than the original TT, however with the tuning set the way they were at EA launch, they were very restrictive and got in the way of fun more often than not.\n\nOriginal review below:\n\nThis game is simply put, boring and excessively grindy. It seems like the developers of this game are so afraid of how the building system from the original TerraTech turned out (where people slapped hundreds of guns on a tech) that anything that deviates from \"4 wheels, 2-3 guns\" is immediately smacked down in the name of \"game design\" and \"balancing\".\nEven when people did figure out cool ways to use the existing blocks and reactor points system, a new efficiency cap mechanic was added, very much in a \"bUt NoT LiKe tHaT\" sort of way. This feels very much like the Henry Ford quote \"Any color the customer wants, as long as it's black\". The developers seem so afraid of how things ended up in the previous game that they're willing to sacrifice everything, including player fun, to ensure that it doesn't happen again.\n\nI understand that this game is still in early access, but there just seem to be so many user hostile design choices that have nothing to do with polish. You get a single save for your world, iron man mode. This prevents save scumming, but also means that if there are any problems with the save/load system, there are no backups for your save. I'm now left with a 4 hour playtime save that crashes my game immediately upon load. That coupled with the amount of grinding in lieu of proper game design has left a really sour taste in my mouth and I don't think I'll be back. \n\nAs it stands right now, this game is very much deserving of its less than 50% positive review score.", "timestamp_created": 1711265499, "timestamp_updated": 1711425544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514292359352111816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1711400501, "developer_response": "Hi, designer here.\n\nThanks for putting the hours in and for sharing your feedback.\n\nWe've completed a balance pass today and will be testing it tomorrow and releasing it soon after (all being well).

You can find more details about it here: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2313330/view/4105666832538508033\n\nI know you're not keen on the building limits, so we've expanded them on the available cabs in the (coming balance pass. Starting at 220 for early cabs and going up to 400 for later cabs (these totals are combined reactor limits and efficiency points). \n\nWe will be adding more progression-based methods for expanding reactor limits beyond cabs too soon, not this update but likely soon after. Aux reactors were in the demo, but are currently being reworked to occupy a restore rather than burning fuel as players we not keen on a constant burn or running out in the middle of a fight. Again, more are planned beyond those two as well.\n\nWe're not trying to stifle your Tech builds, just trying to make it more of a satisfying achievement to build something impressive through progression and to be able to offer real challenges to use your end game Techs against in the later stages of the game. More unlimited/creative ways to play will follow, further down the line too.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for the input, please do let us know how you get on after the update.\n\nMany thanks,\nKris"}, "161356558": {"recommendationid": "161356558", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969658388", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 661, "last_played": 1712407404}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has none of the soul of the original game, and I don't see how the game can match that game without a serious make-over.\n\nI was worried about this when playing the demo, but held out waiting to see if the full game would open up in a better way after a few hours. It does not.\n\nGraphically it looks great, but lacks the original's style.\nThe UI is just abysmal and clunky.\n\nThe original had a great system where all blocks could be attached to everything with some limitations regarding angles and attachment points. This let you build vehicles, emplacements and massive mobile bases all using the same system. For some god-awful reason they decided that bases are now built from a separate pool of parts making them cumbersome and killing the entire concept of a nomadic mobile base. The lack of a universal item storage also means it's a huge pain to move your base once you set one up. Generally speaking, the pool of parts 10 hours in is extremely poor. \n\nThe charm of the original manufacturers is just gone. \n\nManaging the base is intentionally made cumbersome by the way the power system works with no way to toggle things in bulk or manage in a centrally managed way. Maybe this is something that unlocks later, but after 10 hours of fucking around with this system, I'm just fed up with it.\n\nIn the previous game, all items were a physics item. You could suck up both equipment and resources and carry them in a physical way. This game has none of that. Once dropped, resources become a number in your inventory. The only resources you carry physically are the chunks you carry to a fracturing base part, and that is a cumbersome method that takes forever to shuttle 1-2 items at a time.\n\nThe balance is just abysmal. You're constantly grinding for resources to craft even the most basic items. It takes minutes of waiting to craft a few hundred rounds of ammo, that you expend in 10 seconds of shooting. The sheer swarm of enemies that are constantly respawning, have infinite ammo compared to you, and always gang up on you means you are always just trying to find resources for ammo, than actually progressing and exploring the world.\n\nI realize the game only just arrived in only access, but I'm having a hard time seeing how this game can be salvaged.\n\nBalance wise, it would help if natural resources dropped like 5 times as much, and your inventory could store more along a similar scale. I would tone down the spawns and give the player tools to deal with the currently-invulnerable hazards.\n\nStructurally, there are huge quality of life improvements that need to be made to bring it closer to the charm the original had.

It's doing a similar thing with strap blocks and guns to wheels and a cab and go but in a very different way and much more focused on the base building. That seems to have annoyed some people and honestly, if they bought this expecting \"sequel\" then I don't blame them being annoyed. An aspect of it I did really like is the tutorial is short and to the point and after that off you go.

A toggle on/off on that module imo would be far better as right now it's more annoyance than challenge.

Let me give you My insight on this game, given my experience on the former title (300 hours on the first game.)\n\n1. Game Mechanics: Honestly, there's definitely ups and downs, but i can maybe only list off 2 or 3 downsides at most, while my ups are vast. For example, the new storage system is a big step forward, especially for the resources. Gone are the days of the resource receivers and in comes the inventory. It honestly was such a pain with the old system, and i feel that this is a lot better. However, this is also where we can spot the first downside - space. Tech parts seem to make up a large portion of one's inventory, meaning that you need storage ASAP. Thankfully the game gives you a storage straight off the start, but I feel like this just isnt enough for how fast some people can acquire parts (myself included). Another positive is the new building system. In  my eyes, this feels like 2 steps up in one, because of 2 major things the game has implimented. The first is the dedicated blocks for the base building, which means that finally, tech pieces cant connect or use base blocks. This was the main reason i never touched bases in the original game, as it just felt like such a hassle to get all the blocks needed while taking into consideration the blocks on my own tech, but now, that's been solved. The other half of this is the placing themselves. The blocks now actually go to where you want it, unlike the last game which felt overly-snappy, and wouldnt move off the nodes it first went to.\n\n2. Combat: As it stands now, I do honestly think that there can be improvements. As me and my friends co-op world unfolds, we often find ourselves completely swarmed by enemies, much more then the previous game had. I feel like spawnrates are just too high at the moment, but if someone knows a setting i happened to adjust or forgot to change, please feel free to write an equally long comment on this, and try to make me feel ashamed about myself for voicing an opinion (Look my humor isnt great.) Another big thing, that i have seen previously mentioned is the lack of damage a weapon does. Honestly in my experience, I call BS on this. My current tech has only 2 resource lasers and 2 machine guns, and i find this more then enough for most techs.. however, this leads to the other part of their complaints. Ammo. I am in full agreeance on this with the people critical of the game - something about crafting ammo in TTW just feels so.. foriegn. It just feels like an extra step in logistics, and in my opinion, something we could've gone without. But I do fully understand why this mechanic was created,likely because of how ridiculous techs of the original game were as far as firepower went, so this was likely their way of stopping that.\n\n3. Literally anything else: Okay, this is probably gonna turn into a rant, so grab your popcorn. Firstly, Im gonna touch on all the things I think the game can add and help improve on. First thing to be improved: UI. Now, i dont find any issues with how it performs, the only thing i really just wannt see is the ability to customize the color, just to make it more to ones liking ( dont know how easy this would be.) Another thing - being able to change the color of base tiles that you place. Again, dont know if this is in the game or not, but it'd be nice to change the color from the standard orange.\n\nid give this a solid 8/10 for launch, one of the best recent games thats come out on launch, I dont care what standards other people have.", "timestamp_created": 1711148084, "timestamp_updated": 1711245116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501385033130645752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161199495": {"recommendationid": "161199495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127641317", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1711231954}, "language": "english", "review": "it's pretty good, but the battery system is IMO, much worse than in terratech. also, you can't rebind all keys! the music also barely seems to play.", "timestamp_created": 1711147516, "timestamp_updated": 1711147516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501385033130645752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161186914": {"recommendationid": "161186914", "author": {"steamid": "76561199518220098", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1713217349}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1711137174, "timestamp_updated": 1711137174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501385033130645752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161502778": {"recommendationid": "161502778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029431443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2065, "last_played": 1712354164}, "language": "english", "review": "At first I wrote a bad review, but the developers addressed all the problems in a recent update and now it's back to being an awesome game.\n\nEdit after 33 more hours.\nI ended up hiding the game.

The demo was very interesting and it made me very excited to play the early access, but I expected to see an improvement, not a downgrade.

However, the game doesn't introduce some king of chest or external storage early on?? How am I supposed to store all this stuff? I crafted a station called \"Storage\" or something, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to use it because nothing has a description of what it's supposed to do. It's just the name of the block / workstation / component.\n- There are also many issues with the UI and lots of QoL stuff related to how you should use the inventory, workstations and other interactables that are just not implemented at all.\n- The bots just follow you non-stop and always hit their shots, while you have variable aim that just gets worse and worse as you keep shooting.\n-  Whose idea was it to introduce an ammo system again?\n\nAt this price point and in this first stage of early access, I don't recommend it to anyone.

I view that both have the block tech mechanics from the first game, enemy techs, and resource gathering and crafting, but that's about where the core similarities end.\n\nTerratech Worlds is an interesting game in its early access stage. I had connection issues at launch, though those worked themselves out, and the controls took a bit to get a hang of (For the first hour after the tutorial I felt like the reason why I couldn't move my controller cursor was a bug. It wasn't.)\n\nFirst off, the subtle elephant in the room. This won't likely be noticeable unless you do multiple saves, or play singleplayer and multiplayer: The worlds aren't randomly generated, from what I can see, and what the community has told me. If this is how it'll be going forward, I'll be mostly disappointed, because part of the reason why I love Terratech so much is because of the replay value whenever a new content update drops.\n\nNext, the reactor and axel/frame/weapon mount system and ammo/inventory systems. I actually like these balance changes compared to Terratech. A few glaring issues I had with Terratech was the amount of weapon/bullet spam a lot of mid-to-late-game enemy techs had, and is part of the reason why I decided to start playing around with Hawkeye blocks in that game before the release of this one, as their larger weapons are slow but powerful. Seeing an ammo/energy resource system in this game made me gleeful, as it means that trying gun spam here will only eat through your ammo/energy way faster, and will leave you vulnerable. But also seeing ways to make your wheels and weapons more efficient makes it feel more balanced. Overall, a positive change.\n\nThe resource gathering, at first, started to feel like a slog. The moment I found out about seams, that all changed. I love this mechanic. It adds variety, and makes gathering resources with ballistic weapons a bad idea against minerals without making resources painful to deal with.\n\nThe changes to how blocks fall off your tech and how repairing works is also a great improvement. There have been times where I forget to screenshot my tech and lose a LOT. Having it this way is makes recovery a lot easier and less punishing to your tech.\n\nI like the conduit system, but just having straight and corner conduits to work with is a bit annoying without having any sorting or splitting to automate just slapping debris and carbon into a silo and having it all turned into refined carbon.\n\nSetting up base anywhere besides your spawn area is awful. I tried setting up base near the biome with blue trees, and I could not get any of the missions done, as both me and my base were absolutely PELTED with enemies with higher-grade weapons (especially plasma weapons) that I just couldn't deal with. Combined with how high-up the camera is, and I just had to restart from scratch.\n\nI had a severe framerate issue when I simply looked at the sky, even on the Steam Deck with all of the settings set to \"Low\", which was kind of obnoxious to deal with. The game could definitely use some optimization.\n\nI like the licensing changes, however, I'm sad that acquiring licenses to a corporation's blocks was not a mechanic that was brought back.\n\nOverall, I like the direction that the game has taken, and I look forward to see where the game goes from here. It's not without its flaws, but those are expected in early access. I give this game a rating of 7/10.

Balance to charge, laser time/heat, and the overall rebalancing of the cabs to have some merit to getting more then the starter one!  Great start, and I can already FEEL the dramatic change just the laser and reactor charge has done for the game!  Keep up the good work!\n\n\n\n(Original Review)\n\n[strike][i]I never played the original Terra Tech, but it always slipped my mind.  \n\nI tried the demo of Terra tech Worlds a short while ago, loved it, even as short as it was.  \n\nNow, the EA release, and ooo.. damn, the whole progression from the demo to this EA is bad, like really bad.  The amount of grind and RNG to get parts from the get go is an uphill battle, even unlocking several of the new cabs you are still VERY limited to power/recharge rates, and the enemies will just obliterate you if you don't armor up, which in turn reduces your ability to mine/fight back.  \n\nThe cost for items is WAY overblown compared to what the demo offered, like, seriously skewed, and the hunt for resources is terrible.  Just to experiment I got a cheat table to mess around, for extra goods, so I could just tinker after about 8 hours of legit playing.  One thing I found out is that the Wind and Solar power do not work  unless you have a carbon plant going, so, what is the point? I also tried desperately to find the swamp for some Niobium, and by shear luck I got a part I ground up for some, same with Strontium.  The amount of resources, as I said, is far far too high in this version of the game right now.  \n\nWhile fun at first, this gets old REALLY fast.  Ill shelve it for now, come back later if I see any changes, shame I forked down 28$ for this, as it' barely worth $10 in the state it is.  If there was more substance to it, a bit more polish, then yeah, $25 for a nice little indie game for sure, but in the state that is is in, nope, I can't recommend it to anyone.[/i][/strike]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1711357211, "timestamp_updated": 1712172994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684686958789825439", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1711574352, "developer_response": "Edit: we've just pushed a balance update that addresses some of your concerns about the resource grind and costs of some recipes.

More info on it can be found here: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2313330/view/4168717862237664899?l=english\n\nIn the update (that is live right now), we've expanded the reactor capacity and efficiency points of all cabs. the early game ones have been pushed up to a combined total of 220 to 250, the later cabs are now at a total of 360 to 400 across both reactor capacity and efficiency points. these new limits allow for much more freedom in Tech builds. Beyond this most recent update, we will be reintroducing the aux reactor blocks too soon. They're attachable Tech blocks that increase your reactor capacity. They were present in the demo but reliant on constant fuel burn, we're currently reworking them to occupy a restore (one of your three auto rebuild charges) instead. We also have plans for further progression-based expansions to enable even larger Tech builds beyond that too.\n\nProgression/resource grind has been reduced in multiple ways. Resource lasers consume less power and generate less heat now so they can be fired for longer. The health of many of the resource givers (ores, rocks trees etc.) has been reduced. The common uses for resources have also been reduced too, carbon generators now burn raw carbon for 1 minute (up from 20 seconds) and many of the ammo recipes have been made cheaper and crafted faster. Once you build a fragmenter you'll also find that it yields more resources than before too. The cargo space for many of the cabs has been increased and the objective which teaches you how to build small cargo blocks (cargo expansions) has been updated to make it a clearer flow. All of that is in the current update. In the next update (likely coming next week), we're also taking further steps (like stack size increases for all resources).\n\nWe've not reduced the number of enemies in this update, but we have increased the number of blocks that they drop (back up to demo levels) and also increased the amount of ammo that they drop too, making it easier to stay in the fight. In the next update (coming next week) we have adjusted their combat behaviour to be less relentless (for example they won't fire continuously without any pauses anymore and their accuracy has been adjusted to make things more fair).\n\nA world gen would be great, as you say. It's our ambition to get to that stage where we can re-roll whole planets or various aspects of them, but much of the world is handmade right now. Not ruling world gen out further down the line, but it will take us a bit to get there.\n\nAnyway, thanks for playing.

I am going to stick with the game, I'm an older gamer, I played OG TT with my kids, and I bought this game for myself, two of my children and a friend of mine in anticipation of multiplayer. That said, I got home from work tonight and played from 11pm to 8am.  \n\nThe direction of this patch was an amazing transformation in the game!  I appreciate your work and that your team listened to feedback. The steps were definitely in the right direction, I had a great time tonight. I had issues with the direct join to the game through steam, but I was able to set up a dedicated server on my PC without too much trouble (I work in tech automation for a living so that may have helped.)\n\nDedicated server didn't place a lot of labor on my machine, with the new balance on the grind you made, I very much enjoyed myself. \n\nThere are some issues that would help with the automation, which I feel like from playing TT1 you are probably already aware, but the limitations with the conveyors and the ports on the machines doesn't seem straight forward as the old conveyor system was. Granted I've only really just started figuring out the new automation. \n\nExample: Parts shredder has conveyor connected output to a silo input, but only the first item slot in the shredder empties into the silo?  I still have to manually move the other available slots.\n\nPlayed with the flatbed/tractor beam setup, and I honestly don't see the value in it... the tedious nature of picking up the rocks and dragging them back to base, powering the processor and waiting for it to complete... so much easier to just search out and strip mine an area. Really couldn't justify it in the current state. It is another possibly good mechanic if flushed out just a little more. It does have some of the feel of resourcing from TT1 while you are doing it, so there is a vintage value to it.\n\nIt has been a long time since I've played a new game I liked enough to really loose sleep over. Thank you for your work.\n--------\nPotentially good, don't recommend at the current state of the game. As many others have stated, really wanted a true multiplayer OG Terratech. Had hopes this was that game. It is not. Presently it is a horrid grind, parts and pieces are extremely specific and useless taking away from the creativity by limiting possibilities.\n\nGone is my mobile factory unit vs my combat rig that I used switch between because factory production has to be done on stationary grids that don't entirely make sense. I have ammo limitations but the AI doesn't. Near as I can tell once you resource an area it persists to be empty, and since your factory isn't mobile.... \n\nAutomation isn't nearly as straight forward as it used to be, though I do like that individual ore aren't rendered killing my FPS when if I can stand to play it long enough to build a huge factory. OG TT felt fun, it didn't take long to start getting some cool gear. This TT feels like work, and it isn't fun.\n\nGraphics are definitely improved. Like that I can aim my guns for specific parts on the enemy, and I can lead them intentionally. (Might make auto aim a optional, as watching the enemy and driving around obstacles was a large part of the OG game, this forces you to always have your eyes on the target. A targeting block perhaps?\n\nI want to build cools stuff, there are plenty of grindy slow survival games out there... that isn't what OG TT was, and that's not what I thought I was buying.", "timestamp_created": 1711484114, "timestamp_updated": 1711629356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610001742839813232", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1711577825, "developer_response": "Hello, lead designer here.\n\nThanks for giving it a try and for playing TT1 too (I was the lead designer on that as well).\n\nWe've just released an update with bunch of balance improvements, more info here: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2313330/view/4168717862237664899?l=english\n\nResource grind has been reduced in multiple ways.

Our thinking was based on the idea that giving the GSO one block (1x1x1 with 6 APs) at the start of the last game undermined interest in other hull blocks that came later (why use a 2x1x1 block when you can just use more of the old reliable one block?). Progression curves usually follow that you get weaker/more limited items early in the game and unlock better/more useful items later. But you're not alone in this feedback so we're considering options. Nothing concrete yet, but thanks for the feedback there.\n\nThat said, we have expanded the reactor capacity and efficiency points of all cabs making it easier to build larger Techs.

I really hope you'll stay with us on our journey with TTW, we spent 10 years adding things to TT1 so it's hard to match it for content out of the gate, but TTW gives us the ability to do all sorts of things that were not possible to deliver in the original (untethered multiplayer, terrain deformation and water, to name a few things).\n\nAnyway, thanks for playing and for the feedback, please let us know what you think once you've had a look at the update, we're always keen to hear how people are getting on.\n\nCheers,\nKris"}, "161290593": {"recommendationid": "161290593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063393372", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 182, "playtime_at_review": 372, "last_played": 1713016429}, "language": "english", "review": "[strike] At the moment of the release - this is awful.\nGame wise - everything is fine, but progression wise - it needs a ton of polishing.\nManaging base became a heavy dissapointment - requirements for most stuff got drastically increased, Solar and Wind generators become something you cannot access within supplies on main island.\nThe biggest 'exploit' became a scrapper, absolutely killing the intent of getting supplies by mining, the exception again is Carbon, due to fact you'd be wasting 90 carbon within a hour, because 3 carbon plants would eat as much to sustain Scrapper and some other utilities.\nAlmost 6 hours in - you still won't have the tool to pass through sea for new locations, unless you just set fastest wheels and 'swim' through.[/strike] \nHey, they did listen, i was quite away thanks to other games but i will return to TTW eventually.", "timestamp_created": 1711225756, "timestamp_updated": 1712105574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558716237545013428", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1711401843, "developer_response": "Thank you for the detailed feedback.

I disliked the build limitations, but I can understand the need for that for server based play. All the connection points in their base game lagged the crap out of people. So I get the limitations here, really, not that bothered by it.\n\nWhat I DON'T find acceptable is that this game was advertised as \"TerraTech - with friends\". Yet somehow, it feels like NO ONE actually tested the multiplayer aspects. Our group hosted a server and we all hopped on in. Already a few crashes in the first couple hours. Every single enemy is invisible and shooting you from some random other place on the map - might be 10 feet from you, might be on the other side of a hill so you can't fight it. When you destroy them, their parts end up who knows where... And that's another thing! Loot is extremely hard to come by here even when it drops in front of you. Been playing for a few hours already and I can't even get some decent wheels let alone grow the size of my tech.\n\nAll in all, I do not recommend this game... At least not yet. I am hoping the devs get around to fixing multiplayer, because that was the ONLY draw this game has over the original TerraTech. Without that, it might as well have never existed. Payload Studios... I just want you to know I am not mad at you. I am just extremely disappointed... [/strike]\n\nEDIT 3/27/2024 - The devs reached out to me and gathered some info. The next day, my problems have all been patched! I have to admit I am impressed. The dev team and community managers have a great approach to working with the player base. Pretty much all my concerns were addressed in the patch today. No more crashes, desync issues on dedicated servers appear to be gone, the techs actually are where they appear to be and drop loot where they die. It's a complete 180 to where it was before.\n\nI can now recommend the game for purchase, enthusiastically even! Even more so with a dev team who speaks to the community and listens to the players. Payload Studios, I apologize for my previous harsh review, but this totally redeems the rough launch.
