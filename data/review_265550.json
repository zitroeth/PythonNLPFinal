This is very easy to fix, and I'll explain how:\n\n1. Navigate to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\deadrising3\n\n2. Create a new notepad document, paste \"gmpcr_unlock_frame_rate = True\" into it.\n\n3. Save as, title it \"User.ini\". Make sure it is saved as \"All Files\", so that it registers the extension.\n\nNow you can play the game at 60 FPS, but I highly recommend that you cap your FPS at 60. Otherwise, aiming and other stuff will be messed up.\n\nNext up, there is a rough save bug in this port. However, I've discovered a pattern and it is easy to avoid once you follow these next steps.\n\nWhen the game first boots up, it will ask you to specify your gamma/brightness for the first time. Remember, if this EVER comes up again, your saves DID NOT LOAD. If this happens, just hit okay or whatever the prompt is to \"set\" your gamma, and then close the game out and re-open it. You can test this, because if you go to load your game you will see your progress display as if you are level 1. When you load the game up and it DOES NOT ask for your gamma setting, your game likely loaded in properly - but make sure that you actually read the display for your progress before you load. I have not experienced an issue when following this pattern, but as a precaution I decided to back up my saves. The directory is as follows:\n\nC:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\My Games\\Dead Rising 3\\saves\n\nJust copy that entire folder and set it aside each time you want to back it up, and if anything goes wrong next time you load it should be okay to paste it back in. From what I've read, when your saves get screwed - they get screwed for good so overwriting the screwed saves should be okay.\n\nAlso, if for some reason you have trouble with the FPS - turn LOD to the minimum.

However Dead Rising 3 is a major resource hog due to the sheer number of Zombies on screen at once. But if it runs smoothly for you; then games a blast to play through 2 player Co-Op whilst using the built in voice communication. \n\nAs expected with this franchise; story is more of a side show to the very funny costumes, over the top weapons, and slicing up of zombie hordes. Zombie game Co-Op fans should enjoy Dead Rising 3 big time, if your PC can handle it. Whilst many of the games negative performance reviews are more than justified; cant leave a negative review as i enjoyed playing through the game Co-Op, and we had no peformance issues on either PC.\n\n[b]If you want to remove the 30fps enforced cap, here's how:[/b]\n\n>Go to your deadrising3 folder (C: Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\Steam Apps\\Common\\deadrising3)\n>create new text file within the folder\n>name it \"user.ini\" (make sure you change file type from txt to ini)\n>open the new text file & type in \u201cgmpcr_unlock_frame_rate = True\u201d\n>save the document\n>start the game\n>enjoy!!\n\nEdit: Tested the game using a GTX980Ti 6GB with rest of PC still same as above; and FPS was almost identical to my initial review (Stayed between 61 - 87fps this time). So my testing seems to suggest that Dead Rising 3 does become CPU restricted if you own a GTX780 3GB or better.\n\nSome screenshots (Warning spoilers): https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970508803/screenshots/?appid=265550&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall#scrollTop=3013", "timestamp_created": 1419707215, "timestamp_updated": 1638284739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 352, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.869120180606842041", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32541096": {"recommendationid": "32541096", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970548556", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2550, "last_played": 1540916800}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun, with many problems, small buggs all over the place, but it's still fun. \n\nIf you want a perfect and smooth game, this is nothing for you.

It was back then when only Dead Rising 2 was available (the Steam release of the first instalment of this franchise came only much later). I hated it. I hated how difficult it was and how the entire game required you to complete it within the allotted time. I am a completionist - I like playing open world games to their full extent with all the collectibles collected and side missions completed.\n\n[b]On To DR 3[/b]\n\nThe story takes place some time after the events of the previous games. Our protagonist, Nick Ramos, is a car mechanic. He and his group of survivors try to assemble a plane so that they can escape the city called Los Perdidos (\"The Lost\" in Spanish, how clever!) as they learn the government wishes to drop a bomb to solve this problem once and for all. Things get complicated when Nick is bitten and sets out to find some Zombrex.\n\nIn any case, this is a typical story with lots of cheesy dialogue, a love interest, bad guys, boss battles and a lot of gore. The streets are swarmed with zombies and the better weapons (that you create by combining items or other weapons) all are meant to do one job: crowd control. Time is still an important factor - we have 7 days to complete 7 chapters but this is not as crucial now as it was before. Occasionally, we get a phone call and by receiving those we get side missions. These also have to be picked up and completed in the allotted time - I had to pay attention but didn't feel the need to rush it. Hardcore fans can pick nightmare mode - enemies are tougher and time flies just like in previous games. Also, if you have a friend you can complete the story in coop mode.\n\n[b]Gameplay mechanics[/b]\n\nThe transition from DR 2 to 3 was identical to Techland's Dead Island franchise. In Dying Light we did upgrade weapons on the go instead of looking for workbenches. The concept in Dead Rising 3 is similar. But the idea here is not to upgrade weapons but to create new ones. This sometimes results in crazy inventions. You can combine a sledgehammer and a fire axe to get the Defiler, a deadly blunt weapon. Add some motor oil to your broadsword to get a flaming version. Boxing gloves can also be altered to do all kinds of damage. Add some gems to your flashlight to get a laser sword (you'll notice immediately the nod to Star Wars here). You can apply upgrades to shopping carts, wheelchairs and even create RC Helicopters to remotely behead the living dead.\n\nThese combinations require blueprints. It's worth checking into every apartment building we find in the city, plus, since we are there to hunt for collectibles, you can check if there are statuettes, comic books, pieces of clothing (or entire outfits) and dead bodies that we can inspect to get notified on \"tragic endings\".  We can also combine vehicles - a rollerhawg is a crazy yet extremely efficient combination of a steamroller and motorbike. Vehicles are a must as Los Perdidos consists of 4 districts - all connected by highways.\n\n[b]Graphics & RPG elements[/b]\n\nThe game looks good but not as good as the systems requirements deem it necessary. It is a shame it is capped at 30 FPS and that it comes just a year after its console release. You would think a port is much better this way that it is given enough time to get the Steam release done right. And before some people lash at me: I am not interested in remedies the community can come up with. I know there's an option to uncap the game but Capcom does not officially support it i.e. it's confirmed there could be glitches resulting from this change. In any case, if you don't mind the 30 FPS value tops the game looks quite good (there are a lot of cutscenes and some of them are very funny - the game clearly doesn't take itself seriously).\n\nSo, we go around with Nick completing story chapters and side missions. We bump into survivors and save them. We collect all kinds of stuff and keep ridding the world of the undead. While doing so we get XP (PP as Capcom calls it here). After a while we level up and can purchase attributes to learn special moves, get better at firearms handling or to have the ability to have a lot of followers with us (up to 5 ppl to have a large posse). Ranged weapons that have a devastating effect can help levelling up quickly - continuous killings are appreciated as the higher streak we have the more PP we are rewarded.\n\n[b]Apocalypse Edition[/b]\n\nThis is what you get. Consider it a game of the year edition. Comes with 4 DLCs that each put us in the shoes of 4 new protagonists. Interestingly, none of these characters have new skills or weapons - the idea here is to have the same skills that Nick has. So, the higher you were with Nick when completing the story the easier it will be to complete all 4 tales. They take place in Los Perdidos but have fewer missions to complete. They are quite mediocre, to be honest.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nI completed the story and all 4 so-called untold stories by eliminating 60,000 zombies. In just 40 hours this is what I achieved and at the same time I found almost all collectibles. Are you a completionist? One of the trials (challenges) in the game requires you to kill 200,000 more zombies. \n\nDead Rising 3 is a good zombie game. It is a lazy port (and 30 FPS annoys a lot of people) but if you have the right system requirements it's pure fun so much so that you don't feel \"perdido\" during the entire game as you are right where you are needed to be.", "timestamp_created": 1519560215, "timestamp_updated": 1519561934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830366790294647217", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78047909": {"recommendationid": "78047909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087794419", "num_games_owned": 593, "num_reviews": 562, "playtime_forever": 1371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1207, "last_played": 1672497955}, "language": "english", "review": "[quote]\n\u2696\ufe0f Grade = A.

A misfit port at the start, and an overwhelming game at the finish.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a good game, but the port to PC had its fair share of problems. But those are all in the past now, and there are plenty of easy fixes for the few that remain, so I'll just say this: This is a good game IF you have a good computer.\n\nMy last computer, which I first bought this game on, wasn't all that bad. I can't remember the specs, but suffice to say, it was a good laptop for the most part. But this game was too much for it. The frame rate issues were so severe that the game ran as slow as a zombie, pun intended. Yet I still played this to the point that I beat the final boss and completed the story. But it wasn't very pretty...\n\nBut now that I've got myself a new computer, with better specs from the looks of it, the game runs just fine. Maybe it was just my old computer that couldn't handle the game, or maybe Capcom's hotfixes worked as they should in the end? In either case, now I can enjoy this game as I should have a few years ago.\n\nSince this is the third entry into the DR-series, I'm pretty sure we're all familiar with the basic premise: Grab anything you can find and beat zombies with it, rescue people and kill psychos. It's all pretty standard, except you really can pick up anything, from bricks and broken pipes to garbage cans and benches; if it's not nailed down you can pick it up and use it as a weapon. That's the big selling point of this franchise as a whole, and I have to say, it's a good point.\n\nWith the second entry came the ability to combine different weapons into new and better versions, so how could this be improved on? Why, vehicles of course! The first two games had some vehicles to throw around, but it was all pretty limited between different zones. But now that the whole game is one big map, save a few special locations, there's no better time to introduce combo vehicles! Sure, there are only ten of them, but any one of them can lay waste to hundreds of zombies and make travelling the city a breeze! Normal vehicles aren't bad either, but there's just something more satisfying about riding a giant creepy clown cart which sucks up zombies like a vaccum and tosses small explosives than just... mowing them down with an SUV.\n\nOh, and there's a story about escaping the city with your buddies before a big bomb goes off. But who cares about the story? Just have fun and get out in due time.\n\nFrankly, these are some of my favourite kinds of games: They don't care about story, they don't care too much about characters or even realism, they just put you somewhere and lets you have a wild ride. It's like Doom: You're fighting demons on Mars, what else do you need?\n\nI can drone on and on about the different things you can do, the fun possibilities of dressing up in women's lingerie and then beat zombies to (permanent) death with a handbag, or with a giant battleaxe, or a lightpost that can fry, freeze or electocute your foes. But frankly, you're best off to find those things for yourself; provided you have a good computer of course.\n\nSo yeah, I can recommend this one to the well equipped gamers. Now if you'll excuse me, I still have a few achievements to earn and a few more zombies to kill.

If choosing to buy this make sure you check some videos on the PC version. Unlocking the frame to 60fps is definitely a huge improvement, but along with it comes blemishes. Like graphical glitches such as shadows stuttering. If you've never played a Dead Rising game this is a great game to start with. The story mode is lengthy and this PC version is the semi definitive experience, semi because one DLC never made it on here.\n\nAn annoying aspect of the game(my opinion) is that there is just too much driving, expect to drive across one part of the map to another only to get another mission back where you came from. I'd say its padding to be honest and it doesn't help that the game shows how performance tanks while driving; and or the surface textures popping in. Also that's not to mention it slows the game down(literately) as zombies and debris make it hard to navigate especially in those hasty mission that have timers.\nOne of the biggest technical flaw is the mysterious SAVE DELETION. Yes for unspecified reasons the save files will be gone/erased next time you try to continue, this seems to happen when playing the DLC or when you haven't played the game in awhile. The only fix is to back up your saves in the \"mygames\" folder, don't rely on steam cloud it won't help.\n\nAll the technical might seem trouble but they are just bumps, noticeable bumps and yet they don't completely hurt the game just something to be aware of.

Many patches and hotfixes have been sent out then and I expect most of these issues have been resolved. When time permits, I'll update this and give it a proper review.\n\n\nI'd like to be more descriptive about the problems than my other fellow negative-review players. This game is riddled with bugs and crashes. I know you should expect nothing to be flawless on the first days, but this is far from acceptable and barely margins on playable at points.\n\nTo start the system requirements and the optimization of this game are terrible. I've played many games far and wide set to max with rarely anything dipping below 30 FPS and soaring easily otherwise. But setting this game on even the preset of \"Medium\" leads to severe FPS loss during any sort of strain. Mostly from either 100+ zombies or any cutscene I've experienced so far. Playing on low has allowed me to play with frame rate drops mostly on extreme cases such as ~300 zombies or to watch cutscenes without desyncing/skipping.\n\n[strike]Another big issue is the forced resolutions and lack of resolution customization. Now you'd think this is just being picky like \"resize the window\" or \"play on smaller resolutions\", but it's not any of that. It's me playing on a 16:10 ratio with 1440x900 and being told I only have the choices of 1280x1040 at 60hz and 75hz as a resolution. Then, I am forced to have all of the game in it's entirety pushed into a 1440x600 resolution with the game magnified so much that if Nick stuck his arms out, he could touch each side of the viewable area. It's hard to enjoy playing a game when you can't SEE the game you're playing. The driving sequences feel like I'm driving a car with box on my head.[/strike] Come the evening of 9/10, the first patch was made including a fix to native resolutions. I can play now at 1440x900 and see the entire UI and gamescreen normally.\n\nAnd of course, all the crashes. Almost all of them completely unprompted. There's not something that triggers like too many zombies, or a certain scene, it's just all seemingly random. Swing your sledgehammer? That's a crash. Saved a survivor? That's another crash. Threw one too many tires at Rhonda because the campaign won't progress on Chapter 0? Another crash. So many crashes, half your campaign will be navigating Steam to save any last shred of patience you have with this game.\n\nSo it all boils down to being issues around graphic quality and crashes. Everything else is fine, and believe me, I had fun while it lasted. But I've bought two copies because there's no local co-op. I have to battle through the finicky matchmaking system to play with my wife. And then, only to have it turn out to be a Disneyland Tour of the Walking Dead for my wife because the connection is so poor and hard to maintain. Even the cutscenes desync, lag severely, and randomly speed forward. You'd figure the one thing that is a constant with all clients aside from costumes would work normally. All to end with her crashing 20 minutes later. It's a disappointment.\n\nIt's a good, fun game. But it will be tarnished by all these flaws until patches or hotfixes go into effect. If you're a Dead Rising fan, tell the developers to fix these problems. There's a nice forum board where thousands (not exaggerated) of bug/crash reports have been made. And all that's been addressed by the development, or at least the forum management, is that they've redirected consumers to the community's fixes to these problems. And yeah, that's right, the community is currently more active about giving fixes on day one than the developers ever gave this current date.\n\n\nTL;DR.\nIt's a poor port, seems very little work went into making it for PC. Matchmaking is indirect. There are several unprompted crashes. [strike]Resolutions are forced, with several ratios left without options.[/strike]Patch on 9/10 fixed resolution issues. [strike]Developers still haven't pushed a fix yet.[/strike] Other problems yet to be fixed, but seems like progress is at least being made.\n\nI'll be glad to update this as a positive if these problems are addressed.\n\nGood luck, and hopefully all of us who bought it will enjoy seamless gameplay one day.\n\nEdit: Added more details.

He's a decent character as Nick is probably more relatable than Frank or Chuck due to him acting much less badass but I don't feel he has as much character due to this. He's just always kind of afraid or skeptical and only shows glimpses of pride or badassery unlike Frank or Chuck who were more endearing characters in my opinion.\n\nThe visuals are pretty good considering this game is almost three years old now and the port runs very well for me almost always maintaining a solid 60 FPS on high settings. The game does lack some of the charm and colour of Fortune City from Dead Rising 2 with an overall grimier and darker look to everything, but I'd be lying if I said the game looked bad.\n\nBefore the port was updated the game did run quite poorly for me and textures took much too long to load and the frame rate was dire, but thankfully these issues have been resolved. \n\nThere is a nice wealth of content to find in this game with about 30-40 hours worth of missions and sidequests in the story itself, and another 8-10 hours of free DLC content as well, so this game offers quite a lot of bang for your buck.\n\nDead Rising 3 isn't my favourite entry in the series but it's still a solid game and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an open-world game with a large amount of content as Dead Rising 3 delivers on that front. \n\nJust to save people the trouble of looking it up, to have the game running at 60 fps you need to create a text document called user.ini and open the notepad and type the following: gmpcr_unlock_frame_rate= True and then save it.

The world building and story are both amazing. However, minus the fourth game, this is probably the least \"Dead Rising\" game. While there is quite a bit of world building, and lots of side quests, there IS a lot that goes on throughout the game and part of the \"Dead Rising\" novelty wears off a bit and causes this to be more of a zombie killing game that has a stellar story with Dead Rising elements. \n\n*Now, the reason why I urge you not to play the DLC until total completion of the main game is because there is about a 75% (or more...) chance that ALL of your progress will be wiped due to a bug. I was level 47 back in 2021, and I only just recently started playing the game again because I was so incredibly angry and burnt out from the fact that I lost SO much progress.\n\nHowever, all things considered, great game overall, and great for killing time. I like the references to past games, as for me personally, it keeps a little bit of the flair of the old games.

I've played all of them up to this point and to be honest, Dead Rising 3 might be my favorite. \n\nThe big thing Dead Rising 3 does is give the player far more power and time than the other games.   The time limits are huge now, to the point where you barely have to pay attention to the story, just play the game, do all the side missions you want and then continue the story.  It's a freedom that the first 2/3 games didn't have, and makes this game a joy to play.  On the other hand it takes a 6 hour limit and moves it to closer to 30 for the first playthrough.  This is actually a good thing as most people won't replay these games repeatedly.    I know some do, but I'm thrilled at only really needing one playthrough to see everything. \n\nThe other thing Dead Rising 3 produces is a great fluidity in the game play.   The player can still be swarmed by zombies just as in the previous games, but he can easily maneuver around them or murder them efficiently with his weapons.  The player doesn't feel completely helpless against the zombies, and honestly that makes the game feel a lot more fluid than anything else. \n\nI actually love playing Dead Rising 3, I apparently spent 60 hours doing so, and maybe that's a bit high (could have left it on one night) but I easily hit 40 hours on the main game, and maybe 15 more on the DLC trying to do everything.  There's a lot of content on here. \n\nThere's also more zombies on the screen at one time, more items, vehicles and a great map.   Dead Rising 1 and 2 always included cars that feel pointless when trying to drive around a mall.   Dead Rising 3 changed the world to include an entire city based on Los Angeles.  There's four districts that open up fairly quickly (in the first 5 hours) and this city is large but manageable.  This actually creates a use for those cars and ability to design a better city.  Dead Rising 2's mall was insanely large, this is the next logical step and I believe it was a great movie.  Los Peridos is an interesting place. \n\nOn the other hand the story is weaker, not that the stories in Dead Rising ever shined.  I liked most of the story, but the fact is the main character is the weakest of the three.  While Frank West was a good character, and Chuck Greene was a good father, Nick what ever his name is is kind of an any Joe.  He has a small story arc but most of the time he's viewing the story, he's not a huge part of the story.  The story is the world and the military, Nick is just an outside observer until the end, and even there, it's not a great character, but a good story around him. \n\nOverall though the game is great if not excellent, I really enjoyed playing. \n\nThat doesn't mean it's perfect, but most of the complaints are nitpicks. There's the idea of Tragic Deaths.  Sounds interesting and sad, but it's not.  First the player can change his outfit like previous games, so when NIck is dressed up in lingerie and go-go boots, and it breaks immersion, but that's the player's fault.   However the game goes farther and says \"tragic death\" and there's a person who is headless.  or a person who's head is in another's lap and then says something like \"Just trying to get ahead\" or similar while playing sad music.   So which is it, is it supposed to be tragic or is it supposed to be silly?  Just an odd moment \n\nThe DLC for this game that's included is a bit weak.  It is called the untold stories.  The fact is they probably were untold for a reason, they're not that interesting.   There's not even a real link to the original story or the four side stories, two connect but barely. \n\nFinally there's achievements.  And while this doesn't kill the game (I mean a fun game with no achievement is still a fun game) but there's a few flaws here too.  One achievement on the base game will require hours of busy work and at least 6 hours of grinding.  That's a real horrible achievement where you have to kill about 350,000 zombies (About 1000 a minute is the best rate anyone seems to get).  Kind of slow. \n\nOn the other hand on the fourth DLC story there's at least one if not two achievements that are bugged, and if you get this bug you are forced to wipe your save game.  While I was planning on getting a perfect score, I ended up with 86/88 because of these.  Honestly, kind of annoyed by this, but that doesn't effect my overall feelings on the game. \n\nSo in conclusion I don't just recommend this game, I HEAVILY recommend it for anyone who liked any of the previous dead risings.  It's a lot easier especially once you get a blueprint for a combo gun called the Z.A.R.  There's less time management, and the game requires less replaying but it feels like the best Dead Rising 3 game, and a great zombie game that doesn't rely on making you always feel weak.  You become a Zombie fighting machine in this game, and that's a great feeling.   It's currently 30 bucks, and it easily is worth that, but you can find it cheaper, either way, I can't recommend it enough because it's really an enjoyable game.\n\nIn addition I've created a curator account to gather all my reviews availble here if you are interested: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31803828-Kinglink-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1515986744, "timestamp_updated": 1516320709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.729095697402954102", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15892786": {"recommendationid": "15892786", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970529119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1683929791}, "language": "english", "review": "The very first Dead Rising still remains one of my favorite games of all time.  My review might be slightly biased.\n\nI bought this on sale; a massive mixture of concern whether or not it would run on my system, alongside the built up anticipation I have had since the game's release on Xbox One.  I don't own, or intend to own, that console anytime soon, so  when Dead Rising 3 was ported to PC I was very excited---until I read all of the horrible experiences people with much better systems than my own were having running the game.  The Capcom publisher sale finally convinced me to take the risk, and the results have far surpassed my expectations.\n\nWith the settings on low, I get excellent FPS, and it is more than playable on medium.  I am shocked at how well it is running on my laptop!\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, it is interesting having such an open environment to explore this time around.  Random survivors will appear that you can save for extra experience, much like the random crime events in a superhero game like the Amazing Spider-man or something, and the stress on time management seems to have been removed for the most part.  This can be viewed as a good or bad thing, I suppose: worrying about appropriately scheduling your tasks was a big part of the immersion factor for me.  On the other hand, the GTA-ish formula isn't gamebreaking--it is nice to be able to have such control over when events are triggered.  At the time of writing this, I am only a couple chapters in, so I guess all that I just said could still be countered; I'm far enough to know that I am really, really enjoying this game, in many of the same ways that I enjoyed the previous entries in the series.  The only thing that keeps throwing me off is HAVING to have a blueprint for something, even if I know how to make it myself.  I wish they had left that aspect the same as it was in Dead Rising 2.  It really becomes a small complaint though, as searching for these blueprints can be entertaining and addictive.\n\nSo proceed with caution if you are considering buying this.  The game itself is fantastic.. however, a rather alarming number of users encountered issues.  I'll post my specs at the bottom, but I am considering myself fortunate that I am able to run this, and run it as well as it is running.

But in the apparent rush to improve the graphics and get this out as an Xbox One exclusive launch title, Capcom sacrificed a good game.\n\nThe core elements of a Dead Rising game are here. You're trapped in an open world zombie apocalypse and there are dozens upon dozens of weapons at your disposal, lying around everywhere. Combo crafting new, wacky types of weapons also make it. You'll follow the main story, save survivors by either clearing zombies near them or escorting them, and kill psychos. You gain experience points (Prestige Points, or PP) and level up, gaining new abilities, more health, inventory space, passive buffs, etc. One nice addition to the game is a skill tree that lets the player decide, through the early and midgame, how they want to specialize. You can level up forever though, and they even keep giving you skill points after you've bought every available skill in the game. Come now, that's got to be a few lines of code at most... Anyway, Dead Rising 3 occurs on a bigger scale than the previous two, you've got a whole city now! It should be great, right?\n\nBut I think it's simply lost its self-aware charm. The city, Los Perdidos, is as bland as it comes. The way roadblocks snake through the city seem artificial. Instead of funny moments, there are little Tragic Endings. There are only 7 Psychos in the game, plus main story bosses. The psychos are based off the Seven Deadly Sins, which sounds cool in a boardroom design meeting, but there's an absurdity missing from most of them. Dead Rising 3 might be trying to be a little more serious, but at the same time it does try to be silly at times too. The whole balance of the game has been destroyed by Safe Zone Weapon Lockers, which, I shit you not, let you load up a full inventory of miniguns at level 1, and just mow zombies, human baddies, and even bosses to a pulp with zero effort. The old weaknesses of Dead Rising are present. Movement is sticky, it's often difficult to target the item you want to pick up, and survivors are morons. Nothing new or interesting is really brought to the table for the franchise. The graphics got a sizeable makeover and the zombie hordes are impressive, at the cost of a 30fps cap.\n\nThe lack of love in the game really comes to fruition in the DLC packs, which are good examples of the shittiest game design I've seen out of a AAA game studio since whenever the last Dynasty Warriors game came out. Take most of the grindy collectible activities you do in the main game: pick up statues, destroy surveillance cameras, and drive from Point A to B to C to D. All right, now do that with a different character in four separate stories. The collectible activities are just reskinned: pick up WHISKEY, hack INTO cameras, and of course, drive from Point A to B to C to D, oh and some roads are now closed, making the drives even longer and more pointless. To top it all off, the only rewards in the DLC packs are more experience points (PP). Just more PP, here have some PP! I hit way past max level playing the base game, the rewards are completely useless. You're also essentially a god at max level, and you need to try to die in order to lose a fight, even against bosses. So what's left here? Nothing really. Just a chore.\n\nSo, then we get to the PC port itself. There's a 30fps cap which you CAN disable with some .ini editing, but that's a mark of a lazy port right there. Unlocking it can cause issues. The game has a few CTD bugs. The Co-op experience is nothing short of a fucking nightmare. If you're LUCKY, you'll only get CTD when you host or join another game. The unlucky will have their game hang the whole computer, sometimes requiring a restart. You pretty much have to do alchemy with your game settings until the co-op experience works... MAYBE. I managed to get a single co-op session going after about 2 hours of trying. And although this didn't happen to me personally, there are even higher frequencies of CTD bugs while playing co-op. Woo, zombie slaying with a bud has never been easier...\n\nJust kidding. Get Dying Light instead. It's not comical, but at least it's properly fun.\n\nIf you're a BIG fan of Dead Rising, well, you probably already own this. And if you're still on the fence, it might be worth it on a 75% or higher sale price.

I do, it lets people that are searching for rooms know what kind of playstyle your doing while searching for others to play with, but it would seem that people may have confuse this as a \"Difficulty setting\" even tho it's not.\n\n5) There is no Sandbox Mode (Free roam w/o time restrictions) like in Dead Rising 2: off the records. IMO, story mode offers you a very generous amount of time to explore in between missions just to do whatever.\n\n===========\nThings in DR3:\n---------------\n1) Combining vehicles (unlike DR2, your not restricted to only comboing bikes, you can combo cars, trucks... etc.)\n\n2) The ability to combine things on the spot without the need of workbenches or blenders.\n\n3) Weapon Lockers, in safehouses there are these lockers that hold just about every item you picked up and used throughout your playthrough. At the cost of points (depending on the item) you can reclaim or stockpile boss weapons or any non-vehicle combo item you had and resupply your inventory.\nAll collected items are transferred through to new game plus, in case if your wondering.\n\n4) A Survivor board, also in safehouses there are these whiteboards that you can recruit any survivors you had rescued during your game to be your personal bodyguard.\n\n5) A Sprint button, no more jogging from place to place or exploiting pushing weapons or moose head charge attacks to get from place to place fast like in the previous DR games, tho you can still do those if you still want to.\n\n6) The ability to choose what stat to increase per level up. Meaning you can focus on stats that benefit your own personal playstyle.\n\n7) Collectible trophies & Magazines that no longer take up inventory space.\nThis means that you can collect ALL magazines without the worry of inventory space, and if i remember correctly... they stay collected on your person for every NG+ may want to do.\n\n=====================\nPersonal recommendation:\n------------------------------\nIf your new to Dead Rising and want to embrace yourselves in the lore, I would recommend start playing 1 & 2 first (you can ignore \"Off the Record\" it's non-cannon), but if you don't care about the lore, I'd say it's fine if you start off on 3.\n\nI also recommend you look up how to edit your FoV, the default FoV in game feels too restrictive and way too close to the character and doesn't offer enough vision of your surroundings.\n\nEspecially since the MC's fat ass is covering up most of the screen and there's no way to change camera orientation from his right shoulder to the left shoulder to help you see.

Believe me, You can do soooooooo many things in this game.\n\nThe story is good and Nick Ramos is an interesting character overall. And the psychopaths gives a humorous mood to the game.\n\nOn the technical side, The game run smooth at 60FPS (need to modify a file). FPS drops happen very rarely and the entire time my FPS is between 70 and 110 FPS. However, there is a really annoying bug with opening the weapons menu i couldn't find solution for.\n\nOther than that, the game is so much fun, the gameplay is awesome and there too much freedom to play the game.\n\nPeople can join you and help you and you can do the same which makes the Co-Op/Multiplayer mode is equally fun.\n\nPlus, you have all the released DLCs for free.

The graphics are obviously way better than the last 2, but this means higher demanding specs and let me tell you like everyone else is the optimization is TERRIBLE. Kind of close to DayZ if I'm honest. But that should not stop you from buying this game. The story is meh, definitley not as good as the previous 2 games, but during the end it picks itself up with a surprise return from someone who I won't mention, but if you don't know after 3 years of the game coming out you might as well look it up on YT. Now we get to gameplay, this game definitley has the BEST gameplay of the previous titles, introducing sprinting, being able to carry big things like teddy bears in your inventory, the ability to run and eat, run and shoot etc. but the only complaint I have about the gameplay/combat is that weapons feel very weak in this game, in the previous titles one slash of a broadsword would cut a zombie in half and in real life you would probably expect it to as well, but in this game it is like you just hit them in the stomach with a wooden baseball bat, and that means it feels terrible slashing through zombies with blunt weapons when it should feel amazing, this means that you will be using the new heavy attack button most of the time to kill zombies which will destroy your weapons in around 30 or 40 hits. This is unbelieveable as in other games the weapons were kind of realistic and could last more than 50. With a bigger map means a new way to traverse around the map and with this comes the addition of combo vehicles, much like combo weapons, combine two things and make something completely unrealistic that shoots fire and you can take on zombie hordes. This is probably one of the best additions and most fun for the game. But overall, this game is far from perfect but still a very good pickup for only $9, and I would definitley recommend you purchase it.", "timestamp_created": 1482525718, "timestamp_updated": 1482525718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687493085861206055", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12008843": {"recommendationid": "12008843", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985686073", "num_games_owned": 468, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 547, "last_played": 1410039448}, "language": "english", "review": "Dead Rising 3 is a mixed-bag. It's a bag filled with delicious chocolates and overly salted pretzel. You can pull out something sweet and succlent, and other times nothing but shit. Dead Rising 3 is one of those games where it had a lot of great ideas and fun elements but get weighed down by plenty of pretzels.\n\nDead Rising 3 is the next installment in the Dead Rising franchise, a franchise of which I love. Seeing Frank West plow to hordes of zombie in a shopping mall was one of the greatest things I had seen for the Xbox 360 at the time, and my love for the series pushed forward by the new combo weapons, B-movie style, wacky game that Dead Rising 2 was. It seemed Dead Rising 3 might of been a spark for another entry in a series that I had always found enjoyable, despite it flaws. Yet, Dead Rising 3 had proved me wrong.\n\nLet's talk about the good things first though, Dead Rising 3 features plenty new elements to franchise. The game feels more fluid and less clunky, Nick is able to create combo weapons on the fly, and the city of Los Perdidos is much more massive than Willimette and Fortune City. The game features two modes, Nightmare and Normal. Nightmare is more in the style of the previous Dead Rising games, with a tight time limit and a saves only available in safe houses and bathrooms, for those who like a challenge. While normal mode has a very long time limit, and lets you freely explore the undead-infected city at your leisure. Some very minor changes include being able to eat/drink while moving, improved psychopath health bars, less escort missions, and the abillity to access clothing and weapons from the safe house you've previously unlocked or picked up. The zombie-slaughering is a blast, with a wide variety of effective and silly weapons at your disposal. Combine a katana and a scythe to make the all-mighty Reaper, and you can combine that together with a gasoline can to having a Fire Reaper. Put rubber ducks on boxing gloves, or put a shotgun and an assault rifle togheter and face hordes of thousands of undead obstacles with your powerful weapons. Slicing and dicing zombies feels satisfying, and finding new blueprints to a new combo weapon is always a blast. Unlike most open-world games, Dead Rising 3 has a lot of interiors. It's choke full of hardware, clothing, and yes, even porn stores. The absurdity is the finest part of Dead Rising 3, even if it feels a bit juvenile or silly at times, it feels wonderful to plow through the hordes. \n\nNow here's the bad news, let's just get this out of the way, very few will deny it. Dead Rising 3 runs poorly. It's playable, but don't be expecting to run on 60 FPS on the highest quality of machines. Is it a crappy port? Depends on how you look at it. The Xbox One version of Dead Rising 3 (a launch title for the console) was known to run terribly at times, with many technical issues. One could say the PC port of Dead Rising is actually much better compared to the Xbox One version, the thing is, it still runs like crap at times. The weirdest thing is that during cutscenes, the game's FPS tends to drop even less. One very frustrating annoyance, is the game tends to crash every so often. It's almost impossible to do Nightmare mode as the game crashes so frequently that you might end up losing your save, because you couldn't make it to a safehouse or bathroom before the invisible \"crash timer\" rings its bell. It's a very big problem, unless you don't care all too much about running Dead Rising 3 on the highest settings, or don't mind getting under 50 FPS at times, then the performance issues shouldn't really affect you. Even then, there are still some weird texture pop-ins, objects appearing out of nowhere, and some low quality textures even on the highest settings. Plenty of games look much better than Dead Rising 3, and play much more smoother.\n\nAs for negative gameplay aspects, it may very from person to person. Los Perdidos is big compared to the last two locations of Dead Rising. It's also very maze-like, unmemorable, and twisted. In the previous two Dead Risings, the landmarks were very clear. The giant slide in Pallisades Mall in Dead Rising 2, the courtyard of convicts in 1, but Dead Rising 3 doesn't have those types of memorable landmarks. There's no way to tell where the gun store once was, or the knife shop, or the pizza place. The streets, more often than not, look the same. Most locations have to be travelled to by car along a confusing routes of highways, and frequent roadblocks that require you to find a new automobile. It all felt tedious getting around. The side missions, are just your generic open-world ones, such as find 5 guns and bring it to Tommy, or take Sarah to a certain store. A lot of the psychopaths in Dead Rising 3 felt underwhelming, they weren't as interesting or challenging as the previous two and lacked any real great rewards. In Dead Rising 2, deafeating Randy gave you the massive pink chainsaw or defeating Seymour gave you the powerful 60 bullet Six Shooter, and in Dead Rising 1, defeating Adam gave you the mini-chainsaw. However, defeating psychos in 3 only give you PP, a key, sometimes survivors, and only three the six optional psychopaths give you some sort of weapon, none of which are very good. All these features can really tone down some of the great potential the game could have, there's so many minor irritations that just turn into one big itch you can't scratch.\n\nDespite the hordes of zombie killing, the incredibly fun combo weapons, and the bizzareness of the entire game. As hard as it is for me to say this as a really big fan of the series, I can't reccommend Dead Rising 3. It's performance and crashing issues are much too big to ignore, the twisted and unmemorable map of Los Perididos are frustraiting, and it's lack of any real sort of accomplishment from rescuing survivors or doing side missions makes you hesitant every time you get a call. The game could of been so much more, what sounds better than a open-world sandbox co-op zombie killing game? Instead, you're left with a technical mess, and a bland game. With all the things it does right, there's just too many damn pretzels in this bag.", "timestamp_created": 1410068321, "timestamp_updated": 1410068408, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 177, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686850130558013916", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145825966": {"recommendationid": "145825966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288098045", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1729, "last_played": 1694051290}, "language": "english", "review": "I would love to give it a thumbs up, if it wasen't for the bug I just got tonight.

Is by far the best Dead Rising game i've ever played, they've worked through everything to make the game everything it's predicessors weren't.\n-Survivors are more capable of handling themselves and no longer die instantly if you look away from them for 4 seconds.\n-If you get to far from a survivor they teleport to a safehouse\n-Vehicles are avalible all over the map\n-The world changes around you, setting up roadblocks, altering routes you can take in the world as the game progresses\n-Lockers are added that store any worn clothes, picked up items etc. so you can always access them at a safe house and don't have to backtrack to that area to pick that item up.\n-Graphics have massively improved\n-Quest system has improved, with quests now telling you if it's a normal quest or a psychopath\n-Well written dialogues and characters for the story\nMagazines are now collectibles that don't take up inventory space in order to give their boosts, they are instead stored in your inventory and each individual magazine can be selected at any time to offer their bonuses.\n-You can now actually run, no need to wait to level up to gain more speed, they actually have a button that makes you run\n\nNow, more about the port issue:\nI did try after a friend of mine linked me to a guide on how to unlock the framerate on the game to actually do that, and at first. It seemed to work flawlessly. The game ran steady on a higher framerate than before. Though, I did begin to experience crashes after doing that, something which i didn't have at first. And from what i've read, the crashing issues are not something everyone gets, some have unlocked the framerrate of their game without experiencing any issues at all, but others (like me) have experienced them and i think it has also affected some things in the game, as i noticed that achievements activated about 30 minutes after they were supposed to after the framerate unlocking, plus I have one last achivement in the game which i can't get because it requires me to burn an item that doesn't show up. \nSo unlock the framerate at own risk, as it may affect the game, still. The crashings weren't major problems since i might've experienced them like, 8 times on my 121 hours in the game? So it's not a whole lot and the game does autosave alot.\n\nOverall though, if you don't want to spend several hundred bucks on a console, I'd say this game is worth the buy.\nConsidering the backlash of the port, capcom has boundled the game with it's 4 DLC packs, so if you buy Dead Rising 3 you get the Stories of Los Perdidos as well, and the game drops to quite a low price on sales since it has mixed reviews.\n\nSo if you like dead rising and aren't a crybaby who can't play a game under a certain framerate without complaining that it gives you brain disease or some other bullshit, try it out. It's without a doubt a entertaining and well developed game outside of the poor port.", "timestamp_created": 1477995702, "timestamp_updated": 1477995702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670062541961669922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16982918": {"recommendationid": "16982918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067168151", "num_games_owned": 975, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1167, "last_played": 1450951804}, "language": "english", "review": "I waited to buy this game on sale and now I\u2019m really glad I did. If I bought this for the full price I would\u2019ve been very p%ssed. Not everything about this game is bad but a lot of bad decisions were made while creating this game.\n\nPros:\n+ The graphics are quite nice in my opinion.\n+ The psychos are insane and unique as always and have fun cutscenes.\n+ The Ultimate combo weapons are fun to use. (Try the Massive Bomb. It\u2019s awesome)\n+ Darlene\u2019s boss fight is hilarious. \n+ Firearms are a bit more useful than in previous games. In my opinion.\n+ [spoiler]Chuck Greene[/spoiler]\n\nMeh\u2019s:\n~\tMaybe I missed the prompt that told me what to with survivors (how to get rid of them to be specific) or they just don\u2019t tell you. I accidentally dragged one into a bossfight where she of course died because I didn\u2019t know that I had to deselect her at the whiteboard in a safehouse.\n\nCons:\n-\tThe game crashed a couple times. Even forced me to reboot my PC twice.\n-\tSometimes textures take long to load.\n-\tIt\u2019s dumbed down to appeal to the masses. I didn\u2019t die once in the story. In DR1 and DR2 that was pretty much impossible to do.\n-\tYou have way too much time. There was no feel of urgency at all. I finished the game on day 4 even though I completed all the side missions and psycho missions. Had I focused on the main missions I would\u2019ve finished it on day 3 at the latest.\n-\tThe collectables sometimes are a real pain in the #ss to find. More than once I found myself thinking \u201cHow the f#ck am I supposed to get up/over there?\u201d\n-\tThe vehicles are useless as sh%t. Fun yes but the fun lasts for about 2 minutes tops. Then they go boom.\n-\tIt feels like there are less combo weapons than in DR2\n-\tThe constantly getting grabbed by zombies. Every 10 seconds you have a Zed hanging on your #ss. So damn frustrating.\n-\tThe constantly exploding sh!t right next to you. Maybe I was too blind to see it but somehow there was always stuff exploding right next to me and Nick hugging the street.\n-\t90% of the doors are locked and will only open if you do a side mission that is related to that place. I\u2019d like to emphasize on one in particular where you have to protect a woman on a shopping trip and one store is locked. She simply kicks the door open\u2026 She can do that but Nick, who is at least one foot taller than her and bit more muscular, can\u2019t? That\u2019s b#llsh%t.\n\nI guess that\u2019s about it. I haven\u2019t played the DLC\u2019s yet but I probably will in the next few days and I\u2019ll probably play this game in Coop where it\u2019s hopefully more fun.\nI can\u2019t recommend getting this game at a full price.

casual-style gameplay for the Dead Rising series, let's you take a break from the time-restricted missions from the Dead Rising, Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 2 Off The Record. A new feature which introduces outdoor maps which is bigger than the first two(since OTR is similar to DR2) as well as modifications for vehicles. It's a great game for me IMHO and I loved it as it gets better and better since the first one. Although I love the change in gameplay mechanics, I also love that they introduced a new character instead of Frank West since the game's universe could be expanded even further. \n\nOverall Summary: \nDead Rising - Willamette Mall Zombie slashing FRAAANK-calling survivor simulator. \nDead Rising 2 - TIR Chainsaw Biker Stuntman Daddy Babysitting-his-Daughter by giving her presents simulator. \nDead Rising 2 Off The Record - Frank West Photojournalist Vacation Sandbox Mode with alternate supporting female character in badass latex suit Simulator. \nDead Rising 3 - CAPCOM Original fighting-game style for beating zombies as well as psychopaths with a reference from Street Fighter (Mr. Spec Ops Leader) game with lots of reference and Easter Eggs from said game and other zombie games Simulator. \n\nAll the game contents are marvellous, but the sad thing is that the Last Agent DLC causes a major glitch which in turn could corrupt your overall game progress, making you stuck at burning biohazard piles of bodies which do not count to having a complete Total Number of Collectables to 447. You will stuck at burning 36 of 40 Biohazard body piles. So, all of your efforts and countless hours of playing would go to waste if you're the perfectionist type of gamer, since the whole savegame is affected and you can't go back to your previous progress. \n\nMy advice is to make backups of backups before playing DLC4, or in case if you want to play it all over again, begin from DLC4 first, then finish all the rest including Nightmare Mode in Story Mode. When the mission to burn the pile of bodies start make sure to burn the glitched bodies first then do the rest. Overall, all of this won't help you get back your time, but you need to give a little more effort to get that completed perfect savegame with no glitches. \n\nAll in all, I'll be stopping at Dead Rising 3, because of the glitch I think I'm no longer have the interest to move on to Dead Rising 4.
