It does many things amazingly well and it's a lot of fun.\n\nRight up until you start to grind something. The targeting for grinding is enough to drive me insane. If I'm targeting a canister with my grinder out and I start grinding, I'm very obviously trying to grind the canister right? Nope. The game thinks I'm trying to grind the canister next to it, or the desk, or pretty much anything else around it but what I'm actually targeting.\n\nThis is a simple raycast people. Camera to object raycast to check both distance and target. There is absolutely no reason why this should be an issue this far into Early Access and because of that, I'm giving it a negative review. Why?\n\nWell if you're playing on Madman mode (which I do for the challenge) every bit of scrap matters early game. It's stupidly frustrating to try and target something - be it a monitor on a desk or a canister on the floor or even a box without breaking something you didn't intend on breaking. Later in the game this can mean destroying the building itself when you were trying to break a desk, which wastes pretty much every other possible resource in the building itself since it all just disappears. It's a massive waste.\n\nIf and when they fix this, I'll be happy to turn my frown upside down, but until then the game is frustratingly annoying to me.", "timestamp_created": 1710654478, "timestamp_updated": 1710654478, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698424458503723145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1710720785, "developer_response": "Hello,\n\nFirst of all - thank you for playing the game and for being so passionate about it.

There is something interesting here, and for 40 hours or so (with a lot of fails and deaths), it was a decent enough survival experience. But in the end so many small things have piled up that made just go: okay, enough Occupy Mars.\n\nYou might ask yourself then why is this review positive? Because I did stick to it for 40 hours to get to the \"end game\", and overall the journey there was tough but rewarding. But now a brief overview:\n\n1. Graphics: serviceable\n2. Sound: serviceable\n3. Controls: Janky\n4. Survival: Rough, very rough, but fair.\n\nBut now here is a list of complaints (in no particular order):\n\nThe pickup to hand mechanic for most items (except cables) is just weird. It needs to go, and I much prefer to just always pick up to inventory and move things to the hotbar.\n\nThe mining part of the game has a serious progression issue. Hand mining larger rocks, and then grinding them down to small usable junks in the early game is a painfully slow process of getting mats. So much so that I only did it if absolutely necessary. It picks up once you get the truck and the small dump station, and once that comes along its easy to get 1000+ of each ore easily completely trivializing mining and building. There needs to be a step in between those two extremes. It gets even more OP once the rover comes along. Maybe add a tiny grinder were you can place one ore rock at a time in there that you have to hand carry there? Or perhaps the drone can carry one stone at a time to that tiny grinder for you? Or strap one ore rock onto the ATV instead of those pathetically small ATV storage things?\n\nSo many rooms feel utterly pointless. I built a cafeteria and never used it since you cannot really use it for its purpose as a central \"food, drink and social\" room. The same with the lobby. Its only real purpose is to allow you put on the heavy suit. Why can't we just put CO2 scrubber, battery rack (to charge batteries) into the lobby and use it as a sort of \"prep room\" before heading out of an airlock? Same with the cafeteria, you cannot place a water sink in there to fill up your water. Why devs? Why? The HQ is similarly confusing, but at least it allows you place most essentials (water, battery recharge, storage and science benches), even though where you can place what is not always clear. This needs a complete overhaul. IMHO there should be no reason to restrict where we can place what.\n\nI hate the tablet system. Basically you have to find tablets while exploring that randomly gives you the opportunity to unlock a tech once you have enough points in said tech tree. Tablets don't unlock tech, they *allow you* to unlock tech with points you have to earn through other means first. Sorry but that RNG factor is just horrid. Easy solution: much like the pen drives which are coded to a certain tech tree, just give us coded tablets that gives us one 1 unlock option the tech tree. We can then choose were to spend that point, depending on what makes sense for us. Or remove tablets entirely and re-purpose the pen drives for that. Or even better, just steal Subnautica's mechanic of allowing us to scan those things in the wild at those random POIs to get the blueprint.\n\nProgression in the tech tree seems horribly imbalanced as well. Once I had the medium solar panels I gained electricity points rapidly, so much so, that I was lagging behind with the tablets. Lots of points no place to put them. Botany advanced really quickly with every grown plant, while mechanics and materials were very very hard to level.\n\nThe power usage of rooms seems horribly unbalanced. Why does a long corridor need like 4kw of energy? Why does the workshop the most useful of the buildings need so much power? Why can't I manage the batteries outside remotely from inside with a terminal?\n\nThere also needs to be some touch ups in terms of QoL features. For example the hangar has power slots to charge vehicles, but you cannot fill the rover's oxygen tanks in there. Why not? \n\nWhy aren't there just generic sockets everywhere in my base where I can charge my CO2, O2 and power? Why do I have to fiddle with batteries and tanks right up to the end game? Just give us a charging station, and perhaps a better suit between the light one and the heavy one, that just makes all of that charging easier and more convenient?\n\nWind power seems really useless to me. Solar panels are the way to go and the new nuclear devices (kilo power) will never ever leave you wanting for power. Maybe give us steam engines that use water? Or allow us to ferment some plants to create bio fuel for burning?\n\nGrinding down things for mats is way better to get mats but also arbitrarily locked behind tablet tech. I'd argue that needs a balance pass as well. Perhaps allow us to grind everything from the start, but how much we get is locked by tier? Maybe add some things that can only be gained by grinding POIs, while other things have to be crafted? Or even better, give us the option to grind with the rover, dump scrap, trash and wrecked buildings into the rover to deliver to a recycling station?\n\nStorage cabinets need power. Why? Devs, why? But why? Its not a freezer, its not some magical preservation storage box, its just a cabinet with a display on it. Perhaps overthink the entire storage concept a bit. The small storage boxes are neat, but it they'd be a hundred times better if we could just place them on the walls.

Eventually you hit a brick wall in the form of \"Time Crime\" where the game just wastes your time. There are some bugs, game breaking ones are generally fixable with a reload. The game is being actively developed and there are a couple patches a month so I expect to give this game another shot in a year. Thumbs up because this game shows a lot of potential and I got more hours out of it then it cost in dollars.\n\n\nLong form answer: Time Crime.\n- The turning point for me was after establishing a decent size base and a single weather event can destroy your entire power plant causing critical failure. At the moment there is no wind or nuclear power in the game so solar is your only option and they are heavily diminished by dust devils and sand storms. When the game starts spamming you with dust storms once a week and then it takes two days to recoup from the sand all over the place it takes its toll. \n- On top of that half the research tree is gated behind the exploration feature. Where you have to travel several thousand kilometres away from your base, Mark Watney style in your rover, setting up a solar panel, sleeping during the day, driving in the night(that part was cool), only to find a ruin that has junk or no technology for you. Effectively wasting your time. I later found out after 30 hours that there is a bug where every ruin has a technology tablet you just have to reload your game.\n- The entire food growing mechanic is very tedious. In there are 4 stages of plants, you start them off in an incubator, move them to a shelf, plant them in the ground, then put them in a dome. I love that part of the mechanic. The tedious part is moving the plants around is very clunky, the ratios for each stage are a little wonky. Example: Incubators hold 20 plants, stage 2 hold 18 plants but the large item you use to move the plants around only holds 17 plants, so there is a lot of back and forth and some waste. Setting up the power/water/fertilizer/soil ratios has to be done each time you plant a new crop so it eventually gets tedious. Once you have food, you have to combine multiple types of food to get a decent amount of hunger bar from each meal or you'll be chowing down on a dozen potatoes like in Minecraft. The entire thing just needs a pass, but it is a cool concept.\n\nThe game overall is really fun. The tutorial is a little tedious with some buggy movement and controls you will have to just get used to. This game has a lot of potential once its polished up a bit. I love the challenge and technical nature of the game. One thing that stood out was having to drag around cables and hoses to connect machines to power and liquids, just like in real life. Deconstructing solar panels during the day results in sparks flying out that can shock you. There are other examples but I digress. \n\nLooking forward to doing another run in 6-12 months after this game gets some more cook time.", "timestamp_created": 1687923555, "timestamp_updated": 1687923555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879686415195465088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149562545": {"recommendationid": "149562545", "author": {"steamid": "76561199223051104", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 7285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1702511166}, "language": "english", "review": "Campaign mode is tough, and almost made me quit playing for good, so unless you're super dedicated or just love punishment, I'd recommend starting with a few hours in sandbox mode. (It goes without saying that you should complete all of the in-game tutorials either way before jumping in, but I'm going to say it anyway.)\n\nEssentially, it does take time to learn the mechanics of the game, and resources simply deplete too quickly during the first few days of the campaign. You end up in a death spiral, short of having individual game save files perhaps once a day, so you can essentially \"go back in time\" and not make the same mistakes. It takes time to reach a sustainable point, and time, food, water, and oxygen are precious resources.\n\nI'm glad I went to sandbox mode and was able to make a bunch of mistakes, learn the game, and discover how the game loop can be enjoyable. If you choose to start in Campaign mode that's fine, just don't give up. You can start a new game in sandbox mode and learn the game, then come back to the campaign easily, but that's my suggestion.\n\nI think the real problem is that the day/night cycle is simply too fast, and it's one of the more frequent complaints I've seen in other reviews.\n\nWhile there aren't any Steam Workshop mods for this game, you can head on over to nexusmods and get the \"TIME SCALE MOD\". It's the only mod I run for Occupy Mars, but it's a MUST HAVE IMO! \n\nSince there are no in-game speed options, and the default speed is ridiculous, I most likely would have stopped playing the game had I not found this mod to slow time down to a reasonable speed.

I played the demo a few years ago I think, and I thought it was a relatively original idea for a sci-fi sandbox. I was really looking forward to the actual game. But now, after a few hours of playing, even taking the \"early access\" into account, I'm very much disappointed.\n\nFor starters, half of my experience with this game was just waiting. I played on a hardware that more than satisfies the recommended requirements, and with settings set to medium, the game lagged most of the time. Loading screens took minutes. Interacting with anything locked me into 3 seconds of unskippable animation, so merely opening the shelves in the landing pod to get the starting resources takes me a minute when it should have been 5 seconds. Except for the initial part, all the messages in the campaign were also unskippable and had a weird delay. When walking around the base, you end up waiting a second for a slow door or airlock every few seconds. It's somehow unbelivably frustrating and tragically boring at the same time.\n\nThen, there are the bugs. The first time I played the campaign, I got locked in an interface of some machine that tried to take a milion cables from my inventory, even though I didn't even have that many, and wouldn't let me leave no matter how many times I tried escape or RMB. Then a machine exploded in my face and glitched me inside the stairs, so I had to restart the game. I even managed to stick my head through the wall a few times. I replayed the first part of the campaign avoiding exploring the base in fear of breaking the game again (making it mostly pointless), and the second part had me run out of an exploding ruined base with a character that gets stuck on every piece of rubble on the ground. After giving up on the campaign and trying the free play, I found out that the replicator in the starting pod consumes the resources, but doesn't seem to produce anything. At that point, I gave up on the game entirely. They might as well just give me a welder that only blows soap bubbles and ask me to build my base with it.\n\nAnd to those that say \"it's just an early access\", I have two counterarguments:\nFor one, this \"game\" already costs more than a fully-working released game with all of the idea promised here would, and to me, it delivers practically no entertainment worth enduring the constant frustration. If I'm expected to test or co-develop it, I should be paid by the developers, not the other way around.\nAnd for two, I doubt I'm investing in the finished product, because the current game has even worse quality than the demo. It's like their only prioirty was whatever was necessary for the showcase in the trailers and broadcasted gameplay, and they completely forgot that this is supposed  to be a game as well. It has significantly more content, but that just means more technical debt, more opportunities for bugs, and more things that can break whenever they need to change anything. At this rate, they'll just end up in development hell until they run out of budget and will have to give up on the game.\n\nI want to be wrong, and I hope that this can work out, so I won't refund this game. But I consider it more of a charity than investment, so if you are looking for an actual playable game, look somewhere else.", "timestamp_created": 1685784972, "timestamp_updated": 1685788007, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786643624305725098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1685880038, "developer_response": "Hello, \n\nThank you for giving our game a shot and for the review. \n\nWe released a big patch on the test branch yesterday that tackles some of the issues that you mentioned.

The whole concept is brilliant. Setting up power and plugging in cables with sockets is fun. The building system is great.\n\nThe core parts of the game mining and salvaging are buggy and horrible. As soon as I started playing this was an issue and now 30 hours in its just fustrating which is a pity for what can and maybe one day will be a fantastic game.\n\nSalvaging :: Instead of mousing over something and it tells you what the mouse is over, then you hold left click and salvage that item(like every other game!) nope it doesn't do that!! it randomly flickers and grinds whatever is under the cursor and you can move and grind something different. It flickers to something different even if the mouse is completly still. So trying to grind a barrel it will start grinding the wall or a desk. Which isn't so bad but when you upgrade the grinder it will grind the whole desk and destroy the barrel you were actually trying to grind. The 3rd upgrade actually grinds down the whole structure so trying to grind a barrel or a desk and the whole structure just vanishes along with everything in it !! No xp, no materials. Grinding things down is the first bit of the game you come across and you have to do a lot of it, so it should work well??! My suggestion hovering over items lights them up, holding left click grinds the item that is highlighted only. Easy fix!\n\nMining :: Again this is a core part of the game, mine ore and build stuff. Straight from the start of the game its not great. Instead of highlighting over something and mining that, it has the same issue as salvaging. It should be fun like other games, minecraft, space engineers, etc. The other issue is the scanner for ore, you scan ore and it tells you what it is after about 1 second. scan another rock after 1 second it tells you what that is, mouse over to the first rock and it rescans it again for 1 second etc even though it knows what it is, so why rescan it? so the mining involves : get scanner out, scan, get mining drill out, mine, put mining drill away otherwise you cant pick up the ore?? get scanner out again and repeat. This game requires a lot of mining so make it fun and reduce the amount of busy work?. \n\nAlso even though you scan the rocks, you cant tell what they are, after scanning they should show up on the map or the ui? All the rocks are identical looking so trying to find specific ores, lol its just annoying. Scan oh its not that one, scan oh not that one etc with no way of marking what you have already scanned and what it is! like after you scan an ore make it change color so you can clearly see oh its silicon or iron. Or show it on the ui and the map? Have big huge rocks so you can slowly work your way through? like huge veins.\n\nAfter playing and finally unlocking the big rover vehicle which I was excited about, was disappointed after trying it. The drill bit is tiny, the same logic as the handheld manual drill, and you are meant to grind the ore down only once to smaller chunks(but not the smallest size) and load them into the back of the truck with a grabber. But you can accidentally grind it down to much to the small pieces, which you cant pick up with the grabber and worse of all you dont get the high yield that you are meant to get. I searched on youtube and people are actually using the hand drill to mine instead of the vehicle just to get it to the right size and then using the grabber. Which makes no sense whatsover. My suggestion have a massive drillhead that grinds the rock down to the proper size thats needed.\n\nAlso the grabber is questionable, there is a camera to see what its doing and guide it in place and such, but it has such a short reach it should be a lot longer and maybe more automatic? Its okay the first time but grinding loads of rocks just becomes tedious instead of fun. The gameplay loop for the rover is drive to rock, get out of rover, get the handdrill out, mine rock into the right size pieces, get back in truck grab a few bits, press tab, maneuver truck closer because grabber range is so small, tab again to switch to grabber, pick up some pieces, tab back, move truck again etc. My suggestion, big drill bit that quickly drills the rock in to the right size pieces with no way to make them to small, and then much longer range grabber to pick them up. Or ai bots that automatically picks up the pieces or something?\n\nMap system :: Map is bad. You can only track 3 things on the hud, why :( And only with colors, yellow, red, green. Why not make a map where you can add notes and change to any color you want, with as many notes as you want. And then you can tick and untick the items you want to track? You can make notes but not set the text color of the note, and the text actually goes under some elements on the map like structures so you cant read or see them anyway :( Also notes in the fog of war/shroud dont show up lol. You cant use the map while driving???? you have to stop your vehicle, get out to actually view the map?? come on guys this is the basic things to get right.\n\nUI / Hud ::\n\nthere is a choice between first person and third person camera which is nice, apart from the fact going to third person gets rid of the hud and ui :( so if you running out of oxygen or water it wont tell you if you are in third person... Hud should always be visible, and if need be toggle options to hide or show it.\nThis might just be me but vital stats should all be on the same place on the hud, not some on the left and others on the right. Also you cant use inventory while in a vehicle.\n\nI havent mentioned the random bugs that force you to reload your save, because this is early access and thats fine, you can quicksave by pressing F5 so do that regularly and its not a big deal. \n\nThe things i have mentioned I feel are important because its the core of the gameplay and the first thing new people see and interact with. Mining and salvaging should work well and be fun, the map should work well so you can make notes on every little thing you want, ie \"big hill watch out\" \"water patch here\" \"loads of solar panels here to grind down\" \"half looted\" \"go here\"\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1696945338, "timestamp_updated": 1696945338, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.747132837772369385", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1697099500, "developer_response": "Hello,\n\nThank you for such detailed feedback.

For being so early on in EA (or imo beta build) it seems well built and fairly fleshed out as far as buildings being ingame, models working etc.\nThe loading screen states this is an EA game with bugs...if you don't like such things, I dunno what to say.\nIn 20+ hours I've only encountered 1 or 2 game breaking bugs that were resolved by rolling back to an earlier save, I think it cost me 2-3h of gameplay total. For me that's totally fine for EA but I know that would bother some people. \nI expect to get another 10-20h of gameplay on the initial release build of EA which I'm on and then return to it as it gets updated. My hope is that they follow the No Mans Sky model of continuing to update the game over time while selling copies to pay for development, NMS turned into a gem of a game. Ocupy Mars is way less buggy and more stable imo and has large potential (not as high a ceiling as NMS) but could be a very very good game once it's out of EA and continuing on.\n", "timestamp_created": 1683975480, "timestamp_updated": 1683975480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741591393947601318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "152916118": {"recommendationid": "152916118", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993518995", "num_games_owned": 673, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4194, "last_played": 1710496857}, "language": "english", "review": "This has been a really tough decision, it's almost a \"wish there was a neutral\" style review.  But, ultimately, the question \"Would I recommend this game as is?\" would have to be answered with a \"No\".  There exist worse games for the money, but also much better ones.\n\nSo, on to the why of it.  First and foremost, the game is buggy and does not explain its own mechanics well.  There's an intro / \"tutorial\" but it's honestly THE buggiest part of the entire game, as in it locked up when, upon being informed I should take my helmet off now that I'm inside the doors of the base, I took my helmet off, which apparently the on-rails scripted tutorial just could NOT handle.\n\nAfter, or if, you manage to get through said section or just skip it to play sandbox, you're presented with an empty Red Planet that is dotted with abandoned bases.  For some reason repairing these bases and getting them functional as a shelter isn't an option, no instead they're there for you to grind down for parts and resources and loot for other parts and resources.\n\nAt this point there feels like a real thing of interest as you struggle to assemble what you need for things like having power throughout the night so your plants stay unhurt from Martian temperatures, and that can be touch and go early game, but once you've assembled enough power generation and storage (be it a solar power and battery setup or going whole-hog on wind generators)... well, functionally that's it.  There's just... nothing more to do.\n\nOh, you can grind and grind and grind for the heavy rover, sure.  But then you discover that, once again... you end up with this feeling of just... \"why?\".\n\nUpdates are still happening, and fixes are still ostensibly happening but the improvements and polish that the game desperately needs just don't seem to be forthcoming.  Certainly not at the rate needed to bring this game up to its potential any time soon.\n\nAnd the game HAS potential, there's a spark of something good here.  But I'm sure we've all seen so many Early-Access games just get abandoned or declared done despite being nothing of the sort.

But when compared to similar space games like Icarus or even KSP, its fairly rudimentary in its current state. Once you gather blueprints and materials to build a base you're pretty much done with the game as far as I can tell. There's not really any quests, and base decorating is almost non existent. The Greenhouse is somewhat interesting and the rover has potential, but apart from that, there is very little to interact with. You can go out in a rover to mine resources to build a mega base, but there's little incentive to do so, since it's just you, and anything bigger than a small base just feels empty and redundant. You could explore the map, but its very uninteresting, apart from generic abandoned outposts and a few very scattered points of interest. I didn't bother with the jetpack, since by the time its unlocked I'd already built a base and unlocked all the tech I could, so there wasn't much point apart from flying up to get a better view of the base.\n\n I love space.

I tried. I put in a fair ~9 hours. Constructive feedback time..\n\nI'll try to keep it as concise as possible.\nWhat feels bad:\n  In a game with so many levers, you get action locked into using every single lever. If you are a couple of steps too far away and try to use a lever, you will get action locked into taking baby steps until you can reach said lever.. and then slowly pull it down all the way and stare at it until it goes back up. That feels terrible.. The best levers in the game are when you are running to the escape pod and the timer has stopped.. the lever to the hatches leading to the busted elevator. You click them and they move.. simple. This goes for anything that locks you into an action like that. Opening overhead compartments included.\n\n  Accessing your Pipboy seems pretty slow too. Maybe this is just a gripe from me, but it feels like Fallout where it takes too long. It could just be that I'm already frustrated from the time to use levers, so that might just be a me thing. \n\n  The choice to not let me use my map on the ATV is a brutal one. Maybe it's because it's tied to your Pipboy.. err.. Marsboy? How about just having the map pop up on your face shield while you're driving?\n\n  The tutorial. The tutorial is dope in the lore category. I don't mind that. But it feels long winded and like you're running through a maze doing irrelevant stuff. In 9 hours, I haven't needed to replace a fuse or any of that. Granted - some of my time was spend reloading or walking away for a little bit out of frustration. Also, when you first land in your recovery vessel, you would think that you need to get material points by scrapping. So, people generally grab the grinder and go to the nearest base to grind away only to find out that they need an upgraded grinder. Hopefully they find out that they need to use the grinder on the smaller boxes and such inside.\n\nBUGS:\n  The workbench. It basically is a bug. Your tools disappearing. Finishing a repair doesn't repair always. Sometimes you can dupe a small circuit board, etc... It's such a cool idea, but I feel like it went from idea to Prod and skipped QA.\n  The advanced tablets. Those things you read to get the advanced schematics... yea.. It really sucks to ride out to a POI on your ATV (stopping every few minutes to hop off and check the map) and see that the advanced tablet has fallen through the floor of a structure that you need a higher level grinder to make it through.\n\nThis is my first review - so sorry for the crappy formatting.\nThat's it.

There are a few hiccups with the game but nothing major. I should point out that 4 patch have been published in less than a week since launch so some bugs that were present on launch day are already gone(infinite loading in particular). Thus the game is not as broken as some early reviews would lead you to believe. \n\nThe game is fun but a number of issues(big&small) remain: \n\nThe soundtrack is fine but the game will occasionally cycle from one track to the next without rhyme or reason, as far as I can tell. That can be a bit jarring at times. It's also a little repetitive. I wish we had more control over that.\n\nThe performance is okay but it's somewhat lower than the play test(pre-early access) for one reason or another(it could be the different location on the map). I used to get low to mid 90's now I currently get high 70's to low 80's on average with dips to 40's or sometimes 30's when on the QUAD ATV. Given my high spec system(5900x/32gb ram/3090), it is mildly disappointing to see occasional stutters when there were none previously(or very few) but it is also early access. To be fair, I maxed out all the graphics settings so the game would run better if I were to lower a few.\n\nWhile most of the core features are in the game, they still need to add a number of things so optimisations will likely take some time, which is fine. Adding DLSS support would be nice. \n\nThe datapad fetch quests is rather boring. I am not convinced that datapads should be required for basic technologies. In the game you are purportedly an electrical engineer, yet, you need to rediscover how to extend/upgrade the ECU/batteries? Seems odd to me. Also, far too grindy. This is a delicate balancing act though. If it becomes too easy then players will blitz through the tech tree and skip some of the techs but right now given how rare datapads are, I think some techs should have that requirement waved. It also forces us to reload the game if we don't get the tech we need so overall the experience is janky. Sure it's self-inflicted to a point but trust me, you REALLY want those battery upgrades and as it stands, finding a sufficient amount of datapad in a reasonable time-frame is too hard. I found 3 datapads after being 6 hours in the campaign(which is not worth it right now, just do freeplay).\n\nThe system should be modified such that you still need datapads to progress toward mid & late game techs but for the technologies you need to build a basic self-sufficient base you should be able to get them without datapads. So essentially, a workshop that can power itself and produce food in perpetuity. One might think that you don't truly need the ecu and battery upgrade to do this but I disagree because of the circuits board requirement. You need at least 48hours of battery capacity and assuming a drain of 25 kw, that's a lot of batteries.~7 circuit boards or 1 per 180kwh of capacity provided by un-upgraded batteries, +3 or 4 for ecu, +1 for ATV. Just not realistic to expect player to obtain that many small circuit boards in the early game. Why 48 hours? Dust Storms. Solar panels produces nothing during storms and run at a lower rate for some time after unless you clean them.  Probably want 72 hours of capacity to be extra safe. Thankfully, upgrades for ecu and batteries don't need circuits board which seems reasonable to me. Just be really careful with those potato seeds and don't plant them too early.\n\n[b]Speaking of circuit boards, Please Devs, make them stackables[/b]. Also, let us store them in the containers in the capsule.\n\nThe distribution of circuit boards on the map is strange. I have found 7 large ones, about the same amount of small ones but only one medium circuit board. This might be fine depending on which devices need which circuit board(something which the knowledge base in the game doesn't cover at the moment), so time will tell. \n\nSome techs should be shifted around. Why is suit battery printing so far up the tech tree? It's weird. But again, early access and things already changed substantially from the previous version so I expect that things will keep changing according to feedback.\n\nI dislike the new procedure to remove the helmet. Too many clicks are involved( I use the keybind instead). More importantly, there should be an option to speed up or skip the animation. First person animation for helmet removal and when going to sleep would be nice... \n\nThe biggest issue in my opinion is that the campaign is not very good right now. You should just play the tutorials on the main menu and then do free play. Here's why:\nThe facial animations don't seem to always work or maybe not every character has facial animations, I'm not sure. The more important issue though it's that the whole story intro at alpha base feels rushed and it seems like it's just tacked on. You very briefly get introduced to some characters and some of the basic mechanics without it being a full blown tutorial and then complete three or four basic tasks which don't teach you anything immediately useful. Then the base gets blown up everyone either leaves or dies and you are left alone on mars. After that, you start just like you would if you had selected free play. \n\nAnother issue is that after the base gets destroyed, you need to escape it and it's an absolute maze.  This would be fine if not for the fact that if you run, jump or move too quickly in some corridors(the ones with collapsed roof or missing floors mainly) you die instantly. Escaping it was a lot of trials and errors. Even before the base gets destroyed, navigating through it was a pain since a lot of airlocks are locked for no apparent reason and you often need to take a massive detour to get where you need to go.  There are also no sign post anywhere so finding the doctors office for example is just a matter of opening every door in the general direction that the arrow points towards. I like the general idea but the intro needs a lot of polish.  I am not sure if there are currently more story related content beyond that but I will update my review If I find any. \n\nThere are a few other issues and a little jank( no crosshair or target highlight when grinding/mining/repairing, pop-in of your face while driving the ATV, no map while driving the ATV) but this review is getting quite long.  \n\nAll in all though, the Devs have good ideas and a good work ethic if the incredible patch cadence is any indication and I imagine the issues will get fixed sooner or later. \n\nIn short, a good albeit not perfect early access game but a solid 7/10.

It's better now that threre are buildable water taps (a tap the size of a bathroom) and battery chargers, but still feels overcomplicated and non realistic\n- Power, I'm not sure what's going on there... it's trivial enough to overbuild your power supply and put a bunch of batteries&extensions in parralel, but system in general feels overcomplicated and unrealistic (power can vanish into the air without any consumer, same for the water)\n- Things like temperature and pressure in facilities just passively work, like facility just instantly heating up to needed temperature once power turns on, complicated topic seems oversimplified to the extreme.\n- Facility issues and weird limitations, low variety (to be fair it's similar to other games, like subnaitica, but equipment placement is predefined to such a degree that it feels like there is no variety, ex: all doors are predefined, can't build vertically).\n- Inventory... When 3D printer and rover are the most effective storage... There are some improvements in 'nuclear' branch, but that's scratching at the surface of the issue.

Taking a tool from stationary storage into toolbar is not possible, you need to open inventory separately.

Doesn't seem like a lot here except casual survival and base building. A lot of balancing still needed to keep padded game time to a minimum. Very few bugs, none of which were game breaking from what I found.\n\n-\n\nSo here's the long version. Game is fun to a degree but it has some frustrating elements to it. Examples include random blue print unlocks which gate some important things such as vehicles. It takes literal hours to gain research points, though thankfully that's through actions you would already be taking just playing the game anyway. Random weather events like tornadoes taking quite a long time to pass as well as a night so cold you start taking damage just being outside.\n\nMore than a few times I found myself going down a slight decline only to some how start falling down instead of walking and die to fall damage. This means any progress I've made since the last save is completely lost. Added to that the travel times and tediousness of resource gathering make for a very frustrating time.\n\nI did find the base building mechanics a bit clunky but easy to understand. Most things have easy to follow indicators but a lack of manual rotation controls gives it an awkward feel.\n\nLastly there's a bit too much busy work, though some of it I did find interesting to work out, like the circuitry repair, though basic survival resource management and farming were on the tedious/clunky side. Though farming did have it's quirks I was tired of it after a few rounds of planting/harvesting/processing repeat. Yes, that's how farming works, it's just the particular mechanics here are over complicated or downright tedious.\n\nI'd say give this a little more time to cook and it'll probably be worth your time and money.", "timestamp_created": 1695501790, "timestamp_updated": 1695501790, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652058064937591553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1695579552, "developer_response": "Hello,\n\nThank you for playing the game and for the thorough feedback.

I have been following this work of art from the beginning along with many others. I will start off by saying I am a proud backer of the Kickstarter that brought us this game. There are some things that need worked on with the game, but I just played it for 5 hours and thoroughly enjoyed it. As long as you're not trying to play the game on a potato of a computer, everything ran fine for me and looked great on Medium graphics settings with the resolution set for 1900x1080.

A majority of these people claiming to have all these issues most likely don't have the settings configured properly. Anyone who is a fan of the survival genre, LOOK NO FURTHER! This game has it all, and instead of having to worry about annoying A.I. Wolves, Bears, or other creatures. You simply have to survive the harsh elements of Mars. I absolutely love that the devs of this game worked hand in hand with the folks developing tools/structures for colonies on the Moon/Mars in the here and now. The structures you see in game are the prototypes of what they may be using in future colonization missions in space. What a time to be alive! You can expect the normal grind you would have to put in when playing a solid survival game. You have the same frustrations as well, however, this game is Early Access and I would have to say it is probably one of the better Early Access titles I have played that hasn't been a complete flop. Including AAA titles. So well done to the devs. Get it now while the price is good.

More than a few times I have had to completely relocate my base because when I would load back up, there would be buildings that had been disassembled right square in the middle of my base, or even better buildings that were not visible but there from before wrecking my airlock and power systems.  That brings the second scary part, disassembling parts leads to a LOT of the RNG components just disappering completely.  Worse, these components can't be just replaced by making them again, it becomes a hunt through some more of the broken bases to try to replace them... over and over and over.  I have even had some disappear during the save/load cycle.  Items have disappeared out of storage.

The game is not finished, not even close. I am writing this to counter-balance the people who like to complain, and are usually the loudest. \n\nMy first 30 minutes (Ive played for 6.9 hours now) was ... not fun. I decided to go through the tutorial/campaign and it was a disaster. I got stuck on a toilet, no joke. Modern players do not need to be handheld so much as to be instructed to sit on a toilet. I dont know about other people, but i dont enjoy sitting there listening to NPC's talk about crap I dont care about. Its annoying. \n\nEventually I said screw it and did the Free Play. Once I did that I started having fun. I have restarted i think about 6 times so far. Each time ive tried a different starting area and there are VAST differences between the areas. Someone should document the differences, because they are kind of major. \n\nFirst irritation in Free Play was the way cables are handled. If you put one in your hand, you can never again pick it up and put it away. \n\nResearch was super confusing for a while. I eventually figured out that the reason nothing seemed to work was because I had changed the research option difficulty to be the medium one (it defaults to hardest). On the medium difficulty basically all the starting research is done and you cant do the more advanced research without specific tables. There is an AI at the beginning of the game that implies the research you have is temporary... but i dont believe this to be the case. \n\nI dont like the way research points are earned. You have to mine so much minerals to get a point so you can unlock the Workshop (no idea what mining has to do with a workshop)... and you HAVE to do this because either electricity or mechanics require that Workshop be unlocked for you to progress in those trees. So basically you are forced into a progression of mining, then deconstruction then building just to get the pre-req's unlocked in other trees. \n\nWalking ... omfg... thats rough. Find an ATV and everything changes. A must have. \n\nNot fond of mining. Its loud. It takes forever. Its mind numbing. \n\nOk... so what do i like. \n\nI like the mechanics of it all. I mean, thats the reason a lot of us play these types of games. Think Stationeers or Space Engineers for example. This doesnt have the complexity of Stationeers... but it might eventually. I like the way you can turn valves and flip switches on the CO2 scrubber for instance, or the way  you can controller power from the Transformer and Batteries. I like that you can upgrade your devices with more complex systems and then tie them altogether. I like running cables from one place to another, along with water and O2. \n\nI highly recommend playing on the hard setting. You miss so much of the game if you play it on tourist setting where you have tons of resources and everything is unlocked. \n\nThe game is not easy. It could use some graphics overhall for sure. Once multiplayer is in it will be much more fun.\n\nIts 20 some odd bucks. Fair price for an EA game I think... not like those other morons charging $70 now for an EA game. \n\nGive it a chance.

I still do and ill play and get more people in because i can say with certanty from watching the devs streams and watching the development that this will be a good one. Call me a white knight if you want thats just ignorance. People love to bash games that are EA because of bugs and they expect them to be perfect. We all see the trolls who love to jump in and push stuff into the red to hurt the devs. We all know this exists.\nLook at the game for what it is and can be for the future. They worked hard on this and had many sleepless nights to bring us this excellent sim. Try it and judge for yourself and understand this game isnt perfect\"Yet\". \nIt has good graphics thats a lie, it has a tutorial and it can get stuck, again they told us all that on the page. Now that the meat is doen they can focus on the fluff with a few tweaks. Occupy mars is a game well worth waiting the three years or more for it that i have.\nUltimately try it for yourself, give it a shot and remember other games that came out with bugs, darktide guys? Vermintide 2? Cyberpunk? All bashed and trolled but still going strong. At least Occupy mars isnt a cash cow for the company as so many titles are these days. My vote is a 10 our of 10, yes it needs work but isnt that what an EA game is all about? If you dont like the bugs or possibility of bugs, then play something else or refund this one. But im telling you, if you like space survival then your gonna love this one. In the past the bugs we had lasted maybe a week or less before they were HARD addressed. I mean you can look at osirus new dawn, they took that one over, ruined it, then declared it done and bailed on it while its a broken mess. The guys at pyramid games arent like this at all, this is thier passion project and doesnt deserve people telling people not to buy it. Bugs happen guys, if you dont like it dont play EA games. \nAs someone whos played this since demo and then at backing, id say your in for a treat just gotta roll with it for now. They do work hard on it.\nI want to edit this and point something out to the potential customers, Notice alot of the negative reviews are from people playing for about five mins, certainly less than an hour or two.

Yet, the initial excitement fades, exposing a game that lacks depth. The technology tree, touted for customization, disappoints as players are forced into a narrow progression path, making most choices inconsequential.\n\nProgression becomes a grind, demanding repetitive tasks, while the illusion of an open world gives way to a singular, predetermined route. The mandatory search for tablets feels more like a tiresome obligation than an enjoyable quest.\n\nHowever, amidst the shortcomings, Occupying Mars boasts positive aspects. The intricate handling of electricity, water, and gas adds an interesting layer of complexity, enhancing the overall gameplay. The electronic repair feature is a welcome addition, contributing to immersion by making the Martian experience feel more authentic. Additionally, the food creation mechanic adds depth to the game, further immersing players in the challenges of survival on the Red Planet.\n\nIn conclusion, setting aside issues with performance and overall polishing, Occupying Mars reveals itself as a game with untapped potential. To provide a lasting and enjoyable experience, it requires substantial work in terms of additional features and increased depth. The game should offer more varied ways to play, ensuring that each player's journey on Mars is a unique and engaging experience.

Developed by Pyramid Games, the game takes a daring leap into the realm of interplanetary colonization, offering players a taste of what it might be like to establish a human presence on Mars.\nVisually, the game manages to capture the stark beauty of the Martian landscape, with its rusty red terrain and towering cliffs. The attention to detail is impressive, from the intricate rovers and habitats to the dynamic weather systems that can dramatically affect your colonists' survival. It's clear that the developers have put a considerable amount of effort into creating a visually captivating representation of Mars.\nThe gameplay mechanics in \"Occupy Mars\" are where the game truly shines. Players are faced with a plethora of challenges as they strive to establish a functional colony in an inhospitable environment. From managing resources like oxygen, water, and power, to growing crops and maintaining machinery, every decision carries weight and consequences. This level of complexity adds a layer of realism and depth that keeps players engaged and constantly thinking about the long-term sustainability of their colony.\nOne of the standout features of the game is the attention to scientific accuracy. \"Occupy Mars\" does an excellent job of incorporating real-world concepts and challenges of Mars colonization into its gameplay. Whether it's dealing with radiation exposure, dust storms, or the intricacies of hydroponic farming, players are required to think critically and strategically to overcome these obstacles.\nHowever, it's worth noting that the game's learning curve can be steep, especially for those new to simulation and management games. The initial hours of gameplay can be overwhelming as players grapple with the various systems and mechanics. A more comprehensive tutorial or optional hints could potentially alleviate this initial difficulty and make the game more accessible to a broader audience.\nIn terms of replayability, \"Occupy Mars\" offers multiple playstyles and approaches to colony management. Whether you want to focus on scientific research, exploration, or industrial development, the game accommodates different strategies, allowing players to experiment and find their preferred playstyle.\nWhile \"Occupy Mars\" excels in many areas, it's not without a few minor drawbacks. The user interface, while functional, could benefit from some streamlining to improve overall user experience. Additionally, some players might find the lack of a robust narrative or character development a bit of a letdown, as the game leans heavily on the simulation aspect.\nIn conclusion, \"Occupy Mars\" delivers on its promise of providing an immersive and challenging experience of colonizing the Red Planet. With its attention to detail, scientific accuracy, and complex gameplay mechanics, it's a must-play for fans of space exploration and simulation games. While there are a few areas that could be improved, the overall package is a testament to Pyramid Games' dedication to creating a realistic and engaging Martian colonization experience.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691831973, "timestamp_updated": 1691831973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545880436897277832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141538684": {"recommendationid": "141538684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030290953", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 23511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10830, "last_played": 1697250501}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game its engaging and challenging.
