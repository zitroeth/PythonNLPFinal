Nah, Let the monkey do it![/h1]\n\u3000Before Palworld gained mainstream popularity for enslaving Pok\u00e9mon-like monsters, we had The survivalists who enslaved monkeys.\n\n[H3]Review :[/h3]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]\u3000\u3000About[/th]\n        [th]\u3000\u3000Description[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]G\u1d00\u1d0d\u1d07\u1d18\u029f\u1d00\u028f[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000Ah, I thought this game would be another Don't Starve-like experience, but I was wrong. It's an interesting survival game involving crafting, gathering, and sailing to other islands. Of course, you can have a monkey do all the tasks by either saving them from a cage or giving them some food. They don't seem to have perfect AI. for example, a monkey delivering loot to a crafting station might be intercepted by another monkey returning it back to crate. But, it is what it is.\n\n\u3000To make it clear, this game has the worst buttons I've ever played with. It doesn't follow the usual button mapping you would expect, though luckily, it has binding support, which helped a lot. The basics of the game rely on trial and error, leading me to regenerate my island three times to understand the game. Fortunately, you can bring your character to a regenerated island and join someone else's room, which I think is a plus. However, the menu for managing characters isn't as simple as in Terraria, which is a bummer because Terraria offers a better UI experience and menu. Overall, the gameplay was great, though I don't mind the combat in this game, it could become chaotic when a raid happens, and you may need to gather as many monkeys as possible to help you.\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]G\u0280\u1d00\u1d18\u029c\u026a\u1d04[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000Well, I like the simple graphics. it's similar to those free Unity assets you might discover online when learning Unity. However, the only complaint I have is that this game is essentially locked to the specified requirements. It lacks advanced graphic settings like the ability to turn off shadows or bloom. I know it's not a big issue for many people, but I lean more towards helping low-spec users than the spoiled playstation generation ones. That's all. it's more beautiful than Don't Starve, but on the downside, the gameplay isn't as deep as Don't Starve.\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]M\u1d1c\u029f\u1d1b\u026a\u1d18\u029f\u1d00\u028f\u1d07\u0280[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000I'm not sure if the game is dead or if it's LAN-based, but the inability to find public rooms is its downfall. I've tried it, and so far, I can't find any public rooms. Of course, it's not a problem since public rooms usually have issues. For instance, in Don't Starve, you might join a US dedicated server and encounter a trolling player party who kick you with his Steam name 'blank' Unfortunately, the developers of that game don't seem to do anything about those trolls. That's one of the reasons why I jumped into other survival games, like this one.\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]C\u1d0f\u0274\u1d1b\u0280\u1d0f\u029f[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000Mouse and keyboard work well, but it's clunky.\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]P\u029f\u1d00\u028f\u1d1b\u026a\u1d0d\u1d07[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000Could reach 15h to 50h or more if you love the gameplay.\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]S\u1d1b\u1d0f\u0280\u028f[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000Ah, I've never seen a game where you literally regenerate your survival island when you get bored or finish your old world. Instead of waiting for someone to help you or creating a boat to reach a populated island, you get to choose an empty one. It seem you can escape but nah so many people backlogged the game based on HLTB so... It's just a random scenario where your character is stranded on an island full of monkeys that work for you to death after you release them from a cage or give them food, The monkey became so loyal, like those underpaid office workers who call their workplace a 'family. overal its a completly definition of one biggest country in asia.\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]PC \u1d18\u1d0f\u0280\u1d1b[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n[b]Tested OS[/b]\nWindows 10 Home | 64 Bit, Version 22H2.\n\n[b]Hardware[/b]\nCPU\u3000Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i7-7700HQ\nGPU\u3000NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950M\nRAM\u300016 GB DDR4\n\n[b]Performance Test[/b]\n\u3000\u2022\u300060 FPS.\n\u3000\u2022\u3000Run on SSD.\n\u3000\u2022\u3000HD resolution.\n\u3000\u2022\u3000CPU | medium usage\n\u3000\u2022\u3000GPU | Medium Usage\n\n[b]Game Optimization[/b]\n\u3000Run perfectly well\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]A\u1d04\u1d04\u1d07ss\u026a\u0299\u026a\u029f\u026a\u1d1b\u028f[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n[b]Audiotory[/b]\n\u3000?\u3000Playable with disability\n_\nSpeaker config\n\u3000\u2022\u3000-\nSound Setting\n\u3000\u2022\u3000SFX\n\u3000\u2022\u3000Music\n\n[b]Visual[/b]\nColorblind\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Deuteranopia\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Protanopia\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Tritanopia\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Custom\nUI\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Dark\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Scale\nSubtitle\n\u3000\u2717\u3000on/off\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Scale\nDisplay\n\u3000\u2713\u3000Fullscreen\n\u3000\u2713\u3000Windowed\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Borderless\nFPS\n\u3000\u2717\u300030\n\u3000\u2713\u300060\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Unlimited / More\nMisc\n\u3000\u2713\u3000Vsync\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Gamma\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Contras\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Brightness\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Resolution Scale\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Advanced graphic setting\n\n[b]Motor/Body disability[/b]\nControl type\n\u3000\u2717\u3000Simple\n\u3000\u2713\u3000Complex\n\u00bd\u3000Slow reaction\n\u2713\u3000Binding custom control\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\n\u3000For a 2020 game that lacks advanced graphic settings, it's disappointing!

Recommendation remains the same.\n\nThe game starts nice and simple... and stays just nice and simple throughout, just with more monkeys. I'd say it is correctly described by the \"casual\" tag, just... too casual for the asking price. I've tried to find its charm, but its flaws and deficiencies far outweigh its nice things.\n\nThe premise of the game is promising, but the execution is poor. Other than aesthetics, your character is exactly the same from the beginning to the end; no skills, experience, stats improvements, etc. The survival aspect is absolutely minimal, with only a very limited stamina pool, some mostly negligible hunger meter, health and the ever present you-must-consume-potion-to-survive-biome gimmick. There are tiered weapons and tools, but these are mostly wasted on you, as your monkeys can use them more efficiently, both due to their increasing skill stat and from sheer number of them... and then there is little incentive to use anything beyond the basic stuff.\n\n[strike]Speaking of monkeys, the novelty of the game is quickly brought down by poor execution, and terrible controls/interaction. If you have two or three monkeys, it is mostly fine, but 5+ become incredibly annoying to manage. From terrible interactions with other parts of the game, to a faulty user interface, managing the army you will accrue becomes not a chore, but an annoyance.[/strike]\n\nI truly don't know what exactly this game is about. It's not survival, as the \"survival\" elements can be mostly ignored or have a trivial solution. Not base building, as your options as fairly limited [strike]and you have no incentive to defend or improve,[/strike] and everything is almost literally dirt-cheap. Not combat, as it is solved with low-tier weapons handled to enough monkeys. Not AI-based automation, since there is no real depth to the crafting system, the AI is quite lacking and you can't do anything to compensate for it.\n\nI cannot recommend this game at the time.\n\nIf you want details...\n\n- Crafting and \"survival\": The game has a \"one button for all\" contextual scheme, [strike]which combined with the inescapable need to manually pick up, one by one, the pignata-level loot from mostly everything, makes it so that you will very frequently end up giving your pickaxe to your bow monkey, who promptly runs away with it and blends with your army before you can recover it, when you wanted to pick up the couple rubies you needed among the ton of overabundant crap on the floor[/strike]. This, combined with the [strike]ludicrously[/strike] limited inventory (which cannot be actually upgraded, mind you) [strike], the ever so infuriating chest-carrying monkeys that run away from you when you want to access your \"extended\" inventory[/strike], the frustrating crafting tree, and so many obnoxious little big things, make the \"survival\" part of the game quite the annoyance after the first hour of gameplay. Numerous \"survival\" mechanics are just shallow, with barely any impact on your game experience. Health is pretty standard. Stamina is treated like a souls-like thing, with a pool that would allow just a couple rolls, or swings from your weapon/axe/pick, before you are \"too tired\"... but recover completely a few seconds later with no real penalty (seriously, if you overexert, the stamina will recover FASTER than if you had managed your resource). Also, there are biomes in the game, that will require you to progress in your tech/crafting-tree or buy from the in-game merchant to get immunity from the barely annoying life-draining gimmick they induce... fairly standard I guess, but lacks any kind of sense of progression nor carry a narrative punch.\n\n- Combat: It exists, but your undying monkeys are more than enough to handle everything in the game. You don't need the sky-rendering, earth-sundering, eleventh-hour sword, just give three monkeys a couple bone and steel clubs and you are done. There are periodic \"raids\" to your base, which mostly consists of a couple baddies clumsily clubbing at your stuff and house-keeping monkeys. All the structures you build are mostly made out of overabundant materials, like pebbles, sticks and leaves, so all true incentive to defend comes from the mild inconvenience of resetting the blueprints, while your monkeys do all the work... or maybe why bother at all! Just set another camp on another island, why not.\n\n- Interface, user experience and AI: Awful, terrible, abysmal. From the [strike]\"everything is solid, you cannot walk here because there is some bush/rock/tree/unidentified piece of rubble obscured by foliage/mountain\", the[/strike] \"you want to craft the frequently used D? Well, you better start manually crafting several Cs, a ton of Bs and innumerable As, all made from pebbles and grass... and progressively just adding more grass and pebbles to each product\", [strike]to the \"which one of you monkeys has my axe?!\", \"I just wanted to train ONE monkey!\",  \"What do you mean you forgot you were following me when I reloaded the save?!\",[/strike] \"Billy the miner has once again walked all the way to Mordor and his pick is busted...

I\u2019m sure this is not the first review that started with those words, but it sums up much of the game. I\u2019ve put in just over 70 hours on the game and feel I have a pretty good handle on it.\n\n\nThe Basics\n\nYou start the game ship wrecked, alone on an island. You little guy can gather resources of various types (wood, rock, etc) and build basic tools (flimsy axe, flimsy pickaxe, etc). Eventually you build a workstation, which allows you to build more things. Eventually you\u2019ll build walls and floors and make a base. You can also farm and tame wild life to more efficiently acquire resources. Also you\u2019ll make a raft and explore new islands with unique biomes with specific resources and enemies.\n\nOf course the highlight and unique quality of the game is the monkeys. As you explore the world, you\u2019ll find monkeys in cages or monkeys just hanging around an area asking for a specific item. Once you free them or give them the item, they become one of your monkey minions. Any monkey minion can be trained to do a specific task by putting the monkey minion into \u201clearn\u201d mode, and have them watch you do a task (like chopping down a tree). You can also have them follow you, and if you give them a weapon, they will protect you (or at least try). I found this feature similar to the robots in Autonauts, but simplified considerably.\n\nThe research tree is very simple. When you build an item in the tree, the next items become available. This is true for the initial construction, and the more advanced construction (using workstation, forge, etc). Further in the game you buy technologies from various sellers or gain them by beating bosses.\n\nThere are NPCs throughout the world who will buy and sell things with you. There are bosses to beat.  There are different biomes. \n\nThe ultimate goal is to find and fix a ship so that you can escape the islands.\n\n\nThings to Consider Before Buying\n\nThe game is simple and easy to pick up and play. I also found I could advance pretty quickly which was fun. But I also found the fun ran out quickly. Although I put in 70 hours, I had completely all the \u201creal\u201d research, built all the \u201creal\u201d weapons and tools, beaten some bosses and was pretty much done with the game around the 20 hour mark. I felt bad about writing a review with so few hours though, so I pushed through looking for more depth, but I found the game lacking in depth. \n\nThe game has advanced research and weapons. But they are missing two key components. First, I couldn\u2019t find any part of the game where the advanced research and weapons were needed. I could do everything with the basic stuff. Second, after an additional 50 hours, I had only acquired a couple of the advanced research and/or item, due to the need to gather tons of resources over and over just to hit the goals to get the research and/or item. The monkeys minions are great assistants, but a lot of it has to be done manually, like moving to a new area and telling the monkeys to cut down every tree in sight, then gather the wood, move to the next area, etc. I like grinding games and usually find the grinding component of a game quite rewarding, but I found this went beyond grinding and was actually tedious and not fun.\n\nDue to the grinding to get to the advanced part of the game, I found there was a serious gap between the basic and the advanced parts of the game so I searched for anything that might be considered mid-game filler. About the only thing I found was NPC \u201cquests\u201d. But the \u201cquests\u201d made no real sense. For example, one NPC was in an area with enemies that can\u2019t be conquered at the beginning of the game, yet the NPC\u2019s quests were tutorial in nature, like build 8 straw walls and a door. Then build 8 wooden walls and a door. Then build 8 wooden floors. But by that time in the game, my base was well established and I was well beyond any need for tutorials. There was a real feeling that the NPC quests were an afterthought, were unbalanced, and really didn\u2019t fit in with the game.\n\nResource storing in grinding games is essential and expected. In this game resources are stored in chests. But the game is missing basic things, like being able to sort resources in a chest. Or use a button to transfer everything from your inventory into a chest. Or like in terraria where you can stand near a bunch of chests, press a button, and the items are instantly transferred to the chests that already contain those item (one of the best features I\u2019ve seen in any resource grinding game). The game does try to address this issue. When a monkey minion is ordered to pick up items and place them in chests, the monkey minion will try to find a chest that already contains that item before randomly placing the item in another chest. But this behaviour fails very quickly if the chest becomes full, or if the chest is outside of the monkey minion\u2019s work zone. \n\nThe area the monkey minions will work in is finite, and you\u2019ll often find your monkey minions standing beside a tree, complaining they can\u2019t find a tree to chop down because they have hit the edge of their work zone. Unfortunately this zone is invisible and although appeared consistent, after 70 hours I still could not accurately place my monkey minions so they covered the area I wanted. Although this may not seem important, it is compounded with the issues below.\n\nFarming becomes necessary to gather resources more quickly in the later parts of the game. Using 4 monkey minions, they can be trained to plant the seed (one), water the crop (two), harvest the crop (three), and place the harvest in a chest (four). This also applies to farming trees. But you can\u2019t tell the monkey which seed to use. So while you may have initially planted grass in your farm, you may come back to your base and find the farm is completely growing berries instead. I could not find a simple solution to fix this. I tried placing a chest will only the seeds I wanted used. I tried moving all other seeds further away, hoping they were outside the monkey minion\u2019s work zone. The only solution I could see working (which I did not try) is to have each farm built a good distance away from each other. But then gathering the resources together to build something would become tedious instead.\n\nThe last thing to consider is the training of the monkey minions. As I mentioned above, the monkeys are fun, but only for a time. As I past the 20 hour mark and needed the monkey minions to perform accurately and efficiently, I found them quite annoying. First, each monkey minion can only be trained to do one basic action, like planting a seed or watering the seed. It can\u2019t do both. Second, there are no logic mechanisms in the game, such as checking to see if a chest is full, or how many of an item are available. This becomes very problematic, and prevents full automation. For example, there is no way to have a monkey minion continuously make a tool to ensure there are always exactly 20 available. You either have the monkey continuously make the tool, using up all of the resources required to make the tool. Or you can specify how many of an item to make. When those are used up though, you have to manually initiate another build. If you forget, or are away from the base for a while, your monkey minions will stop working, allowing items to run out. The lack of logic mechanisms makes it impossible to completely automate the building process.\n\nSo the bottom line \u2013 would I recommend the game? As long as none of the issues above will bother you, then I would. For me, I very much enjoyed the first 20 hours, but found I was more frustrated than having fun for the additional 50 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1643593802, "timestamp_updated": 1643680965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875625073909759521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77590067": {"recommendationid": "77590067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044280999", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1665647870}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was released as a 1.0 version product. This means that it's feature complete (NOT an Alpha) and it's tested (NOT a Beta). As such, as a reviewer, I can only in good faith review it as such. I am aware of future announcements for the game and the promise of more content, but if the developers wanted it reviewed that way, they should have released it as an Alpha (feature incomplete) in Early access. This game DOES have some potential, but I won't review a title based off promises. As it stands, this title feels like a product, not a game. It seems like an idea that was cobbled together to make 30 minutes of playable game so that youtubers and advertisers can exploit children. I'll be happy to be mistaken, but that's the impression I get.\n\nAs an additional preword, I didn't like The Escapists and think they wouldn't have looked out of place on Kongregate or some other free flash game website.\n\nWhile The Escapists I would describe as ankle deep, this title I would describe as knee deep. What you're doing at one point in the game won't change much to what you're doing 5 hours later. While in other survival titles might see you advance through a dynamic tech tree, figuring things out as you go and gatherering materials, this title sees you follow a linear and static tech tree as you sit around watching monkeys auto gather and your numbers get higher like a mobile game. There is absolutely no \"Survival\" to speak of. Food is immediately abundant, you don't drink, you don't get cold or hot, sick, poisoned, diseased or anything that might be considered \"survival\". Survival itself doesn't even seem to be a consideration in this survival game. As a title in the genre, it feels like it was made by lizards who saw the fundamental elements of every successful game, then they proceeded to remove all of the fun and replace it with a sterile version of what a survival title is when written on a piece of paper and read by an executive that's never played a videogame.\n\nThe monkeys themselves are a core component of the gameplay. Your human character with a fully developed brain can't learn anything, in fact getting WORSE at most tasks as they continue to do it, complaining about how \"Bored\" they are by having to literally stay alive. Conversely, the monkeys level up and get better at tasks, get more efficient at using tools and are generally just better at everything, tool usage included. Then the monkey training happens and it's counter intuitive. You want to train a monkey to haul things to a workstation. You enter training mode and show him how to do it. But because you didn't access a chest and take an item out during the training, the monkey will only deliver items that are left on the ground. Now okay. This makes sense. \"Realism\" or whatever. So why can monkeys learn better than a human? The game flip-flops over itself trying to balance \"reality\" with \"fun\" and fails at every conceivable junction. Like every single opportunity where the developers thought; \"Do we make this realistic or make it enjoyable for the player?\", they never chose to make it enjoyable to the player. You're left with an experience that feels like a chore. In many other survival titles, you're doing chores but it's fun. In this title, you're playing a game and it feels like doing chores and I can't descibe why, which is why I'm convinced it was designed by lizards who just don't understand the human brain. All the parts are there and it should be fun, but it isn't.\n\nThis title is nearly half the price of Cyberpunk 2077. Just let that sink in for a moment before you purchase it and then maybe wait for a sale. Support the developers if you actually believe they're going to improve, but for a general audience, there's absolutely no way that I would suggest someone buy this title. Go play Green Hell or Minecraft or something. At least you'll get a feeling at some point during the game that you need to survive.", "timestamp_created": 1602755567, "timestamp_updated": 1602755567, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875189840793609619", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1603710267, "developer_response": "Hey there,\n\nSorry you felt there wasn't enough survival in the game.

(Fixed.)\n\n-Spears are useless, the enemy moves too much and the attack angles are very restrictive, a woden club works better 60% of the time for close encounters and the Bow outclasses it always as a ranged weapon. (Bows can't damage trees nor rocks, this balances them somewhat, spearst are still not very usefull.)\n\n-The whole crafting system feels incomplete; even after you grind all the materials there is no significant upgrade, no armor, no unique weapon, all feels the same.\n-Currently there is an \"END\" to the game, not an advanced stege in the final expansion of the tech tree or a truly Difficult Last Boss, the game just ends with a Gag and you are back to square one; this confuses me, it feels like the developerss rushed to have a definitive END to the game and forgot to put content in the middle part of it. (Somewhat fixed, still no real objective for all the systems tho, Fixed???)\n\nEDIT.\n\nThe developers are not helping its own game, with every update it gets more bloated and important things appear not to be in the radar for near updates armor and early game collecting, so yeah, not fun for the moment.", "timestamp_created": 1607306010, "timestamp_updated": 1613200763, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 263, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.848299682140350342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "155478413": {"recommendationid": "155478413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187196461", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 925, "last_played": 1704635663}, "language": "english", "review": "It feels unfinished and also is abandoned.

I even played the demo before it released and was pretty pumped for what was to come. However, what was released is most certainly lacking. This game feels half finished. It feels like they meant to add a lot more into it but then couldn't fit it in. A lot of the mechanics are broken or just shouldn't work the way they do. A prime example of this is, if you play with someone else online, only the host unlocks the recipes that aren't connected to the recipe unlock tree. Your teammates will not be able to unlock the bomb recipe so you will have to craft those for them. Backpacks? They can buy it but won't receive the recipe. It's very frustrating and almost made us quit the game. But we decided to just finish it. Also, I think there needs to be better markers on how to make progress because honestly in the beginning we were just like uhh what now a lot of the time. \n\nOne of the most frustrating parts of this game was hands down the tools. They break so fast. Like it's actually stupid. You are constantly repairing your tools just for you to maybe get through half a labyrinth and they are already worn down again. And it doesn't get better with the better tools you craft, especially when it comes to your sword. I don't know who thought it was a good idea to barely get any use out of the tools. \n\nThe raids are pointless, if I'm being perfectly honest. You don't get anything special from them. They are the same enemies that you fought on that island before. They are more an annoyance than anything. Not really any point. Same goes for the treasure, the rewards for tracking it down just aren't worth it unless you're dead set on doing them. \n\nWe did finish the game and honestly it was just lacking. Like there wasn't any reason to stay and there wasn't any reason to finish. They definitely wanted this game to have replay value but it frankly just doesn't. Just doesn't feel like a complete game.

I easily put in a little over 20 hrs just eager to get the next crafting material, get to the next island, find another monkey, upgrade my items, and so on. And to be clear, I had a lot of fun doing so. However, right around when I had nine monkeys, I realized that I'd go on these huge trips with my monkeys so I could gather materials, (maybe 30-45min trips) just to get back and blow through the important materials instantly. It was like every trip to an island was just to gather materials for the immediate next trip for the next island. I realized I was just wasting my time going around in circles.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n-Monkey management is a pain in the ass. I wish there were two modes I could have saved so I didn't have to manually reset them every time I went to an island, and then every time I got back to base.\n-They do no put items in a single chest, the randomly scatter everything (why is there no whitelist/blacklist on chests??)\n-You need one monkey to supply items, one to craft the item, and one to put it away. But the monkeys do not communicate with each other at all. So if I'm crafting an item that needs to go into another item and both are queued, when the first item gets made, the storage monkey will pick it up and put it in a random chest only to have the supplier monkey immediately have to go and get it. I would think the storage monkey would check with the other AI to see if the item is needed. Supplying/Storage should be one job.\n-Monkeys will plant whatever damn seeds they want, so you have to literally store all your other seeds outside of their control\n-Monkeys glitch frequently enough. It's not game breaking but more than I would expect\n-When having your monkeys preform a task, they will complete that task in what I assume is  certain sized area before stopping (so that they don't just go across the whole island), but then you have to re-educate them. It would be so much easier if they retained their teaching and you could just hit a button to reset the order in the next area\n-It's a pain to remember what monkeys do what. Color code them if you want to keep your sanity\n-Monkeys will deal more damage than you, and will cause less wear on weapons when using them. You're essentially meant to do nothing but stand around your monkeys\n-Certain materials are way to scarce and the crafting ratio of them is totally out of balance. I'm looking at you hardwood. You can suck it. A whole trip to an island and I get 45 hardwood stumps, which for whatever dumb reason requires 3 stumps to make 1 plank? And then you want me to use 10 planks to build a ladder?? Are you serious?\n\nI'm so torn with this game. If they just made some quality of life improvements and change the crafting ratios on some things, this would be an amazing game. As is, it's worth the $8.50 I paid, and the week worth of fun I had, but there are a thousand games on steam like that. Guess I'm just disappointed that it so narrowly misses the mark.\n", "timestamp_created": 1632627097, "timestamp_updated": 1632627097, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801746904850006104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84122778": {"recommendationid": "84122778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032455011", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 497, "last_played": 1602630144}, "language": "english", "review": "I normally don't leave reviews because I just cant be bothered sometimes, even for games that aren't great. But this one made me upset.\n\nThis game is absolutely, 100%, without a doubt, NOT worth the price. I have played games that have cost less and have significantly more content. You could literally play the demo and experience the majority of the game. \n\nI see reviews on here about how thats simply not true. That theres more content in the full game than there is in the demo. Yes, that's true. But not that much more. When you play the demo, you can actually see the crafting tree, most of which is locked. That is exactly what is available in the full game. There is no hidden crafts, there is no unlockable crafts. All of those little squares you see in the demo is what you get. Thats it. \n\nThe monkeys. They're cute and I love them, but they are absolutely useless. They are annoyingly to train and can literally only do one thing at a time. Each time you want it to do something else, you have to retrain it. Even if its learned it before. Combat wise, its fine to have the monkeys around, but you really, really, really don't need them. In fact, my friends and I did a dungeon or whatever and the monkeys got stuck somewhere. We literally just abandoned them there because there was no need for them to help us with combat and it was too annoying to go and find ALL of the monkeys in our monkey hoard before we moved on. \n\nThere are multiple islands, which you'd think would be great, right? Nope. The islands were very meh. Each new island has one or two new things on it - new ore, new terrain or new beasts. We completed the game without ever going into the swamp (I don't even know what the point of it was). \n\nWhen we finished the game, we realized that you could literally play this game and finish it in a few hours. It only took my group 8 hours because we took forever figuring out what was going on on the starter island. We got to the second island, set up camp then realized there was literally no point to set up camp. We blew through the rest of the islands by just going to them, running to the dungeon thing and then leaving. \n\nI will not be buying any more of their games in the future, especially not on release. \n\nTL;DR I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. Everyone one of my friends who played this game ended up disappointed at having spent so much money on a game that wasn't worth it. If you are typically a casual gamer or like games that are simple and cute, maybe get this game on sale. \n", "timestamp_created": 1609906207, "timestamp_updated": 1609906207, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800416290760040283", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144449176": {"recommendationid": "144449176", "author": {"steamid": "76561199131725426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 513, "last_played": 1686860500}, "language": "english", "review": "It's no longer being developed, and the gameplay isn't anything to write home about.

It is also a great game for anyone looking for a low-stress survival/building game. I got my 70 year old Dad playing this and he loves it with over 187 hours logged so far and still counting (he took over the entire home island as his base).\n\nSo here are the good, the bad and the ugly of it \n\nThe Good:   The monkey automation is fantastic at this stage though it does need some tweaking to perhaps assign single monkeys to a specific workstation IE: this monkey only crafts things at the Forge and ignores other work stations.  \n\nThe Islands are fairly large and robust with resources and threats. The larger labyrinths while being big are not so large that they are tedious to walk around in special thanks for the teleporter to the exit in the boss rooms. Crafting trees unlock automatically after making the recipe that precedes them. The hunger meter does not deplete so rapidly that you have to eat every 5 seconds.\n\nThe monkey controls while complex seeming are easily learned even by a 70 year old with bad eye sight (Dad if you're reading this I love you XD ). Defenses are easy to build and easy to maintain if you assign a monkey to be on repair duty. The monkeys are best suited for crafting and base maintenance.  I generally take 6 monkeys with me 5 fighters and 1 to carry a chest.\n\nThe Bad: The monkeys have hard limits that are either not defined not addressed or not shown. For example monkeys that water your crops will only water so many (no matter how close or far apart the crop plots are to one another) before it will water no more.  \n\nMonkeys that are assigned to craft things will leave the bench they are working at to go to another bench. This may not seem like a problem but when you have 2 or more crafting stations and already have a craft monkey and want to assign an extra monkey to help craft you have to be quick or you have to stop the first monkey to add the extra one. The reason for this is that the original craft monkey will run up to the craft station you are assigning the new monkey to and start crafting the item you are trying to get the new monkey to craft effectively blocking your mimic command on that monkey.\n\nSometimes monkeys get blocked behind structures they have built IE: base walls. Monkeys can get \"stuck\" at sea. When you die the monkeys try to get back to you but end up spread all over the island you died on forcing you to run around and call them back. Cant breakdown rafts.\n\nThe Ugly: You can't place any decorations or lights on side walls. Base walls even metal ones are easily destroyed by creatures such as orclings, boars, and deer (really deer and boar destroying a metal wall come on Team 17 that makes no sense). \n\nSome items after Expeditions update have no purpose (i'm looking at you dried seed pod husk) due to changed recipes, but were still left in the game. The sturdy bow is the only bow worth making the others are so weak it takes half their \"arrows\" to kill even a small animal.  Giving high tier weapons to monkeys seems to make the weapon weaker IE: monkeys do less damage then the player even with end game weapons. \n \nThe game does not give you enough quest tokens to buy all the trinkets but will offer you multiple copies of a trinket to buy from the hot air balloon guy. I found that out the hard way buy buying a trinket that was later given to me as a blueprint. Now there is a trinket blueprint I have to buy from said hot air balloon guy that I can't get because I used the token for it on the blueprint you can find and there are no more vendor quests to do to get more tokens as I have completed them all (i'm screwed lol).\n\nThere are 4 unlock able trinkets that combine some of the higher tier trinkets into one I've gotten one unlocked and cant figure out how to unlock the other 3.  The one I have is the shield/speed run trinket. There really isn't a lot of info out their from the community like there is for some games (Heroes of Ruin) so a lot of it is trial and error and while that's great sometimes it's frustrating (damn you trinkets)\n\nMy Last Word: Definitely recommend getting this game on a good sale (thank you summer sale 2021!!)it's a fun light hear-ted survival game. It does feel at times half done but get it at a good price and you wont be disappointed. (oh and if you're stuck on the Beast Master quest to tame two rabbits you need to bring them to the small structure next to him that's a miniature animal pen like the one in your crafting menu).", "timestamp_created": 1626456893, "timestamp_updated": 1626456893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78776395320892334", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78824594": {"recommendationid": "78824594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359658621", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1602315519}, "language": "english", "review": "I do not recommend due to the lack of content for this and this price is just absurd.", "timestamp_created": 1604674440, "timestamp_updated": 1604674440, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787554800510406494", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83671149": {"recommendationid": "83671149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020053334", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1609442846}, "language": "english", "review": "I was really excited about this game, and my wife was too.

You can also eat directly from foods that you find in nature, but the prepared recipes will be much more useful and require fewer numbers for a worthy effect. \n\nYou will also have to hunt for wildlife to make other recipes.\nTo hunt certain animals you will have to craft certain items, for example to catch fish. \nOr if you want to save yourself the hunting you can also craft traps and wait after you have placed them. \n\nyou will also find treasure maps, notes, or diaries with useful information that will lead you to useful items or exceptional locations. \nthe game will also offer many interesting quests through bottles washed up on the beach or through a mysterious stranger.\n\nOnline you have certain options as a host, so you can determine whether players / which players are allowed to build in your world or so you can also determine whether other players can also own monkeys, if not the monkeys that other players find will automatically join the host's team.\n\nTip: when going out for recources you'll have to tap the left mouse button.

The basic gameplay loop is really engaging and monkey minion mechanic is great. However quickly after starting the game I started to see major flaws that just kept piling onto each other.\n\nThe game is painfully slow. The run speed is pathetic considering the amount of exploring you have to do. You can go faster by rolling, but that takes stamina, which runs out incredibly fast so you have to wait every 5 seconds to be able to roll again. Crafting of some items takes insane amount of time, even with max level crafting monkeys and that's on top of gathering resources. It took me at least an HOUR to make my first 5x4 tile wooden house with the help of my first monkey.\n\nWhen stamina depletes completely, you get a screen effect that would be fine from time to time, but it gets annoying fast because you see it every 5 seconds if you try to roll to go faster. Even worse, stamina regens SLOWER if you don't use it up completely, so you will be spamming roll till you're out just to roll again faster. This rewards mindlessly roll-spamming and makes you endure the screen effects is you want to any sort of fast.\n\nMonkey minions are a great concept, but executed in the most simplistic way it can, which can lead to annoyances. Monkeys choose chests to put things in seemingly at random sometimes, so say bye to neatly organized storage. If there was a solid way to influence where they put things, then it had to be buried in text tutorials because I sure didn't figure it out during gameplay. You can't tell them to craft only a certain amount, so if you make a monkey chain of \"bring-craft-take back to chest\", they WILL end up wasting resources by crafting too much if you leave them without strict supervision. They will also use tools till they break, wasting MORE resources to craft them new ones instead of repairing, unless you micromanage them like crazy to take tools from them for repairs at the right time. If you tell a monkey to plant seeds, it won't have any consideration for what to plant where either, so no efficient automated farm either.\n\nResources are overabundant to a point of clogging your inventory in seconds, but amount to so little when you'll start crafting. 6 pebbles for a stone chunk, 2 stone chunks and one mud for a stone slab, 3 stone slabs and 3 mud for a stone wall. 36 pebbles and 6 mud for just ONE stone wall. More than one third of a stack for just ONE tile of wall placed.\n\nLet's have a list of flaws that don't have whole paragraphs worth of commentary before I get to another big one:\n-animal taming seems pointless since you can easily just go and kill things for loot without the need to tame, transport and craft breeding feeds;\n-hunger feels pointless because food is overabundant to a point of meat and fruit items only clogging your inventory and having to be constantly discarded to make space for more important things;\n-raids are a pointless annoyance. The game advises you to build up defenses, but that only makes the raid bigger, so the best defense against them is just going out of the base so no more than three enemies spawn. With teleporters you can also go to an easier island to oneshot them on top of it in later game;\n-burning in volcanic biomes and insect swarm in swamp biome debuffs literally don't do anything other than a screen effect and having your character constantly talk in how much pain they are in despite no loss of health nor stamina. Might be a bug, but that's how it was for all of the time of my playthrough, so wasn't patched fast either;\n-traders and their fetchquests are boring and a pure grind and rng, so is finding the lore entries;\n-bosses are just normal enemies but slightly bigger with more hp;\n\nNow, the last thing that completely ruins this game - progression and balancing. Or rather lack of either. The feel I got was that game expects you to go out and explore islands one by one and move your base from island to island, going up the tiers of buildings and equipment till you reach the finial island and beaten every temple. However that was not my experience at all as the game doesn't do anything to enforce that progression path, and it resulted for balance to completely vanish for me.\nI stayed on the starting island without venturing out because there was no push for it. I kept (painfully slowly) building up my base till I was stone tier because I liked the looks and the game kept telling me to build up my defenses, so I did. However I wanted to craft things that needed metal that just wasn't on the starting island and that was what finally pushed me to get on a raft and (painfully slowly) start swimming out.\nFirst island I landed on was the final, hardest one. I thought that harder island = more resources, so I went out to explore and found out that this island had no iron on it, but gold I couldn't mine. I could kill that sparkly fox though, so I (painfully slowly with my dingy bone clubs) did. It exploded into resources, gold among them. I went around, killed a few more foxes, sailed back home when I had a good chunk of stuff that I couldn't do anything with yet. I found the second island after that and got myself iron, but since I had gold from the foxes at that point, I managed to immediately jump over the tier of metal sword and made the gold one right after unlocking. I've barely explored anything past the first island at that point and I've already had an endgame sword in my hands. Progression went out the window at that point cause combat stopped being any challenge and I killed everything effortlessly even though I didn't even bring monkeys anywhere, leaving them to work at the base. Temples were a joke because I demolished enemies.\nSo after getting the gold sword, the game turned into \"run a lot\" and \"grind resources\". Trinkets were useless because I've already beaten everything. Trader quests were a chore since they were either boring fetchquets, or asked me to do redundant things like building a straw house when I had a fully decked stone tier base.\n\nAll of those flaws are sadly decorated with a bitter cherry on top that is a disappointing lack of content. Every island has only two mini dungeons and after the first island and breaking balance and progression, I didn't even explore them because I had no need for any loot that could've been in them. That made the islands not worth exploring cause there wasn't anything on them save for loot corpses that had useless sellable trinkets that I kept having to throw out (you can make more money and faster by farming resources and selling those). There is an underwhelming amount of enemy types, most of them are reskins with buffed stats, like three types of boar or big cat that are exactly the same same for hp, damage and sprite. Like I said before, there aren't even bosses, just bigger, beefier versions of normal animal enemies with the same behavior. All went down in 10 seconds or less thanks for my gamebreaking sharpened gold sword. There are barely any decorative things to build with so you can't even make anything pretty.\n\nOverall, this is a game that managed to keep me engaged, but only because I'm a very specific type of person that found it an interesting experience to analyze and think how it could've been done better. It feels like an early access game, a proof of concept, a foundation upon which a better game should only start being built. It by any means doesn't feel like a full product. If you're like me and can get something out of a game that's such an unrealized potential, then get it when it'll be like 70-80% off, no more. Otherwise it sadly isn't worth price nor time, especially since it's not being updated anymore as devs left it to work on something else instead of expanding and polishing what they have done here.", "timestamp_created": 1667719362, "timestamp_updated": 1669758451, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.76473844051361084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "155532626": {"recommendationid": "155532626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146918455", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1706439139}, "language": "english", "review": "recruiting monkeys to become slave", "timestamp_created": 1704688747, "timestamp_updated": 1704688747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761607110500335693", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100475125": {"recommendationid": "100475125", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998063143", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 328, "playtime_forever": 1346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1309, "last_played": 1633554520}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a lot going for it.

They say they're collecting all the feedback to work on improving the game but with the amount of common bugs that I've run into it seems like their \"gathering \"feedback\" is just PR.\n\nCommon Bugs:\n* Pressing Q, gathering all your monkeys around, hover over one monkey, click them and click Train. High chance that your character throws a banana to multiple monkeys instead of just the one you click.\n-Workaround: Click and drag to select a single monkey. They use a grid system and when the monkeys gather around they'll each occupy a single grid.\n\n* Logging into the game you'll notice that your monkeys that were trained for Combat decided to dismiss themselves. So everytime you log in you'll need to gather up the wandering monkeys and retrain them\n-Workaround: You can set you monkeys to pose before you log out so you won't have to regather them but you'll still need to retrain.\n\n*Placing markers on the map is very inaccurate, the markers rarely appear where you want them to.\n- Workaround: Place a bunch of markers on map till one lands where you want it to then delete all the others.\n\n** Several hours in you'll run into the \"Wood/charcoal\" bug. Basically makes random ghost Charcoal and Wood appear in monkeys inventories that are delivering ingredients to furnaces/fires/benches. The charcoal/wood that appears has only 25% durability and prevents the monkeys from putting them into the target inventory.\n-Workaround: You need to SWAP items with the monkey and then they'll drop the ghost item. You won't be able to pick up that item but if you drop a similar item right on top of it, pick up the item and the ghost item disappears.\n***DISCLAIMER*** Once this bug affects your save it'll start occurring often, so all production reliant on wood or charcoal will stop just as often. Example: I find a monkey that's bugged, go to him, swap items and clear the bug. He'll deliver one item successfully then get locked up on the delivery after. I've quit my 22 hour save because of this and don't think I'll be restarting.\n\n\nQuality of Life Issues:\n* UI designed with a mobile first mentality. UI looks like it's made for a phone game.\n\n* Controls designed with controller/gamepad first mentality. Using mouse and keyboard is very buggy throughout the game, I'm guessing that's the reason the dev's only showcase the game while using a controller.\n\n* Caves are useless. Just wall them up so bats won't come out at night.\n\n* Decorative items are useless. In English, we call these items Trash. You can't do anything with these items except sell to a vendor and they're only worth 5 gold. Vendor doesn't care about damaged items, so just save up your damaged tools and sell them to him for ~40-120 gold.\n\n* Monkeys assigned to deliver items to a chest will prioritize that chest you selected (even if there's a chest next to items they're picking up) but once it's full it seems like they'll pick any random chest within range instead of the next closest.\n\n* When monkeys get knocked out, they lose what they've learned and start wandering.\n\n* No limit on how far they can wander from their original position.\n\n* Can't assign monkeys to guard base while you explore. If you're starting a new base and get raided, many monkeys will get knocked out and you'll have to retrain them all.\n\n* Dungeons/Labrinyths/Vaults are all pretty much the same. Once you collect your 20 monkeys there's no point in revisiting them unless you're planning on collecting Legendary items of tools.\n\n* Most Legendary Items are pointless. With how easy the game is, you don't need more than the blue items you get.\n\n* Monkeys drop chests they're carrying upon getting attacked. While this feature is good if your monkey is trained in combat since they'll immediately start attacking, it's bad when you're moving bases around or travelling through overly thick forests since it becomes very easy to lose chests. It also seems like shark attacks make your monkeys drop the chests into the ocean instead of onto the boat.\n\n-------\nThere are SO MANY quality of life items that are missing from this title that are survival game basics; and yet they are absent.   But the biggest crime here is when a majority of the focus of the game is the automation of tasks via monkey helpers; and THAT system is broken--the rest of the game falls apart.", "timestamp_created": 1602666861, "timestamp_updated": 1602666861, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753039002418518066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1603292694, "developer_response": "Hey there SinReaper,\n\nSorry you haven't had an amazing time.

Later after a raid (which I have no way to possibly get back in time to assist with), I can see that while my defences worked, all my monkeys no longer had any roles assigned.\n\nAssigning monkeys to specific roles as well as the user interface is somewhat lacking. It is rather annoying and the button prompts always assume an Xbox controller layout.\n\nThe first part to the game is very confusing to learn, such as:\n*where to get more metal\n*how to find the shop again\n*how to open chests\n\nThe biggest issue I had was all the objects blocking my path. One must spend time either finding tiny gaps that cannot be seen, or a long time breaking rocks and chopping trees. This is made even worse when you have monkeys carrying chests that count as solid objects.\n\nMy 2nd biggest issue was monkeys would sometimes wander far from home, after you spend a short time on another part of the map, leaving you to have to fix it for every monkey every time you return. Followers would also forget that they are supposed to follow, after being attacked (which they cannot be told to ignore or run from).\n\nIt is worth noting that there is a lack of being able to save anywhere. You always have to return to your bed to save, which can take minutes of walking/navigating. This is even worse if you are the middle of something important, such as using a timed buff or inside a temple.\n\nYou will find yourself running out of things to do fast, while just repeating the same thing over and over for the same reward (with a different name/image).\n\nI could easily have overlooked all the issues if the game were in early access, or a beta version.\n\nUpdate: some bugs have been fixed, but content is still quite lacking and repetitive.l", "timestamp_created": 1603376593, "timestamp_updated": 1606382739, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749026596546173096", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1603709691, "developer_response": "Hey there Josh...

\n\nThere isnt a way to auto pick all items around you, you gonna spam the living HELL out of that space button \nWhich is ANNOYING because if a monkey is near you while you're spamming space to pickup all the items the rock/tree just dropped, you might accidentally give that item to them and take away their \"whatever they were holding\" so they cant do the task you told them, you gotta give it back ...sigh why not make it different buttons for god sakes \n\nTheir AI is great but not perfect, sometimes when I tell them to craft stuff, they go get ingredients from really far trees that I broke, rather than the over 400+ pieces of wood I already have stored in a chest near the crafting stations.\n\nI got the DLC that adds customized hats, while you wouldnt care about those I found it to be REALLY useful for marking which monkeys I remember having higehr combat level, aka i gave pirate hates to fighters and mining hats to crafters and chef hat to gatherers ..etc etc ..it actually helped sorting them a lot.\n\n- I wish there was a way to upgrade inventory space, so far I didnt find any and it gets full too fast.\n- I wish there were more recipes to unlock and blueprints, it feels like I got them all faster than it should have been.\n- I wish the game price was cheaper like $19.99, cuz 14 hours and I got 70% of achievements  feels a bit much ...\"idk how close i am to the ending\"  \n- I wish there was fishing mechanics not use a bow to kill fish and they give the same type of meat.\n- I wish the base player has xp and can upgrade themselves not just the monkeys.\n- I wish the game didnt have achievements that forces me to join other players to earn them.\n\n[h1]Updated review[/h1] \nSo I didnt beat the game, stopped playing for a long time came back recently after all the major updates to play with a friend\n\n- theres an annoying amount of glitches in multiplayer, included in gameplay and not getting certain achievements.\n- the game ends so ....abruptly and doesn't at all feel challenging the \"bosses\" are just extremely weak\n- there are broken systems, such as red gems selling for 100 gold each (which is a lot) but if you refine it, x3 red gems into one refined gem it sells for 30...so basically just farm red gems for 1 minute with monkeys and thats it you bought the entire game\n- Blueprints that you buy from the shop guy or unlock from quests, pets, upgrades for inventory, all the stuff you can unlock from shops basically, can ONLY be unlocked for the host  even if you were the one to unlock them, so you have to get the host to craft that stuff for you which is really just lame.\n- Lame that I cant see the monkeys in my friend's world, I wanted to help organize them and all as every monkey we found there becomes his, but nope, no option to allow the client to gain that perm.\n- buying items from shopguy for blueprints but they still exist there \"Aka backpack\" was extremely confusing cuz we forgot which we got and which we didnt.\n- hunger level in this game shouldnt exist tbh as it takes an extremely long time to start draining it feels like they're just holding your hands with that, same for the losing hp from swamps/hot areas seems like it needs to be buffed cuz I saw no reason in makin the elixir or water to avoid the damage as it basically doesn't do anything enough for me to notice it.\n\n\n\n\nif you want to get this with friends ?

I'm so disappointed in myself that I purchased a game on the day of release. I know better than that but I really enjoyed the demo and about 15-20 hours of game play. That's when everything fell apart. My monkeys will no longer take items from chests (or ground) to restock my forge & workbench having to do that manually takes it's toll on my psyche and is not how the game was intended to be played. Two of my monkeys will occasionally return to where I found them (if I don't give them a task at my base). Monkeys do not sort, period. You have to constantly manage your storage chests with no way to label or color code that I could figure out (using a controller). At one point I was just thinking about keeping everything on the ground because it would've been less of a hassle. I've placed chests next to my forge and filled them with all the metal resources but left room for more items. When the item is produced the monkeys will often take it to the chest that is furthest away instead of the one right next to it and no there were not any like items in that chest. My forge and workbench have stopped accepting components from me or my monkeys (when they were working), twice. I had to destroy them and build them again. I feel like I'm beta testing a non-AAA title that I had to pay $25.00 to get into. I did contact support about my issues and they gave me the usual song and dance. I'll keep an eye on it for a little while and see if they actually fix the issues. Buyer beware. If you're interested in the game read the forums and wait until it inevitably goes on sale due to terrible launch reviews.\n\nUpdate: I played on the beta version (experimental branch) after this review and found that they had fixed the issues I was having. Once they pushed the update/patch through I left the beta and all of my saved games seemed to have been corrupted (which I believe I was warned about). That was OK as I wanted to start fresh. I've played for some time now. I have not run into the issues that I had at launch and that's a good thing, kudos. Each recipe requires more components which only makes the progression slower, meh. You run out of items to build so quick for a survival game. Once you figure out the mechanics the replay value is non-existent, imo. I became bored and had no desire to finish my game. I've decided to uninstall it for now and will keep an eye on future content updates and start a fresh game. I still cannot recommend this game at it's existing price point because there is just not enough content. I'll say it again, I feel like I paid $25 to beta test their game.

If you need to scratch your survival/crafting itch, look elsewhere.[/b]\n\n\n[h3][b]What it did Right[/b][/h3]\nSome parts of the game kept me coming back, otherwise I would not have taken the time to reach the ending. These are the things I liked the most:\n\nThe artstyle for this game is consistent and adorable. Nothing feels out of place, and the sprites are very well done. [spoiler]The Red Panda spirit pet was particularly cute, and its idle animations were a nice touch.[/spoiler]\n\nAutomating tasks, roaming the map armed to the teeth, and striking goofy poses with your army of monkeys is very satisfying, especially toward the endgame. Once you have an abundance of resources and monkeys, you can set up a blueprint for a large base and watch as your primate contractors get to work constructing it in a hilariously short amount of time.\n\n\n[h3][b] What it did Wrong [/b][/h3]\nI want to preface this by saying the game is not [i]bad[/i], but the more I think about my experience, the more disappointed I am. This could have been another excellent title that keeps on giving, much like other more popular survival/crafting titles.\n\nThe crafting menus are all over the place and take some getting used to. Your menu for creating your base is separate from your menu for crafting essentials, and those menus have a second page you would miss if you were only halfway paying attention to the tooltips and tutorials. They could have easily fit these menus on one page, and I am not sure why they opted to split some of these. \n\nYou slowly unlock recipes by crafting one item at a time within \"crafting trees\", which is how the game locks your progress. However, because you cannot see what comes next in the tree, you are forced to guess which item along the path unlocks the next MacGuffin that will allow you to craft what you actually need. This led to some minor frustrations as I had to basically trial and error my way to making any progress in the game.\n\nThe base building lacks variety. There are only a handful of walls, floors, and furniture types, the rest is all your work stations. The grid you build on feels restrictive, and you cannot rotate your blueprints. I never found myself feeling good about the way my base looked, but feeling like it was \"good enough\" given the limitations. In a game in which base building and crafting is a core mechanic, variety is what makes the game replayable and fun. This does not have that.\n\nThe main character is somehow unlikeable. Every time they have to do a small amount of work, they whine about how they should just get their monkeys to do it. Even worse, there are some areas of the game in which they spew an endless stream of whining, like [spoiler]the Swamp and the Volcano biomes. You have to spend a lot of time in these biomes if you want to progress, and as a result you have to spend a lot of time listening to the main character whine.[/spoiler]\n\nThe story is presented to you via logs you find scattered across the map, which are given to you in a random order. The way the final log is written feels less like a shocking reveal and more like an abrupt stop; as if they were halfway through development and decided this log was a good enough place to end it. Using logs to tell the story felt like a way to shirk having to write any amount of dialogue for the NPCs and a cheap way to extend the collectathon to the point in which gathering them just felt like a timesink.\n\nThe combat has very little depth, and worse, [b]sometimes doesn't work[/b]. There would be moments in which I would clearly see my weapon contact the enemy, I would hear the soundbite for the weapon striking my opponent, but their HP would not go down. I would have to readjust my position (sometimes hardly moving at all) for the game to register those hitbox collisions as valid. It made some combat encounters very frustrating, especially when dealing with larger groups of enemies. You eventually unlock [spoiler]legendary \"elemental\" weapons that ... whack things harder. There is literally no difference between these weapons' attacks and their counterparts except for how much damage they do.[/spoiler]\n\nThe \"labyrinths\" and their bosses were extremely disappointing. There are four of these in the game, one on each of the other islands. Since these islands have their own unique biomes, you would expect the labyrinths to follow that theme, but instead you are met with the same corridors, pits, crates, and fight rooms in every single one (albeit arranged in a random order). The only thing that changes is the enemy type featured inside, which is the same enemy type that exists outside the labyrinth already. The bosses [spoiler]are just resized, reskinned versions of said enemy type. Is it too much to ask for a unique mob? Or maybe something that has new attack patterns that are actually challenging instead of just making them bigger meat sponges? [/spoiler] Overall, it felt extremely lazy and rushed, and each one was more like a chore I was checking off my to-do list so I could reach the ending.\n\nSpeaking of, the ending is not satisfying. [spoiler] When you finally have the option to escape, a short cutscene plays. You sail away with all your monkeys on board, thankful you had their help throughout your journey. However, the monkeys knock you out and throw you overboard, and your character once again finds themselves stranded. I understand it was supposed to be cheeky--it was a game about surviving on remote islands with your monkey pals--but it honestly felt like the developers were laughing at me for wasting my time playing this game at all. You spend so much time doing the same gameplay loop over and over just to reach the end and be told that it was all a waste because you would just end up back where you started. [/spoiler]\n\n\n[h3][b]Something Particularly Bad[/b][/h3]\nIt makes sense to give this its own category, as this is a glaring issue. In the game you can unlock \"task tokens\" which can be exchanged for blueprint recipes and other items. There are just enough of these to unlock every available blueprint BUT, it is possible to purchase the same blueprint twice, after which the game will not refund your task token. The only way to obtain task tokens is by completing quests that NPCs give out, and once they are completed, they cannot be repeated. If you accidentally purchase the same blueprint twice, the only way to get more task tokens is to \u201cregenerate\u201d your world, which resets your NPC quest progress and islands. However, it does not allow you to take anything with you except for items you store inside \"The Mysterious Chest\" and your monkeys. Any bases you built and resources you gathered that cannot fit inside the chest are lost forever.\n\nThis has been a known bug since v1.1.13 according to the wiki. This issue, combined with the hitbox issue I mentioned earlier, and the extremely lackluster dungeons and bosses, makes it clear the dev team either got lazy after release, had to rush this out, or some combination of the two.\n\n[h3][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/h3]\nI wanted to like this game. Survival/crafting games are my favorite genre, and this game had a look that was very enticing. Unfortunately it comes off somewhat soulless; like an amalgamation of things people like in other crafting games, outdated references, and very little depth across the board. Given more time, they could have developed more interesting boss fights, unique dungeons, and a story that felt a little more present than randomly placed journal entries. Instead we are left with an experience that feels like a hollowed-out re-skin of a game we have already played before.", "timestamp_created": 1705565947, "timestamp_updated": 1705566073, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733624041080474854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117225425": {"recommendationid": "117225425", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995108422", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 1262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1262, "last_played": 1655624212}, "language": "english", "review": "This game looks good on paper, but it's bogged down by a clunky UI, annoying combat, and an unsatisfying core loop. It shares the problem of a lot of survival-themed games where everything feels like another chore to manage.\n\nThe core monkey mechanic is the worst offender. The mimicry teaching mechanic is fun thematically, but in practice it's a 5 step process that takes upwards of a minute to get a monkey to do something that it's probably only going to do for a minute or so until it runs out of its tool or resource. If you ever give it any other command you have to go through that whole process again. \n\nThe idea of exploring other islands is fun, but it's crushed by the raiding system because every 10 minutes or so you have to run back (technically you can build a bed on the new island and set that as home but that doesn't really feel in the spirit of things since you're encouraged to build defenses in your base). If you hand your monkeys weapons to help you fight, you have to individually retrain all of them. Walls are mostly useless because enemies spawn sporadically around your bed anyway.\n\nThe game would be markedly improved if monkeys remembered prior tasks and you can just set them through a menu. Alternatively, add the ability to equip every monkey with a weapon and a tool and have it automatically fight and then go back to work when there are no threats.\n\nAs a general rule for these kinds of games, I really think simply removing the item durability mechanic would improve the experience. It would significantly reduce the monkey micro management and reduce the amount of time you spend on the treadmill doing the same thing over and over again. For the record - in real life, I've used the same axe/splitting maul, shovels, and pickaxe for 15+ years. I've chopped down trees, split logs, broken up rocks, and dug holes over this time period. I've had to sharpen the axe once or twice.

\nAlr lets talk About Crafting:\nthis game has a cool and special crafting system, you don't start with every recipe, you have to craft a thing to unlock new recipes, and everything is not craftable, sometimes you have to go explore or make a crafting table, and yet you can't make a iron pickaxe, you have to get a big furnace and craft things and then unlock new recipes in furnace, and then finally a iron pickaxe recipe, So that means theres alot of things to do to just get a better thing, when you finally got what you wanted like axe or pickaxe, you feel proud and rewarded for gathering resources to get better things.\nLets talk about clones:\nTheres a roblox game called The Survival game, It has totally same crafting system and same starter weapon, that sharp rock. and also survival game and the survivalists titles are really same, that roblox game is cloning the survivalists, should really get copyright striked.\nlets talk about exploring:\nthe exploring feels So Rewarding, and when i say that i mean you always find alot of resources like chests or abandoned cars and skeletons, everythings a suprise and fun, you always find something fun and cool and helpful resource while exploring, you can also explore with rafts and find iron and cool resources from diffrent islands!\nLets talk about Updates:\nwhile this game got updated for 2 years ago 2021, this game got alot to do,  all the 2020 comments are before 2021, all the bugs are most likely to be fixed already, this game got tons of cool stuff to do.\nLets talk about style:\nthe style is so cool, the movement is not limited, you can walk how you want. with animations in 2d, its not a typical 2d game with forward, backward, right, left, its not, this game you can walk freely without robotic forward or backward bla bla.\nlets talk about dungeons:\nFinding dungeons is hard and fun, you put alot of effort winning the dungeon, but also gets the best loot, completing dungeons is so good, you get legendary loot like good axes and good coins, and alot of things you don't get easy, dungeons is almost impossible without the help of fighting monkeys, but The dungeons is the best part of rewards in the game, so much good stuff!\nLets talk about Combat:\nthis game got decent combat but that does not mean its bad, its so cool with the combat, if you attack someone while they attack you get stunned, its all about timing, if you attack in the right time you stun them and then keep attacking until they die, also monkeys can fight but even with same weapon they don't do same damage because of balance.\nLets talk about Monkeys:\nthis is the main cause we get forward in this game, this feature is so special and good, you can train monkeys to fight, pick up items, put items in chest, craft, borrow a chest for extra storage, mine and cut things, and just alot of things to do!\nlets talk about looting:\nin this game you can open skeletons and alot of stuff and loot them with alot of cool resources, its similar to minecraft, but alot cooler, you can loot alot of things while exploring and everythings so cool.", "timestamp_created": 1688647304, "timestamp_updated": 1688647304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722054839134216309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86186111": {"recommendationid": "86186111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120400500", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 3743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3743, "last_played": 1612764344}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Island Escapists[/h1]\n\n[i]The Survivalists[/i], by the studio behind prison breakout game [i]The Escapists[/i], has your basic \"explore and craft to escape the island\" plot.\n\nHoo boy, is there a TON of crafting in this game.  No raw resource that drops is of much use without modification, not even the fruit that you can eat right away.\n\nRecipes come in three basic styles.  Items crafted By Hand must have the items in your inventory.  Items made at crafting stations or as blueprints set on the ground do not need you to have all the items in inventory at once.  Instead, you can put just a few at a time until you have all you need.  These latter two styles also require the use of a \"multitool,\" but it looks and sounds like a hammer, unless it's stirring food.\n\nBy Hand and every crafting station have their own crafting trees.  You unlock recipes by crafting the ones before it, so you cannot skip over all but the final recipe in the branch.  Crafting trees are organized logically, though.  Crafting a core component for the first time might unlock recipes using it, or you go through a series of upgrades, or other items in the category.\n\nYou'll find extensive crafting trees in another sense.  The more complicated builds require raw materials to be combined into components, and then those components are used in the end build, leading to possibly a couple dozen total steps from raw components to final product.  Crafting also takes time, from a second or two to an entire minute.  A good chuck of game time is waiting for crafting to finish.  (And just you wait until the endgame's build!)\n\n\nOf course, you'll need to collect the raw materials before you start crafting.  Your personal inventory is limited to just 10 slots, but an upcoming update gives you a backpack.  Worse, there's no equipment slots.  You can wield only tools and weapons, no armor or amulets here, and they must be held in inventory.  And those tools and weapons suffer from durability.\n\nOn the other hand, the game is quite generous with most resources.  The game map itself is [i]ginormous[/i], around the size other games might consider for an entire planet.  It even resembles a planet, with \"continents\" that are actually several procedurally-generated islands, plus sandbars and rock formations.\n\nYour midsize starting island has just the first, easy half of the resources with nothing more dangerous than a few aggro animals and enemies.  More dangerous biomes with advanced resources await you on larger islands.  Any one of the large islands contains a bit of everything, but the endgame requires you to visit the other large islands.\n\nAnother way the game is generous is in respawning treasure chests.  These spawn when you find a message in a bottle that gives you a \"treasure map.\"  Smash the chest open, and you'll find what the map says:  Food, a tool, a weapon, or other items, and gold.\n\nAnything in inventory can be dropped and safely left to persist forever.  Excess harvested resources can also be safely left on the ground, or disposed of in an upcoming update's refuse pit.\n\nStorage chests are a bit more than their usual godsend.  While you can't color-code or label them, you can pick them up and tote them around, even while full!  This is like an extra or upgraded backpack.\n\n\nMonkey friends are also here to help you.  Scattered on the islands are monkeys either trapped in cages or running wild.  Free a caged monkey or give a wild monkey the gift they desire, and they will become your helpers.\n\nThis becomes a literal \"monkey see, monkey do\" situation.  Toss them the right tool or weapon, enter Monkey Mimic Mode, and start the action you want them to do, and they will do it.  Your monkey friends can do any major game task you can do, from harvesting, putting resources in chests, supplying crafting stations, crafting, and combat, with the ability to level up beyond what your poor static avatar can do.  They can also carry chests.\n\nThe crafting system limits the monkey helper usefulness.  You can't tell Caesar or your own avatar to make axes until you run out of supplies; you have to keep feeding each individual recipe or see that the monkeys do it.  It is possible to set up a whole supply-and-crafting chain, but there's not much room in the safe alcove you start in, and you'll have to keep monitoring it.  The monkeys also have a tendency to lose focus and wander off once they don't have anything to do or once they wake up after getting knocked out.\n\nBut the monkeys are GREAT for harvesting resources and gathering them, and are a HUGE help in combat.\n\n\nThere's both hunger and stamina mechanics here.  Hunger grows with activity.  Get too hungry, and you lose health.  Stamina is of the \"lemmee catch my breath a moment\" variety, and only becomes a problem in combat.  Naturally, the food you cook act as potions and buffs.  Gathering enough food is a slight struggle until you put together a hunting/bodyguard posse of monkeys and have the metal to build an upgraded cooking station.\n\n\n[b]Frustrations and Annoyances[/b]\n\nIt seems that every time I draft a review before finishing out a game I have to edit it.  Usually, this is to the negative.  This time around, it's to the positive.\n\nI had a description of my annoyances with this game. (You have a surivival game on a bunch of islands, and you have neither farmable crops or effective fishing???  The raids are devastating to your early base!)\n\nBut, as I was finishing the game, the devs released a beta branch with a ton of features and tweaks, many courtesy of player feedback, that were meant to be eventually folded into the main game.  This branch promises to take care of most of my annoyances.  That patch will likely be in the main game in February or March of 2021.\n\nOne annoyance I had that might not be in that patch is how the game deals with respawns.  When you die, you lose all that is inventory.  (Not sure if the upcoming backpacks will also lose items on death.)  Sometimes, you respawn right where you died, or at the save point.  But other times, you respawn on a beach elsewhere on the island, forcing you to run to your items through dangerous territory without a weapon.  Fortunately, it's the same spot, so a player can just leave spare weapons nearby.\n\n\n[b]The endgame's solid[/b]\n\nGet past the annoyances and such and you'll find a good endgame, and a cute finale.  A final build to escape the strange islands will take hundreds of raw resources and a multi-step process.  Builder monkeys will help shave down the crafting time here.\n\nBut even then, you'll still need a few items housed in temple dungeons, and guarded by (disappointing) bosses.  To enter the temples, you'll need to buy keys off the game's lone shop.  In my game, the procedural randomness placed one temple smack in the middle of a dangerous island, but the others were all right off a beach.\n\nThose temples hold some interesting and unique puzzles, including [i](groan)[/i] building so you and your monkey pals can pass over gaps.  Another puzzle type involved getting your monkeys to emote (wave, sit, handstand) on a trigger plate.  It was difficult to tell when the emotes were properly registered.\n\n\n\nThe game offers a mulitplayer mode, only of the \"come visit and help\" sort.  Your friends can take the place of monkeys, including the emote triggers in dungeons and more standard pressure plates.  They can also bring up to five monkeys with them.\n\n\nI struggled with this game at times, but was still going to recommend it because I could finish it and because the devs were listening to the players and tweaking and adding stuff.  The tweaks that might have already come by the time you read this will definitely make it a more enjoyable game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1612765129, "timestamp_updated": 1612765129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721626162528991699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96699541": {"recommendationid": "96699541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356802814", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 1588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1588, "last_played": 1607723312}, "language": "english", "review": "I really want to like this game but it just didn't work for me.

Survival crafting/base building is my genre and I have/played 1000's of hours of games in that category. I picked this up on sale thinking the art looked very charming and the game had a good premise. \n\nThe idea of being able to automate things so you don't have to do tedious tasks is a good one! However, the process of setting up those automations is finnicky, frustrating, and downright annoying. Sometimes I craft things by hand (which takes much longer) just to avoid trying to select a monkey, give them the appropriate tool, and demonstrate what I want done. You have to do this every time you want to make a change in your production lines. Did you select the right monkeys? Who knows! they all stand on top of each other and move whenever you take a step. \n\nLet me give you an example of a typical process of setting up a temporary base on a new island in early/mid game: Go to a new island with your handful of monkeys, bring ALL your tools because if you need a tool, the process to create a basic crafting bench takes 5 whole minutes, 3 ingredients, and 4 inventory slots to complete. You have very few inventory slots and will spend roughly 1/3 of this game tossing stuff out of your inventory and nearly 1/2 of the game managing chests. \nThen to make a basic tool takes 4 more ingredients (2 of which require 2 steps). If you want to avoid the long crafting time, you can reassign your monkeys to do it, but that will take another minute, at which point you'd rather just sit there and craft it yourself. \nIn summary, making a crafting bench and a single tool takes roughly ten minutes, several different ingredients, throwing stuff out of my inventory to make room for all of them, and a bunch of micromanaging my monkeys which are supposed to make my life EASIER. \n\nI want to explore the world, which I think is one of the strengths of this game, but the exploration is an agonizing process of overpreparing, micromanaging inventory and monkeys, squeezing things into chests, and mostly being a pain in the ass. \n\n23 hours in, I realized this game wasn't even fun, and the rewards I get for progressing in the game leads to more of the same annoying, frustrating, tedious gameplay. \n\nThings that would improve the game, in my opinion: A complete re-work of the monkeys. They are there to make your life easier, not more frustrating. For example, only having to \"teach\" a monkey once, and then being able to assign them freely to tasks without having to do the whole process again. Dedicated tools or a small inventory for monkeys so I don't have to carry multiple tools for every monkey anytime I leave my base.\nBetter organization tools for chests, such as filters. \nMORE. INVENTORY. SPACE. (or fewer intermediary items needed to craft something simple) Why can't a crafting bench require only wood, for example? It would greatly improve QOL. Balancing can be addressed elsewhere. \n\nCute game with a great premise but the gameplay is about as fun as yanking my fingernails out.", "timestamp_created": 1669924051, "timestamp_updated": 1669924051, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696949958801269531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80091481": {"recommendationid": "80091481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273696284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2678, "last_played": 1612399606}, "language": "english", "review": "monke", "timestamp_created": 1606359910, "timestamp_updated": 1606359910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 112, "votes_funny": 66, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695477843284606934", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77311128": {"recommendationid": "77311128", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961802848", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 571, "last_played": 1602092385}, "language": "english", "review": "Very middling.

Monkeys stop their tasks after a few minutes. The dev team is extremely unresponsive, and does not seem to care that people who paid for their game are unable to play it.\n\nThis is all on top of a terrible game to start with. It had potential, but I am just massively underwhelmed by the state of the game on release. At least half of my playtime was just idling while doing other things...you can beat the game in maybe 15 hours (I took my time building a base and beat it at around 25 hours in). The controls are horrible, the story is horrible, the humor is horrible, the combat is horrible, the world generation is horrible, the crafting tree is horrible...and for heaven sake, why is the button to pick things up off the ground the same button to give what you are currently holding to a monkey?

The artstyle is pleasing to the eyes and the soundtrack fits the relaxing gameplay. Each island has its own monsters, caves and labyrinths. You mainly build a base and gain resources for quests to escape the Sea. The game is unique in that you can command monkeys to do literally ANYTHING for you. The monkeys can fight, craft or even collect resources and mimic your actions. However, the combat movement felt clunky and took me some time to get used to it, although I still did make do with it. This game is still fun and I got addicted to it for awhile. The Survivalists can be quite repetitive and may even feel like a fetch quest simulator at one point, but I still had my fun trying to explore and craft to unlock more items.

You'll likely be spending a lot of time standing around while waiting for your monkeys to finish certain things for you. But, this comes with the benefit that you can use this time to go around and adventure around the several islands. Though, with adventuring comes a rough apple you're going to have to bite through.\n\nCombat. I won't sugarcoat it, but the combat in this game is very rough. Not in a, it's very hard kind of way, but in a very buggy kind of way. You'll often find yourself missing hits you definitely were supposed to, and somehow hitting things you definitely missed. Sometimes you'll just get pulled back and hit to a location you were previously. The best way to describe the combat is that it feels like you're playing with heavy latency.\n\nStill, despite it's shortcomings, the Survivalist is a somewhat fun experience if you're fan of the survival game genre. It does things a lot of other survival games do, and some it does a little better, some it does a little worse.

I played it with two friends and we had a good time exploring the island, building a base, fighting animals and monsters and delving into dungeons.  This is one of those games where you just want to play another hour to unlock more crafting recipes and enhance your base, weapons and tools. It's a proven but still addictive concept that works just as good as in other games of the genre. That said, the game comes with a fair share of problems. The crafting is very slow and to speed up things you need to find and train apes. So this becomes one of those \"automation crafting\" games, but the system is a mess. Especially in multiplayer when everyone can control the apes and crafting stations. It's just way too inconvenient to be fun or effective. This leads to the next problem of the game: The UI. It's not very intuitive and the crafting stations often come with sub-menus and it just feels convoluted what item you can craft at what station. So expect some getting used to and frustration while trying to escape the island. And a friendly hint for visitors of other players islands: You don't get some of the critical crafting recipes, even when the game tells you that you unlocked them. A friend spent almost an hour trying to craft a bomb only to realize that the recipe didn't unlock at his crafting station but only mine because I was the host of the game. An oversight that should have been patched a long time ago.
