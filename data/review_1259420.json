Days gone is a post-apocalyptic game based after a zombie/virus infection ruins the world. It is quite open world and there are many things to do around the beautiful world. The mountains and areas your character play in is very pretty. There is also great storyline that takes place around the world. There are also multiple storylines to play, which includes side missions. There is also a motorcycle the main character can equip different parts on to customize their motorcycle. At first, where you can explore will be a small area due to not having enough gas for the bike, but once a player upgrades their bike, the world becomes much bigger to explore. For those who like a difficult curve, there is also more difficult modes in the game, including Challenge Mode. Challenge mode lets you do set missions to get patches for main game playing to help you in the main storyline. Anyways, here are my PROS and CONS list:\n\n\nPROS:\n\n- A beautiful massive open ended world to explore.\n- Ability to earn levels and open skills.\n- Ability for player to customize their bike to different specs.\n- Mutliple storylines and many side quests.\n- Challenge mode and more difficult levels in case the game seems too easy.\n- Post game quests to explore more of the world.\n- Works with controllers. I am using a ZEN black switch controller.\n- It works on windows 11 OS.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Some pop in graphic issues when loading areas happen.\n- Some minor bugs found in the game, such as sometimes when killing monsters, they float in the air, or look like they are standing up.\n- A serious bug happened to me. Basically, it did not load the ground geometry correctly. I did fix it by putting my graphic settings to low, shut down the game, restarted it, and played thru the section and it fixed it. You can find the bug here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1259420/discussions/0/3053986162866724340/\n\nRecommended game. The game actually reminds me alot of the MAD MAX game. Although the settings are different in both games, they both have that feel that is similiar in each game. If you personally like post apocalytipc open world games where you can explore while riding a bike around, this is your game. If the price is too high, consider buying it on sale.

I thought it'd be good from the high praise and ratings but not THIS good. If you're more into the \"pick up 'n shoot without a strong narrative\" type of game, you may want to stay clear of this one as it's a long game with an amazing story to tell. The story and cast are so well written I'd even recommend this game to RPG/JRPG players. Aside from 1 or 2 bugs I've nothing bad to say. Controls feel really good, the music score is great, combat is thrilling and varied, the PC port is near flawless and runs with the grace of a gazelle.\n\nThe story is a LITTLE slow to start but it's worth it. It's a long game so let it set itself. I've never played a zombie game before where my sense of purpose in the world was this grand. I played the game on Hard difficulty and it wasn't really tough at all, but as an RPG player I love to level grind so maybe I was just always OP. Hordes are really something else, but I found that even the biggest hordes could be brought down with some basic planning, either entirely through stealth or a full on frontal assault. Some of the ways I beat certain hordes honestly felt like cheating lol, like I discovered an exploit. I put off playing this game for a while cuz I thought it'd be good but mostly the run of the mill. Boy was I wrong.

All this is really well implemented in the game. The story is a little long, but it was presented well. You can take great pictures of the beautiful open world using the photo mode. The bike is controlled very pleasantly even on the keyboard, its sounds and physics are also commendable.\nAs I said, the mechanics of survival, the extermination of hordes of freaks (local zombies), a variety of weapons - all this did not bother me much before buying, but it should be noted that they did a good job on this: you can buy more than 40 different guns in the game, it's a pleasure to exterminate hordes.\n[h3] Now about the cons of Days Gone: [/h3]\n-The game has outpost mechanics, which are a lot in the open world.\n-The storyline is heavily diluted, there are boring missions in the mandatory tasks, but there are not so many of them.\n-There are similar missions (optional) in which you need to kill someone on order or rescue a hostage (at the end of the game they get bored).\n[h3] And what is the result? [/h3]\nAs a result, I can say that I really liked the game. Yes, it is imperfect, the plot is delayed and diluted, and there are many \"points of interest\" scattered around the open world, but you can endure it :) \n[u] I definitely recommend playing this game.

I finally got to it and I don't know how to rate it.\n\nThe story is pretty boring; the characters AND the zombies are gamefied stereotypes. The zombies are called \"freakers\" (which feels goofy every time it's said - and it comes up a LOT.) There's a screamer that attracts friends, a bullet sponge tank, fast agile ambush ones. You know. Innovative stuff like that. I'll give it points for not having a spitter archetype.\n\nThe main character is an awkward, selfish boner that you'll probably not like as a person. He has a looping arc. It goes: He wants something, a friend of his takes an L, and then he gets exactly what he wants. Throughout this arc the vengeful bad-ass post apocalypse biker will brag about how many freakers he's killed, but is a stammering stuttering mess who never has confidence. It's a bizarre dichotomy. I think they were constantly reminding themselves when writing the MC that it's gotta be REAL but they had forgotten who he is and what we've done in his shoes. It feels neurotic and pulls you away from any immersion or sympathizing.\n\nI made the mistake of playing on survival mode. Driving around on the bike *was* fun briefly, but not when you're made to do it for 60 hours. Constantly refuelling and repairing after a 2.5 minute drive isn't immersive or real, it's tedium. It makes you NOT want to use it. 4 hours in I had already regretted not having fast travel. \"Survival\" doesn't have anything to do with actually surviving, it just turns off your HUD and annoys you.\n\nThe quests are intertwined for the most part and all very repetitive. You'll be doing the same tracking tutorial, clearing the same ambush camp, and rescuing the same potato headed survivor on repeat for as long as you play the game.\n\nI had several bugs that forced game reloads/restarts.\n\nThere [i]seems[/i] to be an in game timer where a [i]random[/i] attack will happen to you. Over the course of playing I could feel when I was going to be ambushed by wild life or a special \"freaker\". At first you'll be like \"what the hell, silent wolves!\" and then you'll end up thinking \"well it's been one cut-scene and 6 minutes of driving so I'm due for a stealth bear covered in barbed wire.\" I started faking refuelling my bike in those times because you know, the surprise is coming. Oh boy.\n\nI liked killing hordes of zombies a lot - initially a scary and daunting challenge, then a late-game power fantasy. It felt good to have the character progress in that way. The music was well done, shifting appropriately to the action. Graphically it was decent. Cut-scenes would often have one out of place low res texture that ended up pretty comical but I can look past that. \n\nWhen out in the world if you 360 your camera at any point you will see enemies of one sort or another. Story-line rides with NPCs seem to have no enemies which seems to be a world-rule-breaking thing. It segues in to my next point.\n\nI enjoyed the open world a lot, but with an asterisk. When you're out and exploring it really feels like an apocalyptic rural mountain area. That feeling is destroyed as soon as you get to a mission. Why is the apocalypse filled with chest high walls for cover in every game?! There are so many survivor camps where you walk through what looks like a paintball arena full of health and ammo. You KNOW you're going to be shooting your way through this after the impending cut-scene. \n\nIt's the inconsistent feeling of being immersed and having it shattered that makes me not want to recommend the game. It's not bad. It's just not enough fun, or immersive enough. It tries to tick all the boxes and ends up not satisfying. The game is simultaneously both too much of a game and not enough of one.\n\nIt's not bad.. it just.. is.\n\nMaybe it's for you, but it certainly isn't for me - and definitely not at full price. There's a lot of game time to be had for the money. However that time is both awkward and mostly a chore.

You play as Deacon St. John, a biker outlaw struggling to live by his own code in a world gone mad. While the story may stumble into predictable territory at times, Days Gone still throws enough twists and mysteries your way to keep you invested.\n\nDeacon's a [b] likable [/b] roughneck, but he's not alone. The supporting cast is full of memorable characters, from his gruff but loyal friend Boozer to the survivors struggling to rebuild society. You'll find yourself invested in their stories and rooting for them to survive the Freaker hordes.\nThe gameplay is its greatest strength. The open-world is packed with hordes of the infected 'Freakers', creating frantic, thrilling encounters. Upgrading your bike and skills creates a satisfying sense of becoming more powerful, but be warned: the early game can feel a bit slow.\n\n[b] There are downsides. [/b] While the open world is vast and beautiful, scouring every corner for secrets will feel unrewarding. Exploration should only be done for Nero checkpoints, ambush camps, hordes and resources like ammunition, health items, crafting materials, you will not find any secret weapon or item by exploring, technical glitches can pop up. Some characters and parts of the map feel a bit underused.\n\n[b] Should you buy it? [/b]\nIf you crave open-world action with a dash of survival and are ready for a few imperfections, Days Gone is worth the ride. The intense Freaker encounters, a surprisingly touching story, and rock-solid gameplay will keep you gripped until the emotional finale. While begging for a sequel, Days Gone is a memorable experience all on its own.\n\n[b] Additional Notes [/b]\n\u2022\tRuns well on Steam Deck\n\u2022\tUltrawide monitor support.

They can be a bit less serious at times, \n        adding to the game's charm. However, I recommend tackling the story first to get the full impact. Although the patches that \n        can be earned in this mode give you a permanent buff to the story play-trough.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1710528171, "timestamp_updated": 1710528171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159210234": {"recommendationid": "159210234", "author": {"steamid": "76561199132473206", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2446, "last_played": 1708834133}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed days gone because for me there was a lot to like but if i had to be picky the missions became very repetitive, but i really enjoyed the story so that kind of overlooked it. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1708834638, "timestamp_updated": 1711072192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158470938": {"recommendationid": "158470938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000039559", "num_games_owned": 1011, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 3209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3209, "last_played": 1708113204}, "language": "english", "review": "Story was pretty ok (occasionally very cliche), voice acting - top notch (except some side-missions), gameplay - quite satisfying.\nMissing some polish, weird bugs some times, some slowdowns while riding. \n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1708113421, "timestamp_updated": 1708114271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163247850": {"recommendationid": "163247850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399222077", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 3157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1687, "playtime_at_review": 3157, "last_played": 1713626244}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not really a big fan of Zombie Survival games with a few exception and I'm happy to say that this is one of them. Putting aside the glitches and bugs, the game is really fun and I got really hooked with it. Really hoped that the sequel wasn't axed as the endings set up for a sequel perfectly. Gave me almost Resident Evil vibes.\r\n\r\nIn terms of gameplay, it's an open world post-apocalyptic game and the setting is really great. It's set in Oregon and I think it replicate the region pretty well. The map itself is actually quite big and your main mode of transportation will be your bike which can be upgrade and customize according to your taste. My main complaint here is the fuel consumption and it really frustrates me to have to look for gas station or fuelling canister every 2KM besides that it's pretty fun riding around on the bike. Onto the combat, it's fairly simple, you get your primary weapon, secondary and special weapons. There's actually quite some amount of guns you get to choose from but in terms of melee weapon, I kinda wished it had more customization for it. The open world in itself is actually really fun to explore and there's many side quests which you can complete such as clearing the hordes or ambush camps. It's really satisfying after going through and entire horde and collect their ears. You can almost hear the cash flowing in. As for the story, it's pretty well put together in my opinion. There's some ups and downs but overall it's one of the better stories.\r\n\r\nMoving to the Graphics, It's really a good looker and the soundtrack is also great, When you are exploring during night it gives of an eerie feeling as you're unsure where the freakers or human will strike from thanks to it's soundtrack. The soundtrack is definitely one of the stronger points of the game. However the game does have some bugs although it's better optimized then when it was once released, there's still some minor bugs. One which I frequently face is my character not interacting with NPC although I have pressed the button to do so. It's a minor inconvenience because I'll need to reposition my character every time.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had a blast with the game. It's definitely a must-try if you're into zombie or post apocalyptic open world games. The game does go on-sale quite frequently so definitely keep an eye out for there. The game is a solid [b]7/10[/b] for me.

Is the game worth the money?  answer: Absolutely.  I just finished 5 play-throughs and all challenges and have over 900 hours.  Some of those hours are probably afk, but it's clearly worth your money.\r\n\r\n2.  Replayability: as mentioned above, yes.  You can easily play the game 4 times based on difficulty.\r\n\r\n3.  Bugs and glitches?  Very few.  I'm trying to think of any gamebreaking bugs I encountered and cannot think of any.  Sometimes there might be a stutter here and there, and a couple times I lost the bike sound but had all other sounds.  So to answer, very few to none.\r\n\r\n4.  Storyline?  Good to very good.  Note: replaying the game will still have you walking (literally) through cut-scenes and you may not want to go through them again.  You can hold down the spacebar or sometimes \"H\" (I think) to ignore the cut-scene.  There are a small number of cut-scenes that you cannot get out of, you have to go through it.\r\n\r\n5.  Combat: This depends greatly on your difficulty setting.  Later in the storyline, some Freakers can only die via headshots and some creatures are frustrating on the harder difficulties.  You have a wide range of weapons including melee, sidearm, primary and special.  (includes a crossbow special weapon as well)\r\n\r\n6.  Gameplay:  Most of your time will be spent on missions, either for a specific camp or to clear the way for travel.  You will be killing Freakers, infected creatures, wolves, Humans (Marauders, Rippers, Ambush Camps and more).  Improving your stats will be done via injectors found at NERO locations.  Completing missions and gaining camp credits will allow you to purchase fuel, ammo and upgrade/change your weapon(s) and yes, you need to upgrade your bike.  There is a Gun Locker feature that allows you to store guns that you have purchased or earned via unlock and can be accessed via camps at the Merchant or at most NERO locations once you have completed the Mission for that NERO location.  You cannot store weapons in your Gun Locker that you have picked up in the world.\r\n\r\nPRO's: Everything I mentioned above.  The graphics are good to very good.  Environment effects are good, I love the snow effects.  Storyline flows well.\r\n\r\nCON's: For some reason Deacon (Deek) seems to yell most of the time.  I think it's because the Dev's figured he'd be on his bike most of the time, so they have him yelling when he really has no reason to.  Some people don't like the save game rules.  If you are on your bike (or next to it) you can quicksave, so do that often.  Normal saves don't seem to happen as much as you would like.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it!

It's kinda annoying since ammo is scarce in the game. Its been a few years since release but I hope this issue will still be fixed soon. Ladder animation is a bit funny.

I caught myself admiring the visual fidelity of the game in general all the time. Really stunning landscapes with plenty of spooky zombie-filled caves to show off the lighting and shadows.\nI really enjoy the sound design that came through from the dynamic weather, motorcycle, gunfire, etc\n\nThe game may be following the well-known open world formula but it has nailed it as good as any game ever has.\n\nFighting hordes of zombies as a first time player on hard mode is tense and gets the adrenaline pumping which  got addicting as I continued to upgrade my gear and bike.  This game gives you plenty of moments to make you feel like a bad-ass and I love it for that. Drifting your way through a horde of Freakers in the middle of a snowstorm on the side of a mountain makes you feel so cool.\n\n\nThis game is definitely worth your time and money.\n\nEDIT--\nI've completed the game and I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and playing NG+ sometime in the future.

Days Gone introduces players to a post-apocalyptic vision of Oregon, where humanity struggles to survive amidst the ruins of civilization. Developed by Bend Studio, this open-world action-adventure game plunges players into the shoes of Deacon St. John, a former biker turned drifter, navigating the perilous wilderness on his motorcycle. As Deacon's story unfolds, players will encounter a vast and dynamic open world, teeming with wildlife, hostile enemies, and hidden treasures waiting to be discovered. Whether racing through abandoned highways on his trusty motorcycle, scavenging for supplies in derelict towns, or engaging in intense combat against overwhelming odds, Deacon's journey will test his resilience, courage, and humanity in ways he never imagined.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY (9.5/10):\nAs Deacon St. John, players must navigate the harsh wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, scavenging for resources, managing inventory, and crafting essential items to survive. From finding fuel for your motorcycle to bandaging wounds and crafting makeshift weapons, every decision matters in the struggle for survival. Players can choose between stealthy approaches, utilizing tall grass and environmental distractions to evade enemies, or engaging in frenetic gunfights and melee combat. The game's responsive controls and varied arsenal of weapons allow for diverse playstyles, from silent assassinations to all-out assaults. One of the game's most exhilarating features is its dynamic Freaker horde system. These massive swarms of infected creatures roam the landscape, presenting a constant threat to players. Successfully confronting a Freaker horde requires careful planning, resource management, and split-second decision-making as players utilize traps, explosives, and environmental hazards to thin the horde's ranks before engaging in a desperate fight for survival.\n\nGRAPHICS AND ATMOSPHERE (9.5/10):\nFrom the lush forests and rugged mountains to the desolate ruins of civilization, every inch of the game is meticulously rendered with stunning detail and realism. Dynamic lighting effects, weather systems, and environmental textures combine to create a world that feels alive and evolving. The haunting beauty of the landscape is juxtaposed with the constant threat of danger, creating a sense of tension and unease that permeates every moment of gameplay. Whether it's the eerie silence of an abandoned town or the roar of a Freaker horde echoing through the wilderness, the atmosphere is as captivating as it is chilling. The game's dynamic day-night cycle and weather system further enhance its immersive atmosphere. Rainstorms, fog banks, and snowfall add layers of complexity to gameplay, impacting visibility, sound propagation, and enemy behavior. \n\nSOUND AND MUSIC (9/10):\nGame employs dynamic sound effects to heighten tension and provide crucial feedback during gameplay. The roar of a motorcycle engine signals freedom and mobility, while the distinctive growls and shrieks of Freakers alert players to imminent danger. Gunshots echo across the landscape, signaling the start of intense firefights, while environmental cues such as creaking floorboards or snapping twigs warn of nearby threats. The game's musical score is a masterpiece of atmospheric composition, perfectly complementing the mood and tone of the post-apocalyptic setting. From haunting melodies that underscore moments of reflection to pulse-pounding rhythms that accompany intense action sequences. Composer Nathan Whitehead's evocative score adds depth and texture to every aspect of the game, from quiet moments of introspection to epic battles against overwhelming odds.\n\nSTORY AND CHARACTERS (8.5/10):\nAt the heart of the story is Deacon St. John, a complex and morally ambiguous protagonist whose journey is driven by loss, guilt, and the relentless pursuit of survival. Voiced with depth and nuance, Deacon is a former outlaw-turned-drifter, haunted by the memories of his past and fueled by a burning desire for redemption. Central to Deacon's story are his relationships with two key characters: Boozer, his loyal best friend and fellow survivor, and Sarah, his estranged wife presumed dead in the early days of the apocalypse. Boozer provides emotional support and camaraderie, serving as Deacon's anchor in a world gone mad. Sarah, on the other hand, represents Deacon's greatest source of guilt and longing, driving him to embark on a perilous quest to uncover the truth of her fate and, perhaps, find a glimmer of hope amid the chaos. Game presents players with a diverse array of antagonists, from the fanatical cult known as the Rippers to rival human factions vying for control in the lawless wilderness. Each faction poses unique threats and challenges, forcing players to navigate a morally gray landscape where survival often demands difficult choices and compromises.\n\nGAME LENGTH AND COMPLETION TIME (9/10): \nThe main story offers around 40 hours of gameplay. This includes completing key story missions, unraveling the mysteries surrounding Deacon's past, and advancing the central narrative arc. In addition to the main storyline, Days Gone features a wealth of side quests, dynamic encounters, and optional activities scattered throughout its open-world environment. Engaging with these side activities can significantly extend the game's length, with completionists spending upwards of 80 hours or more exploring every corner of the map, completing side missions, uncovering hidden secrets and doing all optional challenges. The game's expansive open-world environment is filled with points of interest, collectible items, and hidden treasures waiting to be discovered.\n\nCONCLUSION AND SCORE:\nDays Gone delivers an immersive and adrenaline-fueled journey through a post-apocalyptic world filled with danger, suspense, and heart. Bend Studio has crafted a captivating experience that seamlessly blends intense action, compelling storytelling, and stunning visuals. Deacon's personal journey, coupled with the challenges he faces and the relationships he forms along the way, keeps players invested in the outcome until the very end. Despite minor technical issues and pacing concerns, Days Gone ultimately delivers a satisfying and memorable gaming experience that will leave players hungry for more. Whether tearing through the wilderness on Deacon's motorcycle, engaging in intense firefights against human enemies, or braving the dangers of Freaker-infested territories, there is no shortage of excitement to be found in this sprawling open-world adventure. It may not be without its flaws, but its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, making it a must-play title for fans of action-adventure games and post-apocalyptic storytelling alike. So gear up, rev your engines, and prepare to embark on an unforgettable journey through the wilderness of Oregon.\n\nSCORE: 9.1/10", "timestamp_created": 1713019459, "timestamp_updated": 1713072833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162615981": {"recommendationid": "162615981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198980917415", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1126, "playtime_at_review": 3340, "last_played": 1713324632}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I have ever played. took me 55 hours to beat the campaign and it was pure bliss the whole time.", "timestamp_created": 1712770990, "timestamp_updated": 1712770990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162566423": {"recommendationid": "162566423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198837927848", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 2630, "last_played": 1712700637}, "language": "english", "review": "This  is  The Last Of Us Part 3.", "timestamp_created": 1712696091, "timestamp_updated": 1712696091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162435732": {"recommendationid": "162435732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099277933", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3264, "last_played": 1628059158}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game, excellent story and such a great atmosphere.

[/h1]\n\nFrom its tumultuous beginnings to its eventual rise as a cult classic, Days Gone has proven itself to be the dark horse of its genre, and, in my opinion, it's the game of the year within its class. This open-world adventure brings to the table an experience that is as heart-pounding as it is emotionally engaging, setting a new benchmark for narrative-driven survival horror games.\n\nSoundtrack That Sets the Tone: One cannot simply talk about Days Gone without mentioning its brilliant soundtrack. The music in this game is nothing short of amazing, perfectly encapsulating the desolate yet beautiful landscapes of the Pacific Northwest. The atmospheric tunes elevate every ride through the abandoned roads and every tense encounter with the infected, making the game's world feel alive and teeming with unseen threats.\n\nThe Thrill of the Horde: Speaking of threats, the hordes in Days Gone are a standout feature. They bring a level of tension and excitement that is unmatched, creating moments of pure adrenaline as you strategise on the fly to survive the overwhelming numbers of the infected. The sight of a horde cascading down a hill like a tidal wave of death is something that stays with you, pushing you to refine your skills and come back stronger.\n\nA Love-Hate Relationship with Screamers: Ah, the screamers! As much as I hate encountering these terrifying foes, I must admit they add a fun twist to the gameplay. Their ability to disrupt your plans and send you into a panic is paradoxically what makes them so enjoyable to outsmart. It's this balance of fear and fun that Days Gone nails so perfectly.\n\nCharacters That Stick With You: At the heart of Days Gone are its characters, and the arcs of Boozer and Deacon are particularly memorable. Watching their relationship evolve over the course of the game amidst the backdrop of a world gone mad is something truly special. The voice acting and character development are top-notch, making you care deeply about their fates and rooting for them every step of the way.\n\nHoping for More: As the credits rolled, I found myself both satisfied with the ending and yearning for more. Days Gone concludes on a high note, yet it leaves the door open for further exploration of its rich world. I join the chorus of fans eagerly hoping for a DLC or, even better, a Days Gone II. Bend Studio, if you're listening, know that your creation has left an indelible mark, and we're all waiting to see where you take us next.\n\nIn conclusion, Days Gone is more than just a game; it's a journey. A journey through a ravaged world that's as beautiful as it is dangerous. A journey with characters who feel like friends (and foes) we've known forever. To anyone on the fence about giving this game a try, I say go for it.

Good Story with genuine emotions and realistic characters (and their development). Believable open world and a good progression system along with different types of combat for humans, freaks and hordes make for a more diverse gameplay loop than most \"go here, take that base, repeat\" games out there. Only one thing is really annoying: sometimes when you explore you find absolutely nothing in a point of interest because the mission it is connected to is not running. Had plenty of instances where I was just exploring only to find nothing of interest only to come back with an active story 2 hours later. Kinda kills the exploration part of the game. My advice, play the missions only and don\u00b4t wander off to far for a more guided but ultimately better experience because you won\u00b4t be as dissapointed and waste less time. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1712048192, "timestamp_updated": 1712048192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161953286": {"recommendationid": "161953286", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998118011", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 4318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 76, "playtime_at_review": 3051, "last_played": 1713475498}, "language": "english", "review": "You know, I'm beginning to understand why mankind drove the wolves to near extinction.\r\nI feel like we need to finish the job.", "timestamp_created": 1711980822, "timestamp_updated": 1711980822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161370480": {"recommendationid": "161370480", "author": {"steamid": "76561199162680903", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 7789, "last_played": 1713456864}, "language": "english", "review": "game is good", "timestamp_created": 1711301319, "timestamp_updated": 1711301319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161355121": {"recommendationid": "161355121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027598348", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 1907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 915, "last_played": 1712431858}, "language": "english", "review": "Top-notch post-apocalyptic fun and games.

I've put 30 hours+ into this and I'm excited for the next 30.

I had no expectations, but i was blown away by the time i got to the end of it. \nThe characters feel alive and the story is less about saving the world as usual but more about the journey of Deacon and what a journey it is. \nThe story starts out slow with a lot of building up , but once you are known to the world and the charaters it picks up the pace and takes you on an adventure in the post apocalypse that you will certainly love. \n\nThe acting is great , the graphics is gorgeous to this day and the world has an atmoshphere that will grip you and won't let go until you reach the end of it.  Part of me wishes that i could experience the whole thing without knowing anything about it. \n\nLong story short , it deserves the 90%+ ratings on steam and it will likely go on sale soon during the winter sale. \nDo yourself a favor and experience this gem.", "timestamp_created": 1668387215, "timestamp_updated": 1668387215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 243, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.939381897449493408", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149693689": {"recommendationid": "149693689", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990672090", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 5966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5745, "last_played": 1700006941}, "language": "english", "review": "I almost never finish open world games, yet I'm now finishing up my second playthrough of this game.

(Ghost of Tsushima, The last of Us, God of War) - UPDATE: We got most all of them!! Thank you, Keep them coming SONY! , Bloodborne and Gran Turismo next?)\n\nThe WORLD is breathtaking and very ambient. The world its self will suck you in with how lonely the open road is. You get that feeling of loneliness and desperation when out there. The lighting is dynamic, the soundtrack definitely give you a chilling isolated vibe when on your bike, being on foot will give you absolute silence at times which makes you want to be cautious when out there. Also the sound of folly sound great to the amount sound effects to make the game a bit more real.\n\nEXCELLENT game with engaging story that inspires taking on more missions to unfold the narrative DRAMA, especially the tragic romance.\n\nFor those who need comparison, Days Gone does offer open world ACTION and challenges that allow the main character to grow and learn through skills and item acquisitions much like your Far Cry`s and the like. These tools are essential to pace a story and impart a level design that fosters a world of discovery and adventure. But, this is a dynamic world that changes by night, by approach, and by the world\u2019s inhabitants. There is so much going on inside this world, just as a constant caution when exploring or carrying out formal missions. For example, in experiencing a common encampment takedown, I started off stealthy, but part way through got the attention of a horde of freakers and my hasty and finesse free escape straight through the encampment resulted in the horde clearing out the enemy. Your plan and approach can change by the second and the ongoing need to refuel your bike or gather crafting resources makes you feel vulnerable in the dangerous world.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the STORY and the complex relationships that make this dangerous world worth the risk for Deacon to brave. The tragic LOVE story that see his purpose shift from hope to despair connects with a player who understands the meaning of what it is to have found that special person in your life...the one you will never let go of, either in life or memory. These characters are likely not the kind you identify with generally. Bend Studio didn\u2019t make a hero that the player wants to be or makes the kind of decisions we might make. Deacon is true to his character and frustrations about wanting him to open up to his friends or react differently in a way that we might react, is a refreshing change. It supports the main idea that trust is a valuable commodity in this world and isn\u2019t given easily. Trust is currency in Days Gone and Deacon\u2019s wary attitude and resistance to get close to other characters is more than believable, it is appropriate. This makes each softening of Deacon\u2019s guard with some characters so much more meaningful when those moments occur. These are the moments a player will root for and incentify the story that may evolve from those relationships. And yet, this applies to the stories of the main NPC characters as well. The high quality dialogue, music, and atmosphere continually set a mood that perfectly matches the moment to moment experience with convincing influence.\n\nI played this on PS4 so I am glad and proud to finally play it on PC!

The cinematic portion alone is absolutely riveting multiple story lines that immerse you into the heart warming yet depressing and dark open-world experience. As with any open world game there are issues in the game play with bugs and glitches that sometime ruin the immersion but they are few and far between. Maybe one every thirty minutes depending on what you are doing.I really want to hone in on the story though. It is fascinating from beginning to end to follow Deacon St. John in his quest to survive in a challenging post-apocalyptic world. I won't give any spoilers here as to what the main story is because if I say anything it becomes obvious what happens later on in the game.\nThe game play in summation is bad ass. Fighting off hordes is the best part of the game. It's not something that you can just go and do. It takes playing through the main story and becoming more in shape and gaining the skill set in order to take them on. Then once you get to it you have to spend some time prepping for it. Once it goes down it's heart pounding and quite an undertaking. NO other zombie game comes close to the terrifying experience that this game offers when it comes to a bulk amount of zombies coming after you. 7 Days to Die is a close second but this game takes hordes to a whole other level. You have to have some brains to pull it off, it's not for the faint of heart. \nThis game is a perfect blend of stealth and action. You have complete free will as to how you're going to approach combat. There are only a few times in the game that you are forced into a \"shoot-em-up\" or forced into a complete stealth scene. I personally can't stand games that force you into stealth but the way this game handled it is perfect. \nThe music is fantastic. It doesn't drown you in songs with lyrics which i can appreciate that they made it few and far between. It's reminiscent of Red Dead Redemption 1 where you're riding out into a new part of the story and it play a song with lyrics that is very touching and pours emotion into the scene. At the end credits one of the songs features Lewis Capaldi which is awesome. He is such an incredible singer and every one of his songs is great. I've never heard him put out bad music so to be added in this game completely unexpectedly was a nice treat.\n\nOverall if you're looking for a truly immersive open world experience then this game is for you.

Completed it three times on PS4 and twice on PS5 so the steam \"time played\" isn't reflective. \n\nThat said, let's start with the bad and get it out of the way. \n-When you first start out, you will feel like you bought the wrong game. You CANNOT take on the hordes you've seen in trailers (maybe if you've beaten the game, understand the mechanics, how to use the environment or you're playing on an easier difficulty). When you finally unlock your first \"proper\" primary weapon, the game drastically changes in pacing and what you can do/survive. \n\n\nThe Good\n-Beautiful open world and not an Ubisoft title. You will never have to travel endlessly over boring recycled terrain, something is always around the corner. . . or hill. Missions make great use of the open world to make it feel much bigger than it really is (by no means is the world small}.\n-The story and acting are obviously subjective. I won't say anything about it here except that the voice acting is top-notch. \n-Game-play, nothing new or revolutionary but it does what other third person shooters still fail to do today, make the game fun.\n- No in-game ads or intrusive \"services\". A single player game without all the modern nickel and dime schemes of most titles.\n- There is an actual ending, not some final mission setting up some infinite grind collect-a-thon.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone looking for a great story rich game.\n\n\n\nEDIT (11/8/21): 34 hours in and I can safely say that this version of the game avoided all of the issues that it had when it originally launched on the PS4. No crashes and I haven't seen and graphical bugs either. They may exist but I haven't seen any.

Trust system makes sense, but kinda falls on it's face when it comes to the narrative.\n\nCons\n-Certain characters just kinda suck.\n-Slow start, and could definitely trim the length.\n-Early game weapons are really boring/terrible to use.\n-Drip feed of content(weapons, equipment, bike parts, etc) is too slow.\n\nDespite my gripes.

With that out of the way allow me to say this, my gaming history began on an Atari 2600 as a child and my first PC gaming experience was in 1988 with Mines of Titan... yes I am old.\n\nNow with that out of the way, I rather confidently state, this game, while not perfect, by any measure (I've had more than a few bugs that made me giggle and scratch my head) is one of the greatest experiences I have ever had playing a video game and nothing anyone says will change that stance.\n\nAs I have aged, I look more for a relaxing time playing a game, I want to chill, I haven't played a PVP game in nearly a decade and avoid \"Souls Like\" games like the plague, I can't be doing with dying every 5 mins or games that test my patience, I no longer have the hair to pull out for a start.\n\nDays Gone has changed all of that, I feel young again, I know that sounds daft, but it's true. Sure the game has left me a paranoid, emotionally and physically drained wreck, even just 20 hours in but, damn I feel like I'm 20 again, my love gaming is back, and I sadly know it will probably die when I finish the game, which makes me a sad bunny.\n\nYes you leave swathes of foes in your wake while playing Days Gone, but every combat feels like it could be your last. \n\nYes you will spend most of your time on foot sneaking, not because you are forced to, but rather out of fear, it doesn't feel slow, or boring like some Elder Scrolls sneak mission, it feels right, the game is immersive and it hooks you and sucks you in, it gets under your skin, not like some little fishing hook, rather a great big Texas Chainsaw Massacre meat hook.\n\nDays Gone is raw, it's gritty, gruesome and it's uncomfortable to play at times, honestly, it's not for everyone, and I respect that. \n\nAn art critic once said that art can only be art, it must have no other function, than being art and that it must provoke a reaction, whether it is positive or negative. I disagree, art can be something more than a piece of art, I believe there are many buildings and even cars that are art, and I also believe this game is a piece of visual and literary art.\n\nDays Gone, isn't perfect, but that doesn't stop it being a masterpeice.\n\n***EDIT @ around the 70 hour mark***\nOk, so I thought after a further 50 hours of gameplay, it would be a good idea to update my review.\n\nAt this point I think I'm approaching the beginning of the end of the game, that said, I think that's going to equate to another 15-20 hours, and that's just the missions and side quests. On top of that there's still collectables to mop up, hordes to wipe out and then the challenges to complete and then if so inclined, NG+. \n\nOne thing is for sure Days Gone is exceptional value in terms of gameplay and not once has it outstayed it's welcome, it's a long game, but I know when it's over, i'll be wishing for more.\n\nI just wanted to touch on the subject of bugs, as regardless of how good your system is, you'll encounter some. Below are a list of the bugs that I have encountered, it should be noted that none are game breaking.\n\n1.  In Days Gone there are random encounters, in some of these encounters you can interact with an NPC and sometimes the NPC fails to materialise. There's a prompt to interact with them, but they are not there and you cannot interact with them. This isn't a big deal you just end up wasting a little time and ammo.\n\n2. During one mission I was supposed to interact with an NPC, but I had no prompt to do so. I thought I was stuck, but it turns out that opening the door to the room containing the NPC triggered a cut scene leading to the interaction. The problem was that an enemy had already opened the door, so simply closing and then opening the door triggered the cutscene, problem solved.\n\n3. There are infrequent, minor texture pops of scenery.\n\n4. Whenever you mount your bike and accelerate, there are some frame drops for a second or two.\n\n5. I once walked over a tripwire and got thrown into the air, quite far, I didn't take fall damage, but I was in a firefight, so yeah, that was fun.\n\n6. Early in the game I got jumped performing a stealth kill, by three enemies, I panicked and climbed on top of a vehicle. Got my bearing and prepared for a fight, then all of a sudden every enemy instantly died and my map was littered with X marks indicating corpses. \n\nI reloaded my save to no avail, everything was still dead, so I crossed my fingers and carried on and as soon as I \"zoned\", entering and exiting a safe area, all was back to normal, I've seen no evidence of anyone else having this issue, let's just say it was one of the more interesting bugs I've ever seen in a game.\n\n7. During a mission... erm... in some caves, late into the game, I suffered low FPS, around 51-58 ish on an RTX 3070, 5700X, 32GB CL16 3600Mhz, only time it happened and it only lasted about 5mins.\n\n8. Twice, I encountered an enemy that I could not stealth kill and did not react to my presence and after killing them the old fashion way, they didn't fall over dead, they still looked alive, but were very much dead.\n\nSomething similar sort of happens more often, where you kill an enemy but they don't ragdoll, they remain upright, I'd say I've seen that a dozen or so times.\n\nAt no point did said bugs detract from gameplay, other than the FPS drop during a mission, as that was a tense moment and it did slightly detract. Other than that, the few minor bugs offer nothing more than a brief light hearted moment in an otherwise very emotionally challenging, grim and dark game.\n\n***EDIT @ around the 90 hour mark***\nOk just finished the main game, still lots to mop up in my first playthrough, new quests open up after the main game is complete and I've only dealt with 65% or the Hordes, and just short of 75% of collectables. \n\nAs I said earlier I've still to look at the challenges and as of yet, I've no immediate plans to play NG+, I want to polish everything else off I can from my first playthrough, something I suspect is going to take another 10+ hours, by which point I'll need to take a break from this game, it has definitely left a lasting impression and I don't think I can go through it all again so soon.\n\nAs for the final mission, I'd say that they played it a bit safe, clearly a setup for a sequel, although I'll admit I didn't guess the outcome before hand, something I'm usually pretty good at spotting. I will say one thing, the final mission wasn't very challenging, the setup mission prior to the final mission however, that was brutal and took me three attempts.\n\nThis will be my final review update, if you do decide to play, I hope you enjoy the ride as much as I did, good luck and stay safe drifter.", "timestamp_created": 1687387390, "timestamp_updated": 1688679881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 249, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.899312078952789307", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101099254": {"recommendationid": "101099254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198808716300", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1990, "last_played": 1634321372}, "language": "english", "review": "Don\u2019t normally write reviews, mainly because I am terrible at them but here\u2019s my quick opinion. \n\nGame is phenomenal, really surprised me with how good it is.

If you are looking for a dystopian zombie open world, this is it. For all its flaws, the main reasons to get this game are\u2026 the graphics, story and world design. The feeling of \u201cend of the world, with dangerous zombies\u201d is captured perfectly here. It is fascinating to explore all the various locations and wonder \u201cwhat if this ACTUALLY happened?\u201d.\n\nThe flaws people mention are real: The policy of the developers to invade your privacy with their data capture? Shocking, and they should be called out for it, as others have done in their negative reviews. And the other major issue is, the Quality Assurance/Playtesting \u2013 yep, it\u2019s bad. There are so many minor gameplay gripes/flaws/issues that you are left wondering if anyone actually did any playtesting. Watch the credits - literally dozens of people playtested this? Crazy. However, the annoying bugs are not enough to stop this from being an awesome experience.\n\nThe story and acting are really well done. The main plot between the male and female leads does take a strange turn about two-thirds of the way into the game, but overall, you do get completely invested in the characters and storyline. The supporting cast is excellent, and you will want to see what happens next.\n\nA real standout part of the gameplay is the hordes of zombies. They really are truly terrifying. It\u2019s rare to play a game these days and feel \u201con edge\u201d, but trust me, as you approach a horde of 150 of these monsters, the adrenaline will be pumping.\n\nRespect must be paid to the music and sound effects. The creepy build of the music as a zombie gets near you, or you approach a nest of them\u2026 man, it still gives me chills.\n\nIf you can get past the flaws, you can easily spend 60+ hours on this game. If the bugs had been sorted out, Days Gone would be a universal classic.\n\nUPDATE: I completed it for a second time, this time on \u201cHard II\u201d mode.

In a post-apocalyptic world, a (relatively) lone drifter with a gas-powered vehicle which they continually customize and upgrade (as well as themselves with weapons and skills) as they expand the map, take down enemy camps and loot ammo, upgrades and materials.  Lots of ambushes, sneaking around and brutal fighting.  Except this has zombies, but just like the walking dead, they are generally less dangerous than living humans, save for in large hordes.\n\nThe combat is definitely tuned for a controller (originally came out for Playstation, so, yeah), and in games like this I almost prefer a controller for everything, except aiming weapons.  But for melee combat, driving, moving around and maneuvering across the landscape, a controller here is king.  I still use Mouse + Keyboard, however, as I'm too old to change my curmudgeony ways and refuse to aim a ranged weapon with the sticks.\n\nMy only real gripes with this game are there are no designated keys/buttons to swap back to your melee weapon.  The game takes this upon itself, assuming control of this selection when enemies get close enough, however this can be unreliable and inconsistent.  Is it so much to ask for the capability to bind my own key to select my melee weapon?  There is a sort of workaround: open your equipment wheel and select it that way.  This works, but it abjectly destroys the flow of a fight.  \n\nWhat is also annoying, is when you are shooting at some baddy and the protagonist automatically switches to the melee weapon if another gets within a few feet (when you do not want to use melee as the other baddy you're trying to shoot is shooting back at you).  Conversely, it just as inconveniently does not switch when you desperately need it to.  This is the sole aspect of this game which is infuriating to me (well that and you can't save looted weapons in your weapon safe, and somehow a .22LR does more damage than an AK...wtf devs?).  I have searched high and low for a means by which I can bind my own \"switch to melee weapon\" key function, and disable the game's auto-switch to melee weapon.  I'm playing this game, Mr. Game, not you, so stop making assumptions for me, mmkay?\n\nAll in all it's fun and worth playing if you enjoyed games like Mad Max (already mentioned), Shadows of Mordor, et al.  They all follow the same basic mechanic, just done to fit the aesthetic and motif of each story and setting.  Not saying this is a bad thing, but just so you know what to expect what kind of game this is.  \n\nIt is a good game.  It is borderline a great game, so far (I'm only about 6 hours into it at the time of this review).  Is it an amazing game?  Might be for you, and if it turns out that if my opinion changes during this playthrough, I'll come back and edit this review and update my rating.\n\nThe graphics are good, what you'd expect for the hardware which it was originally intended and the era.  Runs flawlessly on Linux via Proton.  I hear it works great on Steam Deck, though I've not tried.  The voice acting is done well.  The sounds and music are visceral and flesh out the remaining ambiance of post-zombie-apocalyptic Oregon.\n\nSolid Game: 7.5/10\nI Recommend picking it up on sale if you're not sure you may like this sort of game.", "timestamp_created": 1671929405, "timestamp_updated": 1671929862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 107, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.891638398170471191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135193451": {"recommendationid": "135193451", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970412411", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 2150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2150, "last_played": 1633884828}, "language": "english", "review": "Days Gone is a criminally underrated game that has left me emotionally moved by the sheer injustice of it all.

In general, DG aims to depict a crude, violent world that sees the worst of human nature surface out of the sheer need for survival - and does so extremely well. The reactions, dialogue inflections, even expressions of most characters are consistent, realistic throughout the game.\n\n[b]2.[/b]\nFrom burning down mutant nests to eradicate infestations from whole chunks of the map, to re-activating pre-apocalypse technology or defeating bandit camps, there is a lot to do across the world. NPCs will periodically call for help in the form of quests as well, with some days having to pass between each call, in a realistic manner. Random events like summary executions to be stopped or skirmishes between factions happen quite often along the road, as well.\n\n[b]3.[/b]\nBetween the meaty feeling of smashing enemies with a baseball bat, the satisfying thumping of bullets into heads, torsos and other appendages, or limbs flying after a close encounter with a pipe bomb, each fight in Days Gone proves really fun from start to end. Deception, stealth or even turning mutants against humans in cleverly-thought-out schemes are all possible solutions, other than the classic guns-blazing approach.\n\n[b]4.[/b]\nDeacon's arsenal, bike parts and passive skills can progressively become better, thanks to an XP-based leveling system and a reputation system in allied encampments. As one completes side-activities or quests, more and more new weapons, parts and gadgets will be unlocked to either purchase or craft. Some quest-lines give unique weapons or blueprints as well along the way or at full completion - so it's worth investing time in doing everything.\n\n[b]5.[/b]\nA special mention needs to be done for Horde fights, where Deacon will find himself against hundreds of mutants at a time. The gameplay of such encounters is a thing onto itself, partially puzzle and partially a test of strategy. Using choke-points, narrow spaces, environmental elements like explosive barrels, distractions and a whole lot of bullets will all come together beautifully, to decide one's victory or defeat.\n\n[h3]Cons[/h3]\n[b]1.[/b]\nThe good variety of approaches and activities simply isn't enough to keep the game fresh all the way to the end. After about 30-35 hours at best, most players will have acquired powerful weapons, advanced bike pieces and many useful passive skills, while the mission types won't change and be always the same. Expect, for the last third of the total playtime, the gameplay to become much more repetitive and bland.\n\n[b]2.[/b]\nFrom hordes not being shown on the global map until very late game, when they would be totally feasible and needed before, to the inability to save without being close to the bike or a bed, there are some annoyances that make the experience worse. The fact Survival difficulty disables fast travel, adding hours of useless filler time spent travelling \"manually\" to get anywhere, is a depressing design choice.\n\n[b]3.[/b]\nFellow humans like bandits or cultists, despite having guns, bombs and armors, prove to be much less of a threat than mutants. This mainly happens because their AI isn't exactly bright: their aim is generally subpar, the tactics suicidal, and the reaction times on the slow side. While some human enemies can be dangerous, most of them can be dispatched with a headshot before they can do anything.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2524211036\n\n[h1]Gameplay Breakdown[/h1]\n\n[b]Exploration[/b]\nIs performed on foot or, for long distances, with Deacon's custom bike, which will need to be periodically refueled and repaired. The world is large, and houses dozens of points of interest to uncover. Fast-travel is possible to friendly camps, however only if the bike has enough fuel, while it's disabled on Survival difficulty. Most of the world won't be accessible initially, as the main quests will need to progress in order to unlock more areas.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nIs done in either melee or ranged fashion, using a good array of murder tools such as spiked baseball bats, hatchets, assault rifles, grenades, napalm and everything in-between. A well-placed headshot can dispatch all but the strongest mutants in one hit, and one the higher difficulties just a few punches from a regular mutant will be enough to bring Deacon down at least until mid-late game. Using cover against humans and their guns, while being quick and agile against melee-only mutants or animals will be the main approaches to fights. Deacon can use Focus to slow time considerably and land accurate shots, but for a very small time.\n\n[b]Character Management[/b]\nIs performed mainly at camps and safe zones, where a gun locker to swap weapons, stalls to sell mutant parts for money and various vendors to acquire new gear, ammo and consumables are present. Deacon's bike can be heavily modded with better parts, that however just like guns and other stuff, need a certain reputation with that particular camp to be purchased. These bike mods can be vital to reach some hidden loot stashes or upgrades, or just get things done faster. The skills panel allows Deacon to spend skill points to enhance three different trees focused on ranged, melee and survival abilities.\n\n[b]Challenge Mode[/b]\nIs a separate mode that pits Deacon against specifically-designed scenarios, with main and side objectives to complete. The better he performs, the higher the rating will be, in turn awarding cash to spend in unlock new weapons, skills and bonuses for the next challenge, in sort of a \"roguelite\" fashion.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2523256372\n\n[h1]The Judgment: Very Good[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1989090445]Complete Ratings List here[/url]\n[i]It took me around 51 hours to complete Days Gone on Hard difficulty, while also finishing all side activities. Despite the presence of a NG+ mode, replay value is rather low. Challenge mode can give some more hours of fun, to those interested.

The reason is that I want to keep this review as short as possible, because this game is heavily story focused and besides the story it doesn't offer much.\nNow hold on... Before you think that I mean this in a negative way... No I don't! Let me tell you now ... The story is totally worth it! \n\nThis Review also, doesn't contain any spoilers, so you don't have to be afraid to read this whole Textwall.\n\nFirst of it is an \"Open World\" with great looking visuals. Even if you play it on medium or low settings, the game will still look good. The optimization of the port is top and the framerate will always stay at a high rate. Animations, character design and the design of the open world (valleys, villages, farms, ....) is just on point. You can even check out many reallife monuments and the game even tells you about their history and the history of the country. But besides this, there is nothing much to explore. One abandoned house looks like the other and there is not much loot to get.\n\nI already said that this game is heavily story focused. Even the sidequests tell a small connected story and add much to the overall atmosphere. Just be warned that some sidequests are getting repeated once in while, but they always have a small story behind them which makes them interesting again. \nYou will find many very well written characters. Some of them are your average \"The Walking Dead\" characters, but this doesn't mean they are not interesting. Talking about \"TWD\" .. This whole game feels like a whole season. To be precise: A \"TWD\" season between 1 and 5 (before the writing got odd). I am not going to say anything about the story, because even the smallest things might reveal something. I just say that it is perfectly executed and will keep you going until you beat it.\n\nThere is a crafting system, but it isn't as demanding as in any other open world titles and it is mostly simplified. Many people criticize it, but I like it the way it is. You have a pipe, gunpowder and stuff? Just craft a pipebomb in less than a second to blow up some zombies.\n\nZombies .... Or Freaker. That is another thing. I love their mechanic and how they work. In most zombie games the zombies are all still intelligent at some point. In this game they aren't. They are stupid and this is good. They will run after you and ignore any obstacles. The more they are the more dangerous they get. Up until you randomly meet a horde (They are not scripted by the way and you can just stumble across them.). They are strong and they will always be strong. You might level up, but you are not going to be overpowered at any point. Hordes stay scary until the end of the game and it is sometimes even better to just run or take your bike and get the hell out.\n\nThe bike is another feature of this game. It is excellently made. First of ... yes ... The bike is your only ride, but this gets explained very early on. The streets are full with cars and the tundra can also only be accessed with a bike. We are talking about a time where it is way better and way more easier to get from A to B with a fast vehicle and not a big bulky car. You will just notice that you have to get gas once in a while. Otherwise you might run out of gas, while you are getting chased by 400 Freaker. Trust me .... You don't want this. You will also be suprised how much fun it makes to customize your ride.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI liked this game a lot and I still do. As a fan of \"TWD\" I can wholeheartly recommend this to any other \"TWD\" or zombie genre fan. And if you are not a fan, but are just a little bit interested by this game.... Give it a try. Even if you don't like open world games, this one will give you a lot of memorable moments and fun playtime.", "timestamp_created": 1623165995, "timestamp_updated": 1623354323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 287, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.884862840175628662", "comment_count": 29, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92311774": {"recommendationid": "92311774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057250349", "num_games_owned": 454, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 4029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 493, "last_played": 1625418033}, "language": "english", "review": "BLOODBORNE NEXT", "timestamp_created": 1621525906, "timestamp_updated": 1621525906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 684, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.8847503662109375", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93386421": {"recommendationid": "93386421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198914201154", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 58327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2155, "last_played": 1696910084}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game with engaging story that inspires taking on more missions to unfold the narrative drama, especially the tragic romance.\n\nBe careful not to run out of fuel as you can end up stranded with a hoard chasing you down xd.", "timestamp_created": 1623119850, "timestamp_updated": 1623119850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.883905172348022461", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92387654": {"recommendationid": "92387654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253694832", "num_games_owned": 842, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 3609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1509, "last_played": 1642163859}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]The Ultimate Biker Life Simulator[/h1] \n[b]And is also the most underrated game of last gen[/b]\n\n[b]+[/b] sony stop being cowards and port Bloodborne next. please, please pretty please?

I was raised in Oregon.  I grew up as a boyscout camping in some of the very locations this game refers to on the regular.  I'm very, very much biased in my opinion....\n\nDays gone is what I've wanted from a zombie apocalypse (sorry, freaker apocalypse) game for ages.  It's an open world adventure that from what I've seen is if Last of Us and Red Dead Redemption had a baby.  It has it's flaws.  It has it's imperfections but it left a surprising mark on my mind and that's sort of a big deal.  \n\nDays Gone is an open world zombie killing romp that takes place in Oregon.  You're a bad ass biker with a heart of gold.  It's a cliche but one that feels both fairly unique in a game like this and fresh.  This is very much Daryl from \"Walking Dead\" in video game form.  \n\nSome reviews have criticized the pacing  of the game and while I can see that... it's what I personally would like to see more of in video games.  It's just a fleshed out world that I felt very much inspired to keep dipping back into.\n\nFor those that grew up in Oregon, btw, it's a surreal experience.  It's not a picture perfect, to scale, re-creation of the state of Oregon but it's very much a love note to some of the best natural wildlife landmarks of the state.  As a kid I went camping and hiking on Three Finger jack.  Here I fought a nasty group of outlaws.  In real life I've had several restful and relaxing stays at Belknapp hotsprings and it filled me with a giddy excitement to see it brought to digital life in this game.  (with a lot more rabid zombie attackers.)  \n\nPerformance wise the game is in the upper echelon of console to PC games.  The graphic settings are nothing to write home about but this game performs spectacularly well.  I bought this on PS4 when it release and was intrigued but turned off by the subpar performance and feel of it.  On a decent PC (my setup is far from cutting edge due to how difficult it is to get a new graphics card these days) this game performs to a stellar level.  High frame rates with most settings maxed out make me feel like it was worth waiting for this moment.  I'm extremely happy with how well this seems to play on my setup and most people with decent computers are going to spend way less time obsessing over settings and a lot more time just enjoying the atmosphere of the game because it just performs really really well.  \n\nThis game was, by far, my standout sleeper hit of the year.  The location bias is real for me, but even aside from that I think this game would still be continuing to hold my attention and our current age off \"what is the latest shiniest thing..\" that's sort of a big deal.", "timestamp_created": 1621655888, "timestamp_updated": 1621656461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 205, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874031424522399902", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149122458": {"recommendationid": "149122458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198224887536", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1712429346}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a firm believer that Sony needs to greenlight Days Gone 2. For those who've played Days Gone on PS5, many will attest to its captivating allure, especially with its unmatched off-road motorcycle physics. I owned a 2016 BMW scrambler, and I was awed by how the in-game bike felt strikingly similar. From the gravity to the gear shifts and clutch work, it felt authentic. One of the highlights? The fuel economy system, where one has to strategically ease up on descents to conserve fuel.\n\nThe magic of Days Gone truly unfolds after the prologue, particularly when you encounter characters like Obrian and make it to Lost-Lake. As the story progresses, far from becoming tedious, the game becomes even more absorbing. The serenity of bike rides set against a backdrop of guitar tunes, breathtaking landscapes, and the adrenaline of chasing hordes is pure joy.\n\nDespite its evident commercial success and adoration from a significant portion of the player base, the news of its sequel's cancellation, supposedly due to a handful of negative reviews, is deeply disappointing.

All of us.\"[/h1]\n\n[h1]Introduction:[/h1]\nIf any of you fellas have been following my Steam reviews for some time now, you might have stumbled upon my profile & in turn seen my list of my all-time favorite games/franchises. The vast majority of them are games that I grew up with in the late 2000s & early 2010s. 2011 is still to me considered the best year for gaming. As such the latest game to have ended up on that list was The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt & that was in 2016, for the next 4 or years no game would end up on that list until 3 very special PlayStation games would capture my heart & spoil me rotten. This is the story of one of them.\n\nDays Gone when it was first announced took people's attention straight away. At first, it might have seemed like another zombie apocalypse survival shooter & you would be right to think that way. Even I did until the developers showed us their magnum opus. The hordes mechanic, something that wasn't possible now became a reality. On your screen, you could battle from up to 100 to even 300 or more fast-moving & furious zombies! Couple that with an addicting gameplay loop, a well-written story, a diverse & expansive world, dynamic characters, & a real difficulty scale & you have the recipe for a perfect game that will be remembered throughout the ages.\n\n[h1]The Story:[/h1]\nDays Gone takes place in the post-apocalyptic ruins of the United States. A mysterious Virus has decimated the global population & turned everyone who was infected into ravaging brutes that have come to be known as Freakers. They are kind of like a mix of the Zombies from Train To Busan & the Darkseekers from I Am Legend. They hibernate, migrate, & eat anything they can slay. Any form of governance & order is long gone, what's left of the civilian population has either retreated into makeshift camp forts, turned to bounty hunting & drifting, or turned to banditry & preying on the weak. You play as an ex-US Army Soldier turned Outlaw Biker Deacon St. John, together with his fellow biker brother William \"Boozer\" Gray, They make a living & survive as mercenaries in the ruins of Oregon. Deacon lost his wife Sarah Whitaker at the beginning of the outbreak.

That was THE LAST TIME I would ever listen to reviews online & critics online because Days Gone is a game made with love & passion, I f*cking love this game! The critics online who are tasteless hacks did Days Gone dirty. This is an underrated game, a downright masterpiece, and a few years from now It will be considered a timeless jewel. I haven't loved and been addicted to a game like this since The Witcher 3 and that was back in 2016. Days Gone is an incredible zombie survival game filled with an actual zombie threat, an incredible story, an expansive world, and an addicting gameplay loop that will keep you coming back for more. Bend Games totally knocked it out of the park when it comes to Days Gone but sadly due to the critics, we likely won't ever see a sequel but that shouldn't be a reason you shouldn't explore this quality game. Very few games nowadays end up in my favorite game list of all time but I am proud to say that Days Gone is one of those games to have earned a spot in my heart and my eternal memory.\n\n[h1]Overall rating 1000/10[/h1]\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7871885/]Follow our curator page,[b] OCG-Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1695909794, "timestamp_updated": 1695909955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870686948299407959", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151627388": {"recommendationid": "151627388", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968982291", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6081, "last_played": 1700842840}, "language": "english", "review": "where is Days Gone 2?? very good game", "timestamp_created": 1700842714, "timestamp_updated": 1700842714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 278, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.869118094444274902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128667375": {"recommendationid": "128667375", "author": {"steamid": "76561199019313982", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 6415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 143, "last_played": 1711296550}, "language": "english", "review": "threw a molotov at a child 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1671204012, "timestamp_updated": 1671204012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 394, "votes_funny": 269, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86785733699798584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116572114": {"recommendationid": "116572114", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994357776", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1747, "last_played": 1655066986}, "language": "english", "review": "A great open world zombie adventure, Don't believe the naysayers this game is brilliant.

It's a LONG game. At the time of this review, the 68.7 hours I have in the game is a single playthrough doing only the main story with a fair number of extras.\n\nYou'll take the role of Deacon St. John, an abrasive character for sure. The game throws you not only into an active virus outbreak that leads to a zombie apocalypse, but into Deacon's relationships with a number of people. People he seems to not have the greatest history with \u2014 \u201cburned bridges\u201d. He's also stuck on his lost love, two sentiments I identify with more than I care to admit in my real life. Ultimately, this makes him slightly unlikable. That combined with the game's length makes this a game for people looking for a certain experience.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3144447687\n\n[h3]My bike, my bike, my kingdom for my bike![/h3]\nBeing reductive, this game feels a lot like Death Stranding meets Far Cry. But I don't think it would be inappropriate to draw comparisons to Red Dead Redemption 2. \n\nYour bike is your lifeline. It's how you travel, it's how you save. It will literally save your life. Fast travel is allowed if you have the gas and the path is not obstructed by things like infestation zones. Otherwise you need to get around without it. The bike does need gas to function but this is relatively trivial as an aspect of the game's survival traits. For one, gas cans respawn and do not run out of gas. And gas pumps are still active in this time, it's only been a few years. When I first started playing, I became rather anxious thinking I'd need to be constantly concerned about gas. You're always getting something as well. Killing stray zombies (freaks) or marauders will earn you XP to upgrade Deacon's abilities. The freak ears and other zombie types can also be sold to camps for credits and that will also build trust. \n\nYou do need to be careful however, ambushes can happen out of the blue. Not only this, but the gunfire or explosions can cause more freaks or non-infected wildlife to show up. Wolves, bears, mountain lions. The game can go from 0 to 100 real fast.\n\nYour bike can be upgraded upon building trust with camps. As a drifter, you're able to go out on missions for a number of camps and establish more trust within them. You'll earn both trust (a type of XP really) and camp credits to refill things like ammo. Other resources can be pilfered out in the wild. You'll learn where to find certain types of resources as well \u2014 scrap can be found in almost any vehicle if the hood is still shut, gas cans are usually found around industrial vehicles such as tow trucks. Ammo can usually be found in police vehicles, medkits in ambulances \u2014 things you'd expect. \n\nMuch like Death Stranding, while you aren't a \u201cPorter\u201d, you are effectively playing that same role within this world. You'll learn the map and better ways to navigate it to perform the tasks the camps want. Bounty hunting, horde killing, resource retrieval and more.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3144447046\n\nThere's also a bit of conspiracy if you investigate the NERO checkpoints and go down that path. \n\n[h3]The Gist[/h3]\nI think this game appeals to a rather specific audience. It does have multiple endings and there's a TON to do in this game. Granted, it can be a tad grindy. But the gunplay is great, the bike riding is great and I personally identified with Deacon in a number of ways. More prudently, if you feel... lost in your real life, this game might be the exact thing you need to distract yourself for a time.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3144448670\n\n[quote]If you've found this review helpful, consider following my curation \u2014 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/28295405/]Station Argus[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1705856726, "timestamp_updated": 1705856726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863142073154449463", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137519126": {"recommendationid": "137519126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210022420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 270, "playtime_forever": 3852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3852, "last_played": 1679087910}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b][u]OVERALL[/u]: 8.5/10[/b][/h1]\n\n\nWhen you find these really big hordes, unprepared, bike out of reach, not doing too great ammo wise etc...

The PC version of Days Gone is a solid port of a great game. It doesn\u2019t go above and beyond by delivering anything extra, but as it is, it performs just fine.

Beautiful yet bleak in equal measure, its world is a pleasure to explore \u2013 and once it gets going, its story won\u2019t let you go. \n\nDon\u2019t write Days Gone off as \u2018just another generic open world game\u2019; it\u2019s so much more than that. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1630232819, "timestamp_updated": 1640633935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852001070976257324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131436859": {"recommendationid": "131436859", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975611370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13514, "last_played": 1691796545}, "language": "english", "review": "I should have written a review of Days Gone last year.  This is not a professional review so there is no need for me to adhere to any conventions.  I know this will age me, but I have been gaming since the original console version of Pong.  Over the decades, from then until now, there have been a large of number of games that I have enjoyed.  Recently, I throughly enjoyed Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal.  I highly recommend both of those.  However, it has been decades since a game has so throughly captivated me the way Days Gone was able to catch me in its grip.\n\nI love motorcycles (and ride a lot).  I love zombie movies.  I love gaming combat.  I love good stories.  Days Gone has all of these things.  Days Gone made me feel like I was a participant in a great TV series.  It was extremely challenging without becoming tedious and repetitive.  The world of the game is very large and extremely detailed.  The attention to detail throughout the game is fantastic.  The sound effects are masterful and make the game truly terrifying at times.  \n\nI want to keep this brief review spoiler free.  Days Gone is very close to a masterpiece for me.  I hope they reconsider and make a sequel.  I sincerely thank the developers and all of those who contributed to the creation of this game.  The final result shows your care, skill and dedication to creating something truly impressive.  Amazing!  I highly recommend Days Gone to anyone who likes this style of game.", "timestamp_created": 1674526171, "timestamp_updated": 1674526171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850245475769042969", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111610593": {"recommendationid": "111610593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004456988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5318, "last_played": 1650918712}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my favourite games. I didn't know what to expect, but it drew me in, made me fall in love with its characters, made me feel completely absorbed by its setting. That's the best thing games can do, for me: make you feel like you're there.\n\nThis is not, as some in the press have claimed, just another generic zombie game. For one thing, the Freakers are a lot more interesting and frightening than most zombies. For another, Days Gone is at its core a working-class love story. Two kinds of love, that is: love between a man and a woman, and love between two brothers. It is completely and utterly unapologetic on both fronts. There's no ironic Joss Whedon distancing here. It's about ordinary people who love each other and fight to make it through the shit the world throws at you.\n\nAs a writer, one of the things I particularly admire is that the game takes it time. By the time you reach the southern part of the map, you've gone through an entire emotional arc. You really get to spend time with the characters as they go through their lives in the apocalypse. And the characters, including your own, evolve. They make mistakes. They become better people. Crucially, they try to actually do things that make the world a better place. By the end, it feels like you've lived through something real.\n\nThe superb voice acting and excellent cutscene animations help with that, of course. And the writing itself, on a line to line level, is fantastic. So many memorable moments and characters. That it's rooted in a real place and in the lives of working-class people makes it infinitely more compelling.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game avoids many of the frustrating aspects of AAA open-world games. It's not a just a pretty but hollow world to walk around while you complete generic activities. One of the things I yearn for is games that make you learn to live in their world (the STALKER games do this, as does Far Cry Primal, especially at higher difficulties). I want games that make you live the fantasy of their subject matter. Days Gone is all about that: you have to take care of your motorcycle, look for fuel, watch how you move about the world, look out for hordes, etc. Yes, it can be slow and in some sense \"grindy\" but to me that's part of the joy. I don't mind stopping for fuel, or collecting materials so I can craft a bomb to blow up a horde with. I'm playing a biker in a terrifying apocalypse, not a superhero.\n\nSpeaking of the hordes, they are terrifying, and the fact that they move about the map adds wonderfully to the immersion. Figuring out how to deal with them, especially early on, is thrilling and rewarding.\n\nDays Gone deserved so much better, including a sequel to carry the story forward. (But don't worry, it doesn't end in a frustrating way. It doesn't try to be \"clever\" by taking away the achievements of the characters with some cynical twist - it just points to the next thing the world is going to throw at them.) I rarely find games that really mean something to me anymore. Sometimes I think that I've completely lost faith in the medium. Then I find something like Days Gone and remember what amazing experiences games can be.

The story centers around the actions of Deacon St. John as he confronts the horrors of a post-apocalyptic, freaker infested world while searching for the whereabouts of his wife Sarah. Deacon's determination, lethal skills & somewhat cynical nature makes him both an endearing & memorable protagonist.\n\nPros:\n+Great Story: The story does an excellent job portraying both the mental & physical struggles of Deacon as he fights for survival in a post-apocalyptic Oregon while searching for his wife Sarah. The details of the deadly post-apocalyptic virus outbreak, various factions & their relation to Deacon & Sarah are revealed as progress is made through the main story-line & its side quests.\n+Excellent Graphics: Post-apocalyptic Oregon looks simply beautiful from its snow-capped mountain peaks to crystal clear lakes. This makes for some breathtaking scenery when not taking on menacing freaker hordes or patrolling the grim remainder of human settlements scattered throughout the map. \n+Great Combat: The combat makes great use of Deacon's melee weapons, guns, throwables & traps when clearing out enemy encampments or taking on freaker hordes. This helps to complement your play-style whether its stealth or going in guns blazing. The skill tree is well implemented which enhances melee & ranged combat along with survival.\n+Good Controls: The game's controls are simple and responsive when in combat or burning rubber through the back roads of Oregon on your motorcycle.\n+Great Soundtrack: The somber yet at times menacing soundtrack definitely complements the look & feel of the game.\n\nCons:\n-Some quests tend to follow a generic rinse & repeat formula, especially when clearing out hordes or ambush camps.\n-Lack of cosmetics. While you can customize Deacon's drifter bike to some extent.

The environments are mesmerizing, breathtaking and visually stunning. Good amount of my time was from using the in game photo-mode. The story is equally impressive with likable characters, emotional moments and some unexpected encounters. The story can feel really drawn out at times but it is worth sticking through it until the very end. The combat mechanics are satisfying regardless of what approach you take (sneaking up on unsuspecting enemies and/or gunning down enemy combatants). Plenty of weapons and skill upgrades to unlock throughout the game including having the ability to fully customize your bike. Encountering large hordes that are highly aggressive and relentless are certainly impressive. Reminds me of the hordes from [b] Train to Busan [/b] and to experience fighting off hundreds of ravaging zombies is one of my favorite aspects of this game. Besides the main story-line, you have optional side missions to complete in each camp location which includes clearing out marauder camps/outpost, burning down infestation areas, and gaining access to Nero checkpoints to boost up your stats. Overall, [b] Days Gone [/b] is an exceptional survival zombie game with many hours (50+) of game time with a fantastic story and satisfying combat mechanics.

The reason for the latter is that the freakers really dodge about everywhere and it gets frustrating to miss shots and then end up in melee; the weaker, less enjoyable side of combat.\n\nAfter that, it just picked up. I loved surviving out in the unforgiving world of Days Gone. I enjoyed the combination of stealth and gunplay. I enjoyed being able to switch between the two and the variety in combat situations the monsters and the bandits.\n\nThe side quests often have on-going stories for the npc's involved and they are dished out at regular intervals, meaning you can't just blow through one person's questline only to have them disappear for the rest of the game. Instead, by spreading things out, you get to catch up on them now and then as time passes in the main story, which keeps things feeling natural.\n\nThe hordes are great. Early on, they're terrifying hazards and, even late game, a force to be reckoned with but, as Deacon gets stronger and better equipped, you'll slowly start to turn the tide.\n\nWhilst nothing Days Gone does is new or done to a level beyond anything that has come before, it does enough things well enough, with enough care and heart , for most of it to be enjoyable and varied.\n\nThe exact ebb and flow of the gameplay loop is down to you, the player, so it's great to do things as and when the mood takes you.\n\nThe main story has a surprising amount of twists and turns, even if it is sometimes uneven in quality. Most of the main npc's have strong(Iron Mike, Boozer, Rikki etc.), well-defined characters and the overall tone of the world has a good amount of moral ambiguity to it. What people have to do to survive, the decisions they have to make...the game tries to show people with all their imperfections and it's more interesting for it than a lot of what I see in games these days.\n\nWeapons have a good amount of variety, they definitely feel different and have pros and cons meaning choosing the right ones for the right job requires at least a bit of thought. Upgrading Deke brings noticeable, satisfying and rewarding benefits.\n\nThe bike being your save point is a great idea. On harder difficulty settings, you genuinely feel vulnerable when you stash it somewhere to go explore or scavenge.\n\nDeacon's character takes a bit of getting used to. He's a grumpy, messed up guy, but you can feel he's trying to change as he finally comes to terms with the reality that he's let this bleak world break his spirit - leaving him living a pointless life.\n\nThe way the backstory of Deacon is told is well done in terms of the segments but sometimes jarring given that it's often telling you stuff in reverse order, or simply a jumbled up order.\n\nFor example, someone close to Deacon says something really cringe worthy at one point. It's bizarre and out of character. 'What a crap bit of script', I thought. However, some time after another flashback, which goes back in time from the previous one, explains why this is. It then made sense and put a smile on my face but that doesn't change the fact that the initial flashback seemed poorly written at the time. It's an odd choice and sometimes it didn't work for me.\n\nThe map is surprisingly big as it expands 3 times from the initial area you start in. I think my first playthrough was close to 40 hours. I also appreciated the fact that after the main story is finished, there are 3-4 questlines that have one or two extra bits; to tie up loose ends with some of the npc's you've gotten to know along the way. Plus, there's an extra piece of story if you defeat all the hordes...it really set things up nicely (and ominously) for a sequel so I was very disappointed to hear Sony didn't give it the greenlight. I strongly believe it deserves a sequel, I'd love to see this concept expanded upon and made better. \n\nGIVE US A SEQUEL SONY!!!", "timestamp_created": 1622578323, "timestamp_updated": 1622578323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 135, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841145336627960205", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145123819": {"recommendationid": "145123819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226731232", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 5149, "last_played": 1713457464}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I have ever played", "timestamp_created": 1693136277, "timestamp_updated": 1693136277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 141, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840923130512237549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123654320": {"recommendationid": "123654320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008476376", "num_games_owned": 527, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 3635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3635, "last_played": 1665354386}, "language": "english", "review": "-What the hell happened here?! Let's see...\n+1 rag\n\nWhat do we have here? Another \"survival\" open world game with grind, outposts and zombies? I used to think that.\nYeah, I knew that it's a good but underrated game. I didn't expect anything from it except hordes of zombies to annihilation and some story. And the story here is really good.\n\nThe story is simple but has its original moments, Not genius. Developers created authentic world with own interesting characters. You fill that they are live. Almost all main characters have their own traits, fears, motivation. You can't get it at first time. but then you grow with them. Not RDR2 level but very worthy! Main story is almost awesome. it is stuck in the middle and crumples at the end. But I'm happy and sad that the story ends. It's a good point for any game [i](Unless you're sitting with a burnt \u0430ss)[/i]\n\nLike all games with open world I was afraid that the game is full of grind. Partially, side missions are not fully junk. They are just okay. I'm glad they're not tight. What is more, I didn't get tired of them [i](even with stupid wiretapping missions)[/i].\n\nIt's all because of gameplay process and well-developed world. It is not easy at the beginning. You need to watch your ammo, fuel your bike, hide and carefully pick a time to go.  Especially when you meet a horde for the first time. You are tense and at the same time you want to explore and learn more.\nI was run out of fuel and almost out of ammo once. I spent almost half an hour to find a fuel can. Escaping a horde and different spots of monsters I found myself that I was really enjoying the situation that game made. I didn't like survival stuff at all, but this one was very exciting [i](especially that fact that I forgot to save)[/i]. Developers guessed right about game process and how it should work. \n\nAlmost all gameplay features works and felt as it should. Have some questions about hordes termination toward to the endgame... anyway it's satisfying. The only moment that crafting at the end of the second half is getting annoying. At this part, game turns into action and you want rush, not to survive. And slightly strange progression skill tree, where some skill should be at the start. But thanks for that there are no levels, health indicators and fk\u043f damage numbers on enemies [i](these stuff is freaking me out)[/i]. One more thing to add - places of interest [i](blue questions)[/i] - fully junk. Didn't find anything interesting except several ambushes and most often awarded by rags.\n\nGraphics and sound design is good. I bet creepy soundtrack will pursuit me for several moths I guess. Guns sound massive and nicely. There is even some kind of world simulation. Not without false impressions but enough to see efforts that were made. Sometimes world is very rude and creepy. Although it is quite understandable [i](Deek has thoughts about it)[/i].\n\nIn the all game that I have ever played, motorcycle riding here is the most pleasurable. Bike has it own physics and interactions. Modifications, roadbed and terrain affect on riding in a tangible way and it's fun.\n\nThe game, Deek, Boozer and freakshow didn't make me tired for 60 hours. I want more but fully satisfied by the product. I'll keep an eye for the next game from Bend Studio [i](especially on PC :D)[/i].\n\nand\n\nDays Gone 2 please :)", "timestamp_created": 1665436280, "timestamp_updated": 1665436433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840870141983032227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138225753": {"recommendationid": "138225753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198973425762", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 6900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6834, "last_played": 1709255702}, "language": "english", "review": "Days Gone is a masterpiece of a game.
