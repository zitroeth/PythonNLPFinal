I died at least 6 times just trying to summon the mother slime and gave up in the end because of how unfun it was.\n\nI reckon the game would be even more fun in a group, definitely worth 10 bucks, even better if you can get it half off!", "timestamp_created": 1706887740, "timestamp_updated": 1706887740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515151500701904297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159874017": {"recommendationid": "159874017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859222382", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1119, "last_played": 1709597514}, "language": "english", "review": "allah", "timestamp_created": 1709597319, "timestamp_updated": 1709597319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513157904148101807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159803430": {"recommendationid": "159803430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043727634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 1171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 94, "last_played": 1710015969}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun sandbox game so far; don't expect anything outside of what's there and what you can do with it.

I just wanted to build a town and go on adventures, and it said it would let me do that.\n\nSteam now says I've played more than 100+ hours. I've been engrossed. \n\nThere's a very strong central gameplay loop that it clearly borrows from the genre of the game but which it executes very nicely even in its early-access state. You go down into the caves, you find loot, you come back up, you build a base, you go back down into the caves, you search for ores and fight monsters, you come back up, you build another house for that farmer who just arrived, you go back down, you come back up and the farmer has been tending your fields and chopping down trees for you so that you can focus on gathering stone and ore to build the forge you're going to need for the blacksmith who just arrived... and before you know it, you're running a town!\n\nIt's not a perfect game.\n\n-I wish there were a little more options for customizing my character. \n\n-It feels like there could stand to be more items. I kept expecting to find coal so I could fuel my furnaces with something other than the precious logs I need to build and craft with. I kept looking for a way to make windows for my settler's homes before I realized that the only thing you can do with glass right now is make bottles and there aren't even any options for like... glassless windows. \n\n-The variety of loot you can find in any given biome's unique caves is currently quite limited, although what is there feels very good. \n\n-I must confess I was a little disappointed that I couldn't use a ladder in the caves to go down to another level of the caves. Sure you can get access to another level lower later on in the game, but it would go MILES towards increasing the viability of my colony if I could just keep going down.\n\nAnd yet, in spite of that, the central core gameplay is so tight and solidly established that it took me almost a week to notice anything worthy of even critique. Why would I care about not getting meat from squirrels or crabs when I've just figured out how to use restriction zones to limit certain settlers to certain buildings so that my villagers living in the bakery will be the only ones who bake, but also other settlers can come in and get food from the displays?! Sure I wish there was lettuce so that I could stop putting CABBAGE on my cheeseburger, but I've just finally unlocked the animal keeper and automated my beef and dairy farms so now I can make cheeseburgers regularly in the first place!\n\nThe game is amazing, and almost all of this incredible work so far has been done by a single developer! I just read in the latest news that they finally added in a couple of others, which I can only hope means that the game will only keep getting better, faster, from here on out.\n\n\nTL;DR - The game's a tight, fun mixture of RPG adventuredom and settlement management with multiplayer support, a very solid gameplay loop, and a metric ton of potential. All sold for the extremely reasonable asking price of $10.00. I liked it so much, that I bought it again at full price after the sale and gifted it to a friend so that I'd have someone to play with.\n\n10/10 - Most satisfying fifteen bucks I've ever spent.\n\nPS:\nIn all seriousness, Developer? if you read these reviews? Lettuce. Please. It doesn't even have to look different from the cabbages. Just... lettuce. Or a leaf-free cheeseburger recipe? Please? Kthnx that's all.\n", "timestamp_created": 1701353366, "timestamp_updated": 1701353366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 469, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.960363030433654785", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114925670": {"recommendationid": "114925670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049493261", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 725, "last_played": 1708314253}, "language": "english", "review": "In the simplest terms, Necesse is essentially the dungeon-crawling settlement sim cross between Terraria, Stardew, Rimworld, and Corekeeper.\n\nThe inspirations from many of the above are very obvious, but by no means in a bad way. I appreciate the familiarity and how well the gameplay elements mesh together, and few parts of the process feels particularly tedious or unlikable - especially the farther you progress through the game - as many of the more mundane chores can be delegated to your settlers or otherwise automated via certain crafting objects.\n\n[b][u]Yeh:[/u][/b]\n- Easy to pick up, with many familiar gameplay elements.\n- Variable difficulty for players of all types; you can make it as casual or challenging as you want, and play at your own preferred pace and way. You can even toggle the hunger mechanic on or off.\n- The soundtrack is absolutely stellar, and the fact that vinyl drops are relatively obtainable at any point in the game is great. An additional bonus is the portable music player, which allows you to play vinyls within your inventory so you can carry and listen to your favorite theme at any time.\n- Modifiers window that you can dock anywhere on screen.\n- Substorage pouches for just about everything - ammo, potions, food, etc. Very helpful in reducing inventory clutter. They're purchasable from a merchant, or you can get them via quest progression. Love this a lot.\n- No MP stat. Makes magic usable instead of having to manage MP/potion sickness a la Terraria. Might be a tiny bit unbalanced, but magic overall seems to have a lower direct damage output than melee or ranged. (*See \"Suggestions\" regarding more on this.)\n- Persistent drops. Everything you leave on the ground stays on the ground until you pick it up, even after reloading a save. I find this really helpful, since I have a tendency to hoard everything and hate losing drops. I think this will probably increase load times after awhile, but the game currently runs just fine for me.\n- Item locks. You can lock an individual item in your inventory so that it can't be dropped or auto-sorted into storage. Super useful.\n- Interesting weapon/tool Blessings/Curses that aren't just all direct upgrades/downgrades of each other. I actually really appreciate that some blessings will improve some aspects to better diversify your playstyle. Not always trying to aim for a Masterful or Divine blessing is a refreshing change, and I'd actually like to see even more diversity for this to experiment with different weapon and playstyle builds.\n\n[b][u]Meh:[/u][/b] [i](keeping in mind that it's still Early Access)[/i]\n- UI is pretty bare bones and a little clunky/unintuitive at times.\n- Graphics leave quite a bit to be desired.\n- Oddly, digging feels like a chore, as regardless of pickaxe upgrade, it never feels like I'm digging through walls very quickly. Considering that digging is such a massive part of the game, this has kind of discouraged me from just digging around the place like I would in Terraria, and instead makes me just want to blow everything up with explosives.\n- Explosives can only be found or purchased, and cannot be crafted. :(\n- Buff/debuff icon tool tips don't always tell you what they do. You have to keep the modifier panel open to check.\n- Spawn points kind of finicky. You have to right click a bed to use it, but in doing so, it also sets/unsets your spawn point.\n- Traveling between islands is a little tedious, as each island and area is a separate instance (likely to save on loading?). There's a huge expanse of water between each island, and it's kind of a pain to get around between them early on. I don't know if there's a warp system that will allow instantaneous jumps between settlements later on, but as of current, the only thing I've seen is the Travel Scroll item, which is a blessing in and of itself.\n--- Update: As of 5/6 I have acquired Warpstones, but those only work within the current island.\n- Some of the ore is visually hard to identify from the rocks - Quartz and Tungsten in their respective stone types in particular. (**See \"Suggestions\" for more on this.)\n- Blessings/Curses can be a little one-note for armor and trinkets. There is currently one pos/neg for every iteration of stat bonus (dmg, atk spd, move spd, def, crit), and it's just a little boring. I would love to see more varied blessings and curses in line with the ones we have for weapons/tools.\n\n[b][u]Suggestions:[/u][/b]\n- Set bonus tool tips for individual armor pieces. Currently they don't tell you what set bonus they have until you equip all three items.\n- Mouseover toggle for crop names. Without using a sign or a display pedestal, I frequently forget what crop I'm planting in the early seed stage.\n- Quest trackers for settler recruitment. Currently, the only trackable quests are the ones from the Elder. It would be really helpful to add a tracker for what requirements are needed for recruiting villagers and other settlers.\n--- In addition to this, if you have multiple settlements, you can get quests from each of the Elder NPCs there. Unfortunately, the quest trackers don't really tell you which settlement the quest came from, and you're more or less left wondering which Elder wants what. Would be helpful to have a little indicator for who/which island.\n- Separate spawn points for every island, or at least some other kind of spawn point setting object. As of current, spawn points act exactly like they do in most sandbox games - pick a bed and wake up in it. This can be a bit upsetting if you happen to click a bed while trying to interact with a sleeping NPC and end up accidentally setting your spawn point to somewhere you don't want it to be.\n- Tabs for crafting stations, or at least for the Workstation and its direct upgrades. The filter system does basically this, but it might be a little more visually appealing in tabs rather than a rudimentary filter system.\n- *An MP system toggle. I love the fact there's a toggle for hunger, but as much as I enjoy the no-MP cost system, I feel like some players might not consider this enough of a challenge even on higher difficulties, especially since magic is INCREDIBLY viable. An MP toggle would add an additional layer of difficulty for players who like having that system, while maintaining the current state for those who enjoy not having MP costs. Granted, that would probably also require an MP potion/restoration system as well.\n- **Ores could use a little more contrast or maybe some kind of other identifier like a border or sparkles or something, or maybe even a Visual Assistance/Visual Impairment mode. It helps to have Treasure potions, but those are hard to come by (I personally didn't find any until maybe 3 bosses in).\n- Mob spawn rate difficulty toggle. I know there are in-game trinkets and items that affect enemy spawn rate and aggro, but the default spawn rate feels kind of weirdly high - often to the point where it's difficult to mine for things underground because so many mobs come crawling by. It makes summons a necessity rather than a preferred playstyle, if only to relieve some of the effort of having to kite things while trying to mine out some ore.\n\nOverall, I've really been enjoying the experience. It scratches that old itch for classic Terraria that I haven't been able to satisfy in a long, long time. I'm really looking forward to where this game goes in the future. Strongly recommend.\n\n>> Will update post as I progress farther in the game.\n5/6/22 Update - I'm more than 24+ hours into the game, and it really only gets better the more you progress and unlock. The nonlinear progression of upgrades is pretty great and allows for some fun skips if you're willing to take on the risks.\n5/12/22 Update - Took a week-long break, and it feels good coming back to the game. It's pretty easy to resume where you left off without feeling overwhelmed. Added a few more notes to the above sections.

In Rimworld you have big zones full of stacks of 1 type of item per square.\n\nIn Necesse the chests work like rimworld stockpiles, but can store multiple items in the chest too. The rimworld stockpile feature means you can assign a chest to hold food, set it to high priority, and villagers will automatically move food to that chest.\n\nAnd a popular tactic is to have an unsorted \"dump chest\" which you put your whole inventory into. In Necesse you just make that chest low priority, dump all your items in, and your villagers will sort them into the correct chests automatically! You just have to set up the chests once and it saves so much effort after that.\n\nI hope you can understand how amazing this feature is. It's going to be really difficult to go back to Minecraft or Terraria. And I'm going to be annoyed when Rimworld has a massive 10x10 storage room half full of tattered raider apparel. Necesse could just put all that into one chest or even better, a dresser that holds specifically armor.\n\nNecesse has really nailed the storage system.\n\n\n[b]2/4) EASY EARLY GAME AUTOMATION[/b]\n\nIn games like Minecraft and Terraria I've never cared for farming, fishing, or breeding animals. I do it, it's ok, and I get what I need from it. But It's more like a chore than a game.\n\nIn Necesse your villagers can farm, chop wood, fish, hunt, and craft for you. It's really simple to set up though some must be unlocked by progression. Farming for example you just take your existing farm plots and put a growing zone over it. Villagers automatically pick and replant there. You don't even need to assign what type of plant goes there because they ONLY replant - they will not mix seeds. So it automatically keeps the layout you set up. Trees work the same.\n\nThere is a bit of a ramp up as you need a lot of logs to make a lot of farms. I'm 12 hours in and stumbled through the game without knowing what to do. I've got pretty much everything at the base automated.\n\n\n[b]3/4) STARDEW VALLEY FOOD (or Pam's Harvestcraft)[/b]\n\nIf you have played modded minecraft you have probably tried Pam's Harvestcraft which adds tons of meals like cheeseburgers and smoothies. It adds a ton of variety and makes it so the more complicated meals fill more food. Stardew Valley was very similar to this, but food also provided buffs.\n\nI don't actually like how either of those games manage food. Because it's tedious. And it never gets less tedious.\n\nNecesse goes a step further because since you can automate farming and crafting you just set up the prerequisites and soon you'll have stacks of high quality meals that give really good buffs.\n\nAnd you don't have to do any of it. Your villagers will grow the food, prepare prerequisites like cheese and grinding wheat, and you'll have delicious cheeseburger meals that give health regen and that sort of thing.\n\nMost of the food buffs last 15 minutes or more which is really nice.\n\n\n\n[b]4/4) FUNCTIONAL STORAGE (Food bag, ammo bag, potion bag)[/b]\n\nA Minecraft mod called Forestry had themed backpacks like a farmer's backpack to store wheat, or a carpenter's backpack to store wood.\n\nNecesse has a similar system. It's actually more like the \"gem can\" from Diablo 2's Eastern Sun mod. I have so far found a bag for food, potions, and ammo. These bags features are very cool:\n\n- Automatically picks up valid items into the bag\n\n- Each bag adds a full row of storage (10 slots, probably)\n\n- [b]The bag itself can be used[/b] which will automatically eat from the food bag, automatically use ammo from the ammo bag, or you can press Q to use a healing potion even if its in your bag.\n\n- Bags fix the problem of the \"deposit into nearby chests\" where your food will be put into chests because they already exist. But you want to keep SOME food so you can eat on the go. Since items in the bag do not get automatically deposited, you keep whatever is in the bag and can easily \"dump\" the rest of your inventory.\n\n\n\nIf you still aren't convinced then this genre just is not for you. This is a really great game, one of the best of the genre. The only downside is the art doesn't look great.

As of right now, there are no seasons or any similar mechanic, it's more akin to minecraft in regards to farming but there is a lot of variety and you can make Buff Food if you see it through.\n\nRimworld:\nThe complete settlement mechanic is leaning on top of a lot of mechanics that rimworld offers.

No more tedious resource gathering, hoorah!\n+ You can build a massive settlement, explore procedurally generated islands, all while fighting enemies, bosses, and defending against invaders. Necesse has it all!\n+ Infinite, procedurally generated world\n+ Pets (I found a summonable pet penguin)\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 Cons:\n\n- I would have enjoyed a tutorial which better explains settler management along with some of the more advance aspects such as using wires, or enemy raids\n- While the Steam page states more content is coming, I also see the game was released back in Dec 2019. While development is still on track, seeing that Early Access disclaimer may put people off\n\n\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f Suggestions:\n\n~ Introduce random events to increase replayability\n~ The ability to take a follower or two on your adventures\n~ Tutorials for more advanced aspects such as connecting objects with wires\n~ More aggressive NPCs. Currently you can destroy their settlement and steal their items without recourse (assuming you don\u2019t damage the settlers too much)\n\n[h1]\ud83c\udfae Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nBuckle up, cause you're in for one hell of a treat. Imagine a mix of Stardew Valley and Terraria, with some RimWorld and bullet hell sprinkled in. Welcome to Necesse.\n\nOnce you create a world, your adventure begins, allowing you to go at it either alone or with friends. It's just you, an old man, and a single room settlement against the world. There's a small tutorial which gives you a brief overview on crafting and gathering, and the old man provides a few simple quests. From there, the world is yours, do as you please!\n\nRather than delivering a story, or objectives, Necesse lets you decide what to do - The game is yours to play however you wish. Initially, I wanted to create a massive settlement. However, I quickly remembered how much I hate gathering. With so much on offer (fishing, hunting, husbandry etc.), and with so little time, I set off and went to explore the procedurally generated world in search of settlers to do it for me.\n\nI travelled East where I found a fully developed settlement filled with villagers for the taking (or so I thought). You see, you've the option to ask anyone to join your settlement, but it costs coins and other resources. Not only this, but they also expect you to provide them a room with all the amenities a human would want or else they'll go on strike. My plan to have a fully automated slave labour operation was over before it began (I should never be in a position of power).\n\nWhen I first began my adventure, I noticed a ladder in my settlement, along with an accompanying quest from the old man, but decided to avoid it in search of slaves... Uh, I mean settlers. However, since plan A failed, I decided it was time for plan B, fighting my way to resources (anything to avoid work, am I right?). Down the ladder I went, equipped with nothing more than the mightiest of wooden swords.\n\nWhile delving deeper and deeper into the dungeon, I found an item which let me summon a powerful being. While the boss mechanics were simple, the onslaught of bullets were a highlight of what was to come. The first boss may have been too easy (I took no damage thanks to my armour and resistance potions), the two following bosses I faced whopped my A! Difficulty feels just right.\n\nNow, back to my previous issue, laziness\u2026 While I could automate my settlers to craft items for me, it was much easier to destroy a nearby settlement and use their building materials for my own benefit. At this point, the world was mine for the taking! That was, until I got raided myself\u2026\n\nI was in full gold armour, equipped with a greatsword, bow, three summons, and a handful of spells. My settlers however, well, one had a sword, that\u2019s about it. I didn\u2019t take the warnings the game sent my way seriously, and it cost me three settlers. Guess I wasn\u2019t an unstoppable force like I first thought\u2026\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcf7 \ud83c\udfa7 Graphics and Audio:[/h1]\n\nEvery biome and boss feels is unique, both with what you see and what you hear. This stems further than a simple colour palette change. These differences apply to enemies, vegetation and wildlife. However, repetitiveness sets in slowly and the lack of diversity shows in regards to settlements.\n\nFor a world that is procedurally generated, settlements all look much the same (albeit with different colour pallets and building materials based on the biome). A lack of variety with settler appearance was also an issue. The layouts and settlers felt very uninspiring.\n\nNecesse redeems itself with the boss soundtracks. In particular, the Queen Spider battle theme was brilliant. Better yet, you can purchase a music player for your base, and stream your favourite theme in game!\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcb2 Value:[/h1]\n\nI explored the world, fought through dungeons, and raided settlements (along with defending my own) - All while having resources gathered and items crafted by my loyal peons. Not once did I think \u201cdamn, I want to keep exploring, but I need to tend to my farm\u201d or \u201cI hope my furnace doesn\u2019t run out of fuel while I\u2019m gone\u201d. Necesse is a title that executes so many things well!\n\nFrom a vanilla perspective, there is a lot to discover and explore (871+ items and 4 biomes). Once boredom sets in, there\u2019s a handful of workshop content to freshen things up. For the cost, this is a no brainer. If you\u2019re a fan of survival games, this is a must play, there\u2019s no other way to put it.\n\n[h1]\ud83d\ude07 Final Thoughts:[/h1]\n\nFor a game who\u2019s name I cannot pronounce, Necesse had me hooked from the get go. There\u2019s so much to see and do, and you\u2019re given the freedom to play however you please. The settler automation is the real highlight for me, as it allowed me to focus on the fun aspects of survival games while automating the tedious parts. Do yourself a favour, give it a try, you won\u2019t regret it.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44931904-Bite-Sized-Reviews//]Follow [b]BSR[/b] for more bite sized reviews.[/url][/quote]\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32732116-IndieGems/]Follow our curator page: [b]IndieGems[/b] if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1675548954, "timestamp_updated": 1710812898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 137, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864391565322875977", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "152889070": {"recommendationid": "152889070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084671806", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3079, "last_played": 1696562918}, "language": "english", "review": "Functionally similar to terraria, but top down instead of a side scroller.

I've played several open-world sandbox survival titles.

This game however rewards you by letting you recruit all kinds of different npc's to your town and they are more than being a shop. you can give them different tasks such as cooking,crafting,sorting,harvesting etc. Automating stuff with the help of your settlers feels awesome. The game is progression based just like terraria. You'll fight 11 unique bosses(ATM) which are getting progressively difficult. That being said, i recommend playing on hard or brutal if you have played terraria expert/master before. The game is acvitely being developed and in early Access. Combat feels decent,soundtracks are banger and to top it off, it was made by a solo developer.

From that, and seeing the trailers on Steam to get a grasp of what the game looks like, it looked like it would be a fun few hour grind, but nothing more as a clone of the genre.\nUpon loading into the game and beginning my journey, I could tell that it was not a clone of Minecraft or Terraria. It was better.\nThe premise of the game is diversifies itself immediately from the tutorial where you officially start your own settlement on a small island with an NPC who serves as your guide to get comfortable in this world. At first, you'll just do the basic acts of chopping down a few trees and learning the controls, but it will be quick to find out that there's not much else to do. On the surface, that is...\nWhen I took my first steps down the ladder and into the underground, there is a sense of exploration that hit me immediately. I didn't know what lurked behind each dark corner, and lighting the way brought another new monster to my roster of challenge. Speaking of which, the design to have a hotkey for placing down torches is excellent for making exploration flow amazingly. As I looted the structures around me, I would come to notice just how the progression system works, and it is all tied around armor and trinkets, with the bulk of buildcrafting revolving around the trinkets, as the armor and weapon selections were relatively self explanatory throughout my playthrough.\nWhat really got my teeth sunk into this game however, are the bosses. Fighting the first boss gave me excitement and thrill. And when I eventually defeated it, I was left with a thirst for more. and thankfully, this game knows that and invites you to drink it all.\nWhile this isn't usually the forefront of conversation, the art style and music really nails the feel of what this game gives you. You want peaceful town music? gotcha covered. How about a boss theme that goes unnecessarily hard? Of course! Even though the exploration aspect is the same throughout most of the game, I never found myself bored or tired of the environments due to the variation of enemies and music. Better yet, you can listen to them anytime you want in game, because of records that drop from bosses, enemies, and chests. And I have to give props to that.\nThat's not even to mention the aspect of handling your settlement with all the NPC's that will come throughout the game. And while each NPC has variation in how they can help you in terms of individual services, you also manage them as a community: automation of resources. And it feels so satisfying to have a society of people that will farm, chop trees, hunt, tend to animals, you name it. So long as they are taken care of, that is.\nGranted, there are a few things that can be improved upon in this game. While the ability to automate a settlement in fun once the player gets a grasp on it, getting to that point is not so clear. At least for me, anyways. There were tasks that seemed to work just fine by changing priorities, such as farming and hunting, and a few others that needed a little more guidance on the player's part that is not completely user friendly. With Forestry and Husbandry, I had a hard time getting those to properly work for majority of my playthrough, because the player has to assign designated areas to do said actions. That wouldn't be bad at all, if it wasn't for the confusion of how to actually set up the area to do those things. I eventually found out way to do that through opening a seperate menu I did not know existed. My suggestion would be to have a button next to the each skill that requires specification of where to perform it when talking to the NPC about their line of work. Another note about NPC's and their skills is that each one can only have a few skills they can do depending on what type of profession they are. And I don't have a problem with that, in fact I like that decision. The problem arises when one of those skills seemingly a lot rarer than the others: husbandry. I don't know if that was an intentional choice or not, but as NPCs came to my settlement, there was ever only one that had husbandry, out of the 20+ that came, not including going to other civilizations to try and find some there too, with no luck. Again, I don't think that choice was intentional, but I think it would be good for a few other professions to have husbandry as a skill, just so that situation doesn't happen to other people as well.\nOne final note would have to be about boss drops. The boss fights themselves are great throughout the game, and the loot is also unique and creative as well. But past the first boss, not many others will give you more than one drop of loot. Granted, I did play on normal mode, and I do not know if more loot is dropped from higher difficulty games. But even having every boss have a guaranteed two items dropped upon defeat could go a long way. Because going through a tough boss fight, sometimes even a ginormous boss fight only to see one piece of loot drop is a bit unsatisfactory. Even if there isn't two boss drops from the bosses, even having a pile of gold and potions spew out alongside the boss item would be better.\nAll in all, this is an amazing experience of a game, all only for ten dollars. And even though there are a handful of things that can be made better, which I imagine will be better as time goes on and the game gets more quality of life updates, there are so many more good things about this game that cannot be stated in a review. I would definitely recommend this game, as it is a joy to experience with a googles on how to get certain items near the end(I did about 3 to 4, and they weren't completely necessary either).

This doesn't make sense considering that summoner gets a constant stream of damage and doesn't miss any shots since their summons aim for them.\n* Online, the worm bosses will always glitch, spaz out, and occasionally disappear for at least one user.\n\nThis is still a great game, but issues like these will need to be resolved before its full release.", "timestamp_created": 1679964561, "timestamp_updated": 1680459838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843751788139343262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147478486": {"recommendationid": "147478486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198922808103", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1697513847}, "language": "english", "review": "If terraria & stardew had a perfect baby", "timestamp_created": 1696213796, "timestamp_updated": 1696213796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843507707118988037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124357731": {"recommendationid": "124357731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022465039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 980, "last_played": 1668057692}, "language": "english", "review": "My sister likes it and plays with me.", "timestamp_created": 1666680405, "timestamp_updated": 1666680405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840576410293579102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151921401": {"recommendationid": "151921401", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965303904", "num_games_owned": 553, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3019, "last_played": 1697540216}, "language": "english", "review": "Initially i thought there wouldn't be a lot of progression having played other similar style games, only to find out that that i'm 50 hours in and still haven't finished the game.

That's the best word I can use for this game. I was able to accomplish alot more from NPC's and the settlement system than expected - I love the zoning system and villager permissions.\n\n2) The MUSIC is bumpin'. Especially boss music. I'm over here feeling like I'm playing Megaman X, it adds a good sense of urgency and such - and ofcourse the different biome musics are quite chill and enjoyable. Also, none of it is repetitive at all, so I can keep my sanity while being in the same zone for hours without having to turn off the music. Well done.\n\n3) Charmingly retro, is the best way I can describe the graphics and over-all appearance. While yes, it has the cartoony feeling of playing an early 90's Legend of Zelda game that we all love, it also has depth of lighting effects, particle effects, and great mobility capabilities. Additionally, the items and weapons look wonderful. When I got my first lightning hammer? MMM! Loved it! Gear looks great so far, though I'd appreciate being able to see a back-slot item like a cloak or backpack - and the ability to hide my characters' helmet. Also - No pony-tails available in hair selection, or facial hair / beards. Would definitely appreciate the option.\n\n4) Connectivity gets a big ol' \"B-\" as a grade for me. While it runs great when things are going smooth, it's good. But the first moment someone starts lagging - items begin to go missing, or some become cloned, just things like that - I'd appreciate such glitches being fixed when possible. Connectivity is Peer to Peer (hosted off a person's PC for others to join) and has the capability to be ran as a dedicated server from what I've seen online. Good option - if the item glitches are fixed. With an early access game, at a reasonable price like this especially - I'm just glad there's multiplayer at all.\n\n5) Dungeons / PVE / PVP: Well, the monsters are scary, different biomes have unique monsters and threats, and in great numbers - become quite challenging. There's a \"sort of\" class system going on - where items give different buffs for melee / magical / summons / ranged damage. And ofcourse eventually a crafted item that takes all of these improvements and combines them into one - sadly invalidating the uniqueness of character building up to that point - ((Check the discussion post I made, it's identical to this review, but includes this issue here in depth.))\n\nAs for the dungeons and cave systems - you can look forward to randomly generated (or seemingly so) labyrinths of monsters, darkness, treasure, lootable and breakable housings and furniture and graves, and boss monsters. It's very thrilling, quite enjoyable - and challenging. (As long as you're not using an insanely busted magic build that just 1-taps everything on the screen.) On this same note, there is a plethora of magical items, potions, trinkets, etc. to assist the player with faster movement and travel - as well as item gathering. Oh, did I mention there are mounts in the game? Well, yes, there are.\n\nIn the game there is a \"team\" system, and you cannot damage people who are on your team. There is also a \"PVP Toggle\" button that each person has individual control of. If you don't want to PVP, just turn it off for yourself and you'll be fine. Otherwise, turn it on, leave the team, and beat the hell out of your frenemies. Fore-warning to melee users, you will never, EVER reach a ranged or magic user who has zephyr boots + the wind wand. That's right, you, the tin-can with your mighty sword, will never catch either of them who are raining down literal life stealing blood bolts, poison infused spiders, and flaming arrows upon you - with no way to stop them. (Yeah, hi, I'm a melee purist here. Just saying how it is.) May I suggest to the author - reflective shields that can only be wielded with a sword in hand? Or perhaps make the sword / shield as one equippable item that uses spacebar or another hotkey to block a spell or something? \n\nLittle Details that are also nice:\n - Useful text chat system, complete with chat bubbles above characters, and the ability to \"link\" items into chat to see data about the item as a tooltip. \n - Weather system is pretty, day/night system adds challenge.\n - Supports a huge number of players\n - Quest system from the village Elder is enjoyable - but needs a larger variety of quests. I keep getting the same couple of them.\n - Drops from bosses are \"individual rewards\" meaning, anyone who participates gets their own drops on the ground - that no one else can see. So no one has to bicker over loot.   (Would also appreciate something similar with chests in mines. Atleast on the 0,0 beginning island)\n - Inventory organization shortcuts are a blessing that needs to be present in more survival games. \n\n\nOverall thoughts:\nIn general, it's a great game already - though yes it does feel the strains of being early in production. However, for the price - you are receiving a game that is well worth it due to its enjoyable art style, settlement systems, dungeon / caving system, and building / crafting. I don't like to \"rate\" things per-se, but this is definitely an easy 4 / 5 for me.    It scratches many itches, like that hunger I have to play Minecraft, Vampire Survivors, or something similar.\n\nThank you creator of this game, for making something truly enjoyable for me and my friends.

Well, actually its a copy of nearly everything Terraria and Rimworld does. BUT that doesn't means its a bad game! It is actually surprising competent and has enough content to keep you invested.\n\nHalf of the gameplay loop is basically the same as Terraria, but with no verticality and with an extra horizontal axis.\nCut trees, get rocks, mine ore, build equipment so you can mine the next tier of ore.\nThe main twist is that the other half of the gameplay is Rimworld.\n\nBuild squares, put some furniture, then pay people to live there. Like Terraria, each NPC has a different skill to offer, but most can do the same chores like hauling items, putting stuff in the furnace and harvesting wood/food.\nThere are no traits like in Terraria or Rimworld, so all NPCs feel the same, they are fine with living near each other and will be happy if you fill their rooms with one of each furniture.\n\nYou can travel the world by going near the corners of the map, but that stops being useful after you find one of each biome. There aren't that many (4 total, plus the Dungeon and Pirate Village), so you can easily find some near your spawn, then add fast travel beacons to them once you unlock it.\nEach biome has two caves, one normal and one hardmode, where you can find ores, biome loot and some other stuff.\nThe map generation lacks a bit of variation, there aren't many interesting sights, if any at all, and several times I had chests and other loot containers not spawning because the map generated a lava lake across the loot room.\n\nAfter a short while, your settlement becomes self-sustaining, so there isn't much to do.\nSometimes a group of raiders shows up. They start easy, but become more and more numerous and well equipped depending of the size of your settlement and equipment. But they are still incredibly dumb.\nAll enemies in this game have the same AI: take the shortest path toward you, then either use a projectile or try to touch you.\nIf you build a wall around you settlement, you can easily force them into a death corridor. They can break walls, but they only seem to do so if they can't find a way to reach you.\n\nThere are a variety of bosses, but like with enemies, they all suffer from same-y AI. Pretty much every boss uses the same strategy, hover outside melee range, circle you, then spam projectiles.\nAnd I do mean almost every boss.\nSome bosses are easy to fight again, but others like the Pirate and the Wizard require you to find another biome, then reach the boss arena. This makes getting their different loot quite annoying.\n\nBecause of how enemies and bosses act, melee is pretty much the worse way to play. No wonder that most of the melee weapons become projectiles by the end.\nYou can bring NPCs with you to help with fights, which scale in dificulty depending of how many NPCs you bring with you, and that also means you have to mine several times more to craft equipment for them, aside the risk of them dying and you having to search for replacements.\n\nEnemies get a bit too hard on the late game, even with the last armor set, plus all armor buffs, plus food buff, plus potion buff, PLUS banner buffs, giving me over 130 armor, some enemies and bosses were still hitting more for over than 50 damage. Your max HP is 300, 350 with a food buff.\n\nYou can't destroy projectiles with a weapon and your defensive skills are limited.\nWhile on Terraria you have all that stuff like dashes, building speed, grappling hooks and wings, here you only have ONE action item.\nIt can be a short dash with cooldown, a short teleport with cooldown, running (something the boots in Terraria did just by walking) or a shield.\n\nBosses and enemies grow evermore aggressive, so dodging is really limited because of the sheer number of projectiles and enemies around you.\nYou don't have a long mercy invincibility so its easy to get caught in a barrage of attacks, or even inside the boss itself, and die (specially to the worm boss and the bat swarm boss)\nThe shield is the best deal by far, but also has it's problems: it slows you down a LOT and it defends to the direction you are walking instead of the direction you are aiming.\n\nYou are trying to shoot at the enemy and pull your shield to defend from an attack, only to get your cheeks clapped because you were moving to the left, so your character defends to the left instead of the direction you were aiming and shooting this whole time.\n\nEventually, I reached the current end game, which are Diablo-like portals you can open, and this is where my opinion of the game got a bit sour:\n\nTo get the second to last armor set, you need Slime parts. To get the slime parts, you need to open a tier 2 portal to the slime incursion, and to do that, you need one of the four essences from the tier 1 portals.\nThe cost to open the tier 2 portal is random, so you can do the first tier 1 portal and it will require the fourth tier 1 portal essence instead.\nNot being enough, there are two kinds of missions you can play, killing or mining. One slime material only drops during the killing mission, the other can only be mined on the mining mission.\n\nSo now you have 2 layers of RNG to craft the armor. Then, to craft the last armor set, you need the slime essence from the tier 2 portal, but just like that last one, there are two kinds of missions and one special material for each.\nEven if you do get the mining mission, you might not get enough for a full set, without taking into account weapons, so you might have to do 2 or more missions to get enough ore.\nAnd that is without saying that you can make weapons and armor for your villagers.\n\nOverall, good game. Has a nice base and can really improve once some quality of life update arrives and the rough edges get fixed.\nIts no Terraria, its no Rimworld and its not trying to do anything original, but is still good enough for the price.", "timestamp_created": 1697957919, "timestamp_updated": 1697992738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.74297797679901123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140260128": {"recommendationid": "140260128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077543458", "num_games_owned": 476, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1688367841}, "language": "english", "review": "Necesse is an early-access game that strikes an excellent balance between the exploration and crafting elements of Terraria and the settlement management mechanics of Rimworld. It seamlessly combines the best features from both games, resulting in a captivating and immersive experience.\n\nOne of the standout features of Necesse is its robust crafting system, reminiscent of Terraria. Players can explore, mine, and craft various items, and the game offers convenient shortcuts such as assigning keys for quick inventory management tasks like stacking items into nearby chests, sorting inventory, and looting all. This feature streamlines gameplay and allows players to focus on their main tasks, making it a truly enjoyable experience.\n\nIn addition to the crafting aspect, Necesse incorporates settlement management mechanics akin to Rimworld. Players have the ability to assign working areas, stations, and chests, which contribute to the production of valuable items. This feature is particularly useful as it enables players to delegate tasks and streamline the settlement's operations, leaving them free to concentrate on their primary objectives.\n\nThe boss music in Necesse is another noteworthy aspect of the game. While I have only encountered the first boss so far, the upbeat and captivating music greatly enhances the boss battle experience. I anticipate that subsequent boss encounters will continue to provide engaging and enjoyable musical accompaniment.\n\nAnother exciting feature of Necesse is the option to upgrade settlers, making them stronger and more capable of defending against raids and zombie attacks. This adds a strategic element to the gameplay, as players can invest in their settlers' development to ensure the survival of their settlement.\n\nFurthermore, Necesse offers seamless cooperative play with friends, allowing for enjoyable multiplayer experiences. The inclusion of a sleep function to skip time enhances the cooperative gameplay, providing convenience and further emphasizing the game's focus on enjoyable gameplay.\n\nThe game provides a diverse range of crop choices and animals to raise, adding depth to the gameplay and allowing players to engage in various farming and husbandry activities.

The bosses are challenging and they get harder as their HP gets lower, using new attacks forcing you to adapt to each phase.\n\nIt currently has a good amount of equipments to gather, a enchantment system with bonuses that makes the equipment different and you can try different builds. You can reroll the enchantment on a piece by paying the mage gold, so even if that new gear is not what you really wanted, you can keep trying to get the buffs you want (not loot goes to waste). The accessories (trinkets) have specific game-changing buffs (and you can add the enchantments too).\n\nWhat makes it stand out is the RimWorld-like village management. You can configure what your chests accept as loot (kinda like storages in RimWorld), and the NPC's will organize them for you. As an example I have a chest that accepts everything, with lowest priority, so after a dungeon run I just put it all there, and they start picking up the stuff and putting in the proper chests. The game has an option to just put everything you have on nearby chests with the same items, but watching the NPC's organizing it is more satisfying. You also set jobs in workbenches with the \"do X\", \"do until you have X\" and \"do forever\".\n\nVillagers have a profession that allows them to do specific tasks, all of them are haulers. Your farmer will cut the crop (you get 2 seeds when doing so), then replants with one of the seeds, and once he finishes the crops he goes and stores the extra seeds on the chest you set up for it. Hunter will kill animals and bring the food to your kitchen chest. They all will also pick the loot of enemies killed around the village and also store it.\n\nBuilding a village is actually useful and fun, and watching the NPC's going around doing productive stuff is very satisfying.\n\nEvery map has a underground, so you can build a ladder and access it's caves, that work like a dungeon (with specific enemies per biome) and to access it's ores. It also has proper dungeons with boss at the end. World map is (I think) infinte, divided in zones that you go exploring (or use maps to learn about specific locations, like other villages or dungeons).\n\nPerformance is great, runs perfectly on my not-so-great laptop, loading times are also very fast.", "timestamp_created": 1621102574, "timestamp_updated": 1621102574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733536303043365479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123054525": {"recommendationid": "123054525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198923319318", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 1151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 159, "last_played": 1687513591}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow this game is actually amazing, I played for 3 hours straight on my first session, Managed to start a small farm and settelement, as well as kill my first boss, This game shares a lot in common with terraria, such as different damage types, (melee, summon, magic, ranged) and armour sets with bonuses for stats, it has farming and settlement management, It has 3 layers in the world, Surface, Cavern and deep cavern, the island you start on is quite small, but you are not limited to it, you can craft a boat to travel to other islands by swimming to the edge to your world.

How much does the average Quality Hamburger cost where you get them? Ok with that in mind, how long does it take you to finish eating it, and how satisfied with it are you? For me it's about 8$, comes with a drink and fries, quite filling and isn't fast food so it always satisfies (this is an actual restaurant that makes quality burgers from real meat, not that frozen corpo trash)\n\nTake those and with a bit of leeway in between, combine them to assess the value of a game you might or might not enjoy. How much fun do you have in under an hour with it? Now two hours? Three? Did you even get past the tutorial and progress far enough to decide if the gameplay is fun? Was it as fulfilling and Satisfactory as that Quality Burger you might have gotten for the same price, or more?\n\nI AM 14 HOURS INTO THIS GAME AND I ONLY SPENT 7$\n\nIT WAS AT THIS POINT I REALIZED: IT SHOULD BE WORTH 20$ MINIMUM\n\nI'll break it down into a simple formula: It's LoZ:ALttP meets Terraria. And it is very well executed. And I'm only 14 Hours in so far. I can't wait to see what kind of shenanigans I can get into once I start checking out the \"Redstone\" of this game (I don't know what else to refer to wire logic in games now, as Todd Howard says, it just works)\n\nTo conclude I offer this parting wisdom: Try the games tutorial and beat the first boss, hire some settlers and get a small farm going. If you aren't past the two hour mark by then, you're safe to evaluate how much fun you've had vs how much $ you've spent. With that information, you can safely decide if this game is worth the price of a hamburger, or if you'd rather just get a refund, and then get a burger. I'll wager that you won't get the burger.\n\n[b][u] 11/10 would purchase again (and probably will for a friend because this has MULTIPLAYER....AND MODS) [/u][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1693486662, "timestamp_updated": 1693486727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688182175159454346", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137732866": {"recommendationid": "137732866", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961128770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1877, "last_played": 1711143739}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Amazing Game\nFor the price of this game i wouldn't even think twice you will 100% get your moneys worth and way more! \nThe game feels very complete for being a early access game and i haven't encountered any bugs,\nThe only thing the game is missing would be something to do after you beat final boss but that's it \n", "timestamp_created": 1683124214, "timestamp_updated": 1683124214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687221169471740723", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 52, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 5997, "total_negative": 299, "total_reviews": 6296}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwAAAHqx0dkE": "Mon Apr 22 23:48:15 2024"}}
