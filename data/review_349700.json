But they are doing the same thing here as they did with WarZ, both with the game and in how they treat their community (in the forums - mass forum bans, critical posts deleted). \n\nThis game is WarZ's brother, it has only a few changes. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[th]Category[/th]\n\t[th]Summary[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n        [td]GRAPHICS:[/td]\n        [td]The graphics have potential, but the lack of opimization right now makes it a challenge to get the same results as shown on the store page.  If you turn the settings to Ultra and have all the settings enabled (such as SSAO and AA), you'll get the same or similar results as shown in the store slider. You're fps will most likely drop to 10-15 when in the middle of a city or town if you are like most people, and many people claim they get around 30-50 ordinarily (when not in the thick of it), which seems reasonable and is what I get as well depending upon the area I'm in at the time.\n\nI had previously been extremely critical about the graphics and shared 2 screenshots here that were taken with what I thought, Ultra settings. I was mistaken, they weren't. So I've removed those screen shots and amended this review accordingly.\n\nI apologize to the devs and those who read my review for that mistaken criticism. \n\nIn summary, the graphics in the game [i]can[/i] be quote good, but it seems that an awful lot of optimization has yet to occur for them to be consistently realized. It's in beta, so optimization is to be expected as the game develops.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]MELEE:[/td]\n\t[td]Pretty bad. You can stand there in front of a zombie and allow it to hit you. You take no damage. I did this over and over again with about 20 zombies to test it...even taking on 3 at a time. The only time I took damage is when I had my back turned.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]LOOT: [/td]\n\t[td]There is a variety of loot to gather, but very small amount of storage space. Some items do stack, and some items can be broken down. But most of this is meaningless w/o a method to store it all and your first backpacks will be insufficient.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]BUILDINGS: [/td]\n\t[td]Quality wise, the buildings are on par with WarZ. There is very little diversity with home architecture and styling.  City buildings such as police departments, office buildings,  garages, post offices, etc. are identical to those found in WarZ. There are towers and silos with ladders, but you can't climb them (ladders don't work).[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]GUNS: [/td]\n\t[td]Gotta have them right? Some guns are found in the world, some guns can be bought in the in-game store (with real money).  You can also buy blueprints (with real money) for guns which will help give you an edge over other players. You can also buy chests which will have tier 1 guns and ammo.  [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]ZOMBIES:[/td]\n\t[td]Ahh, the most important part of a zombie game, no? Well, not in Aftermath unfortunately. Zombies just stand out in the open, still...just waiting for aggro. They do not roam, they will only move when you come into range. They aren't much of a surprise or threat.\n\nThey are super easy to kill because they do no damage. about 5 hits to the head with the average weapon (which does 20-25 dmg) and they go down. They have the identical look, sound, and behavior as WarZ. The one difference that I can think of however, is that the WarZ zeds did damage to you, and some roamed, and there were hordes. Not the case in Aftermath. Very uninspiring. [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n         [td]STABILITY:[/td]\n         [td]The game is in open beta so it is expected that there will be stability and framerate issues. But right now at this stage, it can be a chore trying to not crash when logging in or trying to get consistent fps.  Many users are complaining about the game locking up on them and having to manually restart their computers. I have experienced this 4x so far when joining a server. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/349700/discussions/0/523898291501848492/]There's a thread[/url] now about it in the forum. Some play 10-15 mins before locking up, some lock up at launch, some lock up when joining a server.\n\nIt should be noted however, that since yesterday, I have not experienced any hangups. I don't know if this issue has been resolved, if so, I'll update this review accordingly in a few days.\n\nLow framerate seems to be an issue most players are experiencing. The game clearly is not optimized yet. Even those with monster rigs that can handle most fully released, modern game are reporting they are having issues.  I run the game on ULTRA at about 10-20fps when near buildings and zombies. In the open, the fps is much better (40-50fps). But you can't stay in the open for long. You need to find buildings, people, zeds, etc.\n\nThere is a lot of work to do in this area.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]SUMMARY:[/td]\n\t[td] This game is nearly identical to WarZ with only a few changes. How much those changes set this game apart from WarZ, remains to be seen. The dev behavior and attitude towards the players, at least during the first 24 hrs of its Steam release,  has been the same as was seen in WarZ. So if you like being treated like dirt and/or want your non-violation criticism to be deleted and get banned from it...you will love these devs![/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\nBecause I felt that there just had to be [i]some[/i] differences between the games, yet didn't see any nor could I find any explained outside the game, I decided to get help from the community. Surely the devs wouldn't just \"copy/paste\" WarZ into a new name would they? That's absurd. No...there has to be some differences...\n\n[h1]Trying to find out the differences...[/h1]\n\nI actually created a thread asking for the differences. In the op I asked that no one flame the game or devs or even Warz. A nice poster responded and pointed out some of the differences.\n\nThe devs did not like that...at all. They don't want this game to be compared or contrasted to their previous mess and scam WarZ...at all.  They deleted the thread. \n\nI had heard that the devs were deleting threads and banning posters like crazy just like they did in their forums. I didn't believe at the time because I'd not seen it myself (only participating in a few threads here).  But sure enough, the claim became a reality.\n\nIf you have any experience with WarZ and were expecting...or even hoping...for a different experience and were nice enough to offer a second chance to the devs (like I was), don't. You are going to experience exactly more of the same.\n\nBad devs usually produce bad products. This is no exception.\n\n//// end original review\n\n[h1]Update[/h1]\n\n == BANNED FROM FORUM ==\n\nWow...talk about making it easy to prove my case...the devs did it rather quickly.\n\nI posted in a thread where people were bashing, out right bashing the devs and WarZ with very nasty things. Instead of following suit, I responded with a well thought out post with my experiences and my personal opinions as a result of the devs being on a ban and thread delete rampage (just like they did on their own forums with WarZ).\n\n[h1]The non-violation post[/h1]\n\nThis is the post (and dev reasoning) that got me banned:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=525102063\n\nYup...that's it. While critical of the dev's behavior and the game itself, no obscenities or personal attacks...absolutely [b]nothing[/b] that violates Steam's Forum Policies.\n\nSo what was the justification? Well, here is the dev's response who banned me from the forum for creating such a \"horrible\" and \"violating\" post:\n\n[quote=You were banned by a Aftermath developer]\nReason: \"take a break, come back when you're not so entitled. \"[/quote]\n\nThank you devs for supporting the veracity of my criticism.", "timestamp_created": 1443221485, "timestamp_updated": 1443407259, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1582, "votes_funny": 144, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929493904113769531", "comment_count": 86, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18258867": {"recommendationid": "18258867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004324063", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1445157911}, "language": "english", "review": "So let's start with the actual game, because that's what you're all here for right?\n\n\nFirst impressions are a HUGE thing, especially when you want to keep players playing and encourage other players to start playing. My first 30 minutes of this game were absolutely horrendous. I spent majority of the time running over the terrible looking map and constantly being annoyed by the same grass/flowers textures that would wave into existence 5m from my character. I managed to find several places to loot, finding small amounts of food and water and a LARGE abundance of items that are obviously meant for crafting. Here's the downside to having all those items; before you can properly use most of them, you first need to find blueprints in order to craft even the most basic of items. Want to build a campfire? Gotta find that blueprint first. They don't appear easy to find either- I looted an entire city and did not find a single blueprint of any kind. So 90% of the other items I  found were useless to me.\n\nSprinting requires no stamina, yet jumping takes it away which ultimately makes no sense. Both sprinting and jumping should decrease stamina. The zombies are a joke, with them doing so very little in the world. I stood 3m away from one without it aggroing and when it finally did aggro, it stutter-stepped everywhere and quickly de-aggroed when I started running away.\n\nThe lack of wildlife in a map that houses the perfect environment to house even birds, is quite annoying, given that animals would still be present at the time of this game. \n\nThe game itself offers no instructions in regards to things like group-making, crafting and a myriad of other important tasks. I had to do a manual search on the forums to find out how to group with someone, which turns out that you have to enter in a \"/\" command into chat in order to do so- a very annoying task.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but if you're looking to at least try it out, go for it. It's free to play, but that doesn't mean it is exempt from being so horrible.\n\n\nNOW, onto the background of the game and those behind it.\n\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Sergey Titov is a lying and scamming whackjob (just two of the many names he is known by). Before WarZ (Aftermath's predecessor), Sergey was known for his absolutely horrendous game called Big Rigs. This game is broken beyond compare and really tells you just how bad Sergey is at actually making games himself. However, it certainly isn't his worse trait.\n\nIn 2012 when the DayZ mod was so popular that those behind it decided to make a standalone game (thus properly beginning the zombie survival mmo genre), Sergey and an associate of his, \"RussianKaliber\" essentially hijacked the DayZ mod forums and put forth an idea for thier own zombie apolcapyse game. This got people interested and so began the days of WarZ.\n\nDuring its Alpha stage, WarZ looked to be a promising title, with the developers promising a large amount of very tasty features that would (in theory) make WarZ the amazing zombie game everyone had always wanted. HammerPoint Interactive (the original development team for WarZ) were selling the game on their website for as much as $60 for a Legendary package, which consisted of a large sum of GC, a Legendary user icon both in-game and on the forums and lastly, 6-months of free stronghold server hosting. There were a few other packages available for less cost but the Legendary was the most expensive. Users were told that the game would never be so cheap. We were in for the biggest surprise of the gaming century.\n\nCome official launch day on Steam (Dec 2012), majority of the playerbase were shown just how much of a scam this all was. The game was being sold for a mere $15, it had one map that was only 30% complete (if that), the vast majority of promised features weren't even present in the game, including the promised stronghold servers and the game itself was filled with more bugs than a roach nest. The developers were quiet for days, having taken a small vacation given it was Christmas time and there was no one around to fix their broken game. It was so bad that Valve stepped in and pulled it from Steam and offered refunds to all for the first time ever. \n\nAbout a week or so later, WarZ was allowed back on Steam, having amended the description on the store page to more accurately reflect the state of the game. The damage was already done though. To make matters even worse, Sergey issued a supposed \"apology\" letter which actually more blamed the customers for \"misreading\" the store page than apologising for the ginormous fuck-up he had intentionally made.\n\n\nFrom there, matters continued to get worse and worse for not only the paying customer, but also for the company and those inside it. I won't go into full detail of the events that happened in the year 2013 in regards to WarZ, so I'll do a point summary:\n\n- Private servers were eventually added (not strongholds), but contained little admin controls and people were being charged ridiculous amounts to use them\n\n- The game underwent a name change due to the copyright claim by Paramount for the movie World War Z\n\n- People were being banned by power-abusive admins and an overzealous community manager, Kewk, for saying ANYTHING negative about the game, regardless of whether it broke the rules or not.\n\n- The forums were supposedly \"hacked\" and the source code for the game leaked to the public, resulting in new forums being made and everything on the old forums conveniently lost.\n\n- Artemis Knives (the hypocrite and sellout) joined the team not long after making several videos calling out the developers on their shady actions and horrible business practices. All videos of him doing so were quickly deleted.\n\n- Kewk was caught on video verbally abusing a group of players that legitimately killed him in-game\n\n- Sergey was caught lying more and more, specifically with the Super Zombie that was told to have already been in the game since launch yet no one had managed to find it. \n\n- Eventually the Super Zombie was actually put into the game, along with several other features including cars, minor crafting, strongholds and base-building, all of which were as broken as the game itself.\n\n\nThe list goes on and on and on people. But it is all TRUE, every word. There are MANY witnesses who can attest to these events and add even more to the list should they desire. Like I said, there's just too much to explain but I hope you get the idea of just how bad Sergey Titov is and how he cannot be trusted with anything he says, the same goes with his associates.\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed the read, if you actually read it.\n\n\nEDIT (16/11/2015): The developers incompetence continues to shine with their decision to change the current desert-themed map to a forested one with the guarantee of higher FPS. I made a statement on a thread about how it wouldn't raise FPS, but lower it and mentioned how stupid they are for thinking so. I was promptly banned and Artemis stated that some people don't understand how rendering works... \n\nFor anyone who may or may not understand WHY a forested map would give you less FPS, let me explain it to you. Every tree is considered an object within the game, given that players can collide with them. Now not only can a player collide with trees, but lighting does as well, which results in the engine having to determine shadows and lighting collisions for EVERY tree placed within the world. \n\nThe only way they would raise the FPS with this idea is if they made every tree a simple texture with no collision effects. No tree would be an object and the game would be even more hilarious.\n\nPlease educate yourself Artemis.", "timestamp_created": 1443589946, "timestamp_updated": 1447656318, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4045, "votes_funny": 731, "weighted_vote_score": "0.928411722183227539", "comment_count": 170, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18227302": {"recommendationid": "18227302", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960826568", "num_games_owned": 888, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 393, "last_played": 1448781936}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Romero's Aftermath[/h1]\nRomero's Aftermath is an open world survival horror action game similar to other games such as DayZ, H1Z1, & Miscreated.   The game offers both player vs player (PvP) as well as player vs environment (PvE) in first and third-person views.  This is a survival game so expect to scavenge the large world map for resources while crafting items such as weapons, gear, and defensive structures. \n\n[h1]History Repeats[/h1]\nThe game was announced as being developed to both succeed and to make amends for the abysimal title Infestation: Servial Stories (ISS) formally known as WarZ.  The business model for WarZ/ISS was perhaps the worst I have seen in gaming whereby one had to play and level up multiple players to counter the real $$$ transactions to respawn or be forced to log out for awhile to wait for a respawn timer.  \n\nWarZ/ISS was without a doubt a pay-to-win (PTW) whereby one could buy and bank weapons to later respawn fully geared as wallet commandos to lay waste to players with limited funds. Later updates made changes to this system but the publisher limited these changes to maximize profits.  Another troubling issue was very poor support to fight hackers.  These changes failed to meet consumer expectations and ultimately the game was a complet failure. We (gamers) were told the publisher refussed to further invest in ISS and forbid further developemnet which led to the developement of Aftermath. \n\n[h1]The Aftermath[/h1]\nAftermath is not WarZ or ISS but it did not fall far from the tree. As you will see from my review there are some good elements to this game that could make it shine but unfortunately the bad tend to cast a very dark shadow.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\nControl: Typical first/third-person shooter very similar to H1Z1 and Miscreated.\n\nEnvironment:  The map is huge with lots of camps and towns to explore and scavenge.  Towns get over run and there is a meter to see what percent of zombies have been destroyed. There are also safe zones where you can buy supplies, ammo, and weapons.  You can also bank/unbank items on PvP servers in safezones. \n\nGraphics: The graphics fall in between ISS and H1Z1.  This is no AAA title and as such will be a downgrade in graphics from DayZ and H1Z1. But this is a FTP indie developed game so graphics are what would be expected, good but not great.\n\nFramerate: The game plays smooth at least on my high end gaming system.  For an early access (EA) game and my frame rate is much better than DayZ and about the same as H1Z1 with an average frame rate in the high 60's with lows in the 50's and highs as much as 100 fps with every setting maxed out.   \n\n[h1]Good & Bad[/h1]\nCombat: The combat system is both good and bad.  The good is that hits require one to aim for head shots (HS) or you will have to hit players/zombies 20 times before they die which is a nice feature although 20 hits seems like overkill. The bad is that you can hit a zombie or player in melee from 10 feet away.\n\nZombie AI: I like that you can line of sight (LoS) zombies so that when you are low health you do not have to run for miles to lose them. Zombies afterall have very low intelligence with the one basic need to feed.  The bad is that currently you can stand on a something like a crate and kill hordes of zombies without taking damage. Hit response from the AI is better than other survival games, but that isn't saying much considering most survival games' combat systems combined with fps drops and lag make them horrible.  But at least in this game, you will not take hits while the zombie is facing the other dirrection like you do in the other survival horror games mentioned above. \n\nSurvival Challenge:  I liked the fact that you become infected which you must treat or die.  Of course it would be awesome to become a playable zombie, but that is wishful thinking.  However infection has little to no warning and sadly seems to be the only survival facter outside of zombies and other players.  There are no harsh weather conditions that I can tell.  \n\nCrafting System: You can craft just about everything from meals to a fortified base. You must find/learn patterns to craft items, even basic things like a bandage or building a fire which can be problematic to survival.  In five hours of gameplay I found seven patterns and none of them were needed for basic survival.  You do gain health back from eating food but it is at a very slow rate.  Discovery is a much better system for crafting although this one would not be so bad if basic things like a fire and bandages were known at the start. I should mention that once you learn to craft something you will always know it. \n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\nEconomy:  The rate at which you find or earn money by selling items is horrible.  I think I found $30 in-game-currency (igc) in my first three hoursof gameplay.  There where over 100 people on my server so it could have all been looted prior to me getting to locations, but I expect this to be the norm.  After about five hours of game play and selling an unwanted item (not needed for crafting) I had close to $300 igc, still not enough to buy a bottle of water at $430 igc.  Now if the zombies were lootable, and perhaps they are meant to be and are just bugged or will be later, it would be much easier to get money. But after learning more about the business model of this game, I doubt it.\n\n[h1]The Ugly[/h1]\nBusiness Model:  The business model at first glance seems like a great improvement with the only items one can purchase with real $$$ is permanent skins.  Rare skins are bought through crates similar to Counter-Strike and H1Z1 while more common skins can be purchased by both real $$$ and ingame currency. \n\nAfter playing for awhile you figure out there is a real $$$ conversion system that enables wallet commandos to buy weapons and supplies. You may think that isn't so bad but when you look at the over inflated prices of a bottle of water selling for $430 igc and weapons as much as $3,000 igc you begin to wonder why after 5 hours of game play and selling items I still didn't have enough igc to buy a bottle of water.  \n\nThere is a purpose behind these inflated prices, this business model forces you to buy and convert money to buy items so the developers can make money off of little to no innovative concepts. Rather than making money off of cool game features, the developers intend to line their pockets by charging real money for the bare essentials needed to play this game competitively in PvP. Off course you can farm the items if you intend to farm for 8-12 hours a day prior to joining PvP so you are stocked up on weapons, ammo, and medkits. \n\nAlthough this business model doesn't do mush to break a PvE game, in PvP being able to convert money quickly to buy weapons, ammo, and supplies over having to earn them in game can be game breaking for those that enter with limited supplies.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n-Decent Graphics (not AAA)\n-Control\n-Free-to-play\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n-Money accrual is punishing\n-Crafting patterns\n-EA bugs/crashes\n-Business Model is PTW by design for PvP (little to no affect on PvE servers).\n\n[h1]Recommendation[/h1]\nI wanted to believe the developers and support this game but the business model is deceptively a PTW to line the developer's pockets.  Until which time changes are made to either stop converting real $$$ for IGC or weapons are no longer sold, I cannot recommend Aftermath as much as I wanted to.  \n\nIf you like survival games and do not already own H1Z1, Miscreated, or DayZ and only want to play on a PvE server then give it a try as it is FTP and BM does not affect PvE.  However, if you want to play competitive PvP, stay far away unless you plan on spending money over and over again for a competitive advantage.  There are plenty of other games in this genre to play that offer balanced gameplay without the PTW BM.     \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527631789", "timestamp_created": 1443386489, "timestamp_updated": 1443664419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 431, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.883514106273651123", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57738430": {"recommendationid": "57738430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079320250", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1457192662}, "language": "english", "review": "In my steam library.

They lure you in with a claims of fun times, awesome base building mechanics (Which they still even now advertise as part of the game, failing to mention it is behind a pay wall) and seperate servers for PvE and PvP. Then they take away the base building. Then they bring it back and ensure us that it is not going anywhere (Still have a screenshot of the post they put up in game stating exactly that). So I dropped some real world money into buying parts and tools to build my base, and proceed to build an epic base. Then, even after ensuring us that base building isn't going anywhere, they hide it behind a pay wall called legendary. So...I say screw it. And pay for that too. Now to get back to my base building. Spend a few days and most of my parts and tools to build it. Then 2 weeks later, I log in and my base is gone. I check my inventory for the parts and tools that I spent real money on and ... nope. They are just gone. I contact the devs through the forums to express my feelings and see if they would be willing to at least return the stuff I paid real world money for, and they don't respond. At all. So I try and contact them through the game, using the option in the menu to reach them. Guess what? It takes you to a blank page. I used to enjoy this game, and probably still would, However, the devs of this game are so terrible that they have managed to run me and about 15-20 other players that I used to play with nightly away. The new map sucks and Legendary is just a rip off, obviously. They screwed me out of my money with lies and won't even give me back the items I payed for in game. They put out unfinished game after unfinished game and expect us, the players to keep tolerating it. I know it's free to play (Even so, it'll leave you feeling like you want them to pay you for beta testing this crap... oh wait... It's in full release) and if you can't afford another Zombie game, then check it out. It will be fun for a short while but you will tire of the same grind with no pay out (Base building, Community buidling). If you have a little money, Get a real zombie survival game like DayZ or Miscreated and avoid Free Reign (Or whatever they changed their name to this time to try and cover up that they are the same people making the same shitty game over and over). Fuck Sergie. Fuck Artemis. And what ever you do, Don't be suckered in by their newest turd they have dropped on us, Shattered skies. I promise, In the long run... They will abandon that game too.

Today, I got to my first in-game store inside of a safezone. I can sell a compass I managed to scavenge for $13. To buy the same compass from the store costs $1540. A bottle of water costs hundreds of dollars. Generally, any piece of junk you can find in the world is costing thousands of in-game dollars; but after nearly 10 hours of gameplay you will only manage to find about $30-40.

I simply saw Free To Play and though eh why not... I played for maybe about 45 mins and decided not to proceed anymore for the reasons below.\n\nThe game is boring. Simple as that.\n\nThe zombies off 0 challenge.\n\nThere is nothing to really collect or rather should I say nothing worth while to collect. There were about 50 cars where I spawned in at. The cars had the exact same loot. I started with a 24 pack and had it full within 2 mins of playing the game. I tend to do this on most games so it didnt really seem like a big deal until I continued looking for items. They were all the same. You could easily disassemble them into crafting shit but HOW? I mean you take broken glass right clikc and not its glass pieces. You take Drain X and right click now magicall you have chemicals and plastic... There is no sense in making a craft game if you dont have reasonable reasons to the crafting mechanics lol. \n\nI couldn't create an ax without the blue print. Then I would need tool, wood, parts, and a tool box... WHAT! i searched for 30 mins to find 2 parts and i would need 2 more of those and then the rest of this shit just to make and axe.... Mind you I would need the axe to get wood as well. In most game it is a little dumb to attack a tree to get wood but it makes more sense than tell the user, \"well we arent going to stock your spawn with anything even resembling something useful in the game.\"\n\nI tried for 45 mins to find something good about this game, unfortunately the only thing i really found good was that it seemed pretty ..... smooth.... i guess. I mean i never had any stuttering of the screen. The zombies seemed to move right though it was kinda wierd their attacks going from above my head to the ground lol..... Odd that they have to sway their entire body just to attack. And the fact that every time i attacked the zombie it bounced back so in the 45 mins where i killed about 10 or more zombies i got hit 2 times. And that was when i found a better weapon that my hands or the knife i was given off the start lol.

First off, I played PvE, which makes this game have potential. Good amount of zombies to kill, crafting is there, building is there, so it's like a mix of L4D meets Rust.  But this game has much to work on, animations for one, the Zombies walk as if they are in a strobe light. You can easily kill a zombie 1 on 1 with fists or a knife just by croutching.   \n\nNow this is really where the game gets really bad, You can enter forts or bases that are clearly military ( nothing but military zombies and fortifications inside ) but yet not find a single gun, or even ammo. Also Zombies don't carry a single thing, how is that possible?

Naturally I can't recommend it anymore.\n\nIf you found my review helpful please come say hi on my stream:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/mr_w4rpath", "timestamp_created": 1533726027, "timestamp_updated": 1533726027, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683443129062652588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18966853": {"recommendationid": "18966853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022760354", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1448621043}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely amazing!

It is a blatant copy/paste of WarZ code and assets. Zombies come at you like they do in silent hill, except it's not intended. They lag and warp and stand right in front of you doing no damage. The loot system is one of the worst things I've ever encountered. You will spend hours collecting rubbish and maybe the chance of finding a blueprint to combine said rubbish into some crappy item. The world itself is unimaginative. It's a gigantic desert with some cities and camps here and there. It's ugly, and that alone would make me stop playing the game even if it was better.\n\nIt's the same developers. The only thing they did was drop the Publisher. Sergey, the \"master of games\" is still in control of the entire operation. Artemis \"Sellout\" Knives now has a 'developer' tag  and spends most of his lonely existence on the forums and replying to reviews making sure anyone who thought it was good gets their balls fondled.\n\n For anyone who knows his past, he was just a random streamer who thought too much of himself. He wore a ragged old pimp hat that looked fucking stupid, and his neckbeard appearance just made me want to facepalm. In his mind he was the greatest thing to happen to WarZ. He made videos and posts about how corrupt the developers were and how bad the game was, until one day he decided to switch sides and become a \"Developer\". Unfortunately, the only thing he can do is stream himself exploiting in video games and pretend to be a \"personal chef\". (we all know he actually lived with his parents) He is in no shape or form a developer, coder, or anything that actually requires technical skill. It's just a tag, probably becauase Sergey wanted him to stick around and feel important.\n\nThe only reason it's worth downloading is so you can give it a negative review and save the world from this abomination.", "timestamp_created": 1445096061, "timestamp_updated": 1445096061, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 38, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680144906044006348", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61557379": {"recommendationid": "61557379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123978216", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1451697539}, "language": "english", "review": "Why is this in my library? i never played this game. somethings fishy here.", "timestamp_created": 1578547172, "timestamp_updated": 1578547172, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679319143295288086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18471611": {"recommendationid": "18471611", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995149184", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1444837054}, "language": "english", "review": "Another boring survival game.

After my game finished downloading I launched the game and registered, then it crashed. I didn't think nothing of it and tried launching the game again, only to find out it wouldn't let me because the game was still apparently running.. when it clearly wasn't. So after a good five or so minute wait, it finally let me back on the game. I spawned in and immediatley crashed again. After crashing I had to wait another five or so minutes and then finally it let me back on. I spawned in this time without crashing only to find one of the most horrible looking games I have every played. It is clunky and the looting system is nothing to write home about. I set all that aside and decided to try to make the best of it. I ran into the nearest town, found a gun with no ammo (even though it said I had ammo, it wouldn't let me shoot) and ran into two guys. I had aquired a bar of soap while looting before meeting these two gentlemen and decided to try to make friends with them. I told them that if they could spare me some supplies, I could give them a good time and drop this fine bar of soap I had just found. They yelled some spanish words at me and started beating me. I ran away to try to evade these guys and another random fellow also yelling spanish words at me joined the chase. I ran for a good solid minute until the unthinkable happened... I crashed. Getting a black screen but still able to hear what was happening in the game, I listened on helplessly while these 3 banditos stabbed me to death with their rusty shanks.\n\nTL;DR Don't bother with this game. Through some form of witch craft they managed to make an even worse game compared to WarZ or ISS despite this game still being in beta.
