The core gameplay loop, sound design and visual aesthetic just get under the skin and call you back over and over. I don't know the current state of the modding community but this game is prime fodder for great mod fun, though I suppose you could play DayZ Winter Chernarus if you can live without the aesthetics and want to jump over things.\n\nThere are a LOT of complaints about how the devs are slow in the story chapters, or some rambling on and on and on, whingeing about how they didn't get what they paid for, etc etc etc - just ignore them - either the Wintermute or the Survival mode are worth full price standalone, but I would get both as they do compliment eachother - even at 40 maplebucks, and if you get this on sale man it's a steal.

Lowering the difficulty makes items so abundant that the game lacks any real challenge. Increasing the difficulty makes hostile wildlife so common that it becomes annoying even when you know how to deal with them. Using a custom difficulty disables perk progression. Survival mode feels like it has a backwards difficulty curve and lacks significant motivators to explore once you have obtained the best gear, while story mode is too short to engage with any of the crafting mechanics. Survival mode is locked to permadeath even on custom difficulties for some reason, yet in story mode you can save wherever and whenever you want. The game can be harsh and unforgiving if you don't know where to look, but the map is fixed and item spawns are somewhat predictable making the difficulty highly dependent on how well you know the map.

Managing your sleep, thirst, hunger, and temperature, are the deciding factors in your breakthroughs success. This does nitty gritty survival like few games rarely do. Want to go explore a part of the map? You better wear enough layers, bring enough water, a snack or two, enough material to start a fire, and tools you may need while exploring to search of fend off wildlife. Also, keep your eye on the weather because if a sudden snow storm come sup you are in a heap of trouble. Only in the later game when you have crafted enough warm clothes out of animal skins, collected enough ammo and weapons, and supplied yourself with weeks of food and water, can you afford to venture out in to the countryside with some ease. That doesn't mean you are invincible though, keep an eye out for bears or packs of wolves that are looking hungry. \n\nThink about what it would be like if you were alone with hundreds of miles of wilderness between you and civilization. How truly isolated you would feel. Knowing that no one will hear your cries for help, your rumbling stomach, no one will know or care when you take your last breath.

In the popular games of this genre, it takes between maybe 5% and 10% of the playtime to feed yourself, in The Long Dark, it's more like 70%.\nWhat makes it even worse is that TLD's mechanics are not very deep, the task of feeding yourself or any other task is always very simple, very straight forward, and VERY repetitive. To make things even worse, in all popular games, the longer you play in a savefile, the more you PROGRESS, which implies that you become more efficient, and need to [i]waste[/i] less time taking care of your various survival meters. But once again The Long Dark takes a completely unexplainable approach, the worst one possible, of making a player LESS efficient the longer he is in a world, because of the finite nature of tools and ressources, something that is a very questionable design decision, but that I don't have time to go into details about here.\n\nIn a normal survival game, you spend a little bit of time feeding yourself, and the rest of your time either making better tools that will allow you to spend even less time feeding yourself, or do whatever else you want in the sandbox environment.\nIn The Long Dark, you spend basically all your time feeding yourself, during which your tools slowly break down, at which point you will have to spend even MORE time feeding yourself (or obtaining water, heat or rest).\n\nThe other gaping flaw in TLD is that there is nothing to do. Just compare the game worlds of players who spent 10 thousand days in a minecraft survival world, with the save file of someone who spent 10 thousand days in the long dark.\nAny old minecraft world will be filled with wonders, technically impressive automatic farms, beautiful architecture, inventive and fun projects.\nAn old TLD world will be empty, souless and dead, the only things a player can \"build\" are cursed looking storage depots, where all the items are on the floor, because The Long Dark is like Minecraft's \"Special\" little cousin, who still hasn't added a recipe to craft THE CHEST after 10 years.\nThere is nothing to do in the long dark, nothing to build, no progression to work towards beyond items that can be aquired fairly early like the bow and animal hide clothing. \"Surviving\" long periods of time is a matter of patience and how much of your time you are willing to waste killing the exact same bear or deer NPC over and over again thousands of times over.\nAs such The Long Dark just ends up being a busywork/timewasting simulator, the mechanics are shallow, and surviving is TEDIOUS and TIME CONSUMING, not difficult. And this is a massive problem.\n\nFor the other half of what this game sometimes try to be, a challenge, something like Tetris, where death is certain, and it's only a matter of how long you last, well The Long Dark fails once again.\nHere it fails because death is not certain, surviving is not difficult, just tedious, it's as simple as doing the same repeated actions over and over again, the same 3 or 4 actions, thousands of times over.\n\nSo after that what remains to the game? Being an exploration game, or immersive atmospheric game?\nWell it also fails at being those, the exploration aspect is strongly harmed by the maps being finite, once you've seen everything, well you've seen everything, and there isn't a lot to see. On top of that most of what you will see is the same assets copy and pasted in different locations, again not that interesting to explore. The only sort of thing that goes in the sense of exploration are the few unique handcrafted location, but the maps have been made as obstacle courses, and you need to spend so much time just gathering ressources to survive, that you travel at a snail's pace across the maps, almost completely killing the exploration aspect by itself.\n\nAs for being an immersive experience, a sort of walking simulator, it has great potential to do that, because of it's flawless artstyle, but once again it manages to fail at that, because of low quality graphics, namely for the most part low resolution textures, far too low resolution for the artstyle to compensate, that and other small graphical issue (terrible antialiasing technology, cloned identical trees next to each other, repeating textures on water, half loaded distant terrain) all instantly pull you out of the experience, and kill any immersion that could have existed.\n\n[h1]Conclusion [/h1]\nAnd it's a big shame, the game has a lot of potential, and it would be an enjoyable and succesful game if it only did a few things differently, but as it stands, it's a game that basically fails at everything, it almost fails at being a game, as soon as you manage to stabilize your situation, you realise you could survive forever, then you realise there is nothing to do except surviving, and then you see how shallow the game mechanics are, at which point the vast majority of players stop playing the game and never come back. They have a positive opinion when they leave, they remember it was pretty, or that it made them feel like a lone survivor in the frozen polar regions, but they still leave, and they still don't come back. Because there is nothing to do, and the only things the game offer is just mindless repetitive tedious work. The other category of players, the \"core fanbase\", \"hardcore players\", \"the TLD community\", are those who really want to love the game, but can't, because there is no gameplay to love about the game, so instead every veteran player has to scratch their heads to find artificial rules and challenges in a desperate plea to find some fun in the game. You can see that with custom challenges like \"NOGOA\" (no regeneration, hardest difficulty possible). Again this is because this game offers basically nothing except shallow mechanics, where survival is not difficult or skill based, merely tedious, time consuming and with a heavy luck/RNG component.\n\nWith proper guidance I am confident the game could be fixed, but considering how old the game is, and that the team behind it never discovered the issues holding the game back, or if they did, for whatever reason did not fix them, I have very high doubts that the game will ever overcome it's fundamental design issues without external interference.\nAnd so the game is doomed to be fondly remembered yes, but also a game that no one plays and that all new players quickly abandon.\nAnd it's a shame because it does not have to be that way.", "timestamp_created": 1706603611, "timestamp_updated": 1706603711, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599682211875915527", "comment_count": 64, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159662303": {"recommendationid": "159662303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328774132", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2076, "last_played": 1712051135}, "language": "english", "review": "honestly one of the best survival games out there. your biggest enemy is not the pack of wolves or bears hunting you, but it's the weather and time. i recommend playing this game in stalker difficulty, it really makes you feel like you're desperately scavenging for supplies alone in a eerie world blanketed in snow and littered with frozen bodies on ever corner of the map with the howls of wolves and growls of bears stalking in the shadows waiting to maul you to death.", "timestamp_created": 1709358774, "timestamp_updated": 1709358774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587704777717590332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160079615": {"recommendationid": "160079615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069981230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 26381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 25883, "last_played": 1713382905}, "language": "english", "review": "chill game. \r\n\r\n\r\n(get it?)", "timestamp_created": 1709871171, "timestamp_updated": 1709871171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582950234413146973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161701650": {"recommendationid": "161701650", "author": {"steamid": "76561199157043205", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1712972432}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, but not for everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1711688964, "timestamp_updated": 1711688964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582768857479095459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159350021": {"recommendationid": "159350021", "author": {"steamid": "76561199365347657", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 99, "playtime_at_review": 2723, "last_played": 1712939492}, "language": "english", "review": "A very challenging survival game\\expirience that doesnt provides a lot of room for error however making learning the game and how all of its mechanics work in unison very rewarding. \nYou will die.

Not just that, but they also had the audacity to respond to players who complained about their saves getting deleted by this dlc with the equivalent of a middle finger: \"You'll have to adapt\", \"We didn't expect anyone to survive that long\"\n\nThis is all worsened by the current state of the game. There are so many ridiculous limitations, that seem designed to stop you from surviving at any cost, not by posing realistic threats, but entirely artificial ones:\n-Tools break ridiculously quickly You're seriously telling me a hatchet can't break a bush without loosing a twentieth of its durability? What the hell is it made of? Plastic? \n-You are completely incapable of climbing a 30cm tall rock to save your life. Considering how frequently you need to escape from predators this is ridiculous\n-The way that predators behave is just plain lazy, as another review says the wolves literally start moving in serpentines as soon as you are aiming at them, as if they understand what you're doing while the rest of the time they just run in a straight line towards you.\n-Another annoying thing is the lack of such obvious survival utilities. Why can't you sharpen a long stick to stop a wolf from getting closer, why can't you use sticks to start a fire INDOORS, why can you not sleep on a couch to save your life.\n-Improvised tools and weapons are completely lacking, if you need a forge to make a knife, thats not an improvised knife, its just a bad one. An improvised knife would be something like a sharpened piece of metal or maybe even glass. Those can be made without a goddamn forge.\n-The status effects are also implemented miserably. You get hypothermia, you need to stay above freezing for 12h. Ok so far so good, if you get 11:59 done, but start freezing for 1 second you get to start over. Sprained a wrist/ankle wait 2h or use a bandage to cure it INSTANTLY.\n-The stockpiling of firewood is just awful. There's no reasonable reason, why you shouldn't be able to break down a recently fallen tree or *gasp* cut down a tree yourself and dry it indoors, but that would make wood too abundant so you can only use wood you find just lying around on the ground.\n\nAll of these compound to make the gameplay experience decidedly ... meh.

Ironically I have the most fun with this game when I'm sitting at a campfire, repairing my gear, and keeping my food up with other resources. It's simple, but effective. But everything outside of that is just pressing forward and walking in long, out of the way paths because going up a hill directly will result in injury most of the time. \n\nNot every game needs you to be doing *something* at any given time, but with how large the different maps are, and how there isn't really anything going on, you sure do feel like you're just walking alone across a frozen landscape with absolutely nothing to do. There just isn't really anything fun about it, I feel like I'm being punished constantly without having a real challenge element. There isn't really a skill ceiling, or you don't really get \"better\" at the survival the more you play. You just get more stuff to carry and that in of itself makes the game harder.

That said, the game looks back to about 6 years (only counting time since steam release) of steady development and big updates introducing new maps, mechanics and reworks. \n\nKnowing that this game originated as a Kickstarter project however I cannot help but wonder how well the whole development has been planed and scheduled from the start. If you fail to understand my reasoning maybe try to ask yourself questions in the context of; as a upcoming game development team, if your way to fund the development of your own game involves using Kickstarter and going early access at an early development stage:\n- Would you promise said story mode you know will take you over 6 years to complete?\n- Would you be willing to split your attention on creating a Sandbox experience and a compelling story mode? \n- Would you expect everyone funding the project to be as patient to wait as long as it takes you to fullfill your many promises?\nAlso viewing the development from a financial angle:\n- Could you ensure you will never run out of funds to finish the game even without a lot of early access sales?\n- Would it even financially pay off to make due to your promises, if most of your potential players cannot be sold the game at fullprice at the end?\n\nThe game seemed to fund its own development largely by the quite substantial early access success. Now times got hard for most studios and everyone really, the game is still in an unfinished state with the suposedly largest chapter, which has to tie every loose end(there are a lot) missing and recent sales are probably too little to cover ongoing costs. Hinterlands solution was releasing a DLC they probably started working on quite a while ago, since they probably realized that paid DLCs would be necessary to fund their future projects. \n\nSo how did realeasing a ealy access DLC for an ealy access game turn out for them you ask? Taking a look at the DLC page about 33% Negative Reviews kind of bad which by steam standarts is enough to turn total review evaluation to \"mixed\" keeping quite some players(mostly talking about myself there really) from buying it. The pretty botched release with bugged loot tables and corrupted saves(appearently) did not make it better.\n\nAnalyzing the way this game has been developed and especially financed will have you learn quite some pitfalls that come with ambitious projects, inexperienced teams, using trust as a currency to buy early access sales.\n\nI cannot recommend this game right now, not because it is bad, but because I lost trust into the dev team to actually create the complete full release, which early access is suposed to produce. If they are yet capable to produce said full release, I might actually recommend the game to people who like sandbox/exploration games.\n", "timestamp_created": 1706897841, "timestamp_updated": 1706897841, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540816307067871094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159853583": {"recommendationid": "159853583", "author": {"steamid": "76561199507113717", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 507, "last_played": 1705586935}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game, made me hate wolves", "timestamp_created": 1709572581, "timestamp_updated": 1709572581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540758013725280762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160485664": {"recommendationid": "160485664", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988208312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4242, "last_played": 1710311667}, "language": "english", "review": "WARNING: SWEET BABY, INC ADJACENT\r\n\r\nI figure that's the best shorthand for what to expect without having to read this whole review.  I don't think SBI actually worked on the game, but they'd be proud of whoever did.  If that sort of thing doesn't bother you, disregard.  \r\n\r\n**SPOILERS**\r\nThis review is for the single player campaign Wintermute.  I haven't played multiplayer, but since the problem is the story, and the actual gameplay is fantastic, if you're not planning to play Wintermute I actually *would* recommend the game.  \r\n\r\nIt's broken up into chapters, and the first two give little to no hint at the sudden hard turn the story takes in the third one.  If I had known the direction it was going to go in I definitely wouldn't have bought it, so hopefully I can save other people the same experience.  As briefly as possible: the first two chapters are about two people separated in the wilderness trying to find each other and get medicine to an isolated community.  The third chapter, bizarrely, is about what I figure the writers must have thought was feminism.  I'd argue it's the opposite, but that's a whole other conversation.  In the first two chapters you play the male character and in the third you play the female character.  People often say that a story with a female protagonist doesn't have to be ABOUT having a female protagonist, and that focusing on the character's sex is itself a sexist act.  I agree... someone tell these developers.  I don't think the sudden change in the story just happens because the player character changes, though.  It's such an extreme departure that I wouldn't be surprised to learn the devs hired a DEI consulting firm between the releases of chapters 2 and 3.  The character herself is great, in fact.  Even though it's hard not to notice she's a research scientist while her partner is a big dumb guy, the real issue is that the game's whole universe suddenly becomes about her gender.  With one exception, all the characters in the chapter are female.  Despite being 5'7\" or so, the player character is more physically capable than her large, male counterpart and is able to carry grown men on her back for miles with little effort.  I know, it's not that bad so far, right?  Hang on, I'm getting there.  There's a subplot about an abusive husband.  Not physically abusive, but neglectful and maybe verbally abusive, which is presented as a justification for her letting him die and *embarking on a crusade to murder every man she meets as punishment for making women feel small.*  That's not sarcasm, that's her explicit, stated goal.  This isn't the protagonist, to be clear, and she's not supposed to be a good guy.  She's also not presented as a murderous lunatic, though, and her quest is treated with sympathy and some mild disapproval.  The protagonist literally says to her, kindly and sensitively, \"I'm not judging you.\"  That alone is... really something.  Anyway, I don't doubt she'll get her comeuppance in the final episode, but the point is that the game suddenly completely revolves around this kind of sociopolitical rumination and messaging, and even if weren't morally questionable it's still a radical change from the game it had been, and by that time it's WAY too late to get a refund.  If that's your cup of tea, have at it.

Long pauses from mediocre voice-overs with ridiculous dialogue that thinks its way too clever in some places (it's not) and just plain childish in others. All while just flowing horribly when the player asks questions. The characters talk like everything happened so long ago, but it was literally just the night before. The blind woman calls this night before the \"night of lights\". I don't think I need to go on...\n\nWith game-play, everything is just way too slow. Walking, starting fires, looting, literally everything. The game does not respect your time at all. Take your eye off your food and it burns because you wanted to repair or craft something while you wait. The map seems small but travel is excruciating, and they constantly make you walk back and forth over and over.\n\nThe main draw to this game is searching POI's, and it is just painful. It takes forever to open anything for no reason other than to waste time. Conservatively, I'd say 80% of all the cabinets/drawers/desks are empty. There is literally a bank vault you have to find the combo for and everything in there is empty. The only thing inside a LOCKED vault are safety deposit boxes that you need more keys to unlock. On top of all that, weight is constantly a problem, so most of the items you find end up being useless anyway.\n\nStarting out in the story is not balanced well at all. You are instantly put in a position where you are dying of thirst, hunger, and hypothermia all at once. It is basically tailored for you to just run through and get to the first town as fast as possible so you can be inside and drink that sweet toilet water. The weather mechanic is fine when there are pre-made structures for you to constantly go too, but staying warm outside is just impossible. You also can't build your own bases or structures, so there is no chance for creativity.\n\nHow people can like this even in sandbox survival makes no sense to me. There isn't anything to do except loot POI's for mostly useless things. As much as the game wants it to be true...staying alive in this game isn't difficult, its just annoying and not fun.\n\nTLDR: The story is essentially just a bunch of fetch quests while you have to eat, drink, and stay warm. And doing any of those 3 (plus just walking) is boring and takes forever. And the story is filled with a bunch of boring nonsense.

Permadeath is a core element of the sandbox survival mode. You can have a bad start and die quickly or you skillfully manage to scramble together some supplies and find a shed to live another day. You can have a good start but you will think it's because of your prowess and you will bolster an unjustified self-esteem which will lead you to make a bad call days later and die miserably. It's hard to strike such a balance. Yes, there is some luck involved, but it never feels like the whole thing is out your hands. In fact, the more you learn about the game, its interlocking mechanics and its map, the better you get at surviving. There is an in-game RPG-lite progression system, e.g. the more fires you make, the better you get at it. You can also read books to get better at a specific skill. However, the real progression happens organically by simply learning the game which imo is the best progression there is. Even making it only a week into the game will give you a whole lot of satisfaction. \n\nSo, mechanically, the game is superb. But it is only in combination with the technical side that this game supersedes most other survival games. The music has some 80ies Carpenter vibes, very unintrusive, almost meditative, but then you realize that it's actually foreboding. The graphics are stylized but still very much grounded in reality, resulting in something eerily beautiful. The screenshots won't do it justice, you have to experience it in real time. Slowly scour the landscapes with the snow quietly scrunching or a frozen lake squeaking beneath your feet, hearing wolves howl in the distance while the clouds are racing by due to strong winds. In your shelter you sit by a crackling fire to warm up food and melt some snow or even indulge in the luxury to cook some herbal tea. Then going to bed and it feels cozy just as it would in real life after a long day in the winter cold. The next morning you awake and while you're still wondering why it's still dark, you hear a gale rattling the walls. A step outside and you can't see past a few meters, everythings white and grey and windy and loud. And what was that electrical buzzing during the night all about? Instead of staying in and risking cabin fever, you dare to venture out and soon you find yourself scouring for loot in an abandoned dam facility with only your gas lantern and some matches as a source of light, and you go past the frozen body deeper and deeper into the building, forward, forward, to live another day. \n\nWith all that being said, and with a short recommendation to also buy the DLC because it gives you many, many new items for the survival sandbox mode, I must say that [b] there are some glaring design flaws [/b] that can be very aggravating at times and almost made me go with a negative rating: \n\n- houses in villages have very similar interiors but some of it is randomized which results in logical errors (e.g. a house with kitchen, bathroom, a huge children's room with an oversized cradle but no actual bedroom or even bed for the parents\n\n- the voiceover of your character is randomized which results in silly situations: you pick up money, literally worthless of course except as a mediocre fire starter and your character yells out: \"This stuff will come in handy!\". Moments later you find a huge can of maple syrup which is not only food but would also be a triumph IRL to soothe your mind. But what does your character say? \"Must be good for something!\" It's just lazy coding really. Specific items should include and exclude specific remarks. \n\n- the inventory model of your character is a clown with white cheeks and a bright red nose. When I first saw this, I quit the game because it was so immersion-breaking. It looks like a placeholder but then again, it's in the game for years now. Why have a rudimentary body model anyway? You don't need it. \n\n- interactivity with the world can feel very limited at times: e.g. you can't break down a wooden chair into firewood without having an axe. And even when you have found an axe, you can't cut down the wooden railing of a mountain trail which resulted in a very stupid, entirely unrealistic situation where I had hunkered down in a cabin on a hill. The next day when I wanted to go back down a wolf attacked me and I had to flee back up again. Now, I was wounded, I had no more water and it was very cold even inside the cabin. There were wooden (!) beds and shelves and there was meters upon meters of wooden railing just outside the cabin but I couldn't interact with it. No firewood means not melting snow either. No chance my character would take at least a bit of snow and melt it inside the cabin or just eat it.

My only gripes with it are something only technically considered DLC/Additional content.\n\nAs a survival game, The Long Dark is unimaginably detailed to almost every extent -- hardly rivaled by anything else. The atmosphere is so very stylized and yet unimaginably beautiful. On nights where the Aurora shimmers in the sky, it's hard not to stare in awe.\n\nThe Long Dark is very good at being challenging. Surviving in The Long Dark is hard because you have a very limited amount of items you can keep on you -- you are virtually forced to be nomadic, as any base you create will slowly get isolated of items; there are no loot respawns.\n\nWhere I personally see beauty in The Long Dark's Survival Mode is in the way it interacts with the player. The settings and problems you are faced create some of the best narratives, even if only in your head. \nFor example; one of the Tales from the Far Territory regions is extremely far away from the vanilla section of the map, and the entire route has virtually no heated locations. I was unfortunate enough to have under-packed for the journey (I was very eager to see the DLC content) and so I was beginning to freeze as I reached a shelter. Unfortunately, this shelter was not warm enough and I was left with little supplies after attempting and repeatedly failing to start a fire. I walked the long path to my final destination, desperate and freezing. After using an emergency injection, I was lucky enough to locate a singular mobile home which saved my life. While being completely improvised and simply part of The Long Dark's survival mechanics, it was such a moment that it felt as though I had reached the climax of a story that I had barely played a part in.\n\nDespite it's incredible performance in these fields, it falters intensely as you play the game's story (spoilers will be spoilered). Characters such as the main two, Mackenzie and Astrid, see little character development other than \"Character adapt to wilderness.\" The entire story feels like [spoiler] a long list of fetch quests.[/spoiler] Chapter Three, which includes [spoiler] mostly arbitrary, more chore than fun fetch quests where you have to (at a painstakingly slow pace) carry survivors of a plane crash across the region,[/spoiler] is without a doubt the worst experience I've had in a survival game--or any game, for that matter. It gets worse in the end of Chapter Four, where [spoiler] the 'sniper sequence' during the prison escape is the most unfinished sequence in the game. The detection area is innacurate and scuffed, and rather than add a physical barrier like a collapsed roof, they just forced you to get shot in the most unfun way.[/spoiler] Overall, the story also struggles in vagueness--several sections left me wondering where I was supposed to go.\n\nSome reviews discuss how Hinterland has struggled to release five chapters of their story in the amount of years it has been since Chapter One's release; This is likely because of Hinterland's anti-crunch work culture. As Hinterland's founder and director, Raphael Van Lierop states on the Hinterland Games Website; \"We do not crunch, we do not do office politics, and we do not abuse people. We want you to have a life outside of work, so that you can bring positive energy to the team dynamic and help us achieve great things.\" ( hinterlandgames.com )\n\nOverall, I would recommend buying this game if you prefer making your own story in survival games, and would advise against purchasing the story unless you are alright with experiencing something at a lower quality level than the main game.\n\nTLDR; Game is a very good survival game. Very good at it's job and pretty. It gives you a setting and tools to build a narrative you don't realize you're making. The story is mediocre at best, and is worse than the main game.", "timestamp_created": 1713081969, "timestamp_updated": 1713082003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162450420": {"recommendationid": "162450420", "author": {"steamid": "76561199652343128", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1872, "playtime_at_review": 3321, "last_played": 1713459211}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have some psychological issues, you should try to walk around this white world to understand that you forgot to mark one of locations and then you will be so pissed off that you can forget about all of your personal problems.

It was a great survival game and I had a fun time with it although briefly.  It was original, fun, but unrelenting, and I died a bunch as if it were a roguelike.  Each play was better than the last and my final playthrough was what I considered the most successful before I eventually died a cheap death (the cause of which has been patched out of the game).  I uninstalled it, planning to return when it was further along, but even then I felt that I got my moneys worth.\n\n3 years later, its on the verge of winter IRL, temperatures are low, and we just had a snowstorm, and I decided to reinstall.  I'm glad I did.  This game is no longer the early release game it once was - this game is a heavily polished title that could stand amongst AAA titles.  Worth it before, but now with a really refined survival mode, story mode, etc.  Story mode is half decent and does a great job introducing you to the game.  The controls and UI are better.  The gameplay is more clear.  All around the developers did a great job, and they definitely know what they are doing - this isn't your typical indie studio.\n\nLots of hours under my belt and the game still finds ways to kick my butt.  RNG finds ways to complicate things and give you plenty of surprises, epic wins and deaths.  Mother nature is a brutal antagonist and you'll experience her full force in the game.  She is alive, she is unpredictable, and she always wins.  Each playthrough feels like its own story and provided me with great gaming moments.  \n\nOnce I had a good playthrough, got a bit cocky and ventured out in the fog in search of wood confident I'd find my way back.  I overestimated my sense of direction and got lost.  Frantically making my way back, I came across a wolf.  I managed to get away, but I went from slightly lost to completely lost.  The fog turned into a storm and I wasn't able to light a fire in the wind.  My clothes were wet and eventually I died of hypothermia just a hundred yards from home.  \n\nAnother playthrough had my cabin surrounded by wolves for days.  I was pinned down and I had to make the decision to leave pernamently, sneaking around them by going the LONG way.  I managed to get around them and I found some berries and saplings to gather from.   As I was safely picking them, I was ambushed by a freaking moose who smashed my ribs in.  I survived and stumbled away only to be roflstomped by the moose a second time.  With two broken ribs, I got away.  I loaded up on pain meds, but my new affliction made me unable to carry my heavy load.  I ditched a lot of it and carried on.  In the distance, I saw a cabin.  I was about 50 yards away from shelter when one of the wolves managed to track me down and kill me.  \n\nAnother, I was doing really well but was running low on food.  I planned on moving on, but the weather was bad so I postponed it.  Next day, the same.  And the next.  At this point I was completely out of food and close to starvation.  I decided I was too close to death to not risk it, and decided to go out into the storm.  I was wet, cold, the wind was bending the trees, kept losing direction, and I was close to hypothermia.  I stumbled upon a cave.  I managed to find enough sticks and was able to start a small fire.  I got as warm as I could and carried on.  It was strange though, because just when I thought it was all over, the weather cleared, I was a short distance away from a beautiful log cabin, and there was a bunch of rabbits.  I unloaded my stuff, got warm, hunted rabbits, and had a big feast.  Sometimes you have wins, postpone death and its a great feeling.\n\nMy last story I have to share is from early release (the thing I mentioned earlier that was patched).  This is before I or anybody knew the game.  Its not a zombie game... and there is this lingering feeling it might be.  You see, you enter a lot of abandoned buildings in a post-apocalyptic world and there are a lot of noises and shadows.  You find yourself sometimes stumbling around in the dark using a flare and my mind just expects something to pop out or someone who says \"who goes there?!\".  There isn't and it took me a long time to realize that.  So, hours into my good playthrough, I have a bunch of great equipment, food, water, shelter.  I made a hydro power plant my home and I cleared it completely.  I got back late at night and was stumbled to my bed in absolute darkness.  I'm going down this long corridor I went down several times before when I see a FIGURE coming at me.  I crapped my pants.  Its a zombie game afterall!  I turned and ran, but it was too late.  It wasn't until then that I saw my killer.  A lone wolf ripped my throat out in my sanctuary.  A wolf who spawned inside the dam was patched out of the game, but I'm still cautious and sometimes avoid the dam for that reason.  I went straight to the forums and apparently many others had the same initiation into the game as me.  Her name was Fluffy (google it) and she made one heck of a first impression on me.\n\nUpdate 12/17/2018: Just to give this review a bit of an update with the latest patch and leveraging some of the attention this review received recently.  \n\nGame still rocks in my opinion.  New patch gave the game some unneeded, but appreciated overhaul.  Story mode chapters redone, new items, new challenge mode, new interface, updated graphics and lighting... I think it was a bit rushed however to make it in time for the holidays.  So, expect some bugs.  Two steps forward, one step back.  \n\nStory changes seem to be in the right direction and adds new polish to it.  But there seems to be a lot of bugs with the latest.  I have faith we will get a follow up quickly and in the long run, the game is still a recommendation from me.  Its the type of game you can play hundreds of hours and still only scratch the surface.\n\nAnd my latest death involved in accidentally eating raw fish far from home, getting food poisoning, and forgetting medicine at home (it was like 90% cooked when the fire went out and my brain was on autopilot... and cmon... maybe my character likes sushi).  I spent the rest of daylight scrambling to find antibiotics in nearby cabins.  With no nearby cabins left to loot and it being night time... I had the decision should I hike half the night for the chance of medicine, or just go to bed and let death take me.  I forget my characters last words exactly, but it was along the lines of \"what a crappy way to die.\"  Some sarcastic punny humor, or mocking words from the developers on my silly mistake.  I'm not sure, but it rung true as my character laid down and died sometime in his sleep.", "timestamp_created": 1543413046, "timestamp_updated": 1545142732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 507, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.965501666069030762", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12482935": {"recommendationid": "12482935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034029393", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 7228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2254, "last_played": 1597103108}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, ladies and gentlemen - I have just reemerged back into the real world, after almost 100 days (99 days 18 hours) survival in one playthrough. With that up my sleeve, I'll be bold enough to say that I know a thing or two about this game and ready to try and write an adequate review. So gather round, grab a cup of hot chockolate and have a listen to what uncle Chern's got to tell ya :)\n\nI'll split my review into three sections - pros, cons and things that are considered negative by some reviewers, but not necessarily are.\n\nLet us start with the cons, because this list is the shortest... and because I am grumpy old b*****d who likes to criticize. So...\n\nCONS:\n\nMAP - Map in the current version of the game is not very large. There are only a few points to explore and salvage from. So after you have visited them all (which can... and probably should... be done in the first few days of your survival), the game becomes a bit repetitive. Go find meat - go collect some wood - cook - eat/drink - sleep - repeat from step one. Saying that - it does add to realism. Real survival in the wilderness is far from glorious and comes down to just that - get food, cook, keep sated, hydrated and warm. But still it would be nice to have more areas to poke your nose around :)\n\nLOOT (sometimes) - Loot in the game is mostly random... which is a good thing and adds to realism and replayability value, but at some playthroughs it can get bloody stupid. Sometimes you may have enough ammo to get out of Canadian wilds, venture to Afghanistan and assist several ISAF operations, have three knives, 5 packs of MRE rations, ton of medical supplies and good gear. Sometimes it may be evenly and fairly spread-out - so you find a good bit of everything in moderate ammount... And sometimes it gets silly. On my previous to last playthrough i found 5 can openers, no MREs, no repair tools, one almost broken knife and ton of degraded clothing. I still managed 41 days and died of stupidity (went to bed while freezing, and hoped I'll warm up... I didn't), but be warned - never know what you might get and life isn't always fair :)\n\nLONG DARK - No matter what you do, in the end your character is goind to punch that snuff button and check out. That can be quite depressing, that after toughing it out for 2-3 months, heroically navigating through blinding blizzards, savagely fighting wolves for half frozen (and half eaten) deer carcasses, you still going to die. I know - it wouldn't be \"The Long Dark\" game if you didn't fade into the long dark in the end and it makes this game highly competitive among the players, but it would be nice if there was an option for some sort of happy ending to the game. Maybe they'll do it for story mode later on. \n\nFLUFFY - I am not going to spoil it for you. You'll get to know him as you play the game. Be afraid... be very afraid... and never let your guard down. Cause the very moment you think you're safe and relax, the cruel reality will bite you in the ***... literally.\n\nOther than that - there are no bad things about this game. I wouldn't even use a word \"bad\" to describe all of the above - there are no bad things, just areas for improvement (just please don't change fluffy - leave him where he is - we all love him really... ok, he's completely evil ***hole, but it wouldn't be so much fun without him). \n\nNow, that we are done with those negative waves, let us switch to the positive side and see how beatiful this game is :)\n\nPROS:\n\nREALISM - Ok,.. let's get this straight - no simulator will duplicate the real thing - ever. As a keen climber and outdoorsman, I could have listed countless things that can be added to this game, from the realism perspective. But, so far, this game is as close as computer game can get to real-life survival (if you know anything better - please feel free to suggest). It is not casual, it is not skyrim with most hardcore \"eat, sleep, drink\" mods, it does not hold your hand, nor cuts you any slack. It's simple - \"ok, you're in **** - get surviving\"... and if you can't - hey, it's natural selection for you. So forget all the fancy Bear Grylls shows - no climbing cliffs, no running butt-naked through the winter forest and then trying to replenish your calories by munching on a squirell. Conserve your calories whenever and wherever you can, keep warm and hydrated, keep your gear in working order and adapt adequately to anything the wilderness throws at you - no heroics, no pointless wondering or taking chances, just timely well-planned actions... or it's game over.\n\nIMMERSION - The atmosphere of this game is absolutely marvellous. Nevermind cartoon graphics - sound, tension and your imagination (if you have any) totally do their trick. Howling of the wind outside at night, does set the mood in, whilst howling of the wolves at dusk, will send that tingle down your spine and motivate you to keep your rifle handy and get inside as soon as you can. And there is a really cosy and safe feeling, when you are sitting by the fire late at night, cooking your meal and celebrating your survival for yet another day. \n\nREPLAYABILITY - As mentioned before, the loot is pretty random. So every time the gear made available for the picking would be a little different and so will be your situation. Sometimes it will be bad and other times it will be just plain awful... Deal with it :)\n\nFLUFFY - Well, you know... :)\n\nFinally, let us take a quick look on things, that have been criticized by many players, but that are not entirely that bad.\n\nBALANCE - There have been numerous complaints from the players about calories ticking away too fast or equipment degrading too fast. It's a fair point, but guys - let's not forget that this is a game and players should be kept occupied. There would be a lot less to do if your equipment didn't degrade overtime and so the game would be just repetitive cooking and wood-foraging almost from start to finish. And that's a bit boring - don't we all agree?\n\nIf we are talking realism, then how about adding the fact that your clothing will be soaking wet after couple of hours outside, thus will become a lot colder not overtime but right away and will require good bit of drying to become warmer again? Or how about the fact that your ammo may get damp and unusable, or your rifle itself will require good thorough cleaning regularly, or wood that also will require drying, before it can be set on fire with a match and paper? And so on, and so on... Full realism will make some things easier, but will make a load of other things the hell of a lot harder. So stop wimpering, fix those damn woolen socks with a bit of cloth, patch up can opener with some rusty scrap metal and get out there :)))\n\nWOLVES - To my surprise I've seen quite a few complaints about abundance of wolves in the game and the wolf AI. Personally I do not know why anyone would complain about wolves - wolves in this game are your best friends, right after your winter coat, rifle and knife. In fact you may not need rifle when you got those guys around. On my last playthrough I have run out of ammo, by about 70th day. I survived for almost 30 days more. Guess how? I waited untill some wolf takes down a deer, then scared him off with a flare or fought him off with my fists and hoooray - 8kg of free venison every time. All thanks to wolves... poor buggers - I owe them some beers. \n\nAs to complaints about a wolf AI, I don't see what's wrong with it. Yes - the hungry wolf in the middle of the winter will try to have you for lunch - if there's no easier prey to be had, they will attack human (both in this game and for real). Once again - be thankful for \"non-realism\" and having to deal with lone wolves every time. In real life you'd have a whole pack of them on your ***. Do you feel lucky? :)\n\nIt seems like my word limit is up... Shame :) Anyway - get this game and play it. It's 100% worth it. \n\nThanks for reading :)", "timestamp_created": 1413245563, "timestamp_updated": 1608065282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1109, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.961841762065887451", "comment_count": 45, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41208199": {"recommendationid": "41208199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020027085", "num_games_owned": 583, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2180, "last_played": 1541106968}, "language": "english", "review": "The Long Dark is not for everyone. \nFar from it - it's slow to the point of being tedious; uncaring, and at times unfair. Only the most fundamental mechanics are explained, but most things you have to learn on your own. \"Fundamental\", by the way, means \"use the action wheel for quick access, put on a bandage or you bleed to death.\" Things like \"you can fix your clothes when you have a sewing kit, which will improve its protection against the elements\" or \"being outside during rain and snow can and will soak your clothes to the point that they can freeze\", you have to learn the hard way. I still don't know what the consequences to freezing clothes are, but it certainly can't be good. \n\nSo why, oh why would I recommend you buy it? Because your clothing can freeze if you are outside during -23\u00b0C. \nYou can snap a rabbits neck to survive, but the kicker? Rabbits have a poor nutritional value. \nWind and temperature are different factors, to the point where you can feel additional -17\u00b0C just from standing in the open - but you can take cover from the wind, reducing the effect.\n\nThere is so much love in the intricacies of outside survival and they put so much effort into making it feel [i]real[/i] that I can see why they have to put a large disclaimer on the very first screen you see when loading the game, telling you \"no, this isn't actual survival training, don't try this at home\". \n\nThey are doing a wonderful job at what they are trying to do. Yet, there are downsides to this. As I said, this game is slow: you can take a minute making a fire, only for it to fail at 98% complete. You can walk through the snow for 15 minutes, being able to see just a few meters ahead, only to find out you went vastely off course, shortly before you die of exhaustion.\nThis is not a game you start up for a quick relief of reality. It takes an hour to traverse most areas and that's not including actual exploration.\n\n[b]Important[/b]: Story mode isn't complete yet. It's episodic (you keep all your stuff when going from one to the next) and so far 2 of 5 have been released.\n\nThe team is still working on the game, and they are a bit behind with the 3rd episode because they revisited 1 and 2 after player feedback of the story being too linear. Which is probably worth mentioning in that yes, the story is rather linear at the moment, which I felt to be a problem only at one point, and that the developer actually listens to feedback.\n\n\nI genuinely enjoy the game and can only recommend it to everyone who likes survival and a slightly apocalyptic feeling. Also snow. So, so much snow. This game makes you feel cold even in your room. \n\nBy the way, should you run out of food, but have an axe and a strong clicking finger, you can go fuck with the wolves. It will hurt you, sometimes more, sometimes less, but wolves can have up to 5kg of meat - enough to get you easily through two days.\n\nMan, I really hate wolves.\n\nEdit: Butchered a sentence in there.\n\nDecember Edit: They did, finally, release a new episode in October.

I have almost 100kg of meat ready to be eaten, freezed on the snow for conservation. I have a ton of fresh water just sitting there. I've killed bears, moose, wolves. Anything that can be killed I have done it. I probably have more bullets than animals on the surroundings, and then a lot of arrows and a homemade bow too.\n\nI'm a master fisherman, hunter and I can start a fire easily in the middle of the storm. I make my own clothes from animal skins.\n\nIt's clear that I've now beaten the game. There is nothing it can throw at me at this point that I'm not prepared for. At least that was what I thought, but I hadn't taken account of my own stupidity...\n\nOne day, I was taking a walk to my favourite hunting area, with the hope of catching some deer to make me a new pair of deerskin pants.\n\nI suddenly realized there was a mountaineering rope, hanging down a cliff. \"Wow, I haven't seen that before, lets take a look\", I thought.\n\nI started what it felt like a long climb just to reach a big ledge at the end of the rope, almost running out of stamina in the process. Looks like I carried too much weight, but anyway I did it.\n\nLooking around me, there wasn't a lot. The rope didn't reach the top of the cliff, it just ended on a big ledge halfway to the top, with only a few branches on its ground.\n\nWhen I was getting ready to climb back down, disappointed, I saw there was another climbing rope, hanging down from the top of the cliff to the ledge I was in.\n\n\"Thats where the big prize should be\", so I grab that second rope without hesitation and started climbing up again, but man, I didn't realized it was going to be so hard. When I was on the middle of this second rope, it was clear I was not going to make it. My hands were hurting so bad that I had to go down on a rush, barely making to the ledge before running out of stamina completely.\n\nWell, I'm stupid, I carry too much weight, that's why I couldn't climb it. So I left almost anything I was carrying on the ledge, and got ready for another try.\n\nNow I felt much lighter and I was sure I could make it to the top. But as I was climbing my confidence started to vanish. God it is really a long climb. There is no way I can make this time. I need to go down while I can.\n\nI rushed down to the ledge again, but, when I was getting close to it, my hands slipped and I fell to the snow, twisting my ankle on the process.\n\nNot a big deal, I always carry a lot of painkillers with me so I took a pair of then and was back on track before even knowing it.\n\nAt that point I realized how tired I was, climbing is an exhausting activity. My fatigue indicator was on the red and I was falling asleep while standing.\n\nAh, thats why I couldn't make it to the top. I was so tired from the first climb that climbing the second rope was just too much.\n\nLuckily I always carry my sleping bag with me, you never know, so I decided to take a nap there on the ledge, and then try again for the second climb, this time being well rested so I could make it to the top.\n\nThe cold woke me up. I was totally freezing. A storm had descended while I was sleeping and I had contracted hypotermia. I could barely see, or walk.\n\nOh shit. Wtf was I thinking? I crawled through the ledge, desperately trying to gather all the branches I could find to start a fire. Although my burry vision made it real hard and I felt like I was going to die any moment, I did it. I started a good fire from sticks, enough to warm me up again, or, at least, prevent me from freezing to death right there.\n\nWow, that was close. I got back into the sleeping bag, this time near the fire, hoping to rest a little more to warm me up and gather enough strengh for the climb down. At that point, obviously, I had abandoned all hopes to get to the top and I was just thinking on returning to the safety of my house on the lake, so I could recover.\n\nWhen I woke up, the fire was almost running out, but I had recovered a little condition. There were no more branches on the ledge and the sun was setting on the horizon, so it was now or never, I had to get down or die there.\n\nI dropped almost anything I carried there, on the snow, so I didn't have to carry its weight, including my precious rifle with all it's ammunition, and then grabbed the downward rope with my tingling hands.\n\nClimbing down from the ledge wasn't easy, in fact it was exactly the opposite, but I managed to go down a good deal before slipping again when I was around 3 meters from the ground, twisting my battered ankle one more time.\n\nWell, I left my painkillers along with all my equipment on the ledge, but at least I was on the ground again. I was badly injured and almost dead, but I was on the ground again. Now I only had to cross the lake and get to my house to rest until I'm fully healed, surrounded by food, water and firewood. It's not going to a pleasant walk, but I can make it.\n\nI started crawling towards the riverside when I suddenly heard a loud growl.\n\nSearching through my blurry vision, I saw a dark siluhette getting closer and closer. \"Ffs why always me?\", I though while I maniacally reached for my rifle, only to realize I left it there on the ledge, along with anything else that could be of help.\n\nI turned around and started running like hell, at least I tried, but it's not an easy task with a twisted ankle and a bad case of hypothermia.

I've been playing this game since it was in Alpha, and have long been in love with it. The story mode doesn't live up to what I think it could, at least in my thinking, but I'm not too fussed about that, because the real meat and bones of this game is and always has been the sandbox survival mode. Please don't be fooled by the term \"sandbox\" to think that it's some unfinished non-game-- the narrative that this game's survival mode always had from way back in Alpha was that your character is going to die here. All you're doing is trying to survive as long as possible. You might even succeed at making a comfortable home with renewable resources and live to day 500 with no end in sight--people have indeed done that, actually. But the point isn't to escape or to tame the wilderness. There is no taming it; there is only surviving and trying to carve out a place of safety or two. There are multiple modes to choose from, including one where the wildlife won't attack you (I played the game on this mode for most of my first hundred hours before I finally stopped being scared of the wolves); one where they attack, but aren't your biggest threat when compared to the environment itself and weather; one where you're operating with limited resources and the environment is even harsher; and one where everything is incredibly harsh. There is also a custom mode that lets you decide what aspects you want to play with. The devs are constantly working on this game and adding things in (they swore for years they would never add a custom mode, but finally gave in to the fans' persistent pleas), and they are frequently running special events (just recently, they had a Halloween event where some monster was chasing you around the maps! Too spooky for me, but it sounded incredible). As they continue to work on the story mode (it's episodic), they have been releasing updated maps with more places to shelter and go, and new mechanics, and even entirely new regions to explore! This is a final, released game, but it was already worth the cost when it was still barely out of Alpha mode, and the fact that it's still living and breathing and evolving per the fans' desires and the devs' vision is incredible and worth supporting. If you enjoy survival games, then there is no reason not to get this game. Manage your caloric intake, exhaustion, encumbrance, hydration, warmth, item durability, and scent while you keep an eye on the weather, your safehouses, and the wildlife in order to survive the brutal snowscape. ...Or go to peaceful mode and enjoy the loot-bonanza while you sight-see and and watch the wildlife, chugging on your maple syrup and munching on your candy bars.

I grinded through Wintermute to learn the fundamentals, before diving into Survival mode.\n\nI quickly became immersed. The game's mechanics are relatively simple. The crafting system is not complicated. After so much time, wildlife becomes predictable. Certain animals can only spawn in certain locations. Some days you just get stuck inside breaking down boxes and shelves to collect extra resources, hoping to find a couple extra cans of dog food. And yet, I was never bored.\n\nI managed to fully explore several locations. I built up an arsenal, learned to use weapons, mastered my strategy. Finally, after 150 in-game days, I took on a black bear and a moose--I killed both without getting a scratch. I decided to harvest the corpses on the spot, rather than quartering. After 3 days I still hadn't gotten all the meat back to base, and I took a lot of condition loss spending too much time in the cold.\n\nI had become confident and greedy. A wolf took me by surprise right outside my front door. I started bleeding out, and wouldn't you know it? I had harvested all of the cloth from my base and transported it elsewhere. I had one piece left in my inventory, but not enough time to make bandages. I completely forgot about the emergency stim I had been carrying throughout the entire game... And just like that, a run that lasted over 100 real hours came to an abrupt end.\nHere I am, laughing as I write this, and gearing up for a more challenging run.\n\nI'm picky about games. I don't play many of them. The ones I do play, though, I play religiously. I played other survival crafting games. But this one is different. You're not fighting zombies, raiding bases, building bases, farming or collecting loot for the sake of it. It doesn't feel cheap in that way. \n\nIt's man versus nature. Your biggest obstacle is yourself.  Some resources are finite and scarce, and thus used strictly for emergencies. Often, you are faced with tough choices, none of which are appealing. Wolves are d*cks, but even they are not the real nemesis here. The wildlife is not really out to get you. You can almost always avoid a direct conflict, if you tread carefully. No, in the end it is the cold that will come for you--the incessant, unforgiving cold, constantly chipping away at you.\n\nThere are no monsters here, and yet you must remain vigilant at all times...

Well, I decided to give it a chance before the final release to know what the fuss was all about. Man, it blew my mind.\n\nFirst of all, it's not a simple game of survival, watch meters and number dwindle down as you starve, get tired or dehydrated, although, there is plenty of that too. What's incredible is how contemplative it is, you're always on the look for something yes, you need to keep moving, keep exploring, the world isn't safe, it's dying and it wants you to join it, it feels sometimes the only true warmth you'll ever find is the embrace of death. Outside time leaps, everything you do takes precious time and sunlight, harvesting wood, exploring, getting from point A to B, you're always freezing or going hungry, but then you find shelter, and you like the character can rest.\nYou still have to do something to be alive in a shelter, light a fire, cook food, boil water, but at least you can think, you can prepare your spirit for the terror outside. You have to survive, not because you want to prove something to anyone else, but out of spite, in a land that wants you dead, you want to rebel, you refuse to give up. But it's still respite, at a shelter you can think, plan your next day.\nIn a way it reminds me of Hemingway's old man and the sea, it's about an internal struggle, even if nature gets the final say, you'll wont rest easy, you'll kick and scream and in that defiance you can have your final laugh.\n\nThere is so much that can be said about this, even the play though that cemented my appreciation of this game could be a tale in itself, but for now it's enough, I wrote too much already.", "timestamp_created": 1491081769, "timestamp_updated": 1491081769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 592, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.951989412307739258", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32308268": {"recommendationid": "32308268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032052135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 32979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8744, "last_played": 1707702162}, "language": "english", "review": "Sometimes I don't even outlive 15 minutes, one time I made it over 100 days.

How long can you last against the wrath of Mother Nature until you succumb to the Long Dark?\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\nIn The Long Dark, a survival & exploration game, the initial set-up is quite simple. You can choose to begin your story from either the Mystery Lake or Coastal Highway and then maintain your health (condition) by dealing with:\n[list]\n[*]hunger (as displayed by remaining calories)\n[*]cold\n[*]thirst\n[*]exhaustion\n[/list]\nAt the same time you must explore your environment for critical supplies and beware of wandering too far from a shelter. In this game the worst threat won't be anything living but rather the general inhospitable surroundings. A roaring blizzard, threatening to put you to a cold shallow grave of ice, can be just as deadly to get lost in as to take shelter from in a cabin without any food, water or firewood.\n\nThere exists a constant risk/reward status where you must weigh just what can you do and what you MUST do that puts you in a fairly stressful (and even frightening) situation.\n\n\n[h1]Survival mechanics 8/10[/h1]\nAfter a few deaths and then surviving over 50 days, I can say the threats can be tough but are in the end fair. There are multiple ways to greatly enhance your odds of survival, namely finding better clothes and tools, but there's no substitute for exploration and familiarizing oneself to the surroundings. There are no maps or compasses so remembering landmarks is imperative for finding your back to safety...\n\nThe balance of staying outside to scavenge, hunt, fish and get firewood for cooking, heating and melting&boiling snow for drinking water while also tending to your clothes, tools and potential medical conditions isn't easy, but perhaps one of the finest points is the slightly reduced need for the tiniest of micro management. Getting firewood, melting snow, fixing, sleeping and even harvesting can be set to take place for a predefined amount of time or quantity, which makes managing your ever-dvindling energy more straight-forward and makes organizing easier.\n\nThere's also a day-night cycle and even if the sky is free of clouds, without a flare or lantern it will be all but impossible to see anything once sunlight's gone. During the night it will also be potentially much colder and also harder to spot the hungry predators. The sight of glowing eyes approaching is enough to chill your blood from a whole different reason than the cold...\n\nWhile it can be easy to survive for some time with scavenging alone, it will eventually be a near must to hunt for your meals. And even then the management of limited resourses like medicine and cloths will potentially either make or break your survival. Luckily you can improve your own effectivity at lighting fires, crafting tools and repairing items to make longer term sustainibility possible but long-term thinking is a necessity to survive.\n\nA bit of a heads-up so your not caught off guard, being in strong wind or a blizzard will wear down your clothes rather quickly even if you take windcover in a broken shack or the hut of an icefisher. Hopefully this will see a change in the future updates as it will limit your range to the vicinity of shelters that can be closed properly.\n[spoiler](Oof a blizzard, I'll take cover from it in this hut with a furnace in it and fish... oops, my jacket, hat, shirt, shoes and everything just ripped from the wind wear in this OBVIOUS wind trap causing me to freeze to death despite a burning hot furnace next to me. -_-)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]Asthetics - (9/10)[/h1]\nThe Long Dark has somewhat stylized graphics, giving it a small pseudo-2D impression that plays very well with warm shades in light and cold shades during dusk. A lit fireplace won't light the surroundings as much as an open flame, but it has its own beutiful profile against an otherwise pitch black cabin. A very impressive view unfolds from high-up, overlooking the costal winterland.\n\nAlso, even though there's no story mode, the sandbox mode contains quite a bit of lore on its own. Finding a frozen corpse, collapsed against a tree; an abandoned home with a cooked meat still in its oven or a run-down power-station share their own silent bits of story. There are also multiple named locations around the world, not only to make navigation a bit easier but also dwell futher into the lore of the environment you stroll in.\n\n\n[h1]Music - 8/10[/h1]\nThis game doesn't have an abundance of varying tracks but if one were to categorize them, they should be call mystical. The somber and somewhat distant-ish music serves as a great auditive tool that greatly supports an image of a seemingly unreal frozen world which might just be a dream. The cues inform you about a dawn breaking, a night approaching, a grievous end or perhaps about a dire situation among many other things that can only be found out by exploring this lonely world.\n\n[i]If I close my eyes, when I wake up all the snow will have disappeared and the town'll look like nothing had happened...[/i]\n\n\n\nAs a closing statement, this game can be surprisingly tense and stressful when fighting against all odds to keep you alive. I recommend this game to anyone interested in asthetics, mythical music and eager for a survival story in the now quite lonely cold world. The most successful survivors have lasted over 100 days. Perhaps there might be salvation if you last long enough...\n\n-This review is from up to v.166 early access and covers the sandbox mode of the time.

Rating: 4,5/5 great game\n\nThe game consists of 4 modes:\n- story mode (only 2 out of 5 episodes are released)\n- predefined challenges in a sandbox\n- sandbox mode with 4 different difficulties\n- custom sandbox where you can tweak some of the settings\n\nPros\n+++ survival aspects\n+++ music\n++ graphical style\n++ constant tension because wolves (or bears) might pop up out of nowhere\n++ sense of progression/learning\n+ crafting is focused\n\nCons\n--- no mod support\n- story\n- development of story mode is slow\n\n90% of my 2000+ hours I have spent on the sandbox mode. I think the sandbox mode is the best part of the game. The sandbox survival mode is unlike any other game that is out there. It is very unique much do to having no map or compas. You need to learn the maps and where resources and shelters are. Learning to survive in this game is challenging. It felt very rewarding to me.  Crafting is quite limited compared to other survival games and that is a good thing. Craftable items feel useful and rewarding. But on Interloper (hardest difficulty) you remain  quite vulnerable to wolves, bears and the cold. No matter how good your gear is.\n\nI didn\u2019t care much for the story. They have reworked the existing episodes recently but I still feel it is lacking. But then again many like the story mode and don\u2019t care much for the sandbox. So I guess it depends on what you are looking for.\nThe predefined challenges are too easy for me. They serve more an introductory purpose imo.\nThe custom sandbox mode allows you to tweak some of the setting but not a whole lot. I wish it would allow a whole lot more.\n\nThe game has no mod support and that is the only real negative thing I can say about the game.", "timestamp_created": 1555602744, "timestamp_updated": 1557219202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 345, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946117222309112549", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18576074": {"recommendationid": "18576074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081214854", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 831, "last_played": 1659919584}, "language": "english", "review": "    I've played The Long Dark for almost 14 hours and I think I can really say that this is the most realistic survival game out there.

The not knowing what to do part of the game is what makes this game the most satisfying when you finally get a couple days in. Ok time to stop writing this like a high school paper I'll make this review a simple bullet point guide of the pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros\n- In depth hunger, thirst and cold stats in game\n- Beautiful Graphics (Not much of a machine hog either)\n- Immersive HUD (meaning almost no HUD except for little indicators for when you're getting cold or hungry)\n- Nice and simple inventory system\n- Perfect first-aid system\n- Time consuming crafting\n- Simple hunting system (Skinning and drying)\n- Nice weather system \nCons\n- Wolf AI still needs work\n- Not many crafting options (I can understand why there isnt a lot but a few more would be better)\n- Early Access (bugs)\n\nThere is not a lot of cons when it comes to this game but I'm sure there is a few minor cons on this game.

Recommendation: Either reduce bleed out time, or decrease carcass decay rates, please.\n-Tools seem to decay alarmingly fast\n-Harvest times for certain items are absurdly long, like 30 mins to break down a cardboard box, or 10 minutes to break a branch into 3 sticks!\n-Running drains stamina fast, but also raises fatigue at an unreasonably high rate\n-You can only harvest oil from fish\n\n\nSuggested changes and additions\n-More player built shelters, and possibly containers\nThe snow shelter is good, but what about a hide tent, curing rack, reed or straw baskets, or a large fixture in which to store meat, wood, or oil which can be placed outdoors?\n-Snow Sled\nRare item which can be found in the environment, and can help with transporting loads of items over non-challenging terrains (level or gently sloping, few rocks or other obstacles)\n-More types of wildlife\n-Bone fishing hooks?  \nMaybe they break more easily, but can be created from rabbit or fish bones.\n-Wood Spears for throwing.  \nMaybe they need a full Cured Sapling to make, but don't require a bow to hurl, and can also be used to deter a charging wolf or bear, to a degree.  This can be something just hardened in a fire, or with a tied on metal or sharpened stone tip\n-Sharpened stone tools in general.\nMaybe just a basic handaxe, which degrades quickly and takes a couple of hours to craft, only certain kinds of stones can be used to make them, but they're fairly abundant.  It would give people something else to do when they're stuck indoors.  Maybe to balance the abundance, it's heavy and can break at as high as 50% durability.\n-Customizable maps\nAllow fan creators to place items, notes, and creature spawn points within the environment\n-More types of clothing\nParticularly pants, as well as more types of clothes crafted from animal hides\n-Alcoholic beverages\nReduce frostbite risk and can act as a painkiller, but slightly increases the rate of temperature loss. Accelerates fatigue temporarily, but boosts stamina recovery.  Replenishes a small amount of calories and hydration. Decays very slowly, and is safe to drink even in low quality percentages, but drinking excessive amounts can give you status effect \"drunk\" or make you black out.\n-Harvestable deer Antlers, and Antler based craftables\n-Beartraps, or craftable animal traps for immobilizing or injuring predators or deer\n-Torches which use tender instead of cloth, maybe they take longer to craft\n-(pipe dream) Multiplayer Survival Mode \nI know the development team have mention they're not planning to do this, but it would certainly be nice if they could overcome the game design to figure out a way, possibly by only overriding active time while all players are occupied with a time advancing task (sleeping, harvesting, cooking, etc)  So if players want to skip the night, they all sleep, or one sleeps while another cooks or harvests.  This would also need to allow players to inturrupt time advancing tasks as long as not all players were in time advancing tasks.  If only one person is performing a time advancing task in a safe area, they can just go afk or do something else if they need to, while the other players do their thing.\n-(pipe dream) Survival VS Mode \nOne player is the human survivor, another takes control of a predator, and attempts to locate and kill them. The predator has high resistance to weather, but both must sleep and eat. Sleeping and performing time advancing tasks doesn't automatically advance time outside of intervals where time advancing tasks are synchronized. Both can inturrupt their own time advancing tasks.  The Human player wins if the predator dies, all controllable predators die, or they reach a specific goal, possibly a time elapsed goal to keep this mode short.  The predator can stalk and eat other wildlife to sustain themselves, and can eat raw meat without issue.  They can even leave partially consumed carcasses to temp the human player to harvest them. Flares, torches, and gunshots still trigger a panic mode in the predator as they do with the AI, but panic may fade more quickly.  As predators can't open doors, available maps will either not include indoor zones, or indoor zones will not include normal food and water spawns. Some outdoor fixtures may provide shelter from the elements, such as fishing huts, or other buildings and caves with no transition.  Predators can \"track\" a player or prey animal's scent signature, but this decays over time.  The scent is stronger and lasts longer if the human is carrying meat or is bleeding. Predators also have superior night vision. Knives, axes, torches, distress pistols, flares, rifles, ammo, bows, and arrows would be more abundant in this setting, and the human player would likely start with either a knife or an axe, and possibly a flare, or such items would spawn in fairly reliable positions.", "timestamp_created": 1512807864, "timestamp_updated": 1512809435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 593, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.944752693176269531", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23290463": {"recommendationid": "23290463", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971855969", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5183, "last_played": 1573951138}, "language": "english", "review": "Alas!  My plane has crashed.  I am alone, cold and hungry.   I'm dressed for four hours of comfort on a routine flight from Anchorage to Yellowknife.  Days of wandering lost in the greater Canadian waste were not on my schedule and not figured in my preparation.\n\nIt's late in the day, but for a scant moment, fortune abides me.  Orienting to my surroundings, I see a frozen fellow face down in the snow.  I learn the unfortunates name was Max while rummaging his belongings.  I borrow his hunting knife and hatchet.  Hey now!  Don't think so harshly of me.  He clearly doesn't need them.  \n\nIf the darkening sky is an indicator, it seems my luck is now coming to an end.\n\nDusk is settling around me as night approaches.  I notice with more than passing concern that the wind is picking up.  A blizzard closes with the dark, it seems.  Urgently, I set out into the dim dusk, seeking I know not what.  As the wind and the cold clutch me, I stagger until I see the faint outline of a building.  I\u2019m near frozen.  I\u2019m exhausted and starving, when I finally find the solace of a small hunter's cabin.  It's meager supplies sustain me until morning.\n\nA map on the cabin wall says \u201cMystery Lake.\u201d\n\nDays blend together, one upon the next I wander the area in search of civilization, anything that might help me sustain until someone comes for me.  A rifle to fire the thirty or so rounds of ammo I've amassed wouldn\u2019t hurt, though I\u2019d likely shoot my foot off.  Sour grapes, I tell myself.  Yet a rifle would be an edge up if I am to triumph over the wolf-infested wilderness.  \n\nOh yeah.  Wolves.  \n\nI've fended them off so far.  I even stalk them now.  Risky business with only a knife and a hatchet.  They\u2019re starving, weak.  A few well placed hatchet blows and they run off. I follow their trail, finding their frozen corpse where they succumb to their wounds.  Lately, I\u2019ve even stolen their kills, carefully trailing them until they make one. This has enabled me to live well on plentiful venison. I sew clothes of leather.  I fashion a rough bow, but I\u2019m not very adept with it.  Easier to steal from the wretched wolves.\n\nI said, don\u2019t think harshly of me.\n\nMore days blur together.  I grow stronger, more adept at survival.  I trap rabbits and fish the lake.  I now stand  hearty, healthy and well equipped, sans the elusive rifle.  I've depleted most of my resources.  I tire of fish.  I have confidence in my ability to travel.  Yet, were it not for the new tracks I\u2019ve seen, I might be content to stay.  I\u2019m no expert, but bear tracks nearly a foot across are hard to put out of mind.  I dread knowing that I risk an encounter, I risk death, if I stay.  I must go.  With some anxiety, I make my preparations.\n\n  I gather my supplies, repair my leather clothing and strike out for the coastal highway marked at the edge of the map on the wall.  Four days I trek.  Through ravines, over hills, down cliffs.  I go until I come to a wide, frozen bay in the coastal region.  It\u2019s been weary travel.  I\u2019m cold, tired and hungry, feelings I\u2019ve grown used to.  Yet I see promise now on the horizon. I know I\u2019m being impatient, but an alluring group of buildings across the bay, in the distance, draw my attention.  I set out with a small fishing hut in the middle of the frozen bay as my landmark.  \n\nI\u2019m aware of how encumbered I am. I brought too much and collected more along the way.  The sun falls dangerously low in the sky.  A slight desperation joins my anticipation.  I realize the distant hut remains too distant.  The going has been too slow.  I consumed all of my food a day ago, I\u2019m growing weak now, travel is difficult.  Fortune looks away from me.  Cold and uncaring.  Indifferent.  Night becomes real as the horizon is swallowed in darkness.\n\nI\u2019m what I judge to be near half way across the open ice now, the winds are kicking up.  The temperature is dropping sharply as a fresh arctic blizzard sets in.  First in gusts, then in torrents, waves of fine white dust combine with the oppressive dark, blinding my eyes, tearing at my face like sharp knives.  I light my last flare but it's light is consumed in the gale.  I become disoriented, unsure of my heading, now utterly lost.  Panic rapidly settling in, numb with cold, starvation and tired to the bone, I desperately stagger on.  My tired eyes burn as I peer into the dark, as if I could will them to see the ice fishing hut I know must be nearby.  Finally, with some relief, I begin to make out it's outline.  \n\nBut alas, fortune has now fled fast from me.  The vague outline of the hut was suddenly blocked by another, larger and closer silhouette, emerging from the darkness.  \n\nIt is the bear.\n\nTerror freezes me in its icy grasp, as the foul beast descends upon me.  I\u2019m helplessly unprepared.  The giant creature towers over me, angry.  His breath is rancid as he roars my doom in my face.  His giant paws maul me repeatedly. My carefully crafted leather clothes are shredded as though they were mere paper.  Razer sharp claws lacerate my flesh mercilessly.  Cold and shock numb the pain of the cuts but nothing can numb the deep, grating ache of broken and crushed bones as the beast tosses me about like a rag doll. Face down in the snow now, my flare lying nearby, I see the snow stained heavily with blood.  Somewhere in my mind, it\u2019s not lost on me that the blood is mine.  It\u2019s too much.  Far too much.  \n\nFinally, when it seems as if I must certainly die, the creature ceases his attack, leaving me all but dead.\n\nAs the bear shambles off, I come slowly to my senses, enough to realize my peril.  I've sustained tremendous injuries.  It is all I can do to stem the worst of my bleeding and stumble to the fishing hut nearby, trailing blood across the ice.  Shattered, traumatized, starving and frozen, I close the hut to the storm and fall to the ice near a pot belly stove in the corner.  With the last of my energy, I set about striking a fire in the stove.  The meager warmth it emanates is like fire on my frost bitten and lacerated skin.  The world spins slowly about me as I evaluate my dire condition.  I must eat soon.  I must rest.  \n\nI hear a maddened laugh, startled for a moment before I realize the sound is my own.  I have no food, the fire will die soon, and I am close to losing consciousness.  I\u2019m filled with a sense of what is almost relief when I realize the truth.\n\nI\u2019m going to die here.\n\nAnd so I lie here, death slowly overtaking me, feeling myself fading into darkness.  They say your life flashes before your eyes the moment before you die.  My slide show feels like an eternity.  Thoughts of home, of my family, my world before this one, the joys and pains and hopes I\u2019ve experienced, all flash by.  The scheme of my life, itself a flicker of nothingness, ending in more nothingness.  I lament that I have not done more, that I have not lived it fuller, and better, and with more grace.  I mourn that it must all end like this. My heart sinks lower as my conscience fades.\n\nAnd then I see it.  In the opposite corner, propped against the wall.\n\nA rifle.\n\nThrough heroic feats of effort, I drag myself to the corner.  I take it in my hands.  Twenty-one days I\u2019ve spent in the Canadian wilderness.  Twenty-one days spent searching for a rifle.  And now, as my life force leaves me, it somehow calms me that I hold now triumphantly, that which I have sought.\n\nAnd then, a gentle peace settling over me, I descend into the gray.\n\nAnd so my friend, as you read my unwritten tale, I wish for you to know this.  If you should ever find yourself stranded in the Canadian waste, and if you should come to a vast bay in the coastal region, and while crossing the bay, you should stumble upon a small fishing hut, don't be surprised to find a wry smile on my frozen face as you pry the rifle from my cold dead hands.  And I want you to know this one thing; that I make you this one promise.\n\nI won\u2019t think too harshly of you.", "timestamp_created": 1464614434, "timestamp_updated": 1606700554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 802, "votes_funny": 236, "weighted_vote_score": "0.944556713104248047", "comment_count": 38, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15553445": {"recommendationid": "15553445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058981092", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 234565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3818, "playtime_at_review": 25728, "last_played": 1713799144}, "language": "english", "review": "April 26, 2015 was my initial review. This addendum is as of February 11, 2023.\nThe game (and studio?) is/are not what they used to be. The sound, one of the most beautiful aspects of the game, has been breaking up since the last release, really ruining the experience. There are several longstanding issues that still are not addressed with the game. It appears communication, hotfixes, and PASSION from the studio for the game no longer exists.\n***end of addendum***\nSteam is telling me I've played 426.8 hrs of this game at the time of this review. As you might have guessed, I am very fond of the game. I've held off on writing a review because I just don't think I can do the game justice, but I'll try. \n\nSo what do I love about the game to warrant such an embarrassing amount of hours in the game? I'll try to explain: \n\n[b]The graphics[/b]. They are beautiful and with the recent upgrade to Unity 5, the graphics became absolutely gorgeous. The beautiful snow-frosted branches of the trees swaying in the breeze; the stark mountains against a beautiful sometimes stormy, sometimes cloudy, and sometimes sunny skyline; The beautiful, but scary nighttime with the aurora borealis, moon, and stars smattering the sky; the bright green, glowing eyes of the wolves...er wait...more scary than beautiful those critters are. :)\n\n[b]The sound[/b]. The voice actors are Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale at the time of this review. Veterans of the industry, with titles such as Mass Effect under their belts. The beautiful stinger music that signals a change in weather or time of day. The haunting, creepy music when you discover a corpse inside a house sometimes. The music is not overdone, perfectly placed, so you don't lose that feeling of abandonment. The sound effects, the creaking and groaning of the trees, the wind, footsteps crunching in the snow, the lonely hoot of an owl, the ringing in your ears when you shoot the rifle indoors, the skin-crawling sighing and muttering when in the \"creepier\" locations, the snarling, howling, and barking of the wolves. The sounds and music in the game are one of my most favorite aspects of the game and it's hard to list them all or describe the feelings of immersion you experience. You must experience them first-hand to truly \"get it\".\n\n[b]The game mechanics[/b]. You have to be careful, you have to be smart, you have to be patient or you die. I love this, it's the player in full control, how long you survive is based on the decisions you make. Plan ahead, learn from past mistakes. Unlike most video games I don't mind dying in this game. I don't feel cheated because I learn what NOT to do or how I can do it better. The saying \"you make your own destiny\" seems applicable to the gameplay. It's a sandbox, there's no linear path you are forced to follow, you can immerse yourself fully and explore to your heart's content. There are three modes of play: easy, medium, difficult. A fit for everyone- from peaceful exploration to death around every corner.\n\n[b]The developers[/b]. The developers have always been very involved in the community on Steam and also on their own Hinterland forum and Reddit. They are AAA title veterans who know what they are doing. The updates to the game are frequent and fun. Hotfixes practically same day. They have a zero tolerance for bugs in their game and it shows in this quality product. It's hard to believe it's an Early Access title. I haven't found a more polished one.\n\nThe best part? It's like a free gift everytime there is an update. More fun stuff to check out for free! Another \"best part\"...the sandbox will remain available even when story mode is released for the people who enjoy it. I'm looking forward to the story mode, but I adore the sandbox survival.\n\nTL/DR: Get this beautiful, quality game. It's Early Access with a twist - it feels like a complete game already!\n\nI hope this review helps someone.

I fished, gathered wood and even made myself some deerskin boots! But after 8 days I still couldn't find the rifle. I packed my bags with supplies ready for a search of the ravine. Weather was fine and visibility was good.\n  A wolf soon catches my scent! With my flare to keep him at bay, I make a sprint for the Hydro Dam, phew safe! I hear scratching, I am not alone! I ready my final flare and hold it steady, confident I can repel whatever lurks in the dark. Fluffy comes for me, I ignite my torch... he attacks! I fight for my life and, wounded, the wolf retreats. However I am now left in a crippled state, bleeding. My condition is not good. I escape the Dam only to find myself in a blizzard, I can't go back, I must get back to my cabin! I forge ahead gritting my teeth, I am cold... so very cold. I soon lose my bearings in the whiteout, I'm down to 3% and my vision blurs, 2% I see the silhouette of a cabin, I make it to the door... yes, I survived! But whats this? The cabin does not have a fire! Now at 1% I really start to panic and before I can get out my bedroll I slip into The Long Dark...\n \n10/10 for atmosphere.

Here's why...\n\nIt's realistic, hard, and takes very many factors into account. You're in the middle of the Canadian snowy wilderness with nothing but your clothes. You have only one life, and all you have to do is stay alive. That simple. But not really. You can freeze to death, starve to death, die of blood loss, frostbite, hypothermia, food poisoning, dysentery, intestinal parasites, fire, electrocution, infection, falling from high distances, wolves, bears, moose attacks...\n\nThese threats are not much of a problem when dealing with them one at a time, but combos of them will be a huge problem. But the thing that really kills you the most... miscalculation. You can make a simple mistake such as get greedy and carry too much weight that will slow you down and fatigue you faster, then get caught in fog or sudden blizzard that will either get you lost, make you freeze to death, or get attacked by some wildlife you can't see or even run from, or carry not enough stuff which opens up even more types of problems than can kill you.\n\nI've died hunting wolves with too few bullets,\nGetting distracted chasing rabbits then forgot which way I was going and got lost,\nFroze to death chopping wood,\nForgot a light source searching a building, then it got dark, I got lost and starved to death in the building,\nClimbed a rope while tired, then fell to my death,\nMoose broke my ribs restricting my movement, so later a wolf found me, caught up with me and killed me,\nStepped on my own campfire and burned to death,\nSlept outside and died of hypothermia in my sleep because I didn't put enough wood in my campfire,\nRan off a cliff to my death running from a bear,\nGot electrocuted by live wires I thought was nowhere near me,\nGot lost lost in fog at night, then attacked by 2 wolves, killed them, but bleed to death because I brought too few bandages,\nBurned my stamina just being in a hurry, then turned a corner to a bear while exhausted. He caught me easy,\nGobbled every food item I found not caring about the condition, got poisoned, but forgot my antibiotics,\nFroze on a long journey all because I forgot to sew up my clothes beforehand,\nGot too tired which made me slow, which made me freeze and starve before I found my destination, which made me die from condition loss because all because I forgot my bed roll.\n\nThis game is very immersive, very intense, and you will feel everything. When you're cold you feel it, when you're out of breath you feel it, when you sprain your ankle you feel it. And when you're running from a wolf trying to reach that door or you will die you will be freaking out. This game is an adrenaline rush. And unlike Skyrim or Fallout where you have hundreds of things in your inventory and are looting every 3 seconds for mostly meaningless things, in this game everything is precious. You savor every find. You'll never feel so much joy finding something as simple as matches or a knife. This game keeps you on edge, keeps you on your toes, and you must keep your mind sharp if you want to stay alive. Unless you're only into fast paced, bloody action, shoot em up games, this game I highly, highly recommend.\n\nNow everything I explained covers survival mode. The real game. There is a story mode that holds your hand and lays out items for you, and it's fun too, but not nearly a challenge because you can die an infinite amount of times and not worry too much, but I recommend survival mode hands down.\n\nAnswering comments:\nIn story mode your plane crashes with your wife in a Canadian wilderness on an island with a playable area of 21 square miles (55 km). The story bounces you between the two and you must find each other. Infinite lives and saves.\nIn survival mode you're placed in a chosen or random region and have one life and one mission. Stay alive as long as possible.\nHow hard is it? 4 difficulty levels.\nPilgrim: For your 7 year old or if you want to look around in complete safety and learn mechanics.\nVoyager: For your first serious game with a few minor challenges, but you'll have plenty of resources in no time.\nStalker: For knowledgeable gamers who understand the mechanics fairly well. It's a healthy challenge.\nInterloper: You better know the maps. Punishing and unforgiving. Very intense.

When I stop playing The Long Dark, I feel exactly like that. Not [i]really[/i] of course, but my brain believes it. The Long Dark is really immersive.\n\nThe difficulty is also something to savour. You don't have to fight a single living thing and can still die an embarrassing death. Just today, I managed to walk in big circles twice. In a game. Jesus.\n\nI was also too afraid to go out at night because of big bad wolves and cold, but then I finally did go out. And the game stunned me with the sky. I wished I could just lie down on the snow and gaze.\n\nThen the music started playing. The beautiful soft music by the amazing Cris Velasco & Sascha Dikiciyan.\n\nI couldn't stay in one spot for too long, though, because I'd freeze soon. So I started walking when, on the horizon, I saw a house! With smoke coming out its chimney, goddamn, it was beautiful. Should be some food in it so I was definitely not going to die of hunger. At least not tonight.\n\nBut then I realized it's the house I took off from. God dammit.\n\n[b]Update:[/b] Two negative reviews have gotten to the top and they raise some understandable points with regards to gameplay mechanics and features. I strongly suggest you watch some gameplay videos to see if these issues might be game-breaking for you - you never know. The game cannot be 100% realistic in all manners and makes some adjustments to some of the mechanics such as durability of tools and clothes, etc.\n\nPersonally, I really don't mind them because to me, The Long Dark still offers lots of beautiful experiences, great gameplay and immersiveness which I'm oh so enjoying. But, be warned, you might be expecting something a bit different from the game than what it offers and these might not be due to the game being in Alpha but simply a core aspect of the game itself - so read/video up on it and decide for yourself!", "timestamp_created": 1411402440, "timestamp_updated": 1480114781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 936, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.937566697597503662", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12222718": {"recommendationid": "12222718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005622066", "num_games_owned": 838, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 5797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1586538891}, "language": "english", "review": "They fixed everything I whinged about back in 2014-15 and then some.

Probably because getting immersed in The Long Dark you discover each day something new. But here it is: The Long Dark isn\u2019t your typical zombie survival game. You get an even more challenging opponent: the nature. After a geomagnetic storm, the climate of the earth has changed and you have to survive no matter what in the harsh weather that keeps throwing challenges at you each day. Zombie apocalypse? Neah. Trust me I have played a lot of survival games, old and new and this one is by far my favourite. Being lost in blizzard without seeing almost anything, the cold decimating your body as you struggle to advance slowly with your clothes starting to freeze and the nearby  sound of growling  wolves  beats any survival experience. The game has a set of skills which you can improve as a human being. You need to learn how to cook, start a fire, fish, craft clothes from the animals you hunt, gadgets to fight the nature, and lately even ammo for your guns. And each day you discover new places to visit in this deserted world. Just you and the nature. But at the end of the day, after you have gathered a few more supplies, cooked your food, made sure you have enough water supply and firewood, you can take a second to admire the beautiful landscapes that the Canadian wilderness has to offer you. Or even get out of your shelter at night to watch the sky filled with stars or the aurora borealis if you are lucky\nAfter soo much time played i can assure you you will still have a lot more to learn about The Long Dark. The visual and audio effects of the nature are gorgeous, the music steps quietly sometimes to  beautify your surroundings and each new zone you explore becomes part of your memory. Cause yeah, you create your own map of your steps, you have to remember key locations on each area , and the dangers they come up with. I have found tons of strategies of how to avoid/kill the wolf packs, hunt a bear or a moose. And trust me when I say this. The hostile animals can be unforgiving when you venture outside to ensure your survival. You have to make sure your guns are ready, you have proper clothing to survive a fight without much dmg taken, and of course check out that you have a sunny day to venture outside. WHY? Cause you only have one chance at this. If you die it is game over and you have to start again from scratch.\nYou can see the devs poured their hearts and souls on this one. Starting from a small team, Hinterlands has managed to create an outstanding game over the passing of time, to start the storyline campaign and they struggle each day to give the players something new. Even in these pandemic times we live in. As opposed to other survival games that got stuck in early access, The Long Dark si still moving on. Each year you get new areas to explore on survival mode and the storyline, although slow is still progressing. Apart from that you get challenges and when I say challenges you will find out what I mean if you play the game. Getting chased by an old bear full of arrows through the blizzard, without having enough time to get proper clothes, food or other supplies beats any horde of zombies in my opinion. But, hey, that is just my 2 cents about it.\nI could write you things about this game all day, all night. I could even make video guides that would make others\u2019 pale in comparison. But wouldn\u2019t it be more fun if you discover what you are build of? If you are not a patient person and you tend to slack off on a survival game, don\u2019t buy this one. The nature will  take you as her price in an instant. It is as close as it can get to surviving in real time conditions in the cold. Experienced survivalists have tried this one and they were amazed. Of course, you need to be mindful that this is still a game, not the real stuff. But still, an awesome experience. A lot of players invested time in it to create guides and maps for the areas you explore, so yeah, you can get a lot of help now if you need it. If not, do as I did, and try to make your own memory line of this game. It will become a small part of you\nI wrote this review now because Christmas is near. And yeah, I tend to play a lot more than usual this game during winter season because it\u2019s nice to open your window, look at the snow outside and then get back to the wilderness in The Long Dark.

I actually feel pretty good about it. I've seen everything this game has to offer. I've tackled all the challenges and earned all the achievements.

Your plane crashed; it's cold; the wolves are hungry; the bear is angry; no one is around to help; and you've got to do whatever it takes to survive.\n\nWhat exactly does that mean?  At first, it means following your standard survival game behaviors.  Find shelter.  Find food.  Find water.  Don't let the wildlife eat you as you scour the frozen waste for the things you need.  But what separates The Long Dark from other survival games is that, ultimately, it also means learning the skills to procure those things for yourself.  Want to eat next week?  Better learn to hunt, because the cans of pork and beans you found in that gas station aren't going to last forever.  Want to not die of exposure?  Better learn to tell when a blizzard is coming, because it turns out building a fire in the middle of one is damned near impossible.  Want to look like a rock star?  Better learn to tan a deer hide and sew your own leather pants then--because remember, THERE'S NO ONE AROUND TO HELP.\n\nIn this game, you're facing off against Mother Nature one on one.

Not only that, but the scenario of the game is pretty unique, one that has not really been explored enough, or at least given proper raw representation of what it is to be trapped in a cold environment, surrounded by snow and dangerous wild life. It does, in my opinion, a fantastic job of putting the player in a such a brutal situation where common logic dictates their means of staying alive.\n\nThe Long Dark has come such a long way from its Early Access days, a development process that did indeed take time to iron out all of the bugs, mechanics, A.I., graphics and continued to grow and become a staple in the survival genre. It is really a remarkable achievement of both love and care from the fine people at Hinterland Studios for bringing us a product that was honestly necessary for this genre to evolve. It was clearly stagnating and wasn't really going anywhere, since the majority of survival games had pretty major flaws to them and only a handful were able to blend both the mechanics and atmosphere to give the sense of urgency and, most importantly, fun.\n\nYou are given the choice to either play the story mode of the game or simply go out in the wilderness and survive as long as you can. Whatever you choose, the gameplay remains the same. Make sure you stay warm, make sure you're fed and hydrated, make sure you are rested, and, of course, make sure you don't die. Sounds simple enough, but the beauty of The Long Dark lies in its presentation. Everything from the environments to the sound design are amazing. The maps are so large and, because of this, the game promotes exploration as means of obtaining resources for survival. As hard as the game can be, even stressful at times since you are constantly trying to find shelter, fighting against the weather and avoiding predators, it does have its moments of pure relaxation when you are walking down the road with the sun hitting your face while the calmness of the area around you gives the sense of hope.\n\nFrom what I have played so far, I can say for sure that The Long Dark is perhaps the greatest survival game ever made, managing to set the bar really high for any future survival game. With an emphasis on atmosphere and exploration, Hinterland have beautifully crafted a brilliant game that awakens your nature inside and force you to make your critical decisions and mistakes. It's cold, it's scary, it's beautiful and it's going to keep you coming back for more.

Here's how it works...\n\nYou wake up in the snow after your plane has gone down. WIth no idea as to where you are, cold, shivering, you need to find shelter fast and keep a sharp eye out for predators. Once you've found a cabin or such, you need to start thinking about the basics of survival. Water. A warm place to rest. Food. Clothing that can survive the harsh blizzards. A weapon to fend off wolf attacks. To gain the answer to these problems you must explore. At first you'll find yourself raiding abandoned cars and houses, trying not to think about the dead bodies scattered here and there following an as yet undetailed catastrophe. But the cans of pop and candy bars and such you scavange are only a temporary answer. Soon you'll have to look to be self-sufficient. \n\nSurvive the first few nights and odds are you can survive a couple of weeks. Survive those two weeks and you might survive a month. Survive that and... who knows? The genius of the game is that it perfectly balances risk, need, fear and greed. You can get carried away and suddenly discover that you've neglected something vital - something life endangering. Forget to stay stocked with fuel and you could perish from being marooned in a cave by a blizzard. Fail to carry bandages with you and you might bleed out from a wolf bite on the snowy wastes. Dehydration especially is a danger. (And no, like in real life simply eating snow will not save you.) \n\nIt can be a punishing game at first. Nothing is explained. I didn't know how to make tinder plugs or melt snow in my first game and quickly died after I ran out of my last can of fizzy goodness. But I made darn sure I figured it out the next game. The more you play, the more you find yourself thinking logically and weighing up the risks. Which is all well and good until you become obsessed about getting a bearskin bedroll and end up dooming yourself to be a chewy snack for DiCaprio's growly chum. Happily there's an excellent forum at the Hinterland website, which is very friendly. I strongly recommend it if you have trouble sussing out the game mechanics. \n\nLastly I want to talk about what makes this game truly special. It's the marriage of beautifully crafted graphics with to my mind the best sound design since Battlefield: Bad Company 2's War Tapes. At first glance the graphics appear simplistic. But you quickly come to appreciate them as being truly evocative, especially in terms of weather. Seeing the deep tread of your footprints as you hear the muffled scrumpf of snow underfoot. Watching a sunrise from the porch of your farmhouse in the morning; a hot cup of coffee a personal treat to celebrate narrowly surviving a blizzard the previous day, as you finally recognised the tell-tale signs of an oncoming storm. Looking up to see the high altitude trade winds carrying aloft the first wave of a fresh snow. And the chilly haunting fog that closes in as you return home in the late evening, a brace of coneys over your shoulder. Even simple things like waking up in the cabin and hearing the walls creak and the windows rattle as the wind blows outside... man, this game is the most atmospheric I've ever played.\n\nSo sure it's tough. And yes, wolves are unnaturally terrifying. But as soon as you come to terms with your inevitable death. As soon as you begin to treat it not as a game but as a real question of survival for yourself. And as soon as you learn to let go of trying to max everything out and just enjoy... existing... in this wonderful world HInterland have crafted. Well, then you'll find you've made something really special. Plus you can keep a journal in game!\n\nAny gripes? Each map could do with a forge, and whetstones really shouldn't break after a couple of dozen uses. (I know, game mechanic, but it's unnecessarily cruel.) Also rifles should have a longer effective range and arrows should be more available. Some items, like the maple needed to make a bow, seem unnecessarily rare and tricky to find.) And there should be a little starter guide with a few early-game lifesaving tips bundled with the game in the main menu. And I wish my character would quit complaining all the time about being hungry! It's good to be ravenous and make supplies last!\n\nDespite these niggles the game as it stands at this point in Early Access really is something quite magnificent. It is a transporting game that will have you feeling terrified at times, proud at others and most of all have you feeling that the little farmhouse in the valley has become a place of your own, a place that you can call home in a hostile world. With a story mode to come this game only looks set to become better, but for now I feel that I've definitely got my money's worth on the entrance fee. Congratulations HInterlands for recognising that surviving the natural world can be more thrilling than surviving yet another rehashed zombie invasion, and that the simple joy of felling a deer and filling one's pantry with venison as significant a victory as saving the planet in a shoot-em-up from the evil Emperors RaxinFraxin and Dixdastardlax.\n\n9/10\n\nP.S: You can find answers to many of those early game vexing questions here: http://hinterlandgames.com/join-the-community/\n", "timestamp_created": 1461625865, "timestamp_updated": 1461625865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 195, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925871193408966064", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18784652": {"recommendationid": "18784652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042113623", "num_games_owned": 463, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 8114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2565, "last_played": 1686284575}, "language": "english", "review": "The single most terrifying game ever made. And not cheap terror like a teleporting white guy in a suit that magically kills you no matter what you do. Not random jump scares. Not even with a monster or killer. Your own mind scares you. You're alone. You don't really know why, but everybody is dead, covered in frost and dead. All of the wolves are rabid and deadly, sure, (9/10 deaths will be to wolves) but they arent the scary thing. the cold isnt the scary thing. Nothing in the game is scary, and yet it's terrifying. It's the isolation. You. Are. Alone.\n\n   After a few hours in a session if you've got a headset on and no distractions, every bookself becomes a serial killer. The creaks and groans of the old buildings are a monster creeping up on you. You know you are safe yet you are terrified. You set up your sleeping bag in the corner of a building so nothing can be behind you when you wake up. You waste matches or lantern oil to see in a building you've already looted and know the route of because the dark is scary. The isolation is simply torture, and i love to dread it. 10/10 for atmosphere.\n\n   As for the game itself... well, you're in northern canada and there's no electricity, and everybody is dead. Don't freeze. Don't starve. Don't get mauled by a wolf. The game is fairly realistic, one killed deer or wolf can sustain you for a long time, their hides are warm, and the wolves aren't zombies. They run if you throw a flare or swing a torch. All the mechanics are solid and they still claim it to be alpha. It's worth a purcase now, and they still regularly add things - just imagine what it could become. If you are any kind of fan of indie games, sandbox survival games, or real psychological terror, then this game is a 100% neccassary purchase. Wishlist it, right now, or better yet buy it. \n\n   If you want to see some footage as preview to see if its worth it, i reccomend \"Splattercat\" he's an ex geologist meaning he knows a lot about how to not die when you're in the wilderness hours from a town, and so he mentions what makes sense and what doesnt. But seriously, toss these devs a bone, let's make them rich, so they can finish the game and go on to make more awesome games. These guys put actual heart into the game, and that's rare lately.\n\n*New Addition to Review* Clarification on the three \"difficulties\" the \"easy mode\" is minecraft peaceful, nothing to kill you but your own stupidity. not reccomended. \"Normal\" is wolves and bears, wolves rabid, bears cool as long as you dont shoot them - and you back off if they stand on hind legs and roar (basically them saying \"f*** off\") - they're cool and wolves even avoid them, so keeping one near your base isnt an awful idea, although killing one will sustain you for weeks.  Hard mode is zombie apocalypse basically. if you want to be mauled to death every five minutes, go ahead. All this review is refering to the \"normal\" mode, i don't advise either of the others aside from if you think you want a real challenge... of luck (If you find a rifle before you find 60 wolves).", "timestamp_created": 1446271158, "timestamp_updated": 1664594549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 370, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.924705147743225098", "comment_count": 29, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22369996": {"recommendationid": "22369996", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999490358", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 27595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5012, "last_played": 1690613631}, "language": "english", "review": "The Long Dark. It can and will catch you unawares, even if you consider yourself one of the most prepared.\n\nIt was on my 79th day that things started to go horribly wrong. I wandered off from the gas station I had for the past 40 days considered safe haven. I had a gallon of water, a rifle with plenty of ammo, and enough food to last me a night should I get stranded. It wasn't enough.\n\nI always thought it would be the wolves that would get me. They had been traveling in packs of 2-3 lately; if all of them came at me, surely I would take down one, maybe two, but I knew if a pack came at me I would be wolf bait. I was wrong. As I wandered up the coast, it started to get cold, as night drew closer. I heard an eerie baying close by - a wolf. I prepared myself, searching in all directions. It came charging, snarling and snapping its jaws. I took it down, but then I heard more growling - its pack. I knew standing my ground was a death sentence, so I ran, and I ran. To my luck, I came across a sea side cottage, to which I quickly escaped the snapping jaws of death in its enclosure. \n\nI thought to myself \"I'll just stay the night here, let the wolf pack wander off.\" I foraged around for food - there wasn't much. Some salty crackers, a soda, and some frozen cooked rabbit. I drank half of my water, and ate some of my cooked wolf jerky that I had in my pack and began to kip for the night. \n\nI awoke to the screaming howl of the wind the next morning. I poked my head out and surely enough pure white out conditions. It had to have been at least -40, and going out would be just as surely a death sentence as the wolf pack was. I hunkered down, sipped my water and gnawed the last bits of the jerky as I drifted off to sleep to the symphony of cracking trees and ice falling. I woke a few hours later. The wind had died down! It was time. I drank the last of my water, and ate the cooked rabbit I had retrieved from the freezer previously.\n\nThis was a mistake. Not long after I finished the rabbit, there was the gut wrenching pain. I knew instantly: Food poisoning. I forced down some antibiotics I kept in my med kit, laid down praying for it to go away, or the release of a quick death. The wolves didn't sound so bad, now. I drifted off to darkness...\n\nI awoke several hours later, the sun was just rising. I was starving, thirsty, and the howling wind was louder than ever. I had no choice. I steeled myself, eating the last few saltines in my pack, greedily drinking the soda I had found before leaving the house.\n\nI immediately bolted. I knew with this cold, I had very little time to get to safety. I ran and ran, only stopping mere moments to catch my breath. I was soon freezing, and I had no idea how much further I had to go. Soon, numbness set in, I stopped shivering, my body was giving up. I knew I had to keep pressing on. Finally there was a familiar car in the road. I was almost there! \n\nI was exhausted, I stumbled past the car. I could see the feint outline of the gas station through the wind and snow. There was hope! A few steps from the door I heard a growl; I turned around but it was too late. I couldn't fight  the wolf. I was too tired, too cold, too numb.

Yes!\nRecommended? Do your research.[/i]\n\n[h1]A Diamond in the Rough[/h1]\n[b][i]TL;DR at bottom for those who don't like reading[/i][/b]\n\nThis game, despite being early access and made by an independent developer team, is, put frankly, THE BEST survival game on the market right now.\n\nContent updates have fleshed out the game mechanics and play area to the point where I can't give it a negative review. The dev team is so dedicated to this work of art, and this dedication is what sets it apart from all of the other same-old copy-paste zombie-survival trash that's been pumped out these past couple of years. It's one of the few early access games I've bought into that actually made an active, wholehearted effort to get released. It was almost entirely funded by fans on kickstarter, so they don't have any higher-ups to answer to, unlike most other dev teams. They have the creative freedom to deliver a product under their own vision. This is key; it is one of the main points that make this game a success and allows them to set the bar high for other survival-game developers to shoot for. The team pours tons of hours of hard work into their product, and their going the extra mile shows in the polish of the general gameplay and visual art style.\n\nGameplay is brutal and unforgiving, with your character being given only one shot to make it as many days as you can in the everlasting post-apocolyptic winter you trudge through, searching for supplies just to make it out on top one day at a time. In the sandbox, you forge your own path, be it to salvation or death. How will your story end?\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+ HUGE map. Like, REALLY fucking big. It'll take you a while to explore everything, and with the updates that keep rolling in, it'll only get bigger. There are many zones and transition areas that make traveling from place to place a real adventure. You never quite know what to expect on each journey through the various territories available.\n+ Brutal, but fair. Wolf killed you? Try planning a more efficient route next time for avoiding them. Run out of food? Set up snares by rabbit grounds, try fishing in a hut on a lake, or go hunting deer while staying watchful of your surroundings. No water? You should have boiled more snow when you had a fire going. Froze to death? Don't underestimate the power of mother nature, bud.\n+ Immersive. Isolation in the wild brings you back to reality. The game really puts you in the shoes of a survivor trying to make it just one more day. Hearing wolves howl when you're knee-deep in the snow at night while a blizzard begins to settle in is truly something that'll send some chills down your spine. The ambient noises of the wilderness, followed by a soundtrack that truly captures the essence of what it feels like to be all alone, makes you feel like you've got some skin in the game.\n+ Amazing, extremely dedicated developer team. These guys mean business. Being independent allows them to express themselves in the manner that they want, and without any set deadlines aside from the ones they make for themselves, nothing they do feels rushed or thrown out the door too early, unlike many of the AAA games we see now.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Some of the game mechanics are confusing to beginners. The game's got a steep learning curve. At first, you will find yourself getting killed long before your first week of life alone has even built some momentum. Over time, this becomes less and less of a problem, though even experienced players may find themselves caught off guard by a stray wolf or hungry, moody bear having an off-day.\n- Long wait period between updates. Though when content actually gets released, there are tons of new features provided, it might take a few months or so of testing until content gets pushed from the test branch (unstable) to the main release (stable). Some may not like this, but it goes a long way towards ensuring quality control in the long run.\n- Slow paced. Again, some people might not like this, but due to the concept of the game itself, it's not something that can really be changed. This is a survival game, not Call of Duty. Your gameplay will take place over the course of potentially months or years (in-game time, not IRL) if you're good.\n\n[h1]Score: 9/10[/h1]\n[b]TL;DR?[/b] This is a great survival game for pitting yourself against mother nature and testing your skills against wildlife and harsh climates. It is a slow paced, brutal game of attrition that will see to your inevitable demise.

But what come next is the best experience this game ever gave me.\n\nA heavy wind and storm came out of nowhere and blew off my cozy fire. I was getting cold and beginning to get tired. I tried to start another fire but the wind was just too strong, no luck. It was getting dark and all I got in my inventory is a cup of coffee, a bunch of matches and four flares. After serval minutes, sunlight was out and I could see nothing, pitch black. \n\nI walked forward aimlessly in the hope that I could find a shelter. Five minutes went by, felt like an hour, I lit my first flare. I could only see no further than 3 meters. In order to avoid going in circle or lost in the woods, I stick to a mountain on my right and kept walking.\n\nhttps://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/97221552647251719/D35C2BD09DC150A81B203EE57D7D87ABCBE0FDB4/\n\nIn the following two minutes, I walk close to the mountain of rocks through a blizzard with the only light source coming from the flare that I was holding.\nI didn't dare to run knowing I would be exhausted. I didn\u2019t want to stop either, you can't be certain when will the blizzard stop. You may close your eye and never open again, never be found in this middle of nowhere.\n\nThe first flare is dead, I lit the second one. All sort of objects pass by as I walk forward. Trees, braches, rocks, debris... but not a single shelter. My character started to breathe heavily because of cold, ironically, I in real-life was sweating and hot. I start feeling desperate and blaming myself for not planning ahead before I went on this adventure. I was deep in my own thought, can't remember what I was thinking at that moment. All I can remember is the damn blizzard and the sound of the lighting flare in front on my face. \n\nSecond flare goes off, I rested near a tree and checked my backpack. Two flares left and a cup of coffee I boiled that morning which was cold by then. I drank it thinking I might as well make the most of it while I can. I lit the third flare and kept going. A minute later, I worried that I was walking in circle, so I think \"oh well, nothing to lose at this point\" and leave the rocks on my right. After a minute or so, out of nowhere... I saw some sort of wooden bulletin board with a frozen corpse in front of it. The board has a picture of a lookout with an arrow pointing upward.\n\nI was excited, I lit my last flare and walked along the mountain road and stayed close to the railing. Not long later I found the location call \"Forestry Lookout\".\n\nhttps://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/97221552647251851/682E7F796BCC5C7A8645A871E3DDD955F9C702AE/\n\nI walked inside, slammed the door, cut the chair I saw for woods, and started a fire before I went to bed.\n\nNext morning is the calmest morning I ever experienced, lovely sunrise, warm temperature, full of hope. I quitted the game and wondering what the hell just happened.\n\nBut damn\u2026 that's the most immersive feeling of dying I ever felt in a video game. \nImagine you just staring at a mostly black monitor with a red glowing light in the middle and white particles flying in every direction.

Maybe in any other year, I would have said that The Long Dark was merely Excellent. Maybe I would have put it in the top ten. But fortunately for The Long Dark, the 1.43 version release that updated Wintermute came out in 2018.\n\nAnd in 2018, there is no competition, what so ever.\n\nI mean it. This is the game of the year. This is number one. No other game comes close.\n\nUp until this release, I would have said the survival mode was amazing and fun to play, but the story mode was... the tutorial. Just something there to screw around with. I played it once, and had no intention of going back to play it, ever again. I rushed through it to get it over with.\n\nNow that we have the Wintermute Redux (Ep 1&2), I rushed through it, but that was so I get get to posting my review of the game as quickly as possible. I have every intention of playing story mode several more times. There are at least three other choices I'd like to make. There are a number of side quests I blew past that I am eager to go explore and see what was done with them.\n\nThe storyline before was... rough... to be charitable. Now? Now it is sublime. The acting is vastly improved. The quality of the cut scenes is top notch. The return to a more traditional Story structure really pays off in this revamping of the rough draft that was the previous incarnation of the Wintermute story.\n\nThe NPCs that you meet that are your allies, you feel sympathy for. The NPCs that are your enemies, you feel rage against. There are so many subtle details added in. If you just want to run through the main plot, you aren't doing yourself any service. There are many subtle subplots lurking beneath the surface. If you look for them, they can be found to be enjoyed, and yet, they do not distract from the main quest. There is so much attention to detail. So many stories told without a word. So much meaning behind a trail of blood through the sparkling snow.\n\nThe tightening up of the time table to play the story mode also does it justice. It concentrates the good parts so that the story doesn't drag and keeps the heat on, making you feel like there is urgency and keeps you driving forward. The interactions with many NPCs have also been vastly improved. In the previous version, I wanted to shoot the old lady in the face, she ticked me off so much. But now? I genuinely feel a pang of regret at having to leave her. There are moral dilemmas that put your situation into sharp relief, which I will not spoil here, but such simple choices have sparked great debates on the forums.\n\nThe recurring character of Methuselah is also a welcome addition to the story, for he serves as an excellent framing device. Before he had but a minor part. Now he fits into the unfolding drama so well, I can't imagine him not having been serving in this capacity before. Dare I say it? I actually LIKE the characters now. And my questions are answered! The Plot holes are filled in! The continuity is top notch! There was one note I found that, well, to explain it would spoil it, but the dread at finding that particular note in that particular location was a palatable thing. I don't know if you understand the meaning of the term, \"Fridge Horror\", but it means that when watching a story, some time later it sinks in exactly what happened, and that's when the horror blooms.\n\nIt was beautiful in its' terrifying implications.\n\nThe newly redone Jeremiah is a joy to behold. The voice work is amazing, the animations truly bring him to life. I assume they hired a professional actor and did motion capture, because that's the only way they could have picked up the subtle nuance that makes this character so facinating.\n\nAnd the main plot line... not to give too much away, but the old bear... oh... that old bear... Before that old bear was a major annoyance. Defeating the bear in the previous incarnation was a grind. The current finale, oh ho! Perfect. THAT is what I expect in a final boss battle. I expect to barely cross the finish line after slugging it out against impossible odds. When I stumbled back to Jeremiah, I felt I had EARNED that victory. And the backstory of that bear, the lamp shading, the myths and realities... oh... So good. Just so good.\n\nAnd that's just the improvements to the story mode.\n\nThe survival game has had a large number of improvements given to it as well. The addition of new items have, in my opinion, breathed new life into the Broken Railroad map. The addition of radio towers to the Forlorn Muskeg map serve both a purpose in the Story mode, as well as drawing attention to areas that previously many players would have missed.\n\nThe addition of the Rabbit hat means that finally we can craft a hat after wolf and bear attacks have shredded our head gear. This means every surface that could be subject to frostbite can now be covered with crafted clothing.\n\nThe new Well Fed mechanic is an, and I don't use the word lightly, ELEGANT solution to the problem of players hoarding too much food in the mid to late stage. This sort of outside the box thinking towards game balance is exactly the sort of thing I want to see.\n\nThe real story here is to see that HLG has finally managed to make the Story Mode about the STORY and the Survival mode about SURVIVAL. I didn't think they were ever going to get it done. I wasn't sure it was possible. I thought, given the type of game, story mode was just always going to be the red-headed stepchild of The Long Dark.\n\nTo see the Wintermute storyline finally come into its own is a joy. A ray of hope in an otherwise gloomy, dismal year of disappointment and the lingering stench of failure and rotting loot boxes.\n\nRaphael, the designer of The Long Dark, has restored my faith in humanity. It is still possible for beautiful, fun games to be created that are designed to be... fun. Just Fun. Nothing else. A game that is fun and exciting and interesting and gets you to care, just for the sake of being fun. There are many game designers who could learn a thing or a hundred twenty eight from Raphael.\n\nHe has knocked it out of the park. He has taken a mid court 3-point shot and hit nothing but net. Whatever sports metaphor you prefer, this was a complete, and utter success on ever level.\n\nIs it \"perfect\"? No. However, the few quibbling concerns I have are more a personal preference, then any slam against the story or game design. The people who play the long dark are a diverse lot, so some of us are going to like certain things, and others will hate said things. This is the nature of game design. No game can be all things to all people. But DAMN did it come as close as humanly possible!\n\nI could go into many details about what exactly it is that I like about this latest version of The Long Dark, but at this point I have to get into spoilers and I'd prefer to keep this free of that as much as possible.\n\nInstead I will just state that the level of detail, care, and effort that has gone into this revision of the game is astounding. This was a labor of love and it shows. Someone BLED red and crimson to make this. You do not get this level of craftsmanship and storytelling without tearing out your own heart. It is clear that talent didn't just go into this redux, but pain as well. Nothing of this quality is made without it.\n\nAnd I thank the ones who suffered for this art, because this was just phenomenal. Slow clap. Standing ovation. Drop balloons. Ignite fireworks. Take a bow.\n\nYou earned it, Hinterland Games.\n\nYou. Earned.

Players have been raiding shelves and garbage cans for decades now, and it's hard to argue the popularity of Elder Scrolls and Fallout games is not thanks in part to the immense amount of junk you can scavenge. The Long Dark feels like an entire game built around looting, giving your lizard brain tingles every time your progress bar is interrupted by a new item. That's selling the game short, and I'll fix that, but when you're on a somber trek through a featureless snowfield, aching for a dresser to upturn, you'll remember I said that.\n\nThe Long Dark strands you in the northern wilderness of Canada in the wake of a mysterious geomagnetic event. All the people are dead, all the animals are acting weird, and all the electricity is out. You have four bars to manage if you want to survive: Temperature, fatigue, hunger, and thirst. Scrounging up leftovers and boiling snow will cover the latter two, sleeping in beds and not running everywhere will keep your fatigue down, but traversing the wilderness will freeze you fast, making warmth your most sought-after resource. The game offers a pretty robust survival sim, with many interactions between objects. You can break things down for materials to repair other things, craft tools like bows and fishing lines, and cook and store food. Just making a fire is its own skill, involving starters and fuels and accelerants and chances to fail based on all that and where you're making the attempt. A clean and slick menu interface keeps you from staring at lists too long to accomplish all this, which is some very welcome design.\n\nA big part of the game (at least early on) is indeed finding houses to loot and clicking on all the containers, while being mindful of how much you can carry. In between looting sprees, however, are journeys across the frozen wilds. The Long Dark does not screw around here, as getting lost in the woods or running into some unpleasant wildlife can very quickly be the end of you. You need plenty of daylight for exploring, and if you're lacking warm clothes you really cannot stay out very long. When one of your resource bars, such as temperature, bottoms out, it starts a percentage countdown. When that hits zero, you die. Just being outside on a windy day for an hour or two can take your bar to zero, so you have to plan all your actions carefully. Intensive activities like chopping wood or fishing are abstracted to take up to an hour unto themselves, too. The constant threat makes the game an intense survival simulator, but the barren wastes between shelters that facilitates this design can get kind of boring to traverse.\n\nThere are three difficulties to play on, depending on how eager you are to have wolves snap your appendages in half. You can also start in different areas once you find the paths to them from the starter zone, which can change your experience dramatically. The maps are not randomly generated, so having a few hours of exploration under your belt will most definitely help you survive longer. It seems that the game is designed around scavenging and getting your bearings for the first few days, and then transitioning to hunting and foraging for food and wood in true mountain man style to survive further. It's a long road to get there, though, with a lot of traipsing across snowfields and forest paths, but the painted art style and minimalist soundtrack make the solitude meaningful, and give the game a somber, melancholy feel. If you have the patience for planning long, deadly walks through the wastes, this is a solid survival choice.", "timestamp_created": 1448843638, "timestamp_updated": 1448843638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 168, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912333488464355469", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32480757": {"recommendationid": "32480757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121201036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3842, "last_played": 1681601816}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember my first game, I cranked up the difficulty because why not, I'm familiar with northern canada.

I get face to face with a big black deranged wolf, who proceeds to ravage my face despite my furious '' torch brandishing'' technique.

As soon as I was able to persuade my parents to get it for myself, I was glued to its universe and still find it such a fascinating world even as an adult-- perhaps moreso, because I'm older now and can appreciate its production quality/timeline. It's also incredibly refreshing to be able to play a game that beautifully harnesses natural fear and tension instead of cheap jumpscares or loud noises for the sake of just startling; not only does this game cleverly harness my anxieties in a rather positive and cathartic way, but the psychological terror of fighting every step to survive in a vast open world of snowy regions long since abandoned by their former rulers is absolutely riveting.\n\nAnd every time I hear the music or see the art style of this game, I am swept back up into the cool windy embrace of those howling lands: The somber yet hopeful cello, the taut apprehensive violin, the flowing ivories of the piano... All of the sound design and art of this game feels so unique and has been such an impact on me growing up, so much so that I'll probably never truly realize just how much its very existence has inspired me and my work/love of creating. \n\nThe concept of surviving as long as you can in the quiet apocalypse is simple, yet expertly executed in my eyes. Everything from scavenging to exploring feels balanced, or like actually trying to survive in the wild, even in the later stages of the game-- my dying to a wolf just before reaching 100 Days is certainly proof of that (and I haven't even tried for 500 yet!). The first time I succumbed to the long dark is also memorable, though reflective of my earlier naivety when I accidentally over-corrected my balance and fell off of the train tracks traversing between Coastal Highway and Mystery Lake. But, as embarrassing as my fatal noob mistake was, I hopped right back into another save to begin anew! And that cycle has certainly continued, with the spirit of open-world survival being loyally and consistently kindled through the game's incredibly immersive atmosphere and passionate well-combined mechanics. It always perfectly scratches that itch I get whenever I need to disconnect my brain from reality and enjoy living in a virtual open world, navigating the copious yet unique regions and exploring what all they have to offer my hoarder side.\n\nI've never had another game enrapture my mind in such an intensely beautiful way like The Long Dark does. Any time a friend even remotely reminds me of this game, I encourage them to get it for themselves if able, in the hopes that they experience even a sliver of the sheer wonder this game has faithfully provided me through the years.

I have hunkered down in a coastal cottage close to a fishing den. I have stock piled all the collected food I could from other cottages, and thanks to that den I have an unlimited supply of fresh fish to sate my hunger.\n\nThere are a pack of wolves who test the boundries of my camp daily, but they run off easily enough. It is the bear that I have seen multiple times, including on my front porch that I truly have to concern myself with. Luckily he ran off instead of try to take the arm load of fresh salmon  I snuck back into the house.\n\nI venture out daily, collecting more wood and searching for any other signs of life. I do not know how long I can remain here, my hatched and saw only have so much life left to break out decent fire wood. When the time comes that I am left with nothing but twigs to make fire with, I will be forced to venture out further in search for real tools.\n\nDay 24:\nYou have no idea the true worth of a good hatchet until yours breaks. I plundered a local mine to get twice my weight in coal to stock pile back at the lighthouse, but it has become clear I am going to have to move back towards the lake if I want fresh food. You can only drink so much evaporated milk. \nI have moved my stocks closer to the coastal townsite to allow myself better access to the work bench here. Snares have become just as important to me as fishing line. I have realised that fishing may not be the best way to ensure  fresh food. That thread is just as important for mending my cloths so it looks like hunting is the way to go.\nThe storms seem stronger now than when I first arrived. I have spent days cooped up in the cottage waiting on the blasted wind to die down before heading out to collect wood and tinder. But I have learned to pace myself on making fire and do what I can when what little light comes through the windows is available.\nWhat I wouldn't do for a conversation with anyone other than myself.\n\nDay 35:\nI have a rather large collection of dog food in my pantry. I have yet to stoop so low as to eat any of it, but it is there should the need arise. \nI decided to do some exploring yesterday, there was a road heading up the mountain so I set off at first light to see what I could find. I have three more cans of dogfood in my pack, and a mountaineer rope which I found in this old ranger station at the top of the mountain. You would think I would celebrate such a find, but at the halfway point of the mountain I was caught in a blizzard and sprained my ankle. I was so far from any shelter I just pushed through, and it turned into the slowest, coldest, most agonizing walk of my life. \nSomehow I made it though. And I found a new book to read while I wait out the storm, thankfully there were enough large trees to break down for a fire to keep me warm. \nThe storm did eventually pass, and I am left staring out at this eerie green fog that prevents me from seeing anything around me. When the sun rises, I will venture a bit further on this ridge to see if I can find any other structures. Then I will head back down, I am craving some of that salmon I have stored in my freezer.\n\nDay 41:\nI have bagged myself TWO bears! I honestly am so high on adrenaline right now, I can barely think! It was only a couple days ago that I finally found an old rifle in one of the fishing huts. I had collected a handful of ammo some time ago and had decided I would never find anything to use them in. \nThen providence shifted in my direction and I saw the old black bear that stalks near the hut furthest from my camp. It took two shots. I had no idea I would have such good aim, but when he started charging me after the first shot, the second took him right in the face and down he went on the ice. The amount of meat on this guy! I took back a handful of dark red steaks to my cottage and immediate cooked it up. \nThen as I started to exit my cottage to collect some more wood.. THERE WAS A SECOND BEAR!!! Fear and pure luck saved me this time, it took three shots and the door of my cottage as a buffer to get this old guy down. Maybe he stalked me after I killed his brother? Who knows, but now I got both pelts curing next to the fire and I sit here sipping on some hot coffee and munching on one of the best meals I have had yet.\nToo bad no one is around to see how awesome I will look wearing my new bearskin coat.\n\nDay 47:\nWhat I have realised, if nothing else, about myself since this whole ordeal began, is that I am a hoarder.\nAfter having looted every cottage I could by the lake, I rested up and set out towards the coal mine at the top of the mountain to see if I could find some more lucrative finds. I took bare minimum with me to ensure I could carry anything useful along the way.\nBy the time I reached the farm house some 12 hours later I was so exhausted I could barely keep my eyes open. My feet were sluggish in the thick snow and I felt like an abused pack mule.. the jingles of my pack should have attracted every bear and wolf in the valley and I would have proven an easy meal, there was no way I could run this time.\nSomehow, I made it here. I have stashed all my prized finds in a locker I found in the basement and have realised this farmhouse is almost as sweet a spot to dig in as any. The only thing I am missing is the fishing huts, but I have seen rabbits everywhere as well as deer. \nThe only problem is... all the stuff I have left behind at the lake. It will take me multiple trips to get from the lake to the farm and back and I honestly don't know if it is worth it. I HAVE to go back to collect all the hides I have curing but can I really test my luck with so many wide open spaces in between? Wolves, Bears, or the blizzards that love to pop up when I am miles from shelter.. all these are things to consider. \nI will spend a couple days here in the valley, look for other structures and see what I can find. See if the weather proves as volatile here as it does down by the water.. There are TV's in almost every room in this farmhouse.

It's just the raw and unforgiving aspect of survival against nature.

At lower difficulties you're treated to a slow methodical almost meditative experience where the game more favours exploration over survival, which at first may sound boring however with such a distinctive aesthetic and brilliant weather system the long dark can have some truly beautiful moments such as watching a pack of wolves stalk a herd of deer across the ice on a foggy morning or watching the orange glow of the sun rise above the horizon after a long night of staving off starvation and hypothermia. \n\nHowever if the meditative lower difficulties aren't your style you can try the interloper or stalker difficulties this turns the long dark into a hardcore survival game where its you pitted against the elements, its in these higher difficulties that the game is most immersive. each game follows stages, the first being eating prepackaged food and water that you've scavenge and the wildlife being a nuisance more than a danger, the weathers calm and your biggest danger is yourself however that doesn't last and once mid game begins and your food is gone and your clothes have degraded you begin to feel the squeeze as your ammunition runs low after your 3rd wolf attack of the week, then  the weather gets worse and the pressure to survive is on and before you know it your sitting on the side of a mountain with 2 bullets and  no food, shivering in a shirt as a pack of wolves track you down for lunch.\n\n the game really conveys that feeling of hopelessness and feeling of loneliness perfectly and i would 100% recommend at least giving it a try Hinterland studios while small is dedicated to the game and continue to release episodes of winter mute (the story mode).

I wouldn't last 5 hours in Minecraft. But this game makes you feel like you can survive anything... until you run out of matches. \n\nFor example, here is how I last died. \nI ran into the Trapper's Homestead, sprinting to get out of the freezing cold wind. I was looking for food; peaches, candy, anything I could get in my belly. I looked through the locker, the box under the bed, the first aid kit on the wall, but didn't find anything but an old can opener. Then I looked up, and I swear I heard a heavenly chorus, because sitting on a rack on the wall was something so much more valuble than a granola bar. As I took the old hunting rifle off the wall, I felt a sense of awe come over me. I looked at the nicks and dents and thought of all the stories that they contain, and how many more tales I would write with this pen of steel and wood. After looking around a little more, I decided to try my hand at cracking the safe I found next to the workbench. After several tries I finally got the code down, and lo and behold, inside was a box of 5 rifle shells. By now I was feeling like Rambo. I would not die to this cruel world! \nI survived by hunting the game that I saw in the clearing in front of the homestead that I had claimed as my home, and cooking the meat that I carved off their collapsed frames. I lived this way for about a week, until one very important setback to my otherwise flawless plan - I ran out of matches. But I wouldn't let that tiny detail stop me; I am the great VinyGroundhog! I will not succumb to the meager needs of hunger or cold! And thus my journey begain. I searched from house to house for those tiny life-sticks, but each and every one had been picked clean on a previous venture. I realized that there was only one place where I could find what I needed, one place that I had avoided like the plague. I was going to have to tackle the dam. \nAs I walked into the dam, flare in hand, I looked for Fluffy the Terrible, Killer of Men and Crusher of Souls. I searched through the entire dam for this beast of legend, but nowhere was she to be found. Not able to contain my exitement, I set about looting the dam with a newfound vigor. I looked in the main room. No matches. I looked in the closet. No matches. I looked in the control room. Still, no matches. Soon I reached the conlusion that I was going to have to go downstairs. I walked down the first set of stairs, and as I rounded the corner, there was a nightmare standing in front of me. I stared at Fluffy, and she at me. We stood at a sort of stalemate for around thirty seconds. And then I ran like a coward. I made it up the stairs and Almost made it out when I was knocked down from behind. As I looked at those menacing jaws that I had fallen to so many times before, I knew that I was nearing my end. We struggled for what  seemed an eternity, and then I finally kicked the evil beast off of me, turning and sprinting through the door as fast as I could. By now it was night, and probably had been for a while. I struggled away from that horrible place, blood dripping down into the snow beneath. I looked around in my pack, and found nothing to treat my wounds. I walked along the train tracks, freezing, starving, dehydrated, and bleeding to death. I looked around and saw that I wasn't going to make it. But I refused. I would not die on the terms of a wolf, no matter that it sent me here. And then I thought of a way that I could stand up to the tyranny of the wolf. \nI sprinted to the logging area, and then I found the hill I was looking for. I started up the hill, made it a few yards, and subsequently fell off the hill and sprained my ankle. But I wouldn't let that stop me. I started back up the hill, limping this time, and made it farther, and farther, and farther without falling. And as I hobbled up the last few yards of the hill, freezing, starving, dehydrated, limping, and tired as anything, I saw the sun start to rise. I walked over to the edge of the hill, my vision rolling with every step, and sat down, leaning against a rock. And as my life reached its dusk, the world around me reached its dawn.\n\nThat is what this game does to you. It puts you on a high, which lasts a not inconsiderable time, and then it takes away one thing, and you begin this slow descent into your death. And that's why I love it. It's an Emotional rollercoaster. Everything that happens in the game impacts not only your in-game effigy, but you, as a living, breathing human being. However, there are a few things that I wouldn't mind changing...\n\nHinterland, If you're reading this, Please take note. \n\nThe game world is easily the loneliest one I have every encountered. It even beats pre-NPC Minecraft. Please fix this. Give me a dog, or better yet, multiplayer! What I wouldn't give to either help or hinder other players in the fight for survival.\n\nBirds. Everytime I see a bird in the game, all I can think about is the potential meat on those hollow bones. Just give me a way to hunt them, or trap them. a shotgun would be nice. \n\nAll things considered, this is a very good buy.

So i'll just give you the lowdown of my favorite playthrough (Of dozens of great ones) \n\nDay 1: \nPlane crashed somewhere in the woods near a frozen pond and a hunting blind. I found (much to my joy) two granola bars and a bottle of water. Walking through the cold, i picked up a few sticks and some lichen just in case i needed to start a fire. After about 5 minutes of walking i found an old logging camp with three trailer houses. I scavenged a promising amount of food, got some matches, and even found an out ski jacket to wear over my sweater. Exhausted, i spent the night. \n\nDay 2: \nI wake up rested and thirsty as hell. I pop open a soda and head out. It's early morning and freezing, but i need to find a suitable place to bunker down, and those little trailers werent it. Following the snow covered trail through the woods, i pass a forest overpass. It's a long hike up in freezing weather and deep snow so i decide against, moving further down the trail. Right as i start to wonder if i had made the wrong choice, i hit a small frozen lake full of Ice-fishing huts. I dot through them and find a good set of stuff before i decide to bunker down in one for a little rest. After a few failed attempts i get the fire in the furnace going. I hear the wind picking up outside, but thinking nothing of it. I lay out my bedroll by the fire for a few hours sleep. \nI wake up to what i was sure to be my death. \nThat light pickup of wind was a precursor to a blizzard. A bad one. The little hut was shaking and creaking in the storm, the opening (there was no door) let in frigid air and snow, putting out my fire and freezing me to the core. I gather my things in a panic. The storm is so fierce it's picking up snow that had settled on the ground, whiting out everything. I culdn't see five feet in front of me. Knowing staying in the hut would be my end, i blindly push into the storm, assumingly towards some camping lodges i saw when i first arrived. The wind cut straight through my clothes and the snow soaked my jeans, shoes and socks. My body trembled uncontrollably as heat was quite literally ripped from my body. After a few minutes the ice of the lake gave way to snow and i was sure i was close to salvation. I keep walking forward, waiting to see a beautiful log cabin any second.\nThen i walk straight into a rock wall.\nPanicking and wondering how the hell i got so turned around, i follow the wall, hoping beyond hope to find something to keep me safe until the blizzard gave way. I wasn't going to die yet, not here. I willed myself on, even when i felt so tired from the powerful wind i was ready to just drop. Eventually the rock wall gaveway to a some kind of house. Nearly collasping from relief, i get inside and fall asleep immediately, no energy left for anything else.\n\nDay 3:\nApparentely this used to be a park ranger station. It was obviously abandoned in haste, as plenty of things were still left over. The blizzard is still raging, but im safe inside, with a decent supply to last me a few days. I cut up some furniture for wood with the hatchet i found in the closet and get the fireplace roaring. A get some snow quickly from outside and boil it for water, then i eat a hardy meal of beef jerky and a candy bar. I stay up a bit to assess my gear. Somehow i don't have hypothermia, but my pants looks a little worse for wear. I pathc them up with cloth then call it a day, i'm still exhausted from yesterday.\n\nDays 5:\nI'm stuck in the ranger hut for another full day. Finally, on Day 5 since my crash, the storm lets up to beautiful weather. I pack my things and head out, the Ranger station now depleted of useful things for me. I crunch along fresh now and a warm sun for a while, reminded of why i used to love skiing in New Mexico. After a while i find train tracks and few wrecked cars. It must of been carrying aid to somwhere becuase scattered amongst the snow i found antiseptic bottles, bandages, a bottle of painkillers and 3 flares. I rest for a bit and have a snack and a sip fo water, and move on. A little past 12ish i find what looks like an old hydrodam. Knowing there could be emergancy supplies and food inside, i make a beeline towards it and walk in, shutting the old iron door behind me.\nThe place is pitch black. I have to light one of my flares just to see. I look around for a bit, find a prybar and some other useful items including some workers old scarf (My new scarf now), and decide i'm going to spend the night here. \nWrong decision.\nAs i preparing to set my bedroll down i hear a growl behind. Spinning around, the light from my flare provides me a eerie and terrifying look down the nearby hallway, where a wolf is looking right back at me, growling dangerously. Slowly, i begin to back out towards the door, and he charges me. I panic and throw the flare at him, which seems to scare him long enough for me to fly out the door and across the snow as fast as my damn legs could carry me. I run into the train tunnel and slow to a walk, trying to catch my breath, thank god the weather was still nice. I come out the other end just as the sun begins to set, and find myself in a massive ravine. \nAfter some hopping and skipping and a scary balancing act on a tree that feel across a 50 foot drop, i find a sheltered area behind a old train car and set up camp. I start a fire and give it enough wood to last the night. As i eat dinner i watch the sun set over the horizon. The light reflecting on far distant snow creates a beautiful allusion of fire, as if the horizon around me was burning briliantly. When it sets i am treated to freezing tempertures and a starry sky. I crawl into my bedroll and shut my eyes, hoping to god the weather treats me well.\n\nDay 6:\nI was lucky, i woke up to a light snow and nothing else. Hardly any wind. No wolves dragged me away last night so that was also a positive. Thanking my lucky stars i pack up and begin my journey west, to the coast. From there i planto keep heading down south to warmer weather. After traversing a particuarly large and rickety wooden train bridge (And almost falling to my death twice) i go through another tunnel and break out into the coastline. \nIt was a beautiful sight. The sun glowing over all that sea ice. I would have watched forever if i wasnt freezing. Crawling down the mountain, i find another small trailer house (For the train unloading crew, i presume) and rest there. It felt nice to be inside again after almost 2 days in the wilderness. \n\nDay 7:\nOne week after my crash. Woo... Anyway, i woke up to howling this morning. More wolves. I headed further down the hill, another flare at the ready (I didnt even bother wielding an Axe, im not a swordsman). Sure enough, i run into one near the highway. It circles me before charging. I throw the flare at it and it runs away. Relieved, i walk over to pick up the flare when suddenly another wolf turns the corner, running after me full speed. I turned and ran like hell towards a cabin down the road. But right before i got to the door he grabbed my leg and i tried. In moments he was on top of me, ripping at the arm i threw up to defend my body. I hit him over and over until he finally let go, running away and barking angrily. Bleeding and hurt, i crawled into the cabin to treat my wounds, sure this was the end. I treated my wounds with antiseptic, bandged them up and took some painkillers. Then i slept.\n\nI survived, and made my way to a cabin on a small island across the frozen bay. On my way, a white out struck. I couldn't see anything yet again. Walking slowly in hopes of not opening my wounds again. I pressed forward. Little did i know i had long past walked by the island, and was on thin ice. \nAs the whiteout cleared, I looked up. It was as if every star in the universe was looking down at me. Somewhere in my mind, as the cold enveloped me, i wondered if anyone was out there...\nThen I fell through the ice.", "timestamp_created": 1442009992, "timestamp_updated": 1442009992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 253, "votes_funny": 68, "weighted_vote_score": "0.896514356136322021", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12936062": {"recommendationid": "12936062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050970713", "num_games_owned": 413, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 3685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1197, "last_played": 1698779832}, "language": "english", "review": "- Another survival game - I thought -but this time without zombies (finally i got sick of zombie games ).\nWhat's so atractive about wondering in a freezing environment in a  snow up to your oxers ?

The best survival game imo. Story is alright it was like a tutorial in a way. But survival mode is the real deal. Try it out if you're into survival games.\n\nWith that out of the way let me continue if you're still reading. I'm gonna start by saying this game is VERY different than your average goofy looking other survival games where manage to craft yourself a whole arsenal of weapons seemingly out of thin air and you fight against savages or zombies.\n\nThis game is very poetic. The soundtracks and nature sounds are extremely immersive. You're alone. Completely alone. It's man vs nature. Sure there are wildlife you can encounter but your biggest enemy is the cold. The freezing, unforgiving cold. Especially at night. It's almost pitch black if there's no full moon. It fills you with dread and makes you uneasy. You do NOT want to be outside after dark.\n\nBut there's also a sense of peace and calm. It's relaxing. At the end of each night, a sense of accomplishment. Surviving one more night. Seeing the sun come up. If you let yourself really get immersed into it, this game will make you feel... well it's hard to describe. A sort of a zen state.\n\nItem variety and crafting are pretty nice and balanced. Only weapons are revolver, rifle and bow. And I'm glad it is that way. We don't need bazookas. It's not a shooter game. Though it is a lot of fun to hunt game regardless. There's also a few unique item spawns which will help you a lot but beware, they're in harsh environments.\n\nWhen it comes to realism this game has almost everything pretty accurate. At least it seems to me. I'm no survival expert but I can understand a grown man will definitely need 3000 calories daily to survive and keep his strenght up in this bitter cold environment. Biggest unrealistic part is that a single wolf charging at you. Wolves are usually scared of humans and will run away when they see one. But even devs know this and they even explain it in the first screen when you boot up the game. I guess they had to bend reality a bit to make the game more engaging. Perfectly understandable.\n\nI'd recommend you start on pilgrim(easy) or voyageur(normal) mode to get the feeling of the game see if you like it, if so then you get yourself familiar with everything and if you play enough you will eventually memorize the map. It is a huge map though.\n\nMap knowledge will be what keeps you alive in harder modes later when you want to step up your game. If you don't know your way around and jump straight in the hard mode you will get lost and since you won't know where the nearest shelter is, you're gonna fade into the long dark.\n\nIf those difficulties don't suit you and you wanna change something up, fear not because there's also custom mode where you get to choose, in detail, whatever you want in your playthrough. You can make the weather a bit more forgiving or 9th circle of hell. You can make loot abundant if you like hoarding supplies at your base camp, or make it really hard to get them. You can make the wolves completely passive or make them killing machines where they will most likely eat you alive at your first encounter. And so on, it's great. Only downside is the achievements and feats do not count in custom so keep that in mind.\n\nThanks for reading. I'd also like to recommend turning off your lights when you play.

It's important to set goals for yourself (find a base camp, get a steady supply of meat, fill in the entire map, etc) because this game is very open ended. \n\nThere are some things I don't like, for instance you can't see the clothes that are on your character's arms yet, and some of the menus are a bit wonky, but the developers have said that they're going to add more features in the future (including visible clothes/gloves on player models), so I can't even really complain about that. This game is for people who enjoy sandbox survival, beautiful aesthetic, and no hand-holding. I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1499013626, "timestamp_updated": 1499013626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 103, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.891163647174835205", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63753448": {"recommendationid": "63753448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284874887", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1010056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1608, "playtime_at_review": 721367, "last_played": 1713522012}, "language": "english", "review": "i really enjoy this game i would stay up late to just play this game i can't get enough of it", "timestamp_created": 1582082011, "timestamp_updated": 1582082011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 501, "votes_funny": 357, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889713585376739502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13653215": {"recommendationid": "13653215", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973904809", "num_games_owned": 950, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 658, "last_played": 1673651436}, "language": "english", "review": "No game has ever made me so happy to find a can opener in my entire life.", "timestamp_created": 1419733380, "timestamp_updated": 1419733380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 628, "votes_funny": 746, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889604270458221436", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114708155": {"recommendationid": "114708155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263078895", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13287, "last_played": 1677616512}, "language": "english", "review": "I usually, don't write reviews, , but here I am. \n\nDon't get discouraged by some recent negative reviews. People are doing it simply out of frustration, because devs announced about upcoming paid DLCs. For the record, the game was released 10 years ago and all this time, they continued to provide free updates (I own the game for around 5 - 6 years now). It's diabolical to blame this decision and put bad reviews there for it, not the game itself. Someone needs to grow up. \n\nAbout the game itself: it's relaxing, solitary adventure mixed with most memorable adrenaline rush in-gaming.\n\nExample: I got really good gear, and out of over-confidence went to not well-known region at night. What can happen, I thought, I have a torch, a rifle... A blizzard starts, my torch gets blown out and a wolf starts tailing me... Without light I got lost, zig zagging to my goal. Then another wolf appeared, tried shake them off with a flare, unsuccessful, tried to shoot one with revolver, but was too slow and the bastard sank his teeth into me. Shook it off, 2nd one sneaking again, since I am bleeding... In the end, shot 3 wolfs, encountered a bear, used adrenaline shot and almost died of blood loss. But I survived. That's the Long Dark for me, a struggle to get your bearings, getting too sure of yourself, then fighting the consequences of poorly made choices. 10/10 (I suppose 9/10 would be fair, because sandbox may use more content, but I am too fond of this game, therefore, a bit biased).", "timestamp_created": 1651307750, "timestamp_updated": 1651307750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 106, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889164268970489502", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46679676": {"recommendationid": "46679676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346045233", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 406227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1682, "playtime_at_review": 142078, "last_played": 1713553387}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the most amazing survial game i have ever played.

SHIT! ive used all the wood to cook the moose meat and let the fire die thru the night. i run back out to harvest fallen logs and make it back in time with a couple ticks of health left stumbling back and forth and manage to melt and boil my potable water. now I must simply survive until my ribs can heal and continue my search for ammo, meds and snacks.", "timestamp_created": 1634273733, "timestamp_updated": 1634273733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.888573050498962402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42335211": {"recommendationid": "42335211", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995865992", "num_games_owned": 1198, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 3371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "playtime_at_review": 1226, "last_played": 1712995184}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]You are alone.

Although it is an alpha-game and you only can play \"Mystery Lake\" in the sandbox-mode so far, it's still the best game I've seen for long. Also the graphics style very is different, but very beautiful, looks just like an oil painting.\n\nYou're a lone survivor in the northern canadian wilderness and have to stand against the elements. Explore the (damn cold) area of Mystery Lake, find shelters and loot anything useful, you can find. But be aware of the hungry wolves scouting around as well as \"Fluffy\" , who resides in the dam.

Most of them say, they enjoyed the game, but it needs work. But when it's fun, why then the negative rating???\n\nIn my 42 hours of playing, I had lots of fun so far, especially in my first try, when I met \"Fluffy\" right at the start in the dam, he bit me twice, got me down to 4% condition, I walked to camp office, froze me down to 1%, got to camp office, entered and died right in front of the potbelly stove after only 6 hours survival time.\nThe next tries went way better, made 16 (!) hours in 2nd try and 37 (!!) hours in 3rd, but best one is my current run, in which I am currently at day 91, but with no more ammo.\n\nAt the beginning, the most fun is, when you explore everything, find new places and loot anything you can carry, then you develop you own way of playing, make it better the further you get, of course make mistakes, but nevertheless it is huge fun. All the mistakes, that you make, will help you doing better next time and this is even more fun. Then, after maybe 20-30 days, you have a routine in the game, because you can't explore anything new and your days only contain hunting, cooking, melting/boiling water, eating, drinking, sleeping and foraging wood, maybe repairing, if you're lucky.\nBut even this is kinda fun, cause you are just trying to survive as long as you can with less and less goods.

Within 5 minutes I had found said building, raided the entirety, decontructed all the wooden frames I needed for firewood, gathered food, found a hatchet, a prybar and a light source.\nHappily I began to explore the darker areas of the building with my new found lightsource, whilst having my head stuck in a metal container suddenly a shrill wolf howl peirces the air, horrifyingly, I realise I am unarmed.\nCarefully I tread now, I round a corner and my fears are realised, a lone wolf (takes a little while before noticing me) begins to charge at me, I 180 spin and haul my chilly little cheeks back towards the door, the wolf nipping on my heels.\nI throw myself at the exit and dont stop to turn around, I sprint as far and as fast as I can cramming energy bars and grape sodas down my gullet as I marathon for escape.\n\nThe wolf growls die down, I am alive, however, during this encounter, and how engaging it was, I didnt pay any attention to where I was going, I find myself now, in the midst of a growing snow storm, with only 3 hours of daylight remaining, genuine panic sets in as my field of vision becomes smaller and smaller until I am able to see only a few feet in front of me in all directions, here i began to feel truly lost.\nI drudge ever onwards, my food supplies are sparse, my water is disapated and I am dehydrated and freezing at an alarming rate, risk of hypthermia sets in, I pick a direction and travel, sure that my game is over and this harsh environment has claimed me.\nI am exhausted, through the snow and wind I think I can see a rippling red flag so make ground for that.\nUnder the flag is a wooden hut, I push for sanctuary, my condition reaching a critical level as I turn the door handle.\nInside are two stoves, here I am able to keep warm, melt snow for hydration, cook tins of meat I found earlier after crudly opening them with a hunting knife, I brew a cup of coffee, set the fire to a few bars and get into bed and drift uneasily into sleep.\n\nThis was my Day One in \"The Long Dark\" a truly unique and genuinely quite nerve racking experience.\nNone of the above is dramatised.\n\nWhile the graphics are shaded, I feel this adds to the gritty, post-apocolyptic environment \"The Long Dark\" is trying to promote, the mechanics and well thought out crafting system are just about balanced enough to keep you engaging in the environment to survive and explore, after one or two days, you begin to plan your 12 hours of available daylight, and prioritise expiditions based on what immediate resources are paramount to your survival, that is of course, before you find a reliable source of food, water, heat, and a warm place to lay down and get some rest.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with my return to \"The Long Dark\", this title is showing alot of potential, and I look forward to future updates from this developer.\n\nEDIT: I'm no good with degrees.", "timestamp_created": 1496632195, "timestamp_updated": 1498088620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 224, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.876653850078582764", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102671657": {"recommendationid": "102671657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868307232", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 47459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41391, "last_played": 1677802821}, "language": "english", "review": "A true work of passion.  The developers of this game have really taken their time over many years, to make a very immersive, deep, and cathartic game.  Its the perfect combination of relaxation, fear, and survival, without the tedium of constant raw material collection (like the forest or subnautic, both great games, dont get me wrong.)  There's just something about it.  And its very rewarding the more you play - the more you learn the mechanics and the do's and don'ts, you become a better survivor, and last longer.  But it is harshly punishing for new players - dont be afraid - the learning curve is steep at first, but quickly you will learn the basics.  The punishing elements never get less harsh, but the risk around them becomes manageable - your decisions have consequences - make a bad gamble, and you pay for it, learn something and start over.  Not to mention, the game is MASSIVE, varied, and very customizable.  Like to take it easy - great game.  Like to be on the edge of death every moment - harder difficulties will deliver.  And the campaign is beautiful, and compelling.  Can wait for the conclusion.

I had some money left over during the Steam summer sale after I had bought all the games I had planned to buy. After looking at the screenshots and reading some reviews I decided to try the game.\n\nI've played survival games before, but none really left an impact on me as I was playing and after I had \"finished\" like this game did.\n\nI started the game clueless, on a hill looking over a few trailers. I figured out the mechanics pretty quick, and was instantly impressed by the art style. unfortunately, I only made it ~30 minutes before I died, but I leraned from that first time.\n\nThis game is made in Unity (the same engine as angry birds 2), but looks absolutely stunning because of the fantastic art direction. Everything in the game looks like it belongs in a watercolor painting. It is one of my favorite games ever, visually, even including 8th generation games. At night, the landscape is bathed in darkness, and in the daytime it's bright and vibrant. In the afternoon, the sky is bright red and orange, and looks magnificent. In blizzards, you can barely see 5 feet in front of you and looks and sounds menacing.\n\nThe sound design in this game is also amazing. Aside from the often foreboding ambient music, you'll get used to only the desolate sounds of your own footsteps, aside from when you hear the growl of a wolf or the grunt of a bear.\n\nThe gameplay is very good, and fairly challenging. You have to make sure you have enough supplies to survive, which means venturing out, where you could be killed by wolves, bears, or the cold. You're always making calculated risks, and if you make them well, you'll survive, if not, you'll end up as one of the frozen corpses you find in the snow. It's also very slow and tense. When the sun was going to set in 3 hours and there were wolves all around me, but I was overburdened, tired, and cold, every footstep towards safety seemed to take an eternity. But then, that's the point.\n\nI personally never encountered any bugs or glitches, aside from some VERY small graphical glitches. My experience with this game overall was phenomenal, but unfortunately cut short by a bad decision(shooting a bear in the ass ,which is why I put \"finished\" in quatations).\n\nOverall, this is a game I would highly reccomend to just about anyone, unless you're not a fan of planning and management. The quiet intensity and beauty of The Long Dark make it a very memorable and exciting experince to play.

I made it to around day twenty, having gone through three of the available areas at the time, and I was doing good, but it was not long lived. My resources were dwindling as I made my way to the last supplied area at the top of a mountain, a lone radio station secluded from the rest of the map. It was starting to get dark, and my body temperture was dropping fast, so I lit my lantern and started to run. Out in the darkness I heard a howl, followed by another that seemed much closer. I put away my lantern and took out my rifle, aiming it towards the origin of the noise. I heard a growl about ten feet away, so I fired a shot. A whimper pierced the whirring of the cold winter air around me, then silence. Not taking any chances, I lit a flare to see what was around me. Five feet in front of me was a pair of wolves, one was bleeding profusely from his gunshot wound, while the other was preparing to leap onto its would be prey. Being only fifty feet from the radio station, I decided to make a break for it. I threw the flare at the wolves face and sprinted away. The rapid stomping of my feet began to slow as my stamina quickly depleted. No heat for miles takes a toll on the body, and I was slowly dying just feet from my salvation. I heard fast taps on the ground behind me as the wolves closed in for the attack. I was almost there, just a few more steps until I could get into the station and shut the door, then the wolf pounced. I was on the ground, hacking it apart with my axe as it took gnawed on my half frozen flesh. It was a bite away from ending my long journey, when I took one last swing with my hatchet and killed it. I got up and limped toward the door, just barely making it into the station before the other wolf had a chance at killing me. I made it. Inside was much needed health supplies, and much needed food. I started a fire and cooked some venison, all the while warming my body temperture to its original state. I then went to sleep in the nearby cot, gaining health, yet also gaining thirst and hunger. My supplies were low, maybe a few energy bars and a few cans of soda, definitely not enough to last a voyage out into the unknown, so I decided that my journey had come to an end. I quit the game and said goodbye, for I knew that if I continued I would surely perish. I couldn't watch my character die, after all we had been through, he didn't deserve to fade into the long dark. So I let him live in that save, untouched and undying, until I decide that it's time for his journey to come to a close.

Despite the beautiful art style of the game, the creators add in the perfect amount of suspense and haunting sound elements to have you at the edge of your chair even while walking through a seemingly inviting and stunning landscape. The Long Dark is for anyone else like me; I yearned for a game that didn't need zombies, cannibals, or other out of place entities to create a suspenseful environment. The combination of weather, wildlife, and the sheer feeling of isolation provide a much more engaging environment than any other survival game I have ever played. One thing to keep in mind: The Long Dark is a quite slow paced game. It involves lots of thought and pre-planning to be successful.

If you want a straight up survival game like that - also minus the zombies - this is what you're looking for. There are no other humans, and your main threats are starvation, freezing to death, bears/wolves, and basic stuff like falling and sickness. Don't worry, you won't randomly break a leg walking down stairs like in DayZ!\n\nI know what you're thinking, though. \"It's an Early Access survival game on Steam, so it's probably a buggy, broken mess that will never actually be finished\".  I was worried, too - especially after being disappointed by games like 7 Days To Die. But despite being labeled an \"alpha\", The Long Dark is one of the most polished games I've played in a long time. While more features and areas will be added in the future, the core game they've created as a base is almost flawless. I've never had a crash, I've noticed very few bugs, and it's well optimized (I'm running with maximum settings at 1440p/60fps on a GTX 760). So don't let the \"Early Access\" bit scare you off if the game sounds interesting.\n\nThe current play mode is \"Sandbox\". Basically, you are dropped into a random location in one of several interconnected maps (you can choose which map or have it picked randomly as well) and left to fend for yourself. That means finding food, shelter, and water. Some of the game's activities include: getting firewood, avoiding hostile wildlife, hunting, laying rabbit traps, repairing clothing, crafting, fishing, exploring, and making sure not to get caught in the game's brutal, disorienting blizzards.\n\nHow to go about surviving is up to you. I tend to move from place to place looting, but it can also be smart to set up a base camp somewhere safe if you can do hunting, trapping, or fishing there. The goal of the current sandbox mode is simply to survive as long as possible - the game records that as well as a variety of other statistics. The general backstory seems to be that something happened which caused most of humanity to die, and for the wildlife to turn more hostile. Your plane crashes, leaving you stranded in the frozen wilderness alone.\n\nYou can pick one of three play modes, depending on what kind of experience you want. \"Pilgrim\" is easier and doesn't have hostile wildlife - a good choice for your first game. Then there is the regular play mode, as well as a \"Stalker\" mode which is the most brutal. If you're not sure about something, there is a good online wiki to guide you. I even found a Steam guide with a variety of maps if you'd like more help. So you can really customize your game experience depending on your tastes and skill level.\n\nThe controls and interface are very intuitive. Normally there is no HUD minus a small interface dot and occasionally an icon displaying whether you are shielded from the wind. You interact with things in the game world simply by left clicking when they are in range. Pressing TAB brings up a little display showing how cold, tired, thirsty, and hungry you are, as well as an estimate of how much daylight or darkness remains (you generally want to find shelter before dark). SHIFT lets you run, though there is a stamina meter. \"I\" brings up your inventory, and SPACE brings up a radial menu for making fires and a couple other things like first aid. While I played with keyboard and mouse, the game also supports controllers.\n\nThe Long Dark's Canadian wilderness is beautiful, desolate, and cold. The graphics are slightly stylized, simple and with what I'd describe as a \"painterly\" look to skyboxes and textures. The sunsets and weather effects steal the show, though. The snow and storms are the best I've seen in a game, which is fitting because nature is both the star and the antagonist here.\n\nShould you buy The Long Dark in its current \"alpha\" state? If it sounds interesting, I'd say it's a definite \"yes\". While more content and features will be added in the future - story mode, new areas, new stuff to craft, new play mechanics, etc. - it is a very polished experience and already has enough content to keep you busy for 50+ hours easily. It's very much worth playing right now, and is a great investment that will be worth revisiting over and over throughout its development.\n\n\n[b]8.5/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1466542847, "timestamp_updated": 1593905946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866996228694915771", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87394237": {"recommendationid": "87394237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044343992", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5009, "last_played": 1703291722}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game in early access back in 2014, and I've returned to it every year - usually during the winter.

It's only been now, though, after finally ascending to the summit of Timberwolf Mountain almost 7 years later, that I think I can articulate what I love about it.\n\nThe game is complex, although it deals with very simple objectives. Find food. Drink water. Don't get lost. You're forced to look at the game on a per day, sometimes per hour scale. This means that everything you do,  every little hunting trip or errand run, every foray into a new region, is a tremendous risk while still being completely grounded and relatable. And it means that when you go on an adventure it feels like a genuine adventure.\n\nWhen I broke away from my little hidey-hole in the farmhouse and set off to completely unknown territory, I felt it. When I hid out in a snow shelter for 8 hours weathering a blizzard, I felt it. Finding that miracle deer carcass, losing my last arrow to stop a charging wolf, climbing rope after rope and cliff after cliff under the light of the aurora - holy shit did I feel it.

I can't spend hours and hours on it at one time, it's too nerve wracking for that, but it's fun to hop on and play for an hour or two at a time.\n\nThere are two modes, story and survival.  Story is still a work in progress with chapter 4 due out in the next few months.  Survival mode has several difficulty levels from stupid-easy to why-am-i-torturing-myself-hard.\n\nThe game is easy to pick up but hard to master.  Survival mode has no endgame except to survive.  The enemy in this game is nature.  Weather, wolves, bears and the occasional moose with wolves being the most prevalent are the challenges to overcome while attempting to stay warm and fed without accidentally killing yourself by doing something stupid, like drinking non-potable water or giving yourself food poising with spoiled food.   It sounds boring, but is oddly fascinating and super challenging.  \n\nIf you are considering getting this game keep in mind, this is a slow game.  You spend LOTS of time walking through the snow keeping an eagle eye out for wolves and bears, and if you spot them, you then spend lots of time slooooowly creeping through the snow trying not to get their attention.  Unless you are good at killing them, which I am not. \n\nBottom line, great game but not everyone's cup of tea.

You also face the challenges of finding food, medicines, and other basic supplies.\n\nI made the mistake of fishing too late one evening, and realised it was already dark outside. I had (stupidly) left my lantern and firewood at my camp to lighten my pack weight. While trying to guess which way was home I got turned around in the dark and subsequently died of cold and tired exhaustion while stumbling around looking for shelter.... This was excellent! I loved how one simple mistake could have such serious consequences.\n\nHowever... I dislike some of the limitations in the game, you cannot interact with all of your surroundings, you cannot climb or jump so even small rocks or branches can be an impassable obstacle, you cannot chop wood on scavenge bits, you find lots of corpses but cannot remove their clothing to replace your own, you find lots of blankets and material but you cannot use those to warm yourself they can only be broken down into cloth to repair or craft items. The crafting is also very very basic. \nBasically, I found myself frustrated and thinking 'why cant I do ........, it is common sense' \n\nFrom what I have played so far, I can happily say it can be a difficult game with an unforgiving learning curve that offers hours of interesting and challenging game play.

Atmospheric, relaxing, cozy and beautiful mixed with moments of desperation, fear and creeping death. Been playing for years with hundreds of hours and the awesome devs continue to put out free high quality updates. So much love for the folks at Hinterland, you're a classy bunch. \n\nRefer to the store page for what the game is and features, I'll just throw out some hopefully useful impressions (for sandbox mode). Though difficult, exploring the world is rewarding and loot is randomized when you start a new run. Increasing your knowledge of the game and navigating without a compass or map (though you can draw one yourself in game) is also a great feeling. There is no base building but holing up in the various abandoned locations and making them home is pretty satisfying. Nothing like organizing all your equipment (which you can do in containers or by positioning items in the world) and firing up the stove in the trapper's cabin on a freezing endless-winter night. The level of detail and realism that comes with keeping yourself fed, hydrated, healthy and protected from the cold is very high. This can either be a pro if you like managing these systems often or a con as it could feel like a chore. The game features excellent custom difficulty settings to tailor your experience. Some animals in the game can hurt or kill you (wolves, bears, moose) but they can be toggled on and off. However, some more hardcore elements cannot be tweaked: map must be drawn over time and doesn't show your position, no compass, permadeath (yes), everything losing durability over time and with use, can't carry unlimited items, other stuff I'm probably forgetting. I think these things are part of what makes the game amazing but they could be too much work for those seeking a more casual experience. I usually play on relatively easy settings and once you're familiar with the game and its geography it can be simple to survive (as long as you don't do anything stupid) and immensely relaxing. But there are difficulty levels I still can't survive on and everything in between.

Hinterland Studios has kept their word and give us very regular updates and are always expanding the game,adding new areas to explore and new ways to do things and all of that is in EA !!\nWe're waiting on the next update and hopefully it's going to be the new story mode I've been researching on the Hinterland forums,it promises to be something very special !!\n\nFor now,we have around a 22 km of map to explore,survive in and if its your cup of tea(or coffee or soda) to exploit !!\nI cannot express enough in this review,how much pleasure this game has brought to me and it does it all without one single monster,zombie,evil warlords or any other catchy little thing most of todays devs are tossing into survivor type games !! It's all mother nature and her critters !!\n\nSo,in a nut shell,buy this game if survival is what your into or if your into hunting or exploring,just buy the game,it's a 20 very well spent !!\nThank you Hinterland Studios,for the best game in my library !!!\n\n[code][h1]AccidentlyReviewed[/h1]\nWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Just started a new game a couple days ago, and just defeated the Old Bear again.  Interesting change to how it was a year ago.  I recommend the game, though I will warn of a few issues:\n\n- Space management is absolutely key.  If you like hoarding things, lose that right now.  Take only what you need and limit how much of that you take.\n- Store wood and logs by your normal camp haunts.  Raw meat stays outside so it remains cold.  Plan what you cook.  Coffee is in the morning, but last so you benefit from reduced fatigue while running.  \n- Quick save is your friend.\n- Sprint is mislabeled.  It's actually stamina, and it affects how long you run and are able to aim (this was a terrible decision, developers, btw.  Bad enough aim is so wobbly, but with 53% 'Sprint' I have two seconds of crappy aim?  Not cool).\n- +5 kg if you go 72 hours without letting Thirst or Hunger drop to zero.  You need this.\n- There is no Fast Travel.  This sucks.  It also means don't be encumbered if at all possible.  \n- The cabins along the lake are the only real place to bother exploring outside of main areas, and that's if you find the keys for them.  Nice apparel to find, though the best comes from crafting.  Do the Survival Guide quests to get blueprints.  I'm about at the end of Ep2 again, and I don't think I've gotten a single blueprint other than those quests.\n- Skin animals and leave skins out as early as you can.  DO NOT STORE THINGS IN THE TRAPPER'S (Jeremiah) CABIN AND COMPLETE THE THREE SIGNAL TOWERS QUEST.  Somebody had the bright idea of no longer letting people access the cabin after you defeat the Old Bear.  Any gear you stored goes back in your inventory, which haha, massive weight overload now (Developers, another terrible decision :| )\n\n\nDEVELOPERS:  \n- Please please PLEASE allow quick load during action sequences, such as wolf/bear attacks.  It's REALLY irritating to have to sit through a 15 second animation that I'm just going to quick load anyway.\n- Hurry the dialogue up.  It's not immersive to have long pauses between each sentence, just say the lines with emotion and move on.  \n- Your fire starting system sucks.  55% unless I'm using an accelerator?  Really?  I've been a Scouter and helped many a Scout learn how to build a fire; seeing a fire pretty much start up and just quit a tiny bit before the end of the circle and now there's no fire for the fifth time in a row... No.  Fix this.  After my tenth fire in the game, I should have at least a 95% success or something.  Same with sharpening and gun cleaning.  Why on earth do you think it's a good idea to make it take so long?  It doesn't take hours and hours to clean a gun or sharpen a blade, so be more realistic here.\n\n\nThere are some really irritating things about this game, and devs are taking forever with getting out new episodes, but for now, I'm content with what they've done and am waiting for more.  I recommend that if you have patience, go for this one.", "timestamp_created": 1561320147, "timestamp_updated": 1561320280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 155, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865305542945861816", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 97, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 34726, "total_negative": 4054, "total_reviews": 38780}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwAAAH7nk9kE": "Mon Apr 22 23:41:29 2024"}}
