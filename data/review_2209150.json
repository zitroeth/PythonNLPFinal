Unlike Don't Starve, however, the game is not too taxing and has no real time pressure, which suits me just fine. :-)\n\nSome of the screen shots make the game look a bit like a puzzler, but the gameplay arc is more about collecting resources you pick up walking around the isometric map and then crafting things with them.\n\nYou accumulate exploration points by collecting stuff, which enables you to discover new tile types (biomes) over time, and then place them on the world map. This does give a nice sense of ownership in creating your environment, although the main strategic element here is just to ensure you have a diversity of biomes close to your main base to save you from having to walk too far to collect recipe components.\n\nThere is some very light questing and story, mainly serving to provide some direction to incentivise building new stuff and exploring further afield.\n\nI'm looking forward to the main game, and can see myself sinking quite a few casual hours pottering around in it and exploring new biomes as they unlock.", "timestamp_created": 1682823779, "timestamp_updated": 1685841224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700516462326049805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135523547": {"recommendationid": "135523547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070695980", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 127, "last_played": 1679887669}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Len's Island meets Dorfromantik!

I've seen all of the survival and combat mechanics before, so there's nothing new there, but the map building aspect is really well done, I can see it adding some strategy to the full game when you want to keep things relatively close together. The combat feels clunky. I think you're locked into animations for a little bit too long, and the enemies are really forgiving with their attacks, making combat feel simultaneously tedious and really easy. I am a little worried that after you've played for a while and the novelty of the map tiles wears off you'll be left with a pretty basic survival game.\n\nNow, all of this is from 1 hour of a demo with 3 biomes, 2 enemies, and less than 20 crafting recipes, so I can't speak on the full game at all. A couple original enemies would fix all of the problems I have with the game. As a demo goes, this is fantastic, I highly recommend it to anyone who's just a little interested (it's free, you have nothing to lose) I'll keep an eye on this game and I'll probably pick it up when it comes out.\n\nGood work, Square Glade!

Quests typically require crafting a specific terrain tile, which means there will be a lot of resource gathering, but there won't be any discoveries: you know what you put, and where you put it. The night can be skipped by sleeping, which can be done either at your shelter or a camp, and zombies are not impressive during the day.\n- Last but not least, the game is poorly optimized.

Not a super fan but it's a minor issue.\n\nSurvival mechanics are fairly good, but not overly punishing. Game plays well and is really fun, and you got good options for building your (log) house (walls, floors, roofs, etc.). You only have 1 character, Aiyana. But what matters is the scenery, gameplay and map. The map itself is another major character, gradually expanded as you play by unlocking map tiles that you use to expand the map in however way you wish. You unlock the map tiles by \"doing stuff\" in the game (kind of like XP in rpgs). As for the prologue, map tiles available are of biome types plain, forest, lake and praerie.\n\nCombat Note: The only hostiles in the Demo version seem to be (given what I found) 2 kinds of undead, so the combat seems a bit simplistic. The full game will likely clarify (and perhaps improve on this).\n\nI've seen pictures of ice and badlands tiles too (from the beta / full game), on their Discord channel. The full game will also feature tons more walls, roofs, and more (plank and stone spotted), by looking at the screenshots shared on their Discord channel - honestly, my mind got a little blown away, because this game initially seemed like just a smaller indie project. Can't wait to see the full game release, personally).\n\nThe prologue does have limited content, but it's more than enough to get a proper introduction to most core features. You can also keep on playing after you complete the final Prologue quest.\n\nOverall, I am very positively surprised and will absolutely be getting this game on May 25th. I recommend anyone try out the prologue to see for themselves.\n\nFor a free indie game demo - I'm giving this a 9/10, hands down!\nIt'd be a perfect score if it wasn't for slightly weird controls and some minor bugs with water sources and such.

Tab to open inventory, but not Tab to close. F to open other menus, but not F to close. Besides that, a lot of things need you to not press but hold buttons for 3-5 seconds. This is inconsistent and unnecessary; so many things take longer than they instinctively should.\nAlso you can't decline quests, but you have to press F to accept them anyway.\n\nSecondly, writing, both dialogue and tutorials.

I really don't think they meant to make Jo Ann such an insufferable character, but then they also made the first half of the tutorial you doing her dirty work as she idles, until she ditches you first chance. And then you just find the next group of people to do dirty work for.\n\nThe tutorial often forgets the tutoring part. It tell you to collect twigs, but forgets to tell you how (ie walk to a tree and press F). It tells you to collect plant fibre, but neglects to specify you need to hit the ferns with your axe to get some. It tells you to place down a world piece, and then you just need to notice the new button in that corner of the screen that was not relevant before. Cook a Berry Bowl, but no mention of the game having a 'discover recipes by inventing them' mechanic. Gather water, but only in these semi-invisible specific spots.\n\nAnd lastly, art style dissonance. The overworld has a nice if generic low-poly art style. Character models have a low-poly art style that does not look good up close. But then dialogue portraits are high-quality realistic and detailed. But\u00b2 then the dialogue portrait for your character is of comparatively far lesser quality, ripped straight from the game banner. You can see this dissonance yourself on the screenshots on the game's store page. Even the seemingly one-off tutorial man who doesn't even have a name ('Hunter's Rest Resident') has a higher-quality portrait than the main character.\n\nAlso, I thought my character was crouching. I was convinced I'd glitched the game and got stuck in a non-existent crouch. But after trying the game again after a movement speed update I realised... that's just how she stands and walks with a tool out.\n\nI do hope at least the controls can be improved upon and a tutorial can be added.", "timestamp_created": 1680276345, "timestamp_updated": 1680276345, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495876848697662354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136748700": {"recommendationid": "136748700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066333644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1681573893}, "language": "english", "review": "it plays / controls like a mobile game. no thanks", "timestamp_created": 1681573930, "timestamp_updated": 1681573930, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494566500186920166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135702224": {"recommendationid": "135702224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028202617", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1695244815}, "language": "english", "review": "Above Snakes: Prologue\n\nTime spent @ time of review: 4.6 hours\n\nReview Status: Worth Trying \n\nLet me start off this review with saying, thank you for taking the time to read and remember that this review is for the prologue and not the full game. The thoughts and ideas and suggestions carried within are just views of the writer, which is me. Also be FAIR WARNED that I SUCK AT SPELLING and too lazy to use the SPELL CHECKER!\n\nAbove Snakes is an open world survival game that you create over time. It comes with crafting, building, farming, gathering, killing and some questing. If I had to sum up the game rather quickly, it is project zomboid but set in the west with the main character being female.\n\nI really enjoyed the prologue so far. I completed the main objective of it within an hour of game play. I spent the rest of my time playing, building, crafting, killing and expanding the map.\n\nThe map is based on tiles that you unlock and place once you get enough exp. Some tiles are specific to other tiles, so a plains tile can not butt right next to a grassland tile, You need to unlock the plains/grassland tile to make the transitions between the two.\n\nYou will need to be wise with your tile placement - arrangement  and which ones to place first before the other tiles.\n\nPROS:\n1. Cute Game - Pleasing on the eyes\n2. Pretty simple to understand directions and advance in game play\n3. Crafting simple to understand\n4. The ability to build the world how you see fit\n5. Easy to understand menus and navigation\n6. Enjoyable game play, the possibilities are endless, but in the prologue, it gets repetative quickly\n7. Building is nice and easy like pretty much any other game that we have played. Craft the item and place it, with options to rotate.\n8. \n\nCONS:\n1. Time Speed - goes very quickly - too quickly to state drains and farming/gathering/etc\n2. Controls:\na. Combat controls are terrible - melee fighting is not so bad, but aiming with a bow and arrow is horrid. When mouse pointer is over target, would miss 4 out of 5 arrows with the bow just randomly aiming off in a completely different direction.\nb. Movement controls are terrible - the Q and E to turn the camera are backwards, hitting \"Q\" while running will turn the camera to the right instead of what should be turning left and hitting \"E\" does the opposite. Doing this actually turns the character and the map at the same time and a few times at the start of the game, made me sick to my stomach. I currently only play in one view, using the \"Q\" and \"E\" controls I avoid at all costs.\n3. The use of \"F\" key to do almost everything is annoying. The having to hold the button down to do any sort of crafting is stupid.\n4. Building has issues, placing items are nice and easy to do but there are gaps in the in textures. So it looks like there are gaps between the building tiles.\n5. Map tiles: Do not line up properly, they stay jagged.\n6. Map tiles: They are not polished, you character will get randomly stuck where the tiles dip down like to get the water nodes on the water tiles.\n7. Respawn timer of mobs is way to slow\n8. Crouching while holding tools or weapons is buggy and weird\n\nIdeas or Suggestions:\n1. change the way the camera/player turn using the \"Q\" and \"E\" options. I would rather remove the bow from the right click option to make you have to switch between it and the tools and have the holding right down or clicking to turn as a option\n2. find a way to make the transition between tiles to be smooth instead of the jagged mess that it is.\n3. fix the aiming system to be more accurate\n4. change the size of the mouse pointer to not be so large\n5. have a option to toggle between walking and running, not just when going into a building\n6. remove the crouching when holding tools, it is just not needed or make the option to crouch by a button press and hold like other games\n7. Fix the issue on launch of the prologue to remember what language I have picked\n8. Fix the issue after launching the game and picking a language to remember that I have understood that the game is this and that there can be flashing lights\n9. remove the \"\" WHITELIST BS \"\" when trying to exit the game, just makes dislike the game even more. it's like watching a video and the first that comes out of their mouth is \"\"LIKE & SUB\"\" and then it is repeated every 5 minutes\n10. Add co-op or multiplayer ( player hosted servers? ) Would be so much more fun with friends, which could have the option to up the difficulty of the game with the more people you have playing with you.\n11. Add other options for player models. Nothing wrong with a female protaganist, but would like to have customization options.\n\nIn conclusion if you have read this far, thanks I guess. I really enjoyed the prologue, even with things I found to be wrong or annoying to me. I am looking forward to the release of the game and plan on buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1680123985, "timestamp_updated": 1680123985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494520068168640137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135529569": {"recommendationid": "135529569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118912984", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1679899765}, "language": "english", "review": "Dorfromantic + Project Zomboid?

The game stands out from other survival games as the world is not generated procedurally, but instead, you generate it yourself by placing isometric tile world pieces. In this review, we'll take a closer look at the game's features and gameplay.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nThe gameplay in Above Snakes: Prologue is unique and refreshing. As a player, you start your journey in the small lumberjack settlement of Hunter's Rest and begin crafting the world around you. You determine the landscape of this world inspired by the Wild West and dictate how it will unfold before you. Craft, cook, hunt, and fish to help the people of Hunter's Rest. You can also advance in leatherworking, cloth weaving, and other professions to create the best survival supplies for your adventure.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the game is the isometric world made of world pieces, which is created by the player throughout their journey. This adds a new layer of strategy to the game, as you must plan out the placement of each piece to ensure you have enough resources to survive.\n\nThe deep base building system is another great feature of the game. You can invest your resources into your very own cabin and establish a base for defense and shelter. The extensive outdoor and indoor assets make it possible to create a unique and personalized base that fits your playstyle.\n\n[b]Pros and Cons[/b]\n\nOne of the game's biggest pros is its uniqueness. Above Snakes: Prologue offers a refreshing twist on the survival game genre, and the isometric world building is a great addition. The game also has full controller support, key and button rebinding, and accessibility options like disabling camera shake, smooth camera movements, and photosensitive mode.\n\nHowever, the game is still in its early stages, and there is not much content available in the prologue. It's difficult to determine the game's full potential without experiencing more of it.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nAbove Snakes: Prologue is a promising game that offers a unique twist on the survival game genre. The game's isometric world building and deep base building system are standout features. The game's accessibility options are also a welcome addition. However, with limited content available in the prologue, it's difficult to determine the game's full potential. Overall, I would love to get my hands on this game to delve further into it and give it a better review. From what I've seen so far, I would recommend this game to fans of survival games who are looking for a new and refreshing experience.\n\n\nDEV'S let me get a key to go full Reviews mode on the game", "timestamp_created": 1680016272, "timestamp_updated": 1680097201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491869926452636719", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139648127": {"recommendationid": "139648127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129212819", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 278, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1686070570}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty relaxing gameplay.

About a year ago they distributed alpha builds to content creators, and those builds had a lot more content than this demo. It's so strange that they plastered \"This is not available in the Prolouge\" on so many things that were previously shown by content creators. The world building aspect seems novel, but there are other more fleshed out games (like Forager) with this same mechanic. The sanity stat seems like a ripoff from Don't Starve. And the fact that this game won't have multiplayer is worrying. Almost every single recent \"Open World Survival Craft\" games have multiplayer, and if you look at the big names, like Minecraft, Terraria, Don't Starve Together, The Forest, Grounded, Satisfactory, Raft, Project Zomboid, No Man's Sky, Astroneer, ARK, Valheim, Rust... They all have multiplayer.
