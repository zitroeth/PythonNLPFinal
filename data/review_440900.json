Every time I pick this game up I find out that the devs have remade some important part of the game (building system, combat system, thrall system, journey system) and have made a bunch of minor changes or removals... and the bugs I remember from a few years ago are still there, sometimes along with new ones. \n\nEnemies are still sometimes disappearing after being killed or KOed, just like several years ago. An enemy will still sometimes step onto a rock and stop responding to anything. Fighting an enemy on terrain that isn't perfectly flat and targeting an enemy will sometimes make the camera shoot up to a bizarre angle that doesn't even let me see my character.  At least night exists again -- during the last age/chapter/whatever nighttime [i]stopped happening if you were in the southern part of the map[/i].\n\nFuncom [i]really[/i] wants to make sure you look at their ads. A couple of days ago I even got a pop-up when starting the game that asked if they could collect data from me in order to see how well their advertising was working.\nThe company has decided to make you run the game through their own launcher now (which means they can push more stuff at you).\nThe game now has an in-game cash shop with a premium currency (Crom Coins). You earn \"challenge exp\" by doing randomly-assigned tasks, which unlocks special cosmetic items, except [i]not really[/i] in most cases because you need to buy a \"battle pass\" to actually get access to most of them.\nThe game effectively has ads for another game (Conan Chop-Chop) embedded in it in the form of figurines. You can decide not to make them, but they're going to be there in your crafting knowledge list. They're in mine, at least, and I didn't put them there.\n\nThe old journey system which let you finish things in any order you wanted and get rewarded with exp has been replaced with dozens of individual \"journeys\" with steps that have to be done in a specific order. This doesn't sound too bad at first, until you realize that requiring an order for some of them makes no sense, and that you can only progress one \"journey\" at a time. [b]Is it really a bad thing that I wanted to put on pants and shoes BEFORE doing anything else, Funcom?[/b]\nThe old journey system was something that you could use as a guide, but it never felt like it got in your way or made you do things a certain way -- \"Hm. Have I finished everything in this area? The journey guide says there's something called the Tower of Bats that I can climb. I'll go check that out.\" The new one feels like being given orders by someone with OCD (and then being handed a box as a reward, which turns into two hundred plants that trap you under their weight when you open it, if you don't know what to expect). I get that they were probably trying to give more focused tutorials for specific parts of the game, but the implementation is [i]bad[/i] and messes with natural exploration and progression.\nWell, you can just ignore it... right? There [i]is[/i] a gameplay option for turning it off... except that [b]some of the crafting blueprints are locked behind journeys[/b].\n\nSpeaking of progression, early-game enemies now drop mid-game gear. As far as I can tell, the only reason to craft an iron sword or a hunting bow now is because one of the \"journeys\" tells you to. You can get multiple copies of better gear from river or desert exiles (damaged, but you'll also have weapon repair kits), and the droprate is [i]high[/i]. If it were a rare thing, it would feel cool and you'd feel lucky for getting it, but now it just feels like they want everyone to rush through the early game as quickly as possible. Just like the in-game shop and the \"battlepass\", it's the type of thing you'd expect to see in a dying MMO, not a survival game.\n\ntl;dr -- Game used to be good but the company kept messing with it, pushing ads, pushing in-game purchases, and failing to fix glaring bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1710847502, "timestamp_updated": 1710847502, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 262, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.914818167686462402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162137358": {"recommendationid": "162137358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005435116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 185761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4625, "playtime_at_review": 179218, "last_played": 1713761812}, "language": "english", "review": "ETA: The latest \"hotfix\" patch 10 days ago broke [i]basic running[/i] for folks on console. Funcom has barely acknowledged this issue and made no attempt to roll back or fix this critical - and, for some players, game-breaking - bug. Obviously this is not a huge issue for us PC players, but it really goes to show the current level of QA work in Funcom's development cycle.\n\n---\n\nThere is so much I could potentially touch on in a review, but... I'm tired, boss.\n\nBack in the day we paid $10.00 USD for a DLC and immediately got access to:\n\n48 new building pieces (one complete building palette)\n15 new armor pieces (three different full sets)\n12 new weapons\n32 new placeables\n3 new horse saddles\n\nSiptah was more expensive ($20.00) but was an entire professionally-designed map with new enemy types, items, interesting mechanics (your mileage may vary), and arguably one of the cooler building sets.\n\nPutting the current $40.00 asking price of the game aside for a moment, what does continued monetary investment in the game get you now?\n\nWell, you can pay $15 for a battle pass and spend all season grinding to get:\n\n5 new building pieces\n10 new armor pieces\n5 new weapons\n26 new placeables\n1 new horse saddle\n\nOf course, if you miss the window for the battle pass, you can't get those items anymore. But if you'd like more content, you can always go to the in-game cash shop and make purchases like:\n\nA bundle containing 5 new armor pieces, 2 new weapons, and 1 new horse saddle for $23.50\nA bundle containing 4 small plant placeables for $15.00\nA bundle containing 40 new building pieces (a single mostly-complete building palette) for $30.00\nA bundle containing 4 new banner placeables that don't even use the new emblems system for $17.50\nA single armor set (5 pieces) for $10.00\nA single placeable (a tiny box of carrots) for $2.50\n\nThe cash-shop bundles are on a random rotation to maximize FOMO, so your mileage may also vary if you're looking for something specific.\n\nI'd like to extend a very strong, personal thank you to Franck Vacher - Funcom's Director of Monetization - for getting us to this point. An alumni of Ubisoft, it's clear to see that his expertise in placing profits over gameplay and user experience has worked out great for the community (which looks to have shed somewhere between thirty and fifty percent of its active player-base in the last year per Steam Charts). And I'm so glad that all of the money that players have paid out (and that Funcom has no-doubt saved by cutting their QA team in half since 2021) has gone towards not fixing long-time bugs plaguing the game (like this one that results in thralls and players falling through the floor randomly, conveniently shown off in the latest dev stream at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDicOBwdlcM - skip to 53:21). Because it's not that they're not aware of this stuff, they just choose not to fix it.\n\nIt has been a fun ride.", "timestamp_created": 1712175233, "timestamp_updated": 1713719798, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852714657783508301", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157886979": {"recommendationid": "157886979", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977148918", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 260741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7618, "playtime_at_review": 219748, "last_played": 1713569341}, "language": "english", "review": "I have roughly 5000 hours in total on this game. Multiple accounts, multiple years, multiple playthroughs on and offline. \n\nThis game has basically always been a \"hot mess\" but most of the issues were \"quirky\" and even fun sometimes. Online play is/has/and always will be plagued with cheaters. Accept it, or play on the myriad of private servers that offer a genuinely great experience (pvp or otherwise).  But the game has one of the best gameplay loops (its more \"minecraft\" than \"ark\", despite appearances); building system is exquisite, crafting is fantastic. The systems this game offers feel rewarding with that \"perfect grind\" where you get out just a bit more than you put in. Your materials become stronger items that let you go further. A fantastic dopamine-drip feedback loop. \n\nI have experienced so many ups and downs with this game its hard to actually \"focus\" on anything; but I will say the issues that are actually a problem. Its not \"balance\", its not a \"cash shop\". Its this creeping dread of seeing where its going. The change to the cash shop is ... eh, Im not wild about it, but theres already so much content, I dont really mind that much. The \"fomo\" aspect of it is absolutely garbage, however. Missing out on something youd actually want simply because you were busy? Cmon. But the most egregious issues are the dynamics and gameplay changes they have been steadily implementing at an increasing pace over the years.  \n\n1) not ..too long ago, you used to be able to build basically anywhere; and I do mean anywhere. They keep stripping the playable map further and further; under some guise of \"Stopping hackers\". It is, and has been a horrible solution. I shouldnt have to download a mod to build where I want in single player. More and more, they keep stripping back locations. Every update, there are more spots that are put out of bounds. \n2) they keep fiddling with build rules. Competitive pvp builds being outlawed, blocking build locations, making benches more difficult to place. It keeps getting worse over time. Its been on a slow march to being \"annoying and obnoxious\" instead of \"engaging and rewarding\". \n3) They keep changing the MOTHERFU--- ing combat and items. Its a game functionally out since 2017; why are we adding new itemization mechanics in ... 2024. They keep changing core mechanics of combat, boss hunting, legendary items not being repairable anymore... Changing the thralls was ridiculous, but understandable. \n\nI guess I can sum it up with : while adding some good content here and there, the overall feel of the updates is subtractive instead of additive. They keep removing parts of the map you can utilize, they keep removing combat functionality, they remove thrall functionality, they are removing itemizations, and removing efficacy from legendary weapons. Having to relearn basic systems as  a player with 5000 hours and 6 years of playtime is dire. New players from the last year or so have been going through a whirlwind. The battlepass isnt fun, and the black market is just functionally a horrible idea. \n\nGameplay -  8-9/10, truly an incredibly fun game when everything comes together\nStory - meh, 4/10, youre not playing conan exiles for the amazing story, but thats also hardly the point\nSystems (crafting, building, modding, transportation)  - 9/10; on exiled lands anyway lol\nTrust in developer to keep the game fair, fun, and engaging - 0/10; the game is going in a very bad negative direction. Thank god for the dedicated and talented modders out there keeping things great. \n\ndo I recommend this game? Since palworld, enshrouded, minecraft (yes, really) and valheim exist? Not any more.

This game offers something most games don't. Skyrim is probably the most comparable, but this game has base building. Its like an oasis in the desert for many people. So they put up with all the problems, jank, bugs, incompetence, and even the greed. It wouldn't be difficult to make this a great game. Squandered potential. Bottomline: You'd have to make your own assessment and the base game goes on sale about every other month for $10. Don't tell me I didn't warn you though. \n\nI had this one sitting in my wishlist for over 2 years and honestly, I should have removed it. You just never know how bad something can be until you experience it for yourself.\n\nI was already aware of Funcom's reputation for incompetence. I already knew their catalog of games never reached any mainstream popularity Failures imho. I already saw threads online going back 7 years of players complaining about bugs. Bugs that to date still exist.\n\nAnd then there is the anti-consumer monetization model. Quadruple dipping. Buy game. Buy dlc. Buy battlepass. Buy cash shop. Except there is a heavy dose of FOMO as well. So even whales are missing parts of the game. Yes, I do think this way. If I buy a game... why would I be happy that its missing the rest of the game? I want a complete whole game. Greed. \n\nI could write a book about how you shouldn't waste your time on this game. How you'd be a fool if you actually fell for the 'Dune' game hype. There are plenty of Negative reviews and trust me... those are the honest ones.\n\nI did plan to keep playing. Never finished my current save. Wanted to try mod mad maps. The Chapter 4 patch released and the game is extremely unpleasant to play now. To the point I've not bothered to try. Its really r e a l l y bad. Also its apparently Funcom's modus operandi to purposely break their game and fix those breaks a week or 2 later. I see a lot of 'Heh,.,, 2 steps forward, 10 steps backwards' replies going back 6+ years for this game. Before Tencent became majority share holder.\n\nThat its been this way for so many years leads me to believe the wrong person failed upwards in that company and they have the best job security you could imagine. Weird how much all this mirrors my experience with NCWest when I played 'Blade and Soul' and the CEO was a nepotism hire and grossly incompetent all around to an embarrassing degree.\n\nUnless you are a Funcom shareholder, Funcom employee, or a whale... this game is not for you. Period. \n\nFor $30 you can grab 'Enshrouded' and have complete game that isn't nickel and diming with excessive greed. '7Days2Die' is fantastic with overhaul mods like 'Undead Legacy'. 'Valhiem'. Many more games and developers that deserve your money.\n\nGames with this business model wither and die. You can play through the whole story in BnS and never see another player. The whales in Champions Online are the only people left just sitting around afk admiring their investment in a dead forgotten game. Or just dead entirely like Tera Online. Many many more examples.\n\nGames with this model have no future. To the suits in charge, this is a legacy title. Clear to me that they are squeezing whatever they can from the tiny % of whales before? Before what? Abandon the game? Shutdown official servers? Did you know you can't access all that paid content if the game doesn't connect to the Funcom servers? You can spend thousands on this game and poof! Not yours and never was.\n\nYea no... I don't recommend this game. I've played a lot of mmorpgs, games, and live service games for a long long time... this is the worst I've ever seen a game managed. Its not just incompetent... its maliciously incompetent. \n\nGrounded. Ark. Valheim. 7Days2Die. Minecraft. Enshrouded. Raft. Medieval Dynasty. Smallands. Subnautica. The Long Dark. SCUM. Rust.

HOWEVER, private servers communities and Modders make this game a great jewel.\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone having an itch for Survival meets RPG game.\n\n[h3]The Good:[/h3]\n- Very active modding community gives this game thousands of hours of replayability\n- Good gameplay curve: level up -> build -> grind -> tame -> dungeons and gauntlets\n- Intriguing story but you need to put it together yourself from the stuff you find\n- Low fantasy feel of Conan universe is preserved thoroughly\n- Nice combat\n- Easy to set up mods\n- Easy to play locally, no need for server unless you want to play asynchronously with others\n- Fully customisable rates\n- RP all the way with tons of cosmetics from mods and battle pass/bazaar\n- Overall very fun to play both in Co-op and solo\n- DLCs are worth it most of them. Cosmetics only but they're definitely worth it\n\n[h3]The Bad:[/h3]\n- [b]PREDATORY store system[/b]: the in-game purchases are purely cosmetic however the transactions are predatory using tactics like \"buy this now! limited time!\" and unclear conversion of money to item. You buy crom coins but they almost never transact for exact items. You will have leftover coins so you can be encouraged to buy more.\n- Buggy hitboxes: creatures hit you when you're clearly out of the way, big bosses hit you behind them, etc. You need to get used to this to push harder modded content\n- Latest combat changes are strange to say the least.

After this, or even on mid-level u can get rare/legendary weapons and armor from random mobs in world, who can be killed with no problem with any shitty weapon and armor you have. So you don't need to craft anything anymore, or go for some rare/legendary loot in dungeons. If you don't care about how you look.\n\nThere is no challenge in any part of pve content, wich is main point of game right now, from words of devs.\nMostly all the mobs on default server configuration (or even slightly lowered) are dying in no time: weaker are from 1-2 hits, elite (sculled or end-game locations) from ~5 hits. But if you have geared thrall - you don't even need to fight. They will annihilate everything even faster than you. As the thrall have x10 more hp than you - you don't have to risk at all. \nU will get tons of food, healing items and other consumables from mob drop. It's have no sense to craft it anymore.

However, it seems the game has been on a downwards slope in the recent years ever since this new \"chapter\" stuff came out. They reworked the nice smooth combat and turned it back to janky and rough, the new content has been interesting but executed poorly, the new purge system is a good idea but removes the need to upgrade your base in the slightest because you are the one to activate purges instead of it slowly building up over time. The castle siege system is again while cool executed terribly. If you want to siege it with an army, find 50 friends because you sure as hell ain't dragging 50 thralls over there and if you do (my mistake) have fun watching them charge in and either die, kill 1 enemy and then die, or kill 1 enemy and run back to wherever they were waiting. You can't \"plunder\" the castle's boxes or even take the castle over once you beat it. and with conan's combat where you can get stunlocked very easily or even trapped in between multiple enemies in a collision glitch, having such tight courtyards is very annoying and unfun to fight in. If you can look past these things then I highly recommend getting it as like I said it's one of my favorites and it's really good. if you have the money and think you would like it then go ahead and get it. the only real reason I made the review negative and not positive is to help push these complaints onto the developers like everybody else.", "timestamp_created": 1709259564, "timestamp_updated": 1709259564, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158806268": {"recommendationid": "158806268", "author": {"steamid": "76561199223792386", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 27239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27009, "last_played": 1708454759}, "language": "english", "review": "Gave the current version a try.\nThe new \"journey\" is clunky and defeats the sandbox fun of the game.\nInnane steps have to be completed in order, and they don't always function well.\nHaving to hot swap between journeys to get completion is annoying, no fun there.\nTry opening a menu and swapping journeys when in combat that includes a top tier crafter to pick that journey.\nMaybe die in the process, or follower won't stop and kills crafter.\nInnane, no fun.", "timestamp_created": 1708438584, "timestamp_updated": 1708438584, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158248213": {"recommendationid": "158248213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156914598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 63124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60624, "last_played": 1709494857}, "language": "english", "review": "super fun game!!!!\nfor those who love open world , building, crafting, battles and Conan Theme, this is the top rated!", "timestamp_created": 1707849220, "timestamp_updated": 1707849220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158236796": {"recommendationid": "158236796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209369572", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 28428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1274, "playtime_at_review": 17771, "last_played": 1713758885}, "language": "english", "review": "love it \n", "timestamp_created": 1707838696, "timestamp_updated": 1707838696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158232366": {"recommendationid": "158232366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056576358", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 234808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 692, "playtime_at_review": 224779, "last_played": 1713374961}, "language": "english", "review": "You don't have to follow a quest line to progress in this game.

From the moment you're cast into the brutal expanse of the Exiled Lands, every step, every swing of your blade, every alliance forged is a testament to your strength and cunning.\n\nConan Exiles isn't just about survival; it's about carving your legend into the very fabric of the wilderness. With each passing hour, you'll build towering fortresses that defy the gods, command throngs of followers to do your bidding, and wage war against both man and monster alike. The thrill of exploration is matched only by the satisfaction of seeing your enemies fall at your feet.\n\nBut it's not just about brute force. In the depths of crafting and construction lies a depth of strategy and ingenuity that rewards those who dare to dream big. Whether you're constructing intricate traps to ensnare your foes or mastering the arcane arts to summon otherworldly beings, the possibilities are as endless as the desert horizon.\n\nAnd let's not forget the visceral combat, where every clash of steel feels like a symphony of destruction. With weapons ranging from crude clubs to legendary blades, the thrill of battle never grows old. And when you emerge victorious, standing over the broken bodies of your enemies, you'll know true satisfaction.\n\nWith 1658 hours invested, I can say without hesitation that Conan Exiles is not just a game; it's an epic saga of conquest and triumph.

Be aware that some servers have it so that when you die, you lose everything and someone can take it.  Others have that turned off.  It really depends upon which server you choose as to what the rules are and what kind of behaviors are expected.  Individuals are able to (inexpensively) purchase servers and run them as they see fit.

It was an incredibly buggy mess, had almost no endgame, was completely unbalanced, looked much worse than it was now, ran much worse than it does now, had no mounts, modding was faaaaaaaar more difficult, and many many more things I could list. I'm not about to stand up for a company, but the people who are angry because Funcom is trying to make money off optional items that are almost all cosmetic, really need to touch grass. It is a company. They are made to make money. The battle pass in this game is one of the better less fomo fueled ones I have seen, and the bazaar, is just optional cosmetics that you can buy with premium currency. When these features first launched I was insanely skeptical, but when they didn't lock op gear gear behind it, and allow you to continue it if you play the game, I gave them a pass. Now with the benefit hindsight, I am very glad that they have added these features. I personally never interact with them, but the people who do, give money to funcom, and fund the continued development of one of my favorite games ever. This game is getting fairly long in the tooth, so I am certain that without the premium shops, we would be seeing updates one tenth of the size or none at all. The game has some jank and some things are strangely balanced, but genuinely with all the damn content in the game I can understand the devs not being able to go back and tweak everything all at once. Speaking of the devs, it really feels as though the devs of this game care for the community and their wishes. They also seem to deeply enjoy the conan ip. The writing that is in the game is phenomenal, the weapons are super accurate to the comics, and the tie ins to the series are excellent.\r\nTLDR: Don't listen to the negative unhappy gamers who say the game is worse than it's ever been then turn around and play 1000's more hours.

(I played hundreds of hours on a different platform, so apologies to the trolls infecting Steam who like to insult reviewers for having played \"too long\" or \"not long enough\" to have a legitimate opinion. There is no pleasing you, in any case.)\n\nThis game is so chock-full of bugs and broken features that it really ought to still be in Early Access. It very much feels like a beta. And yet the complete edition, with all DLC, costs a crazy amount of money. Enough money to buy a used game console.\n\nThere are definitely good reasons TO play this game, and for those reasons I will refer you to other reviews. My review will focus on criticisms.\n\nThere are many typos, grammar mistakes, and spelling errors. There are mismatched voice-overs and subtitles.  These are really basic QC/QA failures, in my opinion. Some of these mistakes can even be automatically fixed by software solutions that have existed for decades, and yet are not: Food poisoning gives \"1 points of damage\" every 10 seconds (points, not point). There are areas called \"demense,\" which a simple MS Word spellcheck would have identified.\n\nBuilding mechanics are clunky. Sometimes things snap together, and other times you have to keep trying over and over (or even restart the game, as indicated in dozens of troubleshooting forum posts I have encountered, and probably hundreds more) before they will snap correctly. Obviously buggy.\n\nCompanions automatically attack neutral NPCs, turning them hostile. The workaround is to instruct them to attack nothing, including dangerous enemies that are attacking them and might kill them. Oops! Bye-bye hard work that you did leveling that companion up.\n\nCompanions will block you into doorways. You cannot clip through them, so your only choice is to commit suicide, if you are not on a private server with debug options. There is a \"move\" command, but it often does not work when the companion is right in front of you. Suicide it is! Bye-bye progress.\n\nThe \"move\" command is necessary, however. Occasionally you need to use it to work around your companion's broken path-finding, manually giving them waypoints so that they can walk around that 2-meter rock in front of them. (I had this problem with non-human companions in particular.)\n\nBaby pets can disappear from your taming pen at precisely the moment they are to become adults (extremely common bug, and extremely frustrating and disheartening). Dear lord this game is buggy af.\n\nI've had tons of pets and companions fall through the map, for no apparent reason, while on guard. They cannot always be rescued. Sometimes you have to enable no-clip and go beneath the map to find them. Not an option if you are playing on a server.\n\nGrass clips through the floor of your buildings (though I have read that this is an engine limitation).\n\nWhen you level up and adjust your stats (such as encumbrance), the new values do not immediately update. You must close out or switch tabs for it to refresh the values. (Seriously, wtf? How hard is that to fix, let alone reproduce or notice?)\n\nWhen crafting armor, you cannot sort by defense values. You must instead tediously scroll through nearly a hundred different recipes to find the one you want. (And buying the DLC makes this worse, without actually changing your available armor values. So don't buy the cosmetic DLC!!! Other than additional aesthetic options, they will make your gaming experience worse.) The weapon crafting bench has an identical flaw.\n\nFully experiencing the lore of the game practically requires that you abuse walkthroughs. Seriously. I found the first journal on the Isle of Siptah, and it was half buried in the sand at a seemingly random location. There is NO WAY I would have noticed it if not by sheer luck (or, again, by abusing online walkthroughs). This is a regular pattern. Even crafting-enabling stelas are easy to miss. They don't glow until you are right in front of them, and they easily blend into the samey scenery of the game. This might be Conan: Exiles's biggest sin, since deciphering what the world is all about and solving its many mysteries adds so much to the game, given its rich source material\u2013if you are willing to accept that pulp fiction such as Conan can be labeled \"rich\". I am, because I have seen the attention to detail that many of the devs have lavished upon the setting. However, the means to engage in these mysteries and this loving detail have decidely not been given enough attention by the publisher. (I say \"publisher\" and not \"devs\" because the publisher often directs the devs, or at least dictates their parameters.)\n\nAnd in overall terms as well, the game does an extraordinarily poor job of telegraphing anything. What should you be focusing on next when crafting? (The so-called Journey system alleviates this somewhat, but even IT is buggy. You have to abuse the admin commands to fix its bugs and complete Journey steps that remain broken after YEARS of reports by players. On an official server, you are out of luck.) What is important in your immediate environment? What monster are you currently fighting?\n\nYes, you heard that right. Funcom implemented nameplates for humans, but still hasn't implemented them for anything else, including bosses. So if you really want to know what a monster is called, which can be seriously useful when researching recipes and the like, or even just appreciating the lore surrounding exactly what you are fighting, the most reliable way to find out is to let it kill you and look closely at the message that says what killed you. Occasionally, using a butcher's cleaver on the corpse will take off its head, and you can identify it that way, but why on earth is this even necessary? This game does not take place on earth, Funcom. We do not know the names of the monsters we are fighting if you do not tell us. Yeah, that's realistic, kinda? But it's not a type of realism that contributes to immersion. It just feels like a lazy omission.\n\nLighting is both buggy and badly designed. In certain areas on Siptah, it makes the game almost unplayable at certain times of the day, even with a torch. I found many complaints about this issue from back in early 2022. Guess they never considered it worth putting it into their budget to address.\n\nAt least one dungeon in Isle of Siptah is designed such that you can trap yourself. Other than cheats (admin commands), the only way to escape is to wait until you die of hunger or thirst (or commit suicide, which is the more efficient option in this game) and respawn at your base.\n\nThe Sigils added to the Isle of Siptah are a great addition to the game, or would be if they were better implemented. There is NO information given in the UI for what the Sigils you have consumed are currently doing for you. All you get is an unhelpful icon. You can't even see a label for them that would help you look them up on the internet (!?!?).\n\nOK. I could go on and on and double the length of this review. I seriously could. I lost count of the number of bugs and broken things I encountered that made me think, wtf, did they even bother to hire a designer? Or a play-tester? I eventually made it my mantra: \"This is the norm for a Funcom game. THIS IS FUNCOM.\" And just accepted it. I think you get the drift. This game has not been in the oven long enough. So why are they continuing to release DLCs, when they so obviously haven't even finished the base game? Does Funcom care more about ongoing revenues than quality? (Of course they do. They are a business.)\n\nAnd you might ask, why do I recommend it in spite of the above? Well, because I found it fun as hell. And as much as I scorn a company that has the cheek to release such a blatantly broken product and label it 1.0 (and release multiple DLCs to boot), at the end of the day, for a video game, isn't fun the most important thing? I also think this was clearly a \n\n[See comments for the rest of the review.]", "timestamp_created": 1709811909, "timestamp_updated": 1709812105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510107815265655518", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163040707": {"recommendationid": "163040707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175307305", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 61644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2962, "playtime_at_review": 61346, "last_played": 1713625737}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Conan Exiles\" is a standout in the survival genre, offering a captivating journey through the brutal world of Conan the Barbarian.

BUT:\r\nIt turns out I actually can die if attacked by the wolf and lose my inventory there for no freaking reason.\r\n3) You see your grave on the map but it doesn't really exist and you cannot find it. Self explainatory. VERY frustrating.\r\n\r\nIf you do decide to play, be careful of nearby enemies, they can combo kill you in a second. And if you are below them they can jump on your head and make you overweight. Or if they just jump of the cliff and die, the game will tp/despawn them.\r\n\r\nWe tried to get a refund but can't since we have 2+ hours of gameplay. The truth is first 3 hours we were actually completing \"journeys\" - in-game tutorials on how to do different stuff, so we only noticed the bugs when we crafted first light armor, weapons and went to the closest enemy spawn. \r\n\r\nSo much pain, trama.

I am going to compare this game to ARK and Rust. While it is its own beast with its own merits and flaws, it is within the same genre, and many people will wonder how it compares in certain aspects.[/i]\n\nOut of every early access survival game, Conan Exiles has the most potential I've ever seen, and it's the first day. I am completely baffled by the negative response. Compared to ARK at its release, this game has a much clearer vision and a more complete framework; even if a lot of the contents of that framework are missing or buggy. I'm inclined to believe the negative reception is due to the fact that Conan is an existing IP, not a new one. People might just expect an IP like this to be complete, and not release in Early Access. I'm not entirely sure why those people purchased the game in the first place. There is definitely a bright blue EARLY ACCESS banner on the Steam store page.\n\nAll that said, the game does have a lot of issues. There's a lot of seemingly random framedrops, even to the point of the game completely freezing for several seconds. I'm confident this will be worked out with further optimisation, but it is an issue that has somewhat affected my enjoyment of the game.\n\n[u]Pros[/u]\n[list][*][b]Customisation[/b] - [i]By far the best character creation I've seen in a survival game. It's nearly at proper RPG levels.[/i]\n[*][b]Presentation[/b] - [i]The presentation and atmosphere of the game, at least initially is superb. I can only suspect that it will get better from here.[/i]\n[*][b]User Interface[/b] - [i]Best UI in its genre. It's simple, but not ARK simple. I said simple, not ugly.[/i]\n[*][b]Graphics[/b] - [i]The game isn't the absolute [b]best[/b] looking game in the genre, but it's obvious there was a lot of care put into the visuals.[/i]\n[*][b]Mining[/b] - [i]Definitely the most interesting and satisfying mining system I've seen so far. The rocks dent and chunk away in the place you hit them before finally crumbling. It's a minor thing, but it's pretty nice.[/i]\n[*][b]Leveling and Crafting[/b] - [i]Fairly similar to ARK, but a bit more streamlined in my opinion. As you level up you gain points to level up attributes like Strength or Encumbrance. Furthermore you gain points to purchase crafting recipes. But unlike in ARK, a lot of the recipes in Exiles will net you two or more items.[/i][/list]\n\n[u]Not Bad, But Definite Room For Improvement[/u]\n[list][*][b]Combat[/b] - [i]As you get better armour and weapons, combat becomes much much better. There is a degree of \"Git gud\" going on. However, blocking responsiveness isn't fantastic, and enemy range isn't always what you'd expect it to be.[/i]\n[*][b]Building[/b] - [i]Exiles is in an interesting spot of having a building system that is very similar to ARK's, but also better. The size of the individual building pieces is rather small, but despite this, you don't feel like a giant standing in a hobbit hole if you only build your shelter one wall high. Looking at you here, ARK.[/i][/list]\n\n[u]Cons[/u]\n[list][*][b]General Bugginess[/b] - [i]Very buggy, but not so much that it's unplayable.[/i]\n[*][b]Optimisation[/b] - [i]Not very well optimised, but it is still much better than similar games at their launch.[/i]\n[*][b]Co-Op Desync Bugs[/b] - [i]Haven't tested server multiplayer, but Co-Op, even with a good connection has lots of desync issues. Time of day isn't always going to match up between players. I was also\u2014as the person not hosting\u2014randomly losing my tools as I tried to equip them. At one point we also saw two different items in the same slot of a chest. Removing the item and dropping it reverted it to normal.[/i]\n[*][b]Spawning[/b] - [i]This is mainly an issue for animals, but it's also somewhat problematic for players too. Animals will frequently spawn right on top of you. Out of the time I've spent playing, no less than 3 crocodile-alligators made my ballsack their personal spawnpoint. Of course, I could have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it seemed a bit too coincidental. This exacerbates the issue with low level beds. When you're low enough level that you are having trouble with a single croc, having another spawn on you means nearly certain death. I haven't unlocked beds yet, but I'm assuming they're more than single use, as the low level bedrolls break after one respawn. I feel like this is kind of counter productive. All it does is encourage resource wasting by building 2+ bedrolls and filling your base with them. A much better, but still similar mechanic would be to damage the bedroll after each respawn, and require it to be repaired. They could also implement a respawn cooldown. That would be vastly superior to how they currently work.[/i][/list]\n\n[u][b]Verdict:[/b][/u] - [i]If you enjoy the genre and the setting, and are willing to provide feedback, there are definitely worse things you could spend $30 on. If you're wondering if the game has promise and are just looking to see if it might be worth buying in the future; unless the devs royally eff it up, this game is [b]very[/b] promising. \n\n[u][b]My Rig[/b][/u]\n[b]OS:[/b] Windows 10 Pro\n[b]CPU:[/b] AMD FX-6300\n[b]GPU:[/b] Nvidia GTX 970OC\n[b]RAM:[/b] 8GB", "timestamp_created": 1485908860, "timestamp_updated": 1485910186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 698, "votes_funny": 33, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912614822387695313", "comment_count": 47, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91192942": {"recommendationid": "91192942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039183052", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 16018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4607, "last_played": 1711309286}, "language": "english", "review": "A caveat: I play on a private server very casually.

No further DLC were published, instead there is an ingame market with very expensive cosmetic items (like 3-4 items for 10$).\n\nSince the age of sorcery you have to update your game every time a new season gets published. The battle pass system is a big disappointment: 1) items shown within the seasons trailers are hidden behind a paywall, hence you need to buy the battlepass; 2) when a new season gets published I ran into the issue that I can't use armor nor weapons I previously unlocked with the previous Battle Pass (which I bought for approx. 10$), because I'm \"not entitled to use XYZ\". So I payed money to be able to unlock stuff via gameplay, that I then can\u2019t use after the next season that\u2019s already lurking around the corner gets published.\n\nOh and Funcom Live Services are unavailable each time a new season get\u2019s published. And because Funcom implemented the Funcom-Loader some time ago (I don\u2019t know the correct name for it), you can\u2019t play online, whenever there are issues with Funcom Live Services.\n\nThere are old bugs and translation errors in the game that don\u2019t get fixed. More so: new ones get implemented with each \"update\" and/or season.\n\nI used to love Conan Exiles, played it for 589 hours, but what once was a beautiful game became nothing more than a money grab. And it looks like it\u2019s getting worse. I'm going to finish the current battle pass to get my money's worth, but...\n\nAll things considered I would not recommend the game!\n\n\nUpdate 1: I finished the Age of Sorcery and came back to Age of War Chapter 2. After two days I feel like the PVE mode became way too easy! You get too many resources, the time needed to break a thrall or to tame an animal is way too short now and without the original purge system, there's less of a danger for your bases, since you can control if and where the purge will happen. Don't get me wrong: I like the \"Stygian Invasion Purge\", but it should've been an extra and not the replacement for the original purge system. I know Conan has massive problems with PVP, but all the changes made to both PVP AND PVE diminish the PVE experience!\n\nUpdate 2: Yes, I'm still playing this game, because I love the main theme and feeling, HOWEVER, f*ckups keep piling up! Age of War Chapter 3 introduced some new features that didn't work and a lot of players got banned (temporarily) because of some faults on the developers side. The staff however went on holidays, because Funcom decided to YET AGAIN publish a big update right before some holiday season! The newly implemented Tavern System is cool and the Bazar even sells a fitting Yamatai themed tavern set consisting of 9 items for everyone interested and willing to pay for DLC. It cost 3.510 Crom-Coins (= 24,36\u20ac), with discount 2.457 Crom-Coins (= 17,05\u20ac) --> I calculated the price on basis of buying 5.040 Crom-Coins for 34,99\u20ac!]. HOWEVER\u00b2 at the current state the yamatai seating (seating items are important for the tavern to attract customers you'll be able to contract as thralls) doesn't work! How pricey DLC like this gets published without even checking the bare minimum funtionality is beyond my comprehension.\n\nUpdate 3: I stopped playing the game for some while and came back just now to check on the new chapter, but I finally lost interest in the game for good after Age of War Ch. 4 got released. More unecessary changes (for example a cheap looking UI). I'm just dissappointed and tired. \n\nSo my final verdict: Keep playing if you (still) love the game, if you've already poured extra money into it, or if you're just a casual gamer, but don't buy if you're expecting a fluently running game by a caring company!

The mood and atmosphere really suited me, even though I have little to none experience with the conan universe. Also I generally like open world survival games. I came to Conan from countless hours of Ark: Survival Evolved, and although they have many similarities, this is an entirely different game.\n\nConan Exiles have had its ups and downs. There has been a LOT of server issues and game bugs, and much of the game mechanics has been revamped several times, such as combat. There has also been some trouble with the developers interraction with the community, but this have improved a lot.\n\nWhen the game first came out, it didn't have that much to offer to the survival genre that we hadn't already seen in similar games, except maybe the avatars, large deity-based creatures that can be summonned at endgame to really wreck havoc on other players. Sadly, this was very overpowered, and the game got boring really quick. The gameplay (for me at least) was mostly Farming -> Building -> Get raided -> Repeat.. But as I said, the mood and atmosphere in this game made it bearable none the less. And sometimes I would just explore, and each time I would find something new, like a new NPC camp, friendly NPC's that would teach you stuff, some kind of lore (that is scattered around the entire map), caves/dungeons, etc.\n\nThe leveling and combat was boring at first, it was mostly just spamming the attack-button on buggy creatures while running around, or shoot the more powerful creatures from a safe place. But this was not a big problem for me, I enjoyed the game anyways. My biggest issue at that time was how easy it was to exploit the game and the mechanics, and the PvP was very unsatisfying. It was more or less required to build your base up high on mountains and such, then remove all the stairs so you couldnt get raided. The whole ordeal was just stupid and sad, and the game couldnt be played the way it was meant to be.\n\nAfter a couple 100 hours I took a long break from the game. I hadn't played through any of the dungeons since I mostly played alone, but I reached max lvl and felt like i had seen the most of what the game had to offer.\n\nAnd now, many months later, I am back.\n\nAt first it felt like the same game I had played before, except for a more cinematic intro, and a bit improved Character Creation. But it didnt take long before this felt almost like a new game for me!\n\nThe combat feels much more alive now with more dynamic combos and movements. Enemies are WAY less bugged, and they all have their own patterns which is similar to games like Dark Souls. Combat now includes things like lock-on and enemy health bar, which is very satisfying for me. I haven't tried archery yet, which was my primary fighting method when I first played this game, but I hope I will see improvements there as well.\n\nWhen it comes to the world in general the map has gotten so much bigger, with two new biomes! Also old familiar places have been pimped up, and the world seems even more lively now. And still, the game is more performance-friendly then ever!\n\nWhen it comes to PvP I've seen a lot of improvements, such as traps for raid protection, counter measures for the avatars, time window for Structure Damage, etc. The combat is also more dynamic now (you can defeat a player even when you have weaker weapons and lower lvl, if you know what you're doing). This opens up for building more freely, which is a very important aspect for me! Also I feel the community recently has become more friendly (even in Europe, haha).\n\nAnd then we have the building/crafting aspect, which I've always liked in Conan (compared to games like Ark). This have also been greatly modified/improved. There are so many things you can craft, and for the architects out there, there is few limitations when it comes to structures and building. Also, the new system of which you learn the different crafts is so satisfying (for me at least), even though it took some time to get used to.\n\nAnd last, when you're not building or engaging in PvP, the gameplay revolves heavily around lore and dungeons. (this is maybe an even more important aspect in PvE). And there is just so much to explore!\n\nConclusion: Though the game still has bugs (a few which I find severe) I really see a lot of improvements in an already good game, and I cant wait for the release!\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say right now is that the plans for mounts and magic is scrapped (for now atleast), and i was SO looking forward to that! :(\n\nHope this was helpful!\n\nCheers! :)", "timestamp_created": 1525208795, "timestamp_updated": 1525358591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 367, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.906358003616333008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125078529": {"recommendationid": "125078529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080303900", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 216132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5398, "playtime_at_review": 126927, "last_played": 1713798311}, "language": "english", "review": "I truly fucking love this game. One of my most played of all time and I'm still playing lots. I've gone through pvp, pve, mixed, modded and vanilla servers. Its all a hell of alot of fun, friends or solo you can still carve out a niche. I really do recommend this game to anyone looking for an open world, crafting, base building and survival game. Combat is rewarding and deep, crafting system is intuitive, buildings can be fucking massive beautiful castles and theres lots of fun RPG like elements unique to the game. However, their new battle pass and bazaar system is disgusting, money hungry and just terrible. Youre paying the cost of 1 dlc for 1 set of armor in it, and honestly the armour can look shitty. I've bought half the dlc and will continue to buy those as well as play the game. I will not support that horrific money grab bazaar and dont recommend anyone else to either. If that is removed or changed I will happily change my review, but until then I have to have my say however small it is.\n\nAmendment since people dont get it: Its not just about 'paying for a game you enjoy, you should be paying 100$ for every hour you spend playing.' its that the pricing has gone completely out of wack, they split up item sets and make it all time gated. The battle pass system is a 1 time purchase so you know what I can get over that since it pays you back the full amount. The bazaar is still just terrible, the blood crystal weapon set is split up between the battle pass, twitch drops and the bazaar so you cant get it all without paying ALOT, they are charging stupid pricing like 15$ for a table set of decor, the stormglass set already requires you to buy the isle of siptah but they put beautiful pieces for that set into the bazaar meaning if you want to make the best build with that set possible you need to fork over another $10, the latest Turian tent set isnt even complete with it missing vital pieces to even make a build with just those items and lastly everything is time gated. It is everything wrong with the system, overpriced, set splitting, incomplete and time gated. If these items were bundled up into DLC and sold as DLC packs I wouldnt have made this review. As I said I love the game, I love the old DLC model but im not going to support this cash grab. This review is the literal only way I, a random person online, can have any impact to it.

I really did love this game. TLDR: I'm sad angry and disappointed that they don't fix things that need fixing and instead of doing DLC they are going the Battle Pass route. They ignore things that need addressing and focus on craven attempts to get them more money. If you play PvP, Funcom doesn\u2019t know how to support you so I can\u2019t recommend this game to you. Hacking and exploits still run rampant. This is the last time I'm playing Conan Exiles [or any other Funcom Game] then uninstalling permanently. Thank you to this community - you have all been wonderful.\n\nI\u2019m not opposed to DLC one look at my account and you will see I have bought all of the Expansions for this game because I do want to support games I play quite a lot of. But Funcom is not only deaf to the community keeping this game alive, they made it clear they are going to monetize the ever-loving-f*** out of this game. \nThe battle pass system is a horrible gaming system that NO ONE WANTED TO SEE IN A SURVIVAL GAME. The \u201cFear of Missing Out\u201d mechanic of monetization schemes like this prey on your own psychology to wring money out of you. Instead of buying DLC to support a game I\u2019m going to have to spend WAAAY more money just to keep up with current content and my bank account can\u2019t afford it. The entire system in predatory. It\u2019s designed to hide the price so you don\u2019t realize how much you are paying. It preys on your psychology. It preys on you \u2013 the customer. The only way to win against a system like this is to stop playing the game entirely and spend my time somewhere else with companies who won\u2019t treat me like a bank account \u2013 there only to dump cash on them for mediocre content effort that modders gave us years ago.  \nSo I\u2019m playing the game one last time before September 1st comes out and I can\u2019t support or play this game anymore.\n \nThe things this community has asked for; Fix the bugs and exploits in the game!\nThings the community DIDN\u2019T ask for; Hey! Beat more money out of us with scummy monetization practices!\n\nI've spent quite a few hours in Conan Exiles - mostly in single-player because there are quite a few issues with the bugs in the game that have NEVER been addressed - one of which is connecting to servers. It's hard to get friends into the game when the game itself just randomly tells you it can't connect. I have tried all the so-called 'fixes' for this [sometimes i'm successful sometimes I'm not] but it's an issue that has been around for years now. Mostly this aspect of being unable to join servers lead me down the path of single-player and all the wonderful mods this community has put out over the years.\n\nThis is a survival adventure game with PvP elements. Survival Adventure has rarely been done with bosses and progression quite the same way before Conan Exiles. You have a list of in-game goals and achieving them grants you experience. Here's the thing; some of those goals are actually quite fun, and the ones that tell you to go after bosses [in the base map] are the best. The bosses in the base map can be quite a challenge to a single person and getting to them is quite a challenge on its own. They are fun, and they unlock better gear to go after tougher bosses. More than that they are integrated into the game in such a way that you actually have lore for these bosses. The care and diligence with the way the world building was taken made this game incredibly unique when it first launched.\n\nPvP [Player versus Player]. Full disclaimer; I don\u2019t engage with PvP in survival games. If you like PvP I can\u2019t recommend this game to you because Funcom doesn\u2019t know how to support you. You don\u2019t have to take my word for it, just google \u201cEverything wrong with Conan Exiles PVP\u201d from Ceronesthes [a pvp veteran], for a whole host of issues [and potential fixes] Funcom refuses to consider when balancing the game for PvP.\n\n[Isle of Siptah] The first expansion; when initially brought to PC, it was so devoid of content their main player base Player vs. Enemy [PvE] camp had nothing to latch onto in the map. The Isle of Siptah has a number of issues - chiefly it being pay-to-win in PvP [there are items/armor on this DLC map you can't get on the base map]. Which is fine - it's a design choice Funcom made - but it's a choice that made a lot of players upset. And it didn't help the ailing PvP community at all. \n\nAfter they revamped the Isle of Siptah map HEAVILY did it even become playable in single player - but it's still a map that feels like it didn't have the same care an attention put into it like the base game. Some of these bosses can be fun, but they aren\u2019t ingrained into the map in the same way as the base map through gameplay/ lore/ and straight up world building. They took one of the most unique and fun things about their game and put zero effort in that regard on their first expansion.\n\nModders are fixing the game and adding the content the player base was begging for.  If it weren\u2019t for the modders this game would have had a much shorter life cycle. Not enough credit or love is going to the small community churning out FREE content. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1661777407, "timestamp_updated": 1661777407, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1257, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900589883327484131", "comment_count": 59, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92972465": {"recommendationid": "92972465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032635963", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 25218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23952, "last_played": 1702246072}, "language": "english", "review": "This is... a pretty good open world sandbox. ...not going to lie, I've played this mostly on private servers with friends.

Its actually capturing and it makes the world feel more dangerous and alive. Sandstorms, purges (raids), and Legendary Creatures that.... well... better come prepared with some friends. I thought it would get in the way of the fun, but it adds so much I am glad it is there.\n\n\n----Crafting----\nVery intuitive and deep. From \"memory\" potions to reset your feats and attributes, to meads and ale to get you drunk and add buffs or to warm you up for cold conditions so you don't die, to cooking, to alchemical bases for making potions or stronger steel, to weapons, armour, etc. It feels endless at times with the amount of options you have. Very satisfying each time to progress to the next recepe and to unlock new things either through learning or exploration. You can even have thralls (boink enemies over the head and bend their will to do you bidding) and pets now.\n\n\n----Building----\nEasy snap like mechanic that is again, intuitive and so much fun. You can build almost anywhere and almost anything. Not gonna say more about this one, other than its a time-siphon that I am enjoying so much.\n\n\n----Exploration----\nGot bored of surviving, crafting and building? Not to worry.\nYou got some really kick \"ash\" lands to explore. A desert, savanahs, jungle, woodland and kinda dead-ish woodland, highland, ancient cities, the iced north and a bloody volcano. Better come prepaired again for different weather conditions. Or, just wander to come across other player made settlements, etc.\n\nWhat is great about exploration is that it all adds to a backstory that you can follow, discover recipes, and ofc new/more creatures and enemies. It is so full of things to come across it surprised me. Making survival at that point take a back seat. With caves, dungeons, and more.\n\n\n----RPG Elements and Backstory----\nLike I shortly hinted, there is an entire backstory that you have to figure out and discover. It might be annoying to some that you need to, kind of, in a way discover the story of the game. I personally found this to be great and one of the best ways to make my experience completely free. I do what I want, and as I do it, little gems are dropped on my lap. Not going into spoiler territory, but I found it to be very good.\n\nNeeds a little more polish, for sure, sometimes it feels a little unfinished. And it could do with an ACTUAL cutscene for the ending too. Those that finished the game know what I mean.\n\nSpeaking of which. You can end the game. That is in fact part of the story. You, trying to free yourself from the lands. Or stay there and conquer. Warning, leaving the lands is permanent. And the character is \"deleted\" and now freed from the exile lands. Serves as a great way to put an end to the madness of no sleep as well I guess.\n\nThis all, along with how you build your character, has translated into more role playing elements than a number of role playing games out there.\n\n\n----Its Conan----\nI may be biased. Hell, I even played Age of Conan for 2 years subbed when it came out even though I could see so many shortcomings with it and I was against subscriptions even as I caved to it. This here, is a great rendition of Hyborian lore that any fan should be rather happy to enjoy :)\n\nFuncom has come a long way and this really feels like they learned a lot from their experience with Age of Conan in dos and donts.\n\n\n----Combat----\nLove it. I actually can't make up my mind what fighting style I enjoy more. The last update added so much more to the combat, and I think now it is in tip top condition. From dual wielding daggers, to shield and sword, to javelins, spears, axes, maces, hammers, great swords, and even the new addition of the Katana. Which I thought would be a gimmick alternate to the greatswords..... Ooooh no they aren't.\n\nFor me personally, maces, hammers and spears aside, I really can't make up my mind which I like more. All on a system based on different effects with shield bashing, crippling and bleeding, poisoning, dodging, blocking, or even kicking enemies to throw them out of guard mode. Never had so much fun with real time combat in a game of this type before.\n\nAnd no magic. For ranged you have javelins, throwing axes, fire orbs what have you, and ofc bows and arrows.\n\nAnd tbh, I am glad. This is the land of Hyboria. Who ever thought of a bunch of wizards running the hills hurling bolts of lightning? There is a chance they will add magic, but I kinda hope they don't. We can summon huge avatars in the image of gods of worship to rek shop as well. Its enough imo.\n\nUnless they find a way to make magic interesting and fitting to the world? Perhaps even limited and hard to finally master and not something that every newcomer has and just starts throwing fireballs. I could be ok with that I guess.\n\n\n----Non-Monetised---- I enjoy the model of the game as well. No monetisations, single purchase, and its yours. The content you can buy is just cosmetic really. With completely new building skins, plus armour and weapon \"skins\" that don't power creep into the game and ruin balance. And with this system at hand there is potential for them to add so many more variations in the future.\n\n\n----Play it as You Like + Modding----\nOnline, PvP, PvE with PvP windows on certain hours/days, full PvE, or go offline and play it solo or co-op with friends on private games were mind you, all options are yours to control, along with even admin privelleges (just press \"make admin\" and you're done) for a lot of wacky ways to test, break, or simply enjoy the game.\n\nAdd this to the mechanics of crafting, survival, building, combat, exploration or roleplaying, and you are gold to go with plenty hours to waste.\n\n\n----Server Stability and Bugs----\nThis one is an issue. The servers feel like they are from a smaller developer. It kind of shows. Although 70% of the time it feels great, its not the best stability. I haven't tried PvP for this very reason, and do not intend to. I don't think I can enjoy a game with frequent 100 ping climbs. This is rather noticeable on a real time combat game like this where timing really is key between living or dying. And being able to play offline rubbs it in your face when you see how fluid and awesome the game can be.\n\nAgain, although less than a third of the time its going bannanas, its still a little too much I think and throws your confidence off for things like PvP. There are private servers too ofcourse, so this experience can vary.\n\nThere are also some few bugs here and there to iron out, but nothing too game breaking so far. Sure, they do become annoying when they happen. Other times they are just hilarious (like AI bugs). This is another area that needs more polish.\n\nAside from some bugs here and there, some RP polish and server stability/netcode polish, the game is a blast. I completely recommend it.

The game offers no information what data is collected or stored which is illegal under EU GDPR regulations. If you have bought the game prior to 16.06.2020 update, I would recommend to STOP playing the game and seek for an immediately refund if you wish so.\n\nThis update has also pretty much broke 99% of all mods, got rid of Steamworks APIs, most things will now go through their 3rd party services. People are unable to join servers, some cant even use the game due to no more possible offline play.\n\nIf you are looking to purchase the game, until developers clearly indicate what is this new funcom's 3rd party account service, where is it based and what data is being shared/collected, avoid buying the game even under sale, unless the game is actually free.\n\nUpdate [url=https://store.steampowered.com/newshub/app/440900/view/2468484071684769161]18.06.2020[/url].

Maybe the best hardcore pvp survival game out there. Sure it's a buggy mess at times, but the lore is suprisingly cool and pvp barrier of entry is much better than Ark.  The building is better than Ark, the items and weapons in the game are better than ark (there are a ton of weapons), the bosses and dungeons are numerous and better much than Ark... it's a lot of fun and massively underappreciated. \n\nBUT... cheating is rampant in this game. there's a notorious cheater that just hit us last night, RUIN SYSTEM is what he's known as currently. He looted our vault that's 100 ft up in the air just by looking at it. It wasn't even during raid hours. He ran like the speed of a horse and killed me on my mount. He was clipping through walls and was killing us even though he's level 20 and we're three level 60's and pretty well geared. \n\nBeforehand, we witnessed him raid another vault without breaking it as well and put on the best gear in the game and proceeded to run around killing people. When called him out (because he was terrible at pvp honestly) he crashed the server for over an hour and duped his stats so he had maxed out everything,  which is something they do. \n\nWe reported it to Funcom, but this is a massive issue in this game and all of the veteran players are leaving. It's not like Call of Duty where you just get more kills, the items in this game can sometimes take hundreds of hours to accumulate to the degree that people do, and someone just comes in and takes it, undermeshes a base where no-one can raid it, and Funcom doesn't seem to be doing all that much about it. \n\nI would stay away until it's crystal clear that they have improved their anti-cheat, or crack down hard on hackers.

It is genuinely disappointing to see where it has gone\u2026 I understand that they\u2019re a business and that they have to make money\u2026 but making money shouldn\u2019t have to come at the expense of your customers\u2026 I don\u2019t know who\u2019s idea it was to put in a shady business practice like a Battle Pass and shop\u2026 and then hide them behind \u2018Crom Coins\u2019... but shame on you.

And in a game where people love to decorate and build\u2026 Fomo is even more present. Didn\u2019t spend X dollars on the Battle Pass?

Just a note, we are diehard Conan fans, and the given genre is right in our sweet spot having been avid \"AD&D\" and \"Everquest\" players back in the day.\n\nI have at least tried most of the popular survival games on the market, taking far greater interest in games such as \"The Forest\" and \"Empyrion\" than games such as \"Ark\" which I played some, and games like \"Rust\", \"Life is Feudal\", \"Day Z\", \"7 D2D\", which I sampled but never really got into. I also greatly enjoy many of the single player survival games some of which are VR capable such as \"Subnautica\". While I consider myself equally PVE and PVP centric as a player, playing ARK PVP was nothing short of a relentless and unproductive experience and despite some tenacious efforts to enjoy it on my part, was never fun to play. However \u201cARK\u201d in VR is nothing short of one of the greatest treats I have ever encountered as a lifelong gamer of many years. \n\nUp until \"Conan Exiles\" we have just been kicking around with games like \"Overwatch\", and beta testing \"Shroud of the Avatar\", \"Gloria Victis\", \"Savage Lands\" etc... We have also basically played just about every MMO on the market including \"Conan\" for many years. I would say we have extremely discerning taste when it comes to gaming and will happily take a quality game like \"Mount and Blade\" whose lack of graphics are easily made up for with content and replay ability. \n\nThis is the perspective with which I am judging \"Conan Exiles\" understanding that it is still in EA and continues to evolve to a finished product. I would also recommend paying little heed to any reviews be they positive or negative from any \"testers\" who have not put at least 10 to 20 hours into the game due to the complexity of the in game systems and the sheer time it takes to experience various aspects of the game short of drastically altering the default settings. Conversely I'd caution against listening to the people who play with x10 everything and then complain that the game is too easy and lacking in content. So is the Rubik\u2019s Cube if you physically take it apart and reassemble it correctly.\n\nAs much as we have wanted to continue playing on the official PVP servers, the experience was tantamount to that which we had in \"ARK\" in that when you aren't fighting relentless server issues, you are contending with a completely unbalanced, often toxic population of people hell bent on making your in game experience anything but productive or pleasurable by utilizing the plethora of bugs, glitches and exploits which currently riddle the PVP portion of the game. I am confident that in time, given the tenacity of the devs and their constant efforts to patch and improve the game, that these issues will become manageable and we will revisit that element of the game in the future. In the meantime the two of us are just playing PVE together on a private server, and truth be told, we are absolutely loving the game. In fact, from this perspective, there is little to nothing, save some minor bugs here and there that we even dislike about the game.\nIt has been somewhat similar from a survival and crafting point of view to our coop experience in \"The Forest\" and \"Empyrion\", albeit even simpler to learn and progress than in either of those games. We have only slightly deviated from the default settings and are taking our time progressing through the content. We are both around level 30 and have tried to balance our time between building, leveling and exploring, all of which are extremely rewarding in their own way.\n\nGraphically the game is phenomenal and runs beautifully on our rigs, both of which are powerful machines.\nThe grind is definitely present but is by no means as laborious as many games of the genre, and by comparison is in some ways more straight forward and rewarding.\n\nThere is no shortage of flora and fauna, as well as recipes and uses for that which you obtain from harvesting them. If anything, the fauna can be a bit overwhelming in the earlier stages of the game and act as kind of a meter suggesting by one's success or failure if it is time to move on, or to stay put and improve gear and attributes a bit more.\n\nMy wife and I are always on the hunt for games that we can play together be they MMOs, survival or tower defense genres. We dabble with the \"Dark Souls\" series, but \"Conan Exiles\" truly satisfied just about every aspect of our gaming needs. Most importantly, we are having fun playing in a way so many games simply fail to deliver.\nThere will definitely come a time when we will yearn to play this game in a PVP setting, but currently we are enjoying the aspect of the game we are playing and the experience is nothing short of a 10/10 for us.\n\nI would surmise that the best way to appreciate this game in a PVP setting would be on a limited and well modded server of maybe twenty to thirty people or so, with smaller clan size limits of perhaps five people per clan. Obviously the more like minded the players are on the server, the more enjoyable the experience will be for everyone. Alas, not everyone has ten or twenty friends they can get to play the same game, but this is one game which would truly shine above most given such a scenario. We definitely look forward to the server issues being improved, and we remain encouraged by the obvious care and time the devs are continuously putting into the game's development. Until then we will continue to enjoy this great experience and look forward for more to come as the game progresses.", "timestamp_created": 1487733929, "timestamp_updated": 1488924905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 802, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.88395005464553833", "comment_count": 51, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81663532": {"recommendationid": "81663532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046315468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 832, "last_played": 1607178844}, "language": "english", "review": "It was good back in the day.

Also recommend buying all the DLCs, if not a full price at a discount, especially if you like to build like me.\n\nBut i can no longer give this game a good review because of the microtransaction that they have implemented. Not only the game got a lot more expensive, comparing to the old system of DLCs, they also add a timed purchase thing to the items/bundles in the shop.\n\nAnd all of this takes me to one more thing that might be illegal in your country. Buy doing the time limitation and putting most of the items in at \"discount\" may be illegal because they are putting the real price as a discounted price, and that is illegal in most of the EU if not all, also UK and US. I think some one should look closer into this.\n\nAnd for the Steam page/store, i think it's time to create a badge for games that follow/practice anti-consumer schemes, so everyone searching/buying the game can be worn about it and should be very well visable on the store.\n\nEdit (2023-02-17):\n\ni'm going to make this edit to address some of the comments made, if not all to this date.\n\n1. I never told that you didn't get some freebies and the new game updates. So to clarify you DO GET some freebies, and you DO GET the newest updates for free.\n2. I don't oppose the devs making more money using DLCs, in fact in encourage the newcomers to buy all the DLCs the best way they can afford.\n3. For those that clame the game dies if devs don't make new content, they are so very wrong and this game really is the proof of it. This game only maintain a relatively good population of gamers thanks to an amazing mod comunity, that afterwords justify dev to first of all, fix a broken game, and then add new content.\n\nNow i like to address store of the game:\n\nIf the dev really want to make good money they could implement a lest scammy and less illegal store.\n\nThe scammy part:\n1. The players are required to buy a fiat currency in order to exchange it for items/bundles, hiding the real cost to the player.\n2. They create a fake urgency on buying the items putting them in a timed schedule and keep rotating the items from time to time.\n\nThe illegal part:\n1. It is illegal to always display a product in a discounted price. This means that true price is the \"discounted\" price not the listed price, the illegal part here is creating fake discounts.\n\nA suggestion to fix all the scammy and illegal thing in the store:\n\n1. Build a real store with all the items/bundles available to buy at any time.\n2. Ditch the fiat currency, and use the real money to buy items directly. If you claim that Steam takes a fee for processing the transaction and is less money for the dev, remember this Steam is already processing the transactions for the fiat currency.\n3. By implementing point one, and implementing a rotational discount tru the items in store, they are no longer breaking the law.\n4. For those that are going to claim that you can earn the fiat currency in the battle pass that is pure BS, you don't earn it you have a chance to get it if you complete enuf challenges. And for that ther is also a simple solution. By implementing points 1, you can also buy the battle pass directly with real money, and insted of getting the fiat currency, simply change it for discounts in the store.\n\nAnd with this, i think it is fair and more transparent way to monetize and a game you already pay FULL PRICE for it.\n\nAnd addressing one last thing, yes all the items until now are all cosmetics +/-, the building packs add more building blocks to the game, and when you are working with other people in a build, is very annoying, cumbersom and francly disapointing, wen some one add something to the build that you dont have access to and may never have access to because ther is no simple way for you to buy it also.

I've started to play the game when it was still in [b]early access[/b], seen it's developments throughout the years. With the most recent massive update [b]Isle of Siptah[/b], our clan returned to the game with full force, we enjoyed it very much and hoping that all the bad things that are possible in this game wouldn't follow us there. How wrong were we, after a week server started crashing, and global chat went wild about cheaters, and cheaters we found indeed, they were meshing and using speedhack (while going in to the meshes and destroying the cheaters is simple enough, countering the third-party hacking software is on it's own league.)\n\nThe game is beautiful and well crafted, but some of the things that have been broken over the years are hatches and elevators, various weapons, and now the whole cooking system. \n\nMy clan and I enjoy this game immensely most of has have + 2000 hrs, but there are things that have been going on for years,\n\n[b]Cheating...[/b]\n\nCheating in Conan exiles is as commonplace as regular players, there is no server or a period of time when I have not encountered cheaters in this game or any of the servers I'v played on. Now I know, that Funcom is trying to fix these issues by implementing new measures, but all in all I think that is wrong, the answer is more severe punishment, [b]permanent bans[/b]. \n\nWith the Isle of Siptah update, came the cheaters, the official PVP server (#6002) was full almost daily before the first clan that left due to cheaters, and after our encounter with them, our interests waned as well.\n\nI'v bought every possible dlc for conan exiles, spend countless hours on it, and my money. It irritates me that I cannot enjoy my money and time invested the way the developers intended because of cheater, and it irritates me that they don't permanently ban these people, they should. \n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone, not with all the cheating going on on the servers.\n\nI love the game but the developers are not taking good care of it, and not taking good care of us, their customers and source of income.", "timestamp_created": 1601444572, "timestamp_updated": 1634553164, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 182, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86648404598236084", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117006393": {"recommendationid": "117006393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053108567", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 81389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 81389, "last_played": 1652409701}, "language": "english", "review": "Pull up a chair and listen to my tale of sadness and woe.\n\nMy group of distributed internet friends (all four of us WoW refugees) started Conan Exiles during the Halloween event of 2018.

I Really really would like to recommend the game but until the publisher acts in a responsible manner I will maintain folks are better off not starting to play it, unless the got it for free or nearly so.Honestly it can be a lotta fun and the graphics are good and the mechanics are fair as well but I do not recommend this due to the massive incompetence of the developer. I can only see it sliding into oblivion and would save some poor soul from spending their cash on something in a tailspin.Its too late for me but save yourselves! \n\nIf you picked this up say six months or more ago you prolly had the best its gotta offer. Your only hope now is playing on a serer so heavily Modded its barely recognisable.Right now awaiting a 2 GIG PATCH to load after the \"Update\" they tested for a month or more that has wrecked pretty much everything. Players have lost 100's or 1000's of hours of development here, Official game servers are down and crashing... And they TESTED this for upwards of a Month and didn't spot ANY of these totally game breaking issues?\n\nTo quote Churchill\" They are not fit to manage a whelk stall\"\n\nEdit: Now its Sept 16th. Game has been screwed up for heaven knows how many players as they released another of their fabled \"updates\"All the good stuff is screwed. IE the player mods which are the ONLY reason anyone should consider this game. The baseline content is *\"$@!!! (So close to swearing on Steam here I am so disappointed and mad all at once! But I'd rather reinforce my warning than get banned for blowing up!)I watched the video of their tame White knights gushing over there \"new content\" (also known as ARK and came out some years ago I believe we are now having this rehashed - I mean ADDED to CE. \n\nIf you LIKE PvP then might be worth a look . If you are not interested in PvP then its 60 Gigs of pointlessness that will break the decent and actually INTERESTING Mods real programmers have laboured to add to the game.Yes you heard me 60 Gigs of Early Access \"Patch\" what even IS that?!\n\nA sensible company would have released the engine update let the community adjust to it THEN released the optional paid for new content.But sensible and Funcom just does not exist.I stand by my review DO NOT absolutely DO NOT buy this Game.

If you are thinking of getting the game I HIGHLY reccommend reading the game breaking glitches section first. Let's start with the questionable mechanics bit:\n\nQUESTIONABLE MECHANICS: This section describes DECAY TIMERS, THRALLS, RAIDING, and EXPERIENCE/PROGRESSION\n\n1.) There is a decay timer that will delete your buildings after a certain amount of time not using them. You need to stand next to a building for at least 10 mintues for the decay timer to go up a whole lousy hour. What if you want to take a break? Want a vacation? Well I hope you have enough time on the decay timer so the shit you spend several hours making and crafting don't just up and delete themselves so that the laggy servers don't lag more. Only way to circumvent this is to be on a private server with reliable and fair admins that are likely to keep the server running for a while (Maybe I'm just unlucky with private servers and admins being dicks?). \n\n2.) The THRALL TRAINING SYSTEM is cool and interesting, but the AI is so shit that it doesn't matter. Your horde of legendary thralls you spent days or weeks training sometimes don't even react to enemies, or will just try to fight them with their fists despite having weapons. I've had an elephant run into a small army of about 40 of my thralls, with only 4-6 of them reacting to the elephant's pressence. Players can easily systematically slaughter any number of thralls with just iron tools at their disposal. \n\n3.) RAIDING is extremely easy, whereas defending is near impossible without glitches. Stacking grease orbs and then throwing a single fire orb on top of the stacked grease orbs will cause the fire to do enough damage to break through any structure. If I spend 30 hours making the steel needed for tier 3 building materials for a fort with my buddies. Some random low level shouldn't be able to farm for 10 hours and break through that entire fort taking all of it's possessions. They put in windows for when people can raid you, but honestly I don't intend to be online for 6 hours every day just to watch my base. \n\n4.) PROGRESSION is very slow. You can hit level 50 in 3 days if you play 12 hours a day and know exactly what you are doing, but these types of games have a lot of content and stuff to learn to be able to do that. You spend a bunch of time hitting max level (which is level 60) so that you can use the cool end game perks just to find out there are game breaking glitches that are being abused by 10 people on the server you play on. If you hop servers, then you have to spend all that time grinding back up again. If you play on a private server, then you are at the mercy of the admins to be just and fair to you and others. I've seen people I thought were totally reasonable as admins spawn undead dragons on people's bases for shits and giggles. Slow progression doesn't matter much to me, but it's a bit much\n\nIMBALANCED GAMEPLAY: \n\n1.) SET is the most powerful avatar capable of oneshotting Tier 3 foundations. Every other avatar can not do that.\n\n2.) The spear is capable of stunlocking opponents at a further range than any other weapon. This wouldn't be a problem if a full combo from a full strength build didn't kill anyone who isn't specced entirely into vitality. \n\n3.) Tier one siege equipment like the grease orb and fire orb combo is too strong. My tier 3 foundations shouldn't be destroyed by the comparatively small amount of resources it takes to make the grease and fire orbs. \n\n4.) Tier three siege equipment is too cheap. I can build a trebuchet to knock down anyone's base while they are offline at level 25. Level 60 and have a massive base on a plateau? Well unless you have a god bubble (something else that takes too long to make) you're fucked. \n\n5.) The PURGE mechanic sends a large group of AI controlled mobs at your base after you build up to a certain point. This is fine, except some of the mobs that can be sent at you are boss mobs with enough HP that you will break your iron weapons 10 times on them before you see their HP go down to half. They are unkillable, and ridiculously overpowered. If they get to your base, the whole thing will be wiped without extensive preparations. This doesn't always happen, as sometimes the purge is weak as shit, but it's lame.\n\nGAME BREAKING GLITCHES: Server lag, stat glitches, duplication glitches, and more.\n\n1.) Official servers are garbage when they approach max capacity. Server states I should have a ping of 40 when I join the server, I get online and will have very small ping with few players online. When Raid time comes around (the set window the game allows for players on the official PVP server to raid each other) everyone logs on and the server FPS drops to 10. Ping spikes up and PVP becomes unplayable, NPCS get extremely glitchy and will stand instantly after being knocked down.\n\n****EDIT**** I've been told that 2.) and 3.) in this section have been fixed. \n\n2.) There is a glitch that allows players to have 999 skill points. It's ridiculously unfair to fight people who abuse this without also abusing it yourself. You can only max one stat, with that glitch they can be 50/60 points into every stat where you can only get 60/60 in one. \n\n3.) THE WORST GLITCH OF ALL. There is a nasty duplication glitch that allows you to duplicate items in your inventory. It's terrible and game breaking. Get one dragonpowder, then duplicate duplicate duplicate until you have 4,000 of them and nobody wants to play anymore. \n\nOVERALL: Fun game, great building, decent rewarding combat, ruined by imbalanced gameplay and horrible bugs.  CURRENT STATE: 6/10\n\n***EDIT***\nThis review is from the standpoint of someone who wanted the PVP experience and was sorely disapointed. Some people have mentioned that I failed to talk about the game from the PVE side of things: It's worse. Land claim griefing, which is placing objects near someone's base so that the other person can't build on the claimed land, is a big unfixable problem. Dragging mobs to houses to destroy them instead etc... \n\nThe big point of playing on public servers is that the game should be fair and balanced, but it's not. exploits, glitches, griefing, and other forms of play not intended by the developers destroy my ability to enjoy this game. You can be banned on a whim by private server admins, or your favorite private server will get wiped, reset, or shutdown. Admins would get rid of cheaters and griefers, but are unreliable and very case specific. Answer should be to go to the public servers, but that comes with a whole new bucket of bullshit.\n\nToo many problems for YOU to fix to enjoy the game. You can try to work around all the problems I've mentioned (and maybe you don't even care about some of them), but then you will just walk away with a bunch of mediocre compromises.", "timestamp_created": 1528905896, "timestamp_updated": 1530425968, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 523, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.859180986881256104", "comment_count": 36, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54844362": {"recommendationid": "54844362", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985734114", "num_games_owned": 506, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 191032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5909, "playtime_at_review": 10622, "last_played": 1713758951}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT 9/13/2022: The recent Age of Sorcery update brings a new magic system, along with a total overhaul of advancement, construction, followers, and much more. Having tested it out for a few days, I consider it a massive improvement overall. Many glitches have been fixed, and the whole experience feels better than ever. It also brings a new monetization system, similar to what Dead by Daylight and other online games have been using for years -- battle pass, cosmetic shop, etc. -- and I consider that reasonable in the context of keeping a game like this up and running as a live service. The base game and expansions have ample content, and I still enjoy them today. While I mostly play solo, I've experimented with online co-op with a friend, learned to set up a dedicated server, and had a lovely time. It's my favorite open world game, and I look forward to many more adventures.\n\n...\n\nI never got the whole \"survival game\" craze. I find their design fascinating from a technical point of view, and I've enjoyed watching others stream them, but to me most look like slightly more edgy versions of Minecraft. Aside from this being a \"controversial\" game in a setting I already like, I might not have picked it up. So far, I'm glad I did.\n\nThis is an open world survival game in the Conan setting by Robert E. Howard. He was a friend and correspondent of H.P. Lovecraft, and they both drew inspiration from each other's work over the years. Lovecraft wrote about the \"cosmic horror\" of humanity's place in an uncaring universe haunted by forgotten abominations; Howard wrote of forgotten civilizations where the humans are the real monsters. Having found yourself on the wrong end of \"civilized\" justice is where your story begins.\n\nCharacter creation starts with your new Exile crucified in the desert. You have the usual sliders to adjust facial features and so on, and more to adjust your height, muscle tone, and *ahem* endowment. Yes, there are boob and dong sliders. Yes, if you enable full nudity on your server, you can see it all in full detail, at least on characters without clothing equipped. Yes, of course people lost their minds over this. If you don't enjoy that sort of thing, it's easy enough to change and it's off by default. I made my Exile as big, buff, and buxom as her sliders would allow.\n\nOnce you're done with character creation, the opening scene shows Conan himself finding your doomed Exile. Crucifixion is barbaric even by his standards, so he cuts you down from the cross and gives you a second chance at the struggle for life, or at least a glorious death in battle. You'll be experiencing a lot of both.\n\nYou start naked in the desert on the edge of the Exiled Lands. Your worst enemies in the beginning are thirst, starvation, and the sun. And sandstorms, which will kill you faster than you can ask \"what song is this?\" if you don't find shelter in time. Fortunately, dying just sends you back to your spawn point with half your Health, and your inventory will still be on your body if you can find it before it eventually disappears. You can recover your stuff as many times as you're willing to retrace your steps to loot your own corpse, but sometimes you can't due to dying in a dangerous or inaccessible area. You can respawn at your bed or bedroll once you have them, and keeping spare gear stashed in your base is a good precaution.\n\nBase building is pretty user-friendly. Once you've crafted an axe and/or pick from loose branches and rocks, you can cut wood and stone to assemble foundation blocks, walls, and ceilings. The trees grow back soon enough, and so do the rocks, as long as you haven't built anything over them. The things you can make are controlled by your Feats, and other structures like stairs are relatively cheap to unlock. Once you've placed your first part, new parts snap to each other in a grid pattern. You can't build too far out without support from a foundation block or the terrain. For example, unsupported staircases can only be three tiles high, so no stairway to heaven. (Denied!) Beyond that, the construction rules are pretty forgiving. You can build all the sandstone skyscrapers you want, and cover the Exiled Lands in affordable housing to your heart's content.\n\nSome items you can craft by hand, others you need to craft equipment for, like a furnace to smelt Ironstone into Iron Bars. Most things like furnaces and campfires work like appliances: Put your ingredients in their inventory, click the Play button, and walk away to do other stuff. They stop automatically when they run out of materials or fuel. They have visual cues to tell you when they're working, like smoke rising from a campfire, and you can see their inventory at a passing glance without opening it. Their descriptions only hint at their most common use, so you should experiment to avoid missing out on useful combos. You could say I was searching for the Riddle of Steel, because it took me a week to figure out how to make any, despite having everything I needed. (I had overlooked some item descriptions which spelled it out.) Weapons, armor, and tools degrade with use, and you can only repair what you know how to make. A lot of supplies (like human flesh and other food) are perishable, but you can slow their decay by storing them in special containers. Structures decay over time, but the timer for this is lenient enough (at least in my normal difficulty solo game) that it rarely matters.\n\nYou can eventually build the Wheel of Pain, a place where you break captured Exiles and turn them into Thralls. Knocking out a non-player Exile with special weapons lets you bind them and drag them to the Wheel, and feed them as they work until they're ready to serve you. Assigning an artisan Thrall to some equipment makes crafting faster, and they might know recipes you don't. Fighting Thralls defend your base from wandering monsters and other Exiles, but you must feed them; a Thrall Pot can hold and preserve food for them. You can also adopt animals, like the baby turtles wandering the beach, and feed them until they grow into fearsome pets.\n\nCrafting and harvesting slowly fill a Purge meter, which eventually results in waves of attackers invading your base. EDIT 11/22/2023: This mechanic has been completely reworked in the recent Age of War updates, and now requires deliberate action (hoarding special treasures in a vault) to trigger, making it fully optional.\n\nCombat and exploration are both pretty smooth. You can climb almost anywhere, but some dungeons are no-climbing zones to keep you from bypassing puzzles. How far you can climb before losing your grip is controlled by your Stamina, as are jumping and sprinting, and (in combat) your attacks and dodge-rolling. When low, it refills in seconds if you walk, jog, or stand still. If you let it run out completely, it will take longer to refill, and you can't do anything that needs Stamina until it's full, which is bad news if it happens during a chase or fight. The only way to heal most of the time is to slowly regenerate Health by eating food, which stops if you get hit. No pausing time to chug instant healing potions or eat all the cheese, so you really need to avoid getting hurt, and it will take a while to nurse yourself back to full health after almost dying.\n\nThe open world is beautiful and full of interesting little secrets, and you may see ghosts from time to time, or touch strange monoliths that speak to you in your mind. Climb around the most treacherous terrain long enough, and you might find a treasure chest or a journal on a ledge halfway up a cliff.\n\nTime flies when you're building sandcastles. I started with one tiny shack under Shattered Bridge to have somewhere to put my bedroll. The sign outside now reads \"One Sandstone Plaza\" to distinguish it from the rest of the complex, which dozens of thralls and pets call home.\n\nTL;DR: Naked cannibal woman gentrifies Exiled Lands, rocks and trees hardest hit, would get crucified again.", "timestamp_created": 1566937357, "timestamp_updated": 1700630629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 180, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858956694602966309", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29698489": {"recommendationid": "29698489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122818835", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 406, "last_played": 1527383172}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the challenge of this game.

They have the traditional PvP and PvE servers, but the real sweet spot is PvE-Conflict.  It keeps your base/pets/followers safe from other players, but for five prime time hours a day,  PvP turns on (full loot, pets and followers can be attacked if defending you).  I've played several PvE-C servers over the years, and why most people are actually very chill... there is enough general bloodthirst and opportunism to keep things tense (and interesting).  Even though it can be inconvenient to be a victim, it's fairly easy to replace whatever you've lost creating an \"i don't want to die, but I'm not afraid to die\" dynamic.\n\n[b]There are two maps[/b]\nThe original - \"Exiled Lands\".  The Exiled lands is huge, and you can easily spend weeks (or more) at endgame just exploring all of the biomes, dungeons, and interesting detail in this lovingly hand crafted world.  This map has gone through several major expansions over the years and has really become quite a behemoth of area and content.  If you just want to build, explore, and get the Conan experience than this is a fully developed map that can keep you busy for ages.  One drawback is that sometimes the world feels so big you rarely physically run into other players.\n\nThe new addition - \"Isle of Siptah\".  This is where most of the game population is at the time of writing this.  Much like at the birth of the Exiled Lands map, the world is a good size, but not huge.  The devs plan to expand the world, but there is.. again at the time of this writing.. no concrete timeline.  I'm personally OK with this.  Part of what makes Siptah so engaging is that it's been designed in such a way that both the map and content actively bring players together.  Unless you go hide under a rock you definitely WILL run into other players on a consistent basis.  The map itself is not just \"another map\" with a new biome or two.  The fundamental mechanics of the world and end game are different.  I wont go into that here, just know for players who've spent a substantial amount of on Exiled Lands.. Isle of Siptah feels new and fresh and very different.\n\n[b]What makes this game better than other survival games[/b]\nCombat.  It's a whole lot better than any other survival game I've played (Ark, Atlas, Last Oasis, Rust, many others)... I do enjoy it, buuuut it's still not nearly as good as a quality MMORPG (is it even fair to compare this with GW2/WoW/BDO/Archeage/etc though? probably not).   Also, the variety of different weapons, armors, character builds, buffs, combat pets, etc etc is more in line with an MMORPG than a typical survival game.  Sure, there is a meta just like any game, but the meta guarantees nothing and there are countless different ways to build/outfit your character and be successful.\n\nThe devs... yes they actually do give a damn.  It's years later and they just keep adding more and more major game content and quality of life improvements.  I'm talking about the kind of stuff that modders add in other games, the devs at funcom add themselves here.  Every time I feel burnt out and go away, I get drawn back 6-12 months later by major (sometimes multiple) content updates/whole system reworks and then I run into countless new QoL updates that were also added in the interim.\n\nPower balance.  It's not simply a matter of he/she/they who has the higher level and more gear wins the day.  Level 60 is max, but once you get there and make some decent weapons, armor, tools you are at ~90% power of any other player.  With a bit of tactical thinking, that is more than enough to out play opponents if push comes to shove..  There are however a plethora of slightly better armors, weapons, and combat pets/followers to raise your power level that final 10%.\n\n\"Taming\".. remembering the days of taming in Ark makes me cringe.  In Conan, the system for capturing and raising pets and mounts is SO much simpler. It still takes a while, but for the player you just pick up the baby animal, and take them to a secure taming pen at your base.  Gone are the days of sitting by an unconscious animal feeding it berries and protecting it from threats.  Animals are separated into two groups:  mounts and combat pets.  You can have one of each following you at any given time.  In addition to mounts and pets you can capture the natives (aka followers aka thralls).  There are two types.. combat and crafting.  The system for capturing these is a bit different than pets and mounts (you have to knock them out and drag them to your base to a \"wheel of pain\" to \"break\" them), but the amount of effort past that point is still minimal.  Combat thralls work just like combat pets (but with gear), and crafting ones are placed into your crafting stations to provide you with all sorts of crafting bonuses.  Thralls come at different tiers, with the higher more rare tiers being better fighters and offering stronger crafting bonuses, whilst baby pets have an RNG chance to tame into a specific adult version (one of which is always the \"greater\" aka strongest version).  There is also an RNG component to leveling combat pets/thralls, meaning that the same pets/thralls at max level will have different perks and strengths. There is more to it, and a large part of the endgame is collecting high quality crafters, and seriously strong combat pets/followers.\n\nBuilding is another large part of the end game.  I'm a huge fan of the building system (easy to get started, but takes many hours to master) and I own all of the different aesthetic DLCs to mix and match building pieces and decorations in my builds.  I'll go so far as to say that vanilla + DLC building on Conan is comparable if not better than any other survival game I've seen even on a private server using dozens of mods (and yes Conan has it's own large mod community that takes it even further for you private server fans).  One big gripe here is that there is no boat/raft building system in Conan.. something I love in other games that offer it.  Exiled Lands however never had enough water for that to make sense.. but Isle of Siptah does, so who knows what the devs have up their sleeves next.\n\nSolo Play.. is a yes.  I know sometimes solo play just isn't easily doable or at the very least not as much fun.  That is not a problem in Conan.  Play how you want... with your friends or team up with other chill players from your server to do harder content.. or not.  You will still be successful.  If you like/love/would marry PvP, but find PvP servers a bit too chaotic to be on solo or with a one or two friends then PvE-C has you covered.\n\nTrading. I know that a lot of survival games try to make trading a focus, but then it turns out that most of the time it makes more sense for you to do it all yourself. It's quite the opposite for Conan's Isle of Siptah map.  The devs never made trading a focus, but thanks to the demand of certain rare resources and the RNG elements of endgame pets/thralls/weapons/armors there are trades and crafting requests happening all the time every day.   It's not odd to see a valuable thrall being auctioned off during prime time followed by a secret meet up.. at you know.. that place we met that one time.. *wink*.  This is one area where Isle of Siptah differentiates pretty heavily from Exiled Lands map.  On Exiled lands, like most survival games, it usually makes more sense to just get it yourself.\n\nI'll round this out by saying.. for a survival game, Conan truly makes up for any shortcomings by having dedicated developers and a great community (I'm part of several server specific discords that have turned into long term social channels/gaming channels).\n\nOn a scale of Buy It Now / Wait for a Sale / Skip..

Unfortunately I have to say far too many of these changes and non changes are for the worse, both ways. The shortest possible explanation I can give is regardless of how fun the game CAN be, there are an ever rising number of extremely intrusive problems that have been and are still mounting over these years, and only a very small handful of them have been fixed. This game is an amazonian rainforest of bugs, and not cute Bethesda bugs but serious problems which will strongly affect or even ruin your experience with the game. \n\nTruthfully im torn on how to continue this review. Unlike my usual reviews, I think its more important to focus on the problems with both the game and the developer as they are far more impactful than any individual game detail. Funcom is a company that initially appears to be very receptive and appreciative of feedback but the more I experience and read interactions with them on steam and their own forums, the more I feel this is actually the opposite and this outwardly social and community focused appearance is just a front. \n\nEspecially in recent posts, any criticism (and after the handful of extremely controversial updates in late 2020 and early 21, there is a lot) most comments are met with a copy pasted \"this message has been forwarded to the dev team.\" Any handwritten comments are typically related to \"don't attack the developers\" or \"we will not be changing this.\" Again, they DO respond most of the time, and its just my opinion, or maybe suspicion that many of these comments are a facade, but ill talk more about that later.\n\nIn my time playing Conan, every time I encountered a bug (which is usually at least one major/game breaking instance a session) and google it, it has already been reported as soon as the content was introduced to the game, typically in 2018 with that same \"forwarded to the dev team response.\" The problem is, at least 90% of these bugs haven't been fixed. Instead the devs have been hard at work creating 117$ worth of DLC, the biggest of which, the Isle of Siptah was also met with largely negative feedback on release. But don't worry, all the bugs in the normal game are also present on this new separate map, because they are all core problems left unaddressed for years.\n\nTo name just a few, thralls still fall through the map constantly, die randomly, get stuck on everything and have no recourse in these cases. Meteors are still occasionally unopenable, AI sometimes dreams of a world of peace and becomes unable to attack. Servers are unstable and poorly optimized, filled with hackers and bug abuse such as clipping under the map to grief, blocking spawns, and killing thralls during PVP disabled hours. Performance is absolutely abysmal, some of the worst of any game I've ever played in both FPS and netcoding with extreme rubberbanding that can often outright kill you. I want to stress just how bad performance is because its talked about so little. But don't worry, just a few days ago a launcher was added that completely breaks mods and makes some people unable to open the game entirely. \n\nA specific and recent example of the developers ignoring (and usually doing the exact opposite of) feedback was a proposed solution to the thrall related bugs aforementioned was to expand the existing \"rescue\" option currently in the game, which has an hour long cooldown for your ENTIRE CLAN and deletes any gear or items they're carrying was to add options to remove these restrictions or allow admins to bypass them. The response to this was to continue to ignore the bugs causing them (as they are still not fixed) and to state that these changed will never be implemented for \"clan balance and to prevent abuse,\" completely bypassing the initial problem and specific request for admin and server owner control. This is the typical marrying of bug, game design issues, and developer dismissiveness and neglect that drag Conan down so much.\n\nWhat pushed me over the edge was the recent update which supposedly adds offline singleplayer. This however is a blatant lie as mentioned in one of the top negative reviews here on steam. Right in line with my previous discussion, there is a dev response brushing off this comment as some form of user error. In this case, they inform him that he should connect to the internet at least once after the update for it to work. This is of course ignoring his testing and SEVERAL updates to the review for each of the subsequent hotfixes for this patch wherein he retested every time with the same result, and the fact he had to have an internet connection to post the review in the first place, post patch.\n\nI can't see this as anything other than flagrant, blatant damage control and a lie just like their patch notes, in the hopes that anyone seeing this review might think it is disingenuous. After all, why would a dev completely owned by Tencent and already under suspicion of collecting data in the past want their game to be always online? \n\nThere is plenty more to say about smaller details in the game, but the short version is I don't think the devs actually play it, and they don't care to fix any bugs. Between numerous gameplay changes that are rushed through their PTR in a week despite being outwardly hated, nerfs to stats that are already terrible, perks that are completely useless, and the legion of bugs I run into something that makes me remember these issues every single time I play Conan. I hope perhaps Funcom will one day become the thoughtful and receptive developer their outward appearance belies, but until then these issues stand and my bottom line is negative.", "timestamp_created": 1617183074, "timestamp_updated": 1617195398, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 210, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851073145866394043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1617831253, "developer_response": "Hey there,\n\nThanks for playing and for taking the time to leave such a detailed review!

You've found a clan. Together you've built the best and most defensible bases in the game. You're max level, you can put up a strong fight, especially with the support of your clan, and no one messes with you guys without seriously considering the consequences.\n\nSuddenly, some new players join your server. They seldom speak in chat, they begin killing your slaves and pets while you're offline. Then they begin raiding your smaller bases while you're offline. It becomes apparent that they are using exploits. Everything you knew about this game seems to be unraveling with each raid that they perform. You report their behavior and exploits to Funcom, who openly states that they won't look into any claims unless you post a picture of their base, even though the nature of one of your claims is that they are using an exploit which makes their base impossible to find. After a week of trying to get Funcom to look into these suspect players, you're still not gaining any traction, and the cheaters have now raided all of your bases. Even your bases which were built to be the most defensible, which limit the raiders options to even begin to approach the raid are decimated in minutes; a timeframe which is not known to be possible for raiding such bases, even without the raid-block building techniques which you spent your time to implement. You, your clan, and all of the other big clans on the server are reduced to nothing by 1-3 players who were new to the server just 1 week ago, and have made it blatantly obvious that they are using exploits and cheats. All of your hard work, potentially months worth of grinding on the same server, now has nothing to show for other than your character level. The idea of starting over at this point is unmotivating, especially while these exploiting players are at large, ready to keep you from making progress. This process took a whole week, while the game developer who manages the official servers refused to even look into your claims against these exploiters. You, your clan members, and your allied clans all asked for help from an admin, but none came.\n\nThis is what you can expect from Conan Exiles. It has the potential to be a great game, but the mismanagement of anti-cheat efforts, and the tenacious cheaters that thrive on whatever satisfaction they get from removing all life from any server they join will absolutely ruin this game for you and rob you of your interest in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1626325009, "timestamp_updated": 1626325009, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 246, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.847231626510620117", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118823406": {"recommendationid": "118823406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021998137", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 13713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13713, "last_played": 1657835171}, "language": "english", "review": "Three problems:\n\nThe company behind it is owned by Tencent.\nThey're adding a battlepass\nIt's already a full priced game with over $120 of DLC attached to it in the store.\n\nThat's three strikes.

I\u2019ve always kept my eye out on the genre and sank probably much too many hours in each one. I\u2019ve played games such as 7 Days to Die, Don\u2019t Starve Together, The Forest, Sunless Sea, and Raft to name a few. I even boarded the hype train to Valheim but even in the viking-inspired land, something was missing. Through the years, I\u2019ve searched for a survival game that would blow me away. And then I realized that I always found myself comparing every game to one I already played: Conan Exiles.\n\nI started Conan 4 years ago, back in 2017. Humble Bundle monthly, and it ticked the checkbox of survival so I decided to give it a go. I was amazed but more importantly, I felt lost as one should be when entering a vast world full of danger and awe. All that was left to me was a water flask and a note over a slab of rock. Thrust into the vast desert, blinded by the sun and whipped by a sandstorm, it was an unforgettable warm welcome.\n\nBut for those who appreciate direction\u2019s course, there is a Journey to help you through, a checklist on what you could do to earn experience. What I like about this feature is that it doesn\u2019t hold your hand and make you go through tedious tutorials which are abundant these days. No, this game does not dote but for good reason. The Exiled Lands is supposed to be harsh for a newborn exile and, whether thematically or ingenious laziness, the game wishes you to learn on your own, be it through mistakes and even death. \n\nBarely clothed (or fully naked if the constant sight of elephant trunks and milk mountains pleases you), you are immediately exposed to the dangers of the land. In time and through lessons learned in said mistakes, you will get stronger and when you finally build a suitable base, more secure too. More confident in your ability to survive. As you gather your courage, newly forged weapons and armors included, the more you move further inland, the difficulty of the dangers increase as well. But there is no reward without risk, and there are many. World bosses, dungeons, and quests are all there for you to conquer whether for a powerful sword, a recipe, or just for the glory of it all.\n\nWhile this experience can be fully enjoyed in single player, it\u2019s multiplayer that separates this game from other titles of the genre. To sum it up in one word, tension. \n\nEverything in this game makes a sound. Say you\u2019re travelling through the jungle at night. There\u2019s a hard downpour. You take out your torch because you decide you can\u2019t rely on the lightning flash\u2019s inconsistency and the darkness could lead you to a cliff. But was it worth the risk becoming an amber beacon for those lying in wait? You hear no footsteps, no grass rustled. All\u2019s clear. Is it though? Were the sounds simply masked by the rain crashing down? Revealed by your torch and pressed by paranoia, you decide to make a run for it to your home. But then you hear the unmistakable sound of a weapon unsheathing and you realize you aren\u2019t running alone in the dark anymore. Thing is, you never were alone.\n\nCombat. It\u2019s another point that I enjoy in this game. You\u2019ll quickly realize there\u2019s more to it than the beasts you\u2019ve been killing. Clashing against another player is a whole different dance than what new players would be used to. Learning each weapon\u2019s advantages and disadvantages will help you understand what your opponent is capable of. The stakes are much higher too. Death would drop all your hard fought and farmed loot, if that\u2019s the server setting. Each attack, block, dodge consumes stamina and managing that while landing your strikes is the difference between the emptiness of losing your gear and the triumphant trek back home.\n\nWhile I could go on about different aspects of the game such as thralls and raids, I\u2019d like to point out that it\u2019s crucial to find the best server for you. You can find one suited just for PVE or PVP and there\u2019s a middle ground called PVE-Conflict. Personally, I\u2019d stick with a server with PVP but with enforced rules or, even better, RP or roleplaying. I have found most of my enjoyment in those servers since the admins expand the world\u2019s lore or with their own.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a survival game, as I was so desperately 4 years ago, you might find what you\u2019re looking for in Conan Exiles. Just like the game\u2019s feature aptly named, it is a journey and I found myself coming back to it like a return home. I\u2019ve met so many people in this game, some hospitable and some not so much. I\u2019ve fought my share of fights and wars, both my own and through the duty of an alliance. Personally, I don\u2019t know if my journey has ever ended. I think that being immersed, living out a fantasy life how you want to, is a testament to what a survival game should be. It might be different for you but should you try this game out, how your journey starts and how it ends is up to you, exile.", "timestamp_created": 1622848201, "timestamp_updated": 1622848201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.845555901527404785", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122096289": {"recommendationid": "122096289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010641248", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 105, "playtime_at_review": 7156, "last_played": 1712960510}, "language": "english", "review": "Original Old DLC\n73 items - Riders of Hyboria for $9.99\n76 items \u2013 Seekers of the Dawn $9.99\n73 items \u2013 Savage Frontier $9.99\n93 items \u2013 Jewel of the west $9.99\n95 items \u2013 Architects of Argos $9.99\n87 items \u2013 Debaucheries of Derketo $9.99\n78 items \u2013 Blood and Sand $9.99\n37 items \u2013 Riddle of Steel $9.99\n83 items \u2013 Treasure of Turan $9.99\n93 items \u2013 Imperial East $9.99\n\nNew Micro transaction Store\n3 weapons for $5.50\n3 emotes for $4.38\n1 large Brazier for $6.33\n1 Banner for $6.33\nChimneys and rough timber frames for $8.33\n6 items Black magic starter set for $11.37\n2 items Echoes of Acheron for $5.58", "timestamp_created": 1662910833, "timestamp_updated": 1663201221, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 224, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843964517116546631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63749874": {"recommendationid": "63749874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198825532444", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 453779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359914, "last_played": 1662220494}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh god what have i done with my life.", "timestamp_created": 1582075799, "timestamp_updated": 1582075799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 151, "votes_funny": 395, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843105792999267578", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67316565": {"recommendationid": "67316565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068184522", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 22930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2772, "last_played": 1673198298}, "language": "english", "review": "My husband and I got this to celebrate our anniversary since we can't actually go anywhere with the coronavirus lockdowns. \n\nCan confirm that those who slave together stay together. 10/10 would recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1586892086, "timestamp_updated": 1586892086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 142, "votes_funny": 151, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842087328433990479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44478023": {"recommendationid": "44478023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035180936", "num_games_owned": 1620, "num_reviews": 166, "playtime_forever": 4850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2516, "last_played": 1696391001}, "language": "english", "review": "I play solo and despite some shortcomings I am having a blast with this game.

There are a lot of bugs, especially in single player, and several areas of the game are very rough, it's also missing a fair amount of content.\n\nA basic rundown of the gameplay, it's honestly ARK, without tech, and instead of taming dinos you tame people (thralls). The game is much more focused on the player rather than the tames, this is in part to the thrall system being woefully unfinished, but you do all the combat yourself. You can have a singule thrall follow you, but they are slow and derpy and it's a waste of time. What you do with thralls, some you station around your base as like a turret and they protect your base from enemies (they can move to attack but will return to their post after combat), most of the thralls though slot into production tables where they have some bonus effect to crafting. That's pretty much it. The store page here and the opening cinematic make references to building cities/kingdoms.... you can't do that. The \"settlement\" system was cut in order to push the game out by a deadline, and it may or may not be added later. You can build a bunch of structures in the shape of a city (after a ridiculous amount of grinding), and position static thralls around like decorations, but it's not the system the game was supposed to have.\n\nThe map is rather large, I spent probably most of my 23 hours I've played up to this point running around and exploring, and I've only seen a small fraction of the map. The resources and thralls you need to progress are spread out all over so accomplishing anything in the game generally requires a great deal of running around. The game was clearly designed around mounts, which were a thing that was coming right up until the end of EA when they were cut because consoles apparently can't handle the increased movement speed. A crude fast travel system was added right before release but it's wonky, difficult to obtain, expensive to build, and requires multiples built all around the map to really function. This is what ultimately led me to stop playing for now, trying to progress in really any way meant spending hours running around the map looking for things I needed a wiki to find. Building remote secondary bases to make these journeys less of a headache is heavily penalized by a \"purge\" system which causes enemies to attack your structures after a certain amount of time spent doing things, and if you can't protect them they are destroyed (purges can be disabled though).\n\nThat's a lot of negatives, but all in all I really like the game and have high hopes for it. The graphics and armor styles are great, combat is decent, climbing is fun, and I like the thrall concept far more than I probably should. The game needs a lot of work, and normally I would give it a thumbs down for that, but I've played FunCom games for nearly 20 years now, since Anarchy Online first came out. They have a tendancy to release things in a messy state, even before that was normal, but they have also in the past shown the willingness to support their games for many years and improve on them greatly. Anarchy Online is still running, and recieved a patch within the last year or so I believe and had new content added not long before that, if Conan Exiles gets that treatment then the future of the game is pretty exciting.", "timestamp_created": 1526454836, "timestamp_updated": 1526454836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 130, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838760197162628174", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29691994": {"recommendationid": "29691994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011643462", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 27366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3612, "last_played": 1575945522}, "language": "english", "review": "1.

Technical review\nCritized main issue: Server lagging/rubberbanding!\nWhile it is true that - including for me - the game was simply unplayable in the first days of \"Early Access\" I keep being patient.\nWhy?\nFuncom did not anticipate such a strong interest in the game which overwhelmed the servers of their partner \"Pingperfect\".\nGuys, please be serious, we all know that with many new games server issues are to be expected and the devs are engaged quite closely with the community to resolve this.\nThey already took action by cutting ties with their former partner \"Pingperfect\" and are looking for a new appropriate server partner.\n\nKeep in mind that since release we have seen around every 12 hours an update and the devs are constantly working to iron out technical problems.\n\nThat is what \"Early Access\" is all about, developing a game together with the community!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Game review\n3.1 Character creation\n3.2 Game concept\n3.2.1 Combat\n3.3.1 Thrall System\n3.3.2 Religion\n4. Graphics\n5. AI\n6. Conclusion\n\n\n3.1 Character creation: \nYou choose your sex, race, religion and customize your facial and body features with the help of sliders.\nDue to the full nudity, you can enjoy resizing your characters dong to reflect what you wished for in reality or go all humble. Same counts for female breasts - Funcom tradition when thinking about Age of Conan.\nHowever if you are prude there are options to disable or partially disable nudity.\nI would never understand personally why someone might be offended from a naked human body but is totally fine with gore but ok, nevermind!\nFacial hair for males are greyed out still, something that is going to change very fast surely.\nThe racial background is purely cosmetic and a roleplay aspect while religion has a deeper sense. More about this later.\nGenerally it feels very intuitive to create your character, not to overwhelming and not too simple and thankfully you can not create weird mutant like character like in ARK. You are Human and you are going to look like one - great!\n\n3.2 Game Concept: \nLike many people already said before me, Conan Exiles does remind me the most of ARK. It uses the same engine (UE4) and the game concept is similar however in my opinion it feels like an updated version.\nThe menus are more intuitive and they also improved the building system because unlike ARK you can use the terrain, adapt the height of your foundations and build into mountainsides.\nSometimes certain parts do not want to snap in the right place but generally I prefer the Conan Exiles system over ARK, I had far less issues here.\n\nSo while generally being another survival game where you have to manage hunger, thirst, stamina, encumbrance and your health it brings new fresh elements into the genre (Soon more about it.)\nI noticed a tiny nice feature regarding encumbrance. In other survival games you can freely move until you are encumbered - same goes for Conan Exiles - however the more you carry here, the less faster your Stamina regenerates which will decrease your intervals in which you are able to run!\nAnother survival aspect is \"corruption\"\nThe more time you spend with dark beings and dark places, you gain corruption which will overlap your health bar, effectively reducing your maximum available amount of health.\nHow to remove it? For this you need dancers! Yes, some nice men and women entertaining you! Read more about it later in the thrall section!\nA neat little features!\n\n3.2.1 Combat:\nThe combat system generally reminds me mostly of TES: Skyrim. Wield the weapons you want and attack your foes etc.\nNice but honestly I wish they will introduce a more in-depth system, currently you can try to dodge enemy attacks but it doesn't work intuitively yet and the possibility to cripple certain body parts is also missing.\nYou cannot hit someones arms so he cannot wield his weapon or cripple his legs so he cannot chase you e.g.\nShooting arrows at foes also doesn't bother them. They just keep running like they are made out of steel.\nI hope they gonna change this however gore is a feature on s.o. death!\n\n3.3.1 Thralls: \nA unique aspect of Conan Exiles is the feature that allows players to capture Human NPC's in order to break their will and make them work for you!\nSome might think that it is similar to a pet system like ARK in which you tame dinosaurs but I think it is different and it also feels diferent in the game.\nThe possibility to tame and ride animals is not yet implemented in Conan Exiles but will come in the future, better reflecting the equivalency of taming dinosaurs in ARK probably.\nThe thrall system currently enables you to capture someone, bring him back to your camp and let him spin around in the hamster wheel - sorry -in the Wheel of Pain.\nIt takes quite some time but after the procedure is done you can make use of your new thrall.\nHowever, they have certain qualities.\nThere are archers, fighters, blacksmiths, chefs, dancers and probably more.\nThere are NPC's with certain abilities out there which you have to find in order to fill in your desired role.\nTo remove corruption you will need dancers e.g.\n\n3.2.2 Religion: \nA new and fresh aspect to the genre!\nYou choose the deity of your desire during character creation (currently there are four but they plan on bringing in more) and then you are able to build the first tier level of your deity's altar/shrine/etc.\nKeep in mind that every deity is unique regarding items you can get but the mechanics are the same, you have to gain their favor!\nThere are two higher tiers of altars available (three in total, counting the starting one) with more unique religious items which you can unlock once you've reached higher levels!\nWhen you gained the highest amount of favor, your deity will reward you be allowing you to summon his avatar which you can control then for a brief time (1 minute on default I think?) to crush everything in your path!\nI am curious to see how much further they will develop the religious aspect!\n\n4. Graphics:\nI tried all the different graphics options, all the way from \"low\" to \"ultra\" and I can tell you that this game looks gorgeous, the graphics are very well done and manage to transfer an atmospheric feeling. Those sandstorms are gorgeous!\nSomething I could not test for myself yet required a low end laptop. In the graphics settings is a checkbox wich adapts the graphics specifically for low end laptops, enabling people with less sophisticated hardware to play the game.\nThe greatest atmospheric \"turnoff\" currently is the missing AI intelligence as well as NPC animations.\n\n5. AI:\nThis is one of the priorities of the devs to change (Early Access) however currently, NPC's simply stand around, doing nothing and they feel rather robotic in their behavior and only get active when they spot to attack you.\n\n6. Conclusion:\nFresh, new ideas for the survival genre! My main issues about rubberbanding or lack of AI intelligence and animations is subject to change, so I recommend the game!", "timestamp_created": 1486211464, "timestamp_updated": 1486211651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 417, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837492048740386963", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29611424": {"recommendationid": "29611424", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982731169", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 10718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8390, "last_played": 1525938010}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll Get right into it.\n\n**Pros**\nVisually Beautiful\nThe game is familiar and intuitive.\nCrafting and building are easy and simple\nThe Crafting system is deep and upgrades feel meaningful.\nGathering is not an annoyance meaning you gather at a decent rate and there is plenty of nodes to gather from.\nCombat is Awesome.

They feel biased and unsure of what they were buying. Most of the issues currently come down to Perfectping servers and the battle eye issues with lag and kicking people. Those will be fixed and several things that were problematic will no longer be.

And while there are many interesting parts in the game that make it fun to play, such as capturing thralls, building cool bases, battles with enemy clans, among others, there are some drawbacks to the game as well. Defending the more primative bases of the newer players from cowardly butchers of some end game players is dounting and player population dwindles quickly because of this, among other reasons. Players who use game features to ruin play for new players and others, like building walls to block off new players from entering your server,  filling the world with empty vaults, glitching into enemy buildings or using game mechanics to look inside bases through walls are some of these. I understand the tremendous amount of work it takes to fix all of these issues is daunting and despite these issues, thus far, I've remained a player. Your always going to encounter people whos only joy is making others miserable, even if they have to break the game to do it. My hope is funcom finds a way to minimize the impact of toxic players, so that the servers will have robust populations filled with players who can enjoy the game together, the way it was intended.

The recommendation status has changed.)\n\nThis game was off to a great start but ever since they incorporated xbox (August 2017) it's been a mess.  The meaningful updates have essentially stopped and a lot of the core features that were promised at EA launch - sorcery, mounts, city life, the purge, etc. - aren't on the roadmap anymore for the official launch in May according to the newsletter from 23Jan2018.  \n\nThere are also still bugs that have been in since launch - arrow in the hand - despite months of a supposed polish-phase.  In short, this game has some promise and great building but the AI is terrible and after you get past the first few hours there isn't much to do but rinse and repeat in different areas (but you'll have to grind through the gear tiers to do it). \n\nIf you've got any interest in this game I would suggest playing something else until well after launch to see if Funcom actually delivers on the core ideas that sold so well when they started in EA.\n\nEdit (16Feb2018):  I stand by this review.  A watered-down version of the purge has been included for launch but mounts, city life, and sorcery are confirmed out.  The AI remains subpar and the inclusion of teleporting for fast-travel (since there are no mounts) makes things worse, not better, in my opinion.  This game lacks substantive content and has become a combat-based, gear grind with a nice building function.  Somehow they've managed to combine the thing I dislike most about MMOs (gear grinds and weapon tiers) while emphasizing my least favorite feature in a survival game (combat).\n\nEdit (20May2018):  I jumped back in after launch and I am pleasantly surprised at the changes that Funcom has made.  I find myself pulled into the game looking forward to the next play session which hasn't happened since the North expansion was released (August 2017).  A lot of bugs have been squashed and the stability of the game has been improved.\n\nThe combat system is an improvement and the rebalance of weapons made the difference between the tiers less significant and more optional than mandatory.  The amount of customization, decorations, and high quality building pieces makes constructing a massive fort or a small hideout a real pleasure.\n\nThe addition of currency, trading outposts, and other lore-based improvements (like more monsters) makes the world feel more like the one described by Robert E. Howard than it ever did during EA.  This game isn't perfect and some things could use further iterations (i.e. thrall AI, swimming animations, skills bonuses, etc.) but for the first time in a long time, it feels llke it's on the right track.  I now recommend this game and I hope that Funcom continues to support the game so that we can tame pets, learn sorcery, and, finally, get mounts.", "timestamp_created": 1516764933, "timestamp_updated": 1526865676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836042344570159912", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41292885": {"recommendationid": "41292885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088137792", "num_games_owned": 582, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 11208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4419, "last_played": 1704346718}, "language": "english", "review": "At the time of writing this I have clocked 12 hours in game, I bought the game yesterday (4/4/18)\n\nAt first I was hesitant because it has a lot of negative reviews but I gave it a shot anyway and I am honestly suprised how good the game is.

There is no hotfixes for even the most simple of exploits.  Game breaking exploits often take weeks to be addressed. The fixes don't always work as intended and might be back in a similar form with the next update.

Communicate on the platform you are actually selling the game on.\n\nThe EA launch couldn't have started worse.  Just about 2 days after launch the Official Servers were taken down for 2 weeks. During that period there was little to no communication. After nearly 2 weeks, the only answer \"soon\" which was given almost every day wasnt enough anymore. \n\n- Even the most serious bugs and game breaking exploits take a long time to be addressed. Simple steps like disabling a secondary attack which enables one to \"fly\" seem to only be able with a bigger update.\nBroken core mechanics of the game take months to be \"fixed\" (players being able to stop pretty much every ai from spawning across the entire map)\n-They often seem to not know how to fix core mechanics.\n\n- [b] Development is 2 steps forward, 1,5 steps backwards[/b]  It seems like no testing was done at all.

The gameplay varies just as much because it is composited of a damn lot of elements.\n- Building\n- Fighting \n- Searching for thralls (the most fun thing in the game)\n- Developing your char \n- Farming resources (which is a lot less tedious than you might think)\n- Exploring dungeons and camps and ruins and caves and...\n- Collecting recipes, legendaries, armor sets...\n- Chatting, forming allies, declare wars (the social component is important and may become as thrilling as the first season of game of thrones)\n- Testing (I spend a lot of time trying new weapon types or builds)\n- Maybe raiding bases or defending against NPC and PC attacks (depending on your game mode)\n- Exploring the ever-changing map (since new clans come and old ones leave - you can loot their ruins)\n- Tame animals\n- Summon the undead\nand so on.\n\n[i]The variety of tasks is the strength of Conan Exiles and keeps me playing.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\nI cannot recommend this game if you are searching for a smooth experience - it is not a \"designer game\". It has edges and bugs and things that just don't work out. It is like your favorite shirt right out of the washing machine but before steaming. Some bugs are just so annoying, like when you ...\n- build an expensive structure that just vanishes for no reason\n- lose a stack of ore somewhere between your inventory and the smelter for no reason\n- see the thrall you knocked out falling through the floor for no reason\n- lose the grip while climbing for no reason\n\nAlso, the gameplay mechanics are just not smooth. The combat system could easily be done much better if it wouldn't rely that heavily on the animation system. You could very easily make placing structures more comfortable or building in general. And the whole UI is from another age. \n\n[i]The rough edges and flaws may raise one's eyebrows but they don't bother me too much.[/i]\n\n\n\n[h1]And The Ugly[/h1]\n\nI cannot recommend this game to players who search for a smooth PvP experience. It still has to deal with many exploits, such as: \n- under-meshing \n- animation glitches that allow you to\n... appear unarmed, yet attack with a spear (not seen in a while)\n... be invisible or move in a stuck animation frame, that is under the mesh (seen some weeks ago)\n... attack without losing stamina (seen recently)\n... cancel combos and start with the finisher (seen some weeks ago)\n... teleport (not seen in a while)\nAnd the community remains very eager to find new exploits every day.\n\nBesides the exploits, I also dislike the devs reaction to problems. If your server keeps crashing, it may take the dev a whole week to repair it. Also, the dev prefers to fix exploits over banning cheaters. While this is legit, it takes months to fix an exploit and in the meantime, it leads to massive frustration for honest players, who lose all their stuff to cheaters, that don't get punished at the end.\n \n[i]The cheaters and exploits have bugged me just too much in the past, I lost a lot of my love for the game.[/i]\n\n\n[b]Finally I conclude with giving the game a thumb down. I don't recommend it, if you, just like me, want some good PvP fun. If you are searching for something else, this game might be very much for you, though. [/b]\n\nUPDATE: Update 37 fixed many issues and exploits according to stamina.\n\n[h1]Original Review[/h1]\n\n[i]After 850 hours on an official PvP server I can say, this is one of the best games I have played so far. \n\nBut I cannot recommend it. The game is 100% destroyed by cheaters.\n\n- The servers get attacked and forced to crash or lag by dupers.\n- Every second base is an undermesh base. Still 3+ ways to undermesh not yet fixed.\n- The PvP combat is dominated by glitchers, that use the wonky animation system to ...\n- ... cancel combos and start with a finisher\n- ... dive in the mesh like a sand shark\n- ... appear to be unarmed but attack with a spear\n- ... be immune to damage\n- ... have infinite stamina\n- ... be invisible\n- ... teleport\nand so on.\n\nThere are many more bugs and glitches and exploits. Even if they would fix some of them, each single one that is left would still be gamebreaking. \n\nMaybe a good game in 5-10 years. Or if you find a server with honest people.\n\nI am willing to change my recommendation based on the improvements Funcom wll make to the listed issues.\n\nUPDATE\nThings got worse. In addition to the problems mentioned above, the game became unplayable on my server (official 1100) with the unbelievable number of 200 crashes (the event log supports a max amount of 200 entries) in the last 10 days. Multiple threads in the official forums by different players of different clans were opened and asked for help. (Besides the normal way of filling out the \"report server\" form - which the players did the first few days.) \n\nInstead of fixing the issue, Funcom decided to delete the threads. The server is still crashing.   \n\nI am aware this issue doesn't apply to every or even many servers - and there are lots of people who can play without all this trouble. But if you want to buy this game, you should know, that it is a possibility, that an official server gets killed by a strange \"cooperation\" of cheaters and the dev.\n\nUPDATE 2\nMy server is finally running again. I have talked to the server provider, Funcom and some Players about the reasons for the server crash. Apperently a player structure was the issue. I will rework my review soon the better reflect the actual state of the game and my personal experiences with it.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1561414228, "timestamp_updated": 1568979504, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 125, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833018720149993896", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1562841072, "developer_response": "Hi, just to update you on some of the actions we're taking: https://forums.funcom.com/t/family-sharing-and-conan-exiles/80150"}, "108401511": {"recommendationid": "108401511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004894439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 544219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9939, "playtime_at_review": 303987, "last_played": 1713799961}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally gonna do this.

You don't point and shoot magic. You cast a spell manually by picking trough a menu as the spell is cast till you have chosen all parts of it. It takes some seconds, you are vulnerable.

What do I mean by wasted potential? Well buckle up, grab yourself a delicious can of nondenominational soda and pop a couple of no-doz because I'm about to tell you. \n\nThe first few hours of Conan Exiles are genuinely fun, the fun is in the potential, you can see other people's bases, see their hard work and think to yourself \"gee I can't wait to get there\". Then your feet hit the ground and you realise what's actually in store for you. Ruh Roh.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of the game is great, building is fun, the locations are pretty, and some of the bosses and dungeons are real neat. The problems only really start to show themselves after about 50 or so hours, once you start to hit the endgame. Conan Exiles is the victim of some baffling design choices, like a skill tree that changes very little, a resource scale on building that makes mount everest look like a flea's turgid member, and systems that have been gutted by various buffs and nerfs. Did you want to enjoy a well balanced nutritional smorgasboard? Too bad. We're pork rind people now. I have been holding multiple NPCs hostage and forcing them to eat pork rinds so they do more damage. Every time I see a boar in the world it no longer registers as a creature. it's just a pork rind ATM and daddy needs to make a withdrawal. But I digest.\n\nAll in all it genuinely feels like this game has been neglected on a base level and this has caused a lot of the systems to fester and turn into a pale imitation of anything enjoyable. The fun moments are usually overshadowed by the oppressive slog for farming mats that hangs over you like a burly taskmaster ready to forcibly feed you pork rind after pork rind until you get back in line.\n\nI feel as though I can recommend this game because of two important things:\n\n1. The first few hours are pretty fun. If survival games are your thing or you just really like Conan\n2. I paid like 12 dollars for this game, I've been playing this sucker at like 10 cents an hour. \n\nIn conclusion, a polished turd is still a turd, but it still goes down a whole lot smoother than a turd filled with pork rinds.\n\nTL;DR: The game is ok, it just needs some serious love and a lot of system overhauls that focus on bringing content back int othe game, not removing it for the sake of balance.", "timestamp_created": 1607411063, "timestamp_updated": 1607411063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 67, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832588016986846924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148038071": {"recommendationid": "148038071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105406830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 28101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1050, "playtime_at_review": 25855, "last_played": 1713641662}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a absolute outrage- Funcom is once again targeting the mod community and especially the RP community by asking for the removal of Tot!

They're currently searching for a new partner that will give a better multiplayer experience. I'm glad to see Funcom is quick to make choices like these, shows they're very proactive about the playerbase's concerns. The data from these official servers will be saved and ported to their new provider. The process to find a new provider will take a few days however.  So I urge you to play on unofficial servers or solo in the meantime.\n\n\nSolo play runs the most stable, multiplayer is still having some problems. Still a more solid launch than what I experienced on other Early Access games. Funcom has a clear vision in mind for the future of this game, whether or not they deliver on this remains to be seen. I'm enjoying the game as of now.\n\nFrame rate uncapped and v-sync off gives me about 70 to 140 FPS, but will stutter at certain areas for seemingly no reason. Despite this, I've been still getting better performance compared to other EA games of this type, ARK would be one such game, and it has had two years now.\n\nPro & Con List\n\nPositives-\nGame world- The game world is gorgeous, really feels in line with Robert E. Howards vicious and primeval feeling. \n\nGame models are excellent\n\nArmor and weapons are wonderfully designed , and often behave realistically to wind with cloth garbs.\n\nThe crafting system seems well thought out and designed (However the UI to craft needs far more work, will explain below)\n\nThe building system is great, the snap system isn't a new function for building, but it seems to work very well here, and building up the sides of trees and cliff-faces is really entertaining.\n\nSHEER UNCENSORED BARBARITY- Now for some puritanical individuals, this is a definite con, I've seen the argument raised on the discussion board. This game has FULL FRONTAL nudity as an option, and the gore is turned up to 11. Robert E. Howard was writing stories that rivals George R.R. Martin's brutality and sexuality in the mid 1930s, that's saying something. No seriously, I think a young George would've blushed at this stuff.\n\nExploration- Exploring feels rewarding, stumbling across the lore pieces throughout the exiled lands is great for a lore hog like me.\n\n\nNegatives\n\nOptimization: I've seen many people voice concerns on optimization, I didn't these problems on my rig, but I cannot speak for all systems, so it deserves mention.\n\nAnimations: When animations play out properly, they seem well done, however there seems to be a disconnect unto where animations connect to hitboxes as well as a draw range for animations playing out. (Nothing quite like seeing a naked man ominously levitate towards you before breaking out into a run)\n\nUI: The Crafting Recipe Unlock Menu is TERRIBLE. I've gotten used to it, but it was a painful adjustment. It's seemingly not organized at all, and still seemingly has \"Item ID\" numbers attached to certain recipe unlocks, which is quite off-putting. A seemingly easy fix I'd imagine however. The actual crafting screen itself on the right hand of your main inventory is fine however.\n\nCombat: Needs improving, the combat animations of the humans is and some enemies is excellent. But however the hitboxes seem to be off and it often ends up as a button mashing fight. The inability to block without a shield is also pretty annoying. Funcom said this is one of their biggest next priorities however in their last devstream before release. \n\nMultiplayer: As of right now, I've heard that it's easy to grief bases, and that door and wall destruction is far easier than it should be. Expect this to be fixed very soon, they've made this clear on the Conan Exiles Reddit.  The multiplayer performance is also pretty spotty, I've found servers where it runs well, and others where the \"rubber banding\" issue, is quite persistent. \n\n\n\nClosing statement:   I personally love it, it has its flaws, but I feel the problems they have here can be fixed relatively easily.  Still, if you feel hesitant to guy an Early Access game, I'm right there with you on that concern. I haven't bought Early Access in a long time until now, it's a logical and valid concern. All I can say is keep an eye on the game if it interests you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was my experience on:\nGPU: GTX 980\nCPU: Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-6700k 4.0 GHz\nMemory: 32 GB RAM (4x 8GB DDR3)\nResolution: 1920x1080\nHDD: 2 TB\nSSD: 256 GB", "timestamp_created": 1485851486, "timestamp_updated": 1486149996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 714, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828857362270355225", "comment_count": 47, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128033595": {"recommendationid": "128033595", "author": {"steamid": "76561199153894245", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 315410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128787, "last_played": 1712550368}, "language": "english", "review": "What the bleep?

I\u2019ve yet to attempt open servers. As a result, I probably haven\u2019t run into the more annoying stock of communities like purges and raids. I\u2019ve played alone, modded, and at my own speed; that may color how I see this game. I\u2019m okay with this.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Skyrim for a moment. Yes, it\u2019s relevant. Do you all remember the first five to ten hours you played it? You were still weak, dealing with iron and steel swords and slashing your way through new caverns and dungeons while scrounging every bit of material you could for your smithing skill. Everything was new and different, and every new playthrough with a different race or weapon type.\n\nThen something happens. Several hours in, your smithing and sneak is 75+, you\u2019re level 40 on Expert Difficulty one-shotting every bandit in every dungeon because you took a couple of very specific perks that make the entire game a cakewalk. Or you used alchemy to hilariously boost your stats in the several hundreds or thousands and now your armor rating is at a complete maximum and you\u2019re doing sixty times melee damage on sneak attacks.\n\nAt a certain point, Skyrim gameplay becomes less about mechanics and just about exploration.\n\nHowever, Exiles basically takes those first few hours and expands them across the entire experience. I get a bit of a Skyrim meets ARK and a lesser used comparison is that I\u2019m honestly getting an Assassin\u2019s Creed: Origins vibe, if nothing else certainly the aesthetics. Large sandy dunes and mountains with spotty greenery and oases, and I\u2019m pretty sure I have an identical screenshot of climbing up a red mountain. My exile and Bayek would probably get along.\n\nFor whatever reason, I find Exiles to be a bit more accessible than ARK ever was. I think it\u2019s perhaps the single player admin menu which if ARK has I have never found. Through it you\u2019re able to manipulate things to an insane degree, like ten times the amount of experience and resource gain, as well as modifying how much damage you do and enemies take. I went through a largely unaffected run (though I did bump my experience up to 2X) the first time around and that sucked me in for several hours. In future games, I made it a little easier on myself with quality of life workshop mods including upping armor durability and reducing boss health pools. That last one might sound like a cheat, but when they have up to 30,000 health and I\u2019m alone in the world, lowering it down to 10,000 or something makes the experience a LOT more bearable. I\u2019m not saying ARK does not have these features (it does have workshop support) but it just wasn\u2019t nearly as compelling as Exiles, which does in fact have a story contrary to what some reviews claim.\n\nYou start the game creating your character and get a randomized set of \u201ccrimes\u201d which can include anything from punching a camel to lewd acts with corpses. It ranged wildly and there\u2019s quite a list that can be quite comical, though the game itself is largely void of humor. Conan himself shows up to remove you from the cross and the game dumps you in a desert road, entirely naked and scrounging for fibers, rocks, and branches; all the things you\u2019ll need to quickly craft a set of clothes and basic tools.\n\nThe story doesn\u2019t really hold your hand, nor does it tell you what to do. There are runestones dotted around the land that give you snippets and clues. The idea is that you have a magical slave bracelet that\u2019s holding you in what is literally called \u201cThe Exiled Lands\u201d, which is the whole area of the map you\u2019re in. Go too far, and you\u2019ll find a green shield that will automatically kill you. What\u2019s involved in this is finding a large variety of bosses and McGuffins that will eventually remove the curse of the bracelet and allow your exile to leave.\n\nThat\u2019s the basis of your presence in this strange world. What happens after that point is really up to you. Since you can hardly take on an undead dragon right out of the gate, you pretty much engage in the usual ARK/Minecraft flare. Build a house, hunt animals for hide, and generally spend a lot of time working your way up.\n\nEventually I found that I had the most fun when I had a decent set of medium armor and a good stock of weapons that I could repair on the fly and that allowed me to make various expeditions outside the comfort zone of what people call the \u201cnewbie river\u201d, the southern-most landscape that offer you the most resources within a reasonable travel time. I eventually made it to the Hinterlands where I was able to harvest heavier leathers for better armors, which in turn allowed me to travel farther and take on more intimidating enemies.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, you have to manage some resources including hunger, thirst, heat and weight. Thirst can be fairly easy to manage if you\u2019re hanging around the southern portions of the map. Hunger isn\u2019t too bad, and weight I\u2019ve modded out entirely, which I\u2019ll justify shortly. Beyond that there\u2019s a full listing of RPG elements with various perks and stats you can acquire as you level up. In an unmodded game you can only max out a couple so in multiplayer or co-op games you may want to split roles between survivors, gatherers, and combatants.\n\nThe most fun I\u2019ve had in this game is just the unrestrained exploring, which for me has only been with the help of some workshop mods. I got an insane encumbrance mod early in my career because once I acquired a legit \u201cdecent\u201d set of armor, my weight was at 70% regardless of how much stuff I tried to store away. Even in my most purist playthroughs, that mod will always remain. I am less irritated with weight in the likes of Skyrim because I typically have fast travel and stores to sell my crap to, but here I do not have that convenience. Fast travel in Exiles is possible but more of a mid- to end-game perk once you explore enough of the map. There\u2019s a bunch of obelisks you can purify and then travel to through a map room, of which I haven\u2019t done a lot of research and I\u2019m not sure where to find that. As it stands, everything you need you have to get on foot. No horses, no mounts, just hauling all the ass.\n\nThe lack of fast travel is indeed a late-game annoyance. Alongside that are a variety of bugs that you\u2019ll come across for a post Early-Access game. I\u2019ve found that engaging in combat within certain variables will have me and the NPC I\u2019m fighting just\u2026 sorta flail at each other for a bit. Neither of us take damage, and I noticed that it is because we had some buildings and terrain above us. I lured them out and now we both took damage again.\n\nSpeaking of, the combat leaves a lot to be desired. It gives me Origins vibes again with some blocking, dodging and health bars. However the lock-on and hit detection is very wonky when I try to do some light attacks right next to a crocodile only for them to miss entirely. I had to back up and try again and it would work. This happens about twenty percent of the time, depending on my attack. Conversely, a heavy spear attack always hits my enemy.\n\nSome enemies also have knockback effects. I\u2019d be fighting basic bird type enemies and they\u2019d reel in, walk towards me and I\u2019d be knocked over. Apparently they\u2019re \u201ccharging\u201d but they don\u2019t go faster than walk speed and thus are difficult to detect. Maybe that\u2019s my fault but it\u2019s just a bit annoying.\n\nPatience is really the key here if you want to get the most out of the game. I\u2019ve tried rushing towards the revered \u201cStar Metal\u201d for the endgame gear but found myself perfectly content with some normally crafted heavy stuff, or light armor if I want to dodge enemies more often. Exiles is kind of a slow burn at first but once you find an established area with decent walking distance to most forms of resource, you\u2019re probably in good shape.

The issue is you'll come across bugs that were reported in 2017, but have not been addressed.  Sometimes you'll see comments on the forum that they have plans to fix said issue(or that they have, when in truth they have not), other times no response.  Instead of fixing the gamebreaking issues, the developers are working on new features.  The fan boys will frequently give you suggestions on how to cope with the bug.  Do x and then y, and the bug should go away for a bit.  This is not acceptable, believe me, I develop software for a living.\n\nHere are just a few major/medium issues:\n-thralls(think of this as a D2 merc that follows you) will not attack until either you attack, get hit, or they are hit.\n-thralls randomly decide they will do nothing but stand there, even while being killed.\n-thralls that finally decide to attack, will randomly pick a passive enemy not even in range, and run to it to pull it into the fray.  Sometimes the enemy will sit there taking no damage, all while your thrall continues hitting it.  You have to walk within a certain distance for the game to decide to deal damage to said target.  Doing so, may pull additional enemies, and your thrall will likely repeat the process of finding a passive enemy to aggro.\n-thralls with melee weapons miss anything that slightly moves.  Are you being chased?  Don't worry, derpy will swing his/her weapon at the wind.  You have to time it just right so that w/e derpy is swinging at isn't moving at the time of the swing.\n-thralls with bows, randomly just decide they will never shoot another arrow\n\n-purge, first 3 waves spawned directly outside base, as they should.  Remaining waves spawned on top of base and did major damage.  Our base was perfectly exposed for pathing, but nope, purge was dropped directly on top of roof.  Last wave spawned Rockslide directly INSIDE the 1st floor.  We lost everything.  This was with T3 blocks.\n\n-sometimes when looting your corpse, your items will not show up in your inventory.  You have to log out and back in for them to magically appear.\n\n-players, thralls, enemies glitching through walls/floors.  Multiple times now I've almost killed a boss, only for it to fall through the floor or a wall, and never to be seen again, until server restarts.  I was even pulling a named volcano archer to my thrall wheel, and it glitched through the mountain.  It was never found.\n\n-pets, especially greater ones have garbage stats compared to thralls.  There is no purpose to really have them outside of their poop, gold/silver dust, etc.\n\n-chests that decide they'll never restock.  Went a few days without the rusted keys(for scrap armor chests) respawning.\n\n-weapons that claims to ignore armor, but do not.  2handed axes(in name/description) that are actually 1handed axes.\n\n-rng in this game is so utterly bad.  I spent a full week of trying to get snow hunter to spawn at 1% chance, only for her to spawn 9 out of 11 times in exact same spot.  Other examples include bosses continually dropping the exact same gear, until rng clicks over, and now they start magically dropping w/e it was they refused to drop before, time after time.  Pet rng for getting a variant or greater is so awful(yes i know about different foods influencing the odds).\n\n-pretty often you'll pull off a perfect dodge, only for the game to teleport you back to where it thinks you got hit.  You don't get the stamina back and you take full damage.  It's an auto-death if you get stuck near a wall surrounded by undead or anything that can stagger/knock you down.  You'll roll, and appear to have gotten away, only to instant port back to wall cluster, and continue to be killed/locked.\n\n-enemies from absurd range will just instant target the player.  This is a real pain when you're walking through an area with animals, and instantly you have king elk, wolves, mammoths, bears, etc coming at you at full force.  I remember that episode on the Discovery channel, where the elks decided to join forces with their number 1 enemies, to kill the humans(j/k).\n\n-enemies sometimes even after sustaining well over 70% of their hp in damage from your thrall, will continue trying to kill you, even when you haven't attacked.\n\n-the aoe graphics for clouds(corruption, noxious, etc), especially in the volcano and broken springs, frequently don't match hitboxes.  I've been walking through fire graphics taking no damage, and other times been randomly hit by corruption and noxious stacks, even when there is nothing in sight.  Another example is spiders and reapers often won't fire a projectile, but you'll get poison stacks.\n\n-when building you have to place certain blocks/building pieces in a specific order, or they won't line up or snap together.  The gate is a great example.  \n\n-Sometimes you'll get the \"failed to place object.\"  When there is clearly no reason you can't place said building object.  The work around is to swap to another object, and then back to the one you had.  This is so annoying when building large bases.\n\nthings that aren't bugs but don't really make any sense to me:\n-with friendly fire enabled, you can hit each other, including thralls.  Enemies do not hit each other.  This seems silly.  If a cluster of skeletons are body blocking you against the wall wildly swinging, they should be hitting each other too.\n-this game sometimes plays like a souls game, and other times something else.  They need to decide what it is.\n-enemy archers range from never able to hit you even when standing still, to able to auto-aim you even if you are sprinting, rolling, zig zagging, etc.  Sometimes they'll snipe you through trees.\n-inability to lock storage containers.  I would like it if I could lock/code my own storage so that clan mates don't ninja or 'borrow' things that I need.\n-There are lots of bugs in the game, that can only be resolved by restarting the server.  Again this is a work around, not a fix.  This should not be needed as much as it is.\n-Xp tables feel very half-butted.  Imagine how annoying it is to kill the undead which are plentiful, high in hp, do not bleed/poison, and can't be stunned.  They give a few thousand xp.  Now imagine a ram, rock rocknose, etc that you can take out with 1 hit that gives large sums of xp.  Yes I can get to lv 60 fast, that isn't my issue with xp.

I have played it for more than 1000 hours. And how did they repay me? They decided to create some very generic and vague rules about building without fully explaining what they mean and how you are supposed to follow them. Then without the slightest warning they ban me, delete everything I have built, no refunds, no checking the case, and what is more I cant even log in the official servers because I am restricted for some time. I did nothing wrong. 2 years I have spent to build my base. 2 years now I am on the same server.  That's more than 1000 hours of gameplay. I do not prevent access to resources nor do I prevent entering in a dungeon. When I built my base there was no restriction, I didn't built on areas that I'm not supposed to and I never tried to bug the game or try to build in a malicious way just to prevent players from building or be of bother to them. Noted that I also play in a PvE server. I sent a ticket. They answered about how I can see my restriction, its reason and how long its gonna last. That was not even the case, I wonder I someone even read my case. I wonder if someone even looked into it before deleting everything I have done in this game. I have read about similar cases so it makes me wonder if they just deleted the efforts of so many players so far without even examining every case. Truly I am disappointed.

Thus why this is simply a recommendation and not a review.\n\nI'm not a long time player by any stretch of the imagination and haven't experienced issues myself, but can easily imagine why the veteran playbase is a bit disgruntled. Considering my DayZ and Ark experiences, my heart is with the die hard Conan players, as I understand how frustrating it is when you feel like your not being heard. Bugs, glitches, cheating in PvP and everything else with it, I get it I really do.\n\nBut..\n\nI don't have that deep of an experience with the game to judge it on that level, but what I do have is a first time player's perspective who picked it up in the HumbleBundle Monthly, so that's all I can speak of at the moment and my perspectove will always be on the opposite side of the spectrum due to the price I paid for it and lack of hours played in comparison to the vets. \n\nWith that being said, if you're considering buying this month's HumbleBundle Monthy, because you've had an interest in picking Conan up, but were on the fence, do so. For the price it's being offered at, along side other free titles, it's a no brainer. Conan is a very, very good title and is well worth the HumbleBundle Monthly's asking price. I'd honestly go as far as saying with my experiences thus far, I should have picked it up when it released and am upset at myself for not doing so, because it's easy to see Funcom truly cared about the Conan IP.\n\nIf you're a fan of survival titles, you're missing out not playing Conan, because Conan Exiles 100% deserves a place in your library. I can't get enough of the grindiness when survival titles get it right and Conan does. It's enjoyable and somewhat familiar (especially to ARK players) as soon as you begin your playthrough. Conan Exiles is one of those titles that will scratch that survival itch if that's what you're looking for. So I honestly can't recommend Conan Exiles enough for the asking price over at HumbleBundle. In my opinion, it's the best monthly that's ever been released, because the value really is that good.\n\nFrom graphics to gameplay, Conan Exiles is a high quality release being offered at next to nothing in the July HumbleBundle Monthly and if you've been interested in playing it, you'll regret not picking it up now for $12 (US) and the included other games. Don't let this opportunity pass you up, because as much as I'm sure there are issues with the game as the veteran playerbase say's, they paid far more, so their perspective is definitely going to be more critical and rightly so.\n\nYet, I let the Steam reviews affect me not buying Conan Exiles for months and I'm disgusted at myself for that, because Funcom deserved my support. They released a title in the Conan universe and put a massive amount of effort into it. Upon first launch, I was amazed at exactly how well rounded this game is and imperfections aside, there's a lot to like (more so than most survival titles). So, although ARK might be considered the reigning king of survival titles to many (I still think DayZ is the best), owning the runner up for a fraction of the release price is the deal of the year! \n\nI have to be honest here, I still haven't played a perfect survival title, even though I own so many. They all have their strengths and weaknesses and I guarantee when you play Conan Exiles, you'll see a lot of things that Funcom did better than everyone else, just as if you play ARK and DayZ, they'll both have certain elements that are superior. Yet, you'll be disappointed if you don't give Conan Exiles a shot to discover this yourself. \n\nBuy the July HumbleBundle Monthly bundle, support charity and Funcom, they both deserve it!", "timestamp_created": 1532066652, "timestamp_updated": 1532337049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 232, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821362197399139404", "comment_count": 32, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121622554": {"recommendationid": "121622554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034355239", "num_games_owned": 816, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 35847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22049, "last_played": 1667774767}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, this is how Tencent run its business.

Its sickening. The devs at this point are that one friend you have that recently started meth and is telling you is fine and normal, trying to get you to do it. \n\nDo yourself and the community a favour, if you don't own it, don't buy it, and if you do own it, make as much noise as you can about this.

And then you have your standard obfuscation currency that's also far too overpriced and also perfectly engineered to never be the amount you need for whatever shop item you want.\n\nMy advice is, if you want a good, solid game experience, download an earlier version, or wait until someone un-fucks this one. Or buy and support a game from someone else who respects your time, your enjoyment, and your support.

Howard's Conan. As someone who committed some wrong, you are transported to the Exiles Lands (no mention of the actual location on the Conan's map from the books) where you're left to fend for yourself, trapped within boundaries that kill you if you try to cross them. From there it's classic survival; eat, drink, build a shelter, etc... If you play the Siptah expansion then it's the same thing but happening on an island. \n\nThe map: Exiles Land, as it's called, is a medium-sized map roughly on par with Skyrim in size; roughly 45 square km. Give or take. The map spawns different biomes: jungle, tropical/desert, northern forests, and... volcano. I dunno. It seems like since the dawn of gaming every single developer needs to add a volcano+lava into their maps. *shakes head*. The diversity of elements in these biomes include vegetation, animals, and npc's, as well as resources (wood, stone...) for you to gather in order to build a shelter. Just like npc's, animals whether carnivors or herbivores are pretty much static in their locations and wander very little. Encounter a bear in a certain place? The'll always be a bear there. Npc's also hate you and will attack you on sight. Only a very few select npc's are neutral and that's because they have either something to tell you or teach you. To get around you can travel on horse but can also make use of obelisks which serve as fast travel points, but only if you've built yourself a map room. \n\nSiptah is a large island with a mysterious tower at its center. The biome mixes tundra/redwood forest with more tropical setting in the south, which feels strange a bit out of place. Like on Exile Lands you'll find camps with npc's as well as dungeons which are called Vaults. There are no obelisks or maprooms on Siptah so you have to cover the distances on foot or on a horse. \n\nVisually the game is presented as using the Unreal Engine 4 but honestly it looks more like Unreal Engine 3. Some textures are sharp, but many others are low-res when viewed up close. The sky is classic original Unreal with 2D animated textures going from one side to the other while morphing unrealistically. The night sky is atrocious. It looks like someone used a black background in Paint and dotted it with a white pen tool. We should see the arm of the Milky Way, nebulas, and even the Andromeda galaxy, but there's none of that. \n\nAmbient sounds are the most underwhelming thing. For a natural world there aren't many sounds. Waterfalls don't produce sounds. Galloping with your horse in water doe not produce sounds. Sometimes a bird or two are faintly heard. This world should be teeming with animal sounds, alas. Soundwise, it makes you feel like you're in the middle a lifeless world. It's all a big letdown in the audio dept. \n\nBuilding however is good and intuitive. You can do so with basic mats such as stone and wood, or use refined mats to build using different architectural styles taken from the Conan lore. It's by far one of the most user-friendly building game there is. \n\nYou can add thralls to serve you, either as crafters or henchman/henchwoman by first knocking them out, placing them on a wheel of pain and after more or less 24 hours in real time that thrall is ready to serve you. It's pretty darn quick considering Conan himself spent 20 years on such a wheel. \n\nYou can play either PvP, Pve C (conflict) or PvE. As such, to play these modes you'll have to hop on a public server or a private server (should you have been invited), or rent your own server. For the latter the admin can set the rules of the game to their liking. Or, if you do not like social interaction, just start a single-player game, give yourself admin rights and go crazy.\n\nConnectivity: If you play online, be aware that all the servers are in Germany and that disconnects are frequent. The length of the disconnect, during which you can't re-join your game session, can vary greatly; from 5-10 minutes to a couple of hours, depending. Be advised.\n\nLike many other games, this one also has DLC's. Before, a DLC would get you building pieces, decoration items, armor sets, and weapons. Now? Not so much as Funcom has decided to fragment everything in almost individual pieces that you can buy at the bazar for a certain amount of Crom coins and only Crom coins, which you can \"conviently\" purchase with real money on the bazar. In other games, such Guild Wars 2, you can purchase things in the store using gems, but you can exchange the gold you make in-game for gems. In Conan Exiles there's no way to obtain Crom coins other than by purchasing them with money. You want this armor set? Crom coins. This workstation? Crom coins. And so on. \n\nThankfuly the game is mod-friendly but there aren't a ton of mods. \n\nBut then you'll ask me, how come you have clocked 5k hours into this game only to not recommending it? Hang on tight!\n\n\nUnfortunately Funcom isn't a company who communicates well, if at all, with its player base. It is, I rather say, an abomination regarding its communication. They don't seem to care much about players grievances! At all. Niet. Zip. Nada. They don't acknowledge the problem and much less about what's being done. There is an important thread on the Funcom forum about this: \n\nhttps://forums.funcom.com/t/connection-lost-continues-to-be-a-significant-issue/221501/183\n\nFuncom did end up resolving the situation but offered no explanation, nor apologies whatsoever. \n\nOn Dec. 14th 2023 Funcom rolled off it's new update; Age of War chapter 3. But like any update now, Funcom seems to have dropped the ball in a massive way. This update banned just about every player unexpectedly due to an \"imbalance\" of the Crom coins you have bought, and this discrepency puts every player in debt for a varying number of Crom coins. Unfortunately, you can't play the game unless that balance is checked out by buying... you guessed it, Crom coins. It's like you wake up one day to discover that your bank account is overdrafted for thousands of dollars, and the only solution is for you to fork out the cash to make up for it. Until you do, you can't buy anything. See here: \n\nhttps://forums.funcom.com/t/lots-of-players-seemingly-banned-for-incorrect-crom-coin-balance/245721\n\nAs per usual, Funcom does not communicate with the player base at all, and the only solution is to appeal via Zendesk, which, I afraid to say, isn't quite effective. \n\nThese updates always bring forth nasty situations like this. When it's not all your thralls vanishing, it's your entire base, or repeated connections issues that keeps you from playing the game. \n\nPopular Conan Exiles YouTuber Wak4863 has to say about the latest debable: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6ZsIr7sEFg\n\nYou *may* enjoy the game, but be advised off the issues I brought forth and mentioned in the forum links I've provided.", "timestamp_created": 1681943164, "timestamp_updated": 1702607195, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816352188587188721", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68452855": {"recommendationid": "68452855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026869898", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4682, "last_played": 1706620333}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game at first but completely unbalanced as you progress.
