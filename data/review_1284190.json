It's a world to get lost in.

There is no predator hunting you, no aliens shooting at your back. It's just you versus the atmosphere. And it's on you to change that as well.\nSo you can REALLY focus on creating a lush, beautiful planet out of a dead wasteland, all while exploring cool landscapes, shipwrecks and hidden lore. \nYou build base(s) and get your automation started for more resources to build more and better things, that will transform this dull marsian planet into a living, breathing home. \n\nFor me this game is the perfect balance of exploration and \"strategy\" on how you spend your resources. I adore that this game has other priorities that so many others from this \"branch\" have. Nothing jumpscares you or makes you stressed out and fear for your life - but places can still be scary and uncomfortable to navigate through, keeping you on your toes for a hot minute (also thanks to the eerie soundtrack), as fall damage or drowning/suffocating/burning/starving still can kill you. \n\nOverall a great game to relax and tinker when you're not the kind of person who destresses with \"stressful\" games. It's just so.. satisfying visiting a faraway place after a long time and the once sad, sandy dunes are now green and lush. It's a good kind of dopamine.\n\nI revisit the game every few months when there are bigger gameplay updates and new things to discover and create, as it CAN get repetitive after a while, especially when you're in the later stages. It can feel like a waiting game at some points when you're just at the beginning of a new stage, but, if you have a few building projects going, you really don't mind. Just put on a podcast and build away.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're in search for a very TAME survival game, that isn't hard or punishing to get through and has its focus on actually reshaping the planet. I just hope that the developers never give in to the constant lamenting of some people who DO want an active threat being added. Or at least make it optional.

You're taking an entire map that's so barren and orange/red it hurt my eyes at times, and turning it into something lush and honestly pretty striking at times! It's very fun and rewarding to watch the map transform. The gameplay(and indeed, much of the game design itself) borrows from Subnautica; you explore, you gather resources, you build your base, you make the world your own. Instead of finding the unique flora and fauna like in Subnautica, you get to put it there yourself!\r\n\r\nMany of my issues with this game, and why I will not be finishing it despite being a stone's throw away from the finish line and ending, stem from technical issues and an apparent lack of polish that I originally thought was attributed to the early-access state of the game. Now that we're at a full release, I feel that the game is far too unstable. Hitches, freezes, and an apparent memory leak that caused my entire computer to lock up on multiple occasions made playing the game more stressful than rewarding or fun, because I was always worried about saving as early and often as possible to protect my progress(which is largely just based on waiting real-world time for your terrformation values to tick up) from the inevitable crashes.\r\n\r\nThe map is full of holes. I found a gap in the geometry within a 15-second walk from the spawn point that allowed me to clip under the rocks. The game evidently makes a lot of concessions to maintain performance; one of these concessions is very aggressive LOD and occlusion culling of basically everything. Map geometry, player-placed buildings, even the plants that you grow will very obviously pop in and out of existence as you are moving to and fro. The lay of the land is hard to get a grasp on because of how drastically the environment changes as you travel; something I thought was just a bare hill that would allow me to access another part of the map is actually blocked by a huge cliff that simply popped into existence when I got close enough. It's jarring, confusing, and immersion-breaking. Another comparison to Subnautica is hardly fair here; those guys had the advantage of an ever-present underwater fog to hide what they were doing in the distance, but they also had the environments and objects fade in and out rather than simply appearing and disappearing. I don't want to make assumptions, but it feels very much like higher-quality assets and systems were added onto the very shaky foundation built by the team working on this game when they were much more amateur as developers. One example of this I feel is the lack of a proper day-night cycle. The skybox is eternally static, and \"night\" is signified by the game cranking down the exposure without changing how anything is lit. It's strange and doesn't feel like something that should have passed any kind of a quality check for the 1.0 release, which is a statement that I unfortunately feels like applies to many things about this game.\r\n\r\nI hope that some day I can return to this game and properly finish it without the pains of the current version.

"language": "english", "review": "I'm a huge sucker for survival and base building games, and the idea of throwing terraforming into the mix really appealed to me. When faced with the brain-dead simplicity of the early game, however, I just couldn't bring myself to continue and see whether the changes to the planet were sweet enough to make up for my utter boredom and disappointment.\n\nResource gathering amounted to \"pick up minerals that are scattered around in a roughly even distribution.\" No deposits or concentrations, just walking around learning to identify which small rock (that sticks out from the environment like a sore thumb) corresponds to which of the 5 or so minerals you actually need, because you sure aren't going to be able to collect everything - inventory space is extremely limited early on. So you go out and hope that you randomly find the one you're looking for before you run out of oxygen. The sole exception was a particular one that I had to hunt around for, which was probably the most interesting thing I did during my playtime, punctuated by frustration when I realized that I needed a flashlight that I didn't have, so I had to make another tedious trip back to base, burning through my oxygen tanks the whole time.\n\nBase building, normally my favorite part of these games, was even more lackluster. I had hoped for a feeling of setting up a complex logistics system on an alien world: laying power cables, fiddling with buttons and wires on panels, managing pressure and atmospheric gases, performing critical maintenance, growing food while on the verge of starving, sweating at the possibility of making a fatal mistake. Instead it's just a matter of unceremoniously plopping down devices that magically provide power, magically dig through rock with no byproducts, magically provide oxygen to your suit, and magically correct the mix of atmospheric gases to something breathable. Oh, and they all magically work forever, unless perhaps one happened to get hit with an odd meteorite - wouldn't know. One you've plopped your first set of magical devices, what do you have to look forward to? Gathering more minerals to plop another set of them, until you unlock the T2 version, and then plopping those down instead. And the scale of my operation barely felt like it would be enough to support myself, let alone make any changes whatsoever to the ecosystem of an entire planet. \"Planet Wizard\" might have been a more apt description here.\n\nGraphically I didn't find the game to be up to modern standards. Textures are very flat and frequently don't blend well with whatever they're sitting near. The devices you put down lack a sense of character - that is, being a working machine. Wind turbines simply run at a constant speed forever. Solar panels are static and always clean. Drills barely move. Your own character only interacts with the environment via a tool that does everything. If the gameplay were more interesting it could easily make up for this, but such as it is, it's just another reason to be unenthused about the complete package.\n\nOverall, I'd say that if you don't much care about the things I listed above and just think the idea of watching the planet turn from red to green and having life show up (again, magically) is cool, then by all means you may enjoy Planet Wizard- I mean Crafter. If you just like great survival/crafting games, though, the market is flooded with other titles that will respect your time and provide a more rewarding experience", "timestamp_created": 1712846664, "timestamp_updated": 1712846664, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631703019142150879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163191409": {"recommendationid": "163191409", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991261547", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 184, "playtime_forever": 8522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8522, "playtime_at_review": 6700, "last_played": 1713791390}, "language": "english", "review": "The Planet Crafter is a fun game with a strange story, but an enjoyable progression.

Today I'm going to set a timer and see if I can stop after an hour. I don't even LIKE gather-and-craft games. Or I didn't think I did. I don't like crafting in other games, but there's something ridiculously satisfying about figuring out what you need next to survive, and then once you've got that figured out, figuring out how far you can explore before you need to either get back to base, or build a new cube and crafting station so you can make oxygen and water and then pray you find food so you don't die before you get back.

Cobalt to make oxygen tanks, ice to make water, and locating chests in the area to find food packets.

It started out as the love project of two very committed developers. They created a small game with great promises and prospects for the future, and they really delivered above expectations in some aspects (while not in others, to tell you the truth). The colorful, rich and stylish design they worked with is remarkable, which continued to improve with later additions and the redesigning of some elements. It was a great journey to experience the newer and newer terraforming stages and features implemented in the game with the frequency of cca. 2-3 bigger updates/year according to a very clear roadmap.\nEven though I never really wished for a multiplayer feature for this game, it was pretty obvious they were going in that direction, considering the huge number of players who simply won't play single player games and are begging for mp in every single new game that doesn't have that feature. IMO in this case it contradicts a fairly important lore element, which is not reconcilable with a MP setting, and some key parts of the story don't make much sense anymore when you're not alone on the planet. \nI mean, it's probably cool as the story is not complex or deep at all. This game is so much more about the massive freedom and variability of wholesome sandbox-type base design, building&crafting than anything else! I wouldn't even call it a survival game as this aspect is very simple and marginal. I remember my very first playthrough, when breathable atmosphere wasn't even a thing, that it took me like 40 hours until the first time I ever died, and even that was due to a fall. \nI'm gonna provide a brief pros&cons below to prevent this comment from becoming comparable to a novel in length. \n\nPros:\n- Beautiful visuals, unique world with various biomes.\n- The environment changes a lot during the game, it's a great experience.\n- Wholesome building, crafting, exploring (endless - as long as you want to continue). It's up to you to decide how your planet's biosphere will grow and what kind of creatures will populate it.\n- Pretty big world (may not be true so much in multiplayer), with possible expansions in the future\n- Massive and well thought-out automation is available in later stages of the game to prevent too much grind. This includes fast travel so your time is not wasted too much on pointless traveling. \n- Low level of difficulty and no hostilities at all. Focus is on setting your own goals and working to reach them. Then a bigger one. Then a bigger one. You can't lose what you've built by acts of God or any other forces of nature.\n- Extremely nice and communicative developers who are very enthusiastically working on this project. They let players know what their plans are and they accomplish them. They gather a lot of feedback and input from players, there have been several QoL and balancing improvements. \n\nCons:\n- I hoped for better graphics optimization by 1.0 release, but it's still not so great. FPS still tends to drop low (<40) in densely built-in areas, despite cpu and gpu are less than half burdened, and it's been like that for 2 years. \n- Similarly, collision issues are omnipresent, meaning you can experience rain in a cave or you can easily fall through/under edges of rocks anywhere, sometimes making it difficult to get back to the normally playable area. Some edges, areas of the map look roughly unpolished (polygonal). Water has improved but still, water physics are kind of lame.\n- There is no vehicle/mount and with 1.0 release they kind of said they have given up on that entirely. This can cause a massive grind in the early/middle game. The later alternatives are OK though (jetpack + unlimited fast travel). [spoiler] As soon as I saw my first grown up mammal, I started to wish that at least I could mount them, lol. [/spoiler] \n- The story is not very meaningful or deep, and a multiplayer setting directly contradicts its premises.\n- If you're a science-lover person, you better suspend all your disbelief while you play this game. Just accept that the O2, temperature and pressure values are simply xp points you earn in the game that unlock new stuff and they don't mean anything else. I would've liked if they gave a little more thought to those things, but this kind of strategic variability is completely missing. You just can't screw up the terraforming process, it's literally impossible. The only thing your choices influence is how quickly you can finish it.\n\nAll in all, the pros surely outweigh the cons, it's definitely worth a try even on full price.

You can drop power anywhere and it counts for your overall score.  There's no running wires which is nice, but it means that you can just run around, gather the items you need and drop a random solar panel miles from your base and it counts, which feels dumb.\nthe map is also really small, which I find meh for a game thats about terraforming a PLANET.  Satisfactory can be annoying when you have to spend 2 hours just building a tube system to cover a long distance, but you can really feel the scope of the planet.  I can get to one end of the map to the other with minimal hassle in 15 minutes.  Maybe its less about the exploring then the base building, but the base building is steps below other games of its type.  You can be creative in your building, but there is nothing that makes building sit right on weird terrain.

I understand that Subnautica is a very different game, but these two games share many of the same goals. Both focus on exploration, on intense resource management, and the impact/cohesion of your actions (with this game having the entire planet change gradually over time, and Subnautica has a few full-blown quests/story events with some environment changes). Unfortunately, I felt this game fell flat on its face when it came to resource management and exploration. It seems that it gets much more interesting if you sink over a dozen hours into it, but the game just wasn't very fun at all in the early-ish stages of the game for me. \n\nThe entirety of this game is resource management, which unfortunately devolves into cramming resources that are literally copy-pasted everywhere into your relatively small backpack (that does get to a decent size,  only just 4+ upgrades in...) and trudging through the same environments to get the same resources over and over and over. This aspect is improved in multiplayer, as your efficiency is multiplied per player, but that doesn't change how glaringly bland it is. There's not much to really go on about it, which sucks because it's most of what the game offers you as gameplay besides exploring/building. \n\nEnvironments can be interesting, I see some that look pretty cool on the store pages screenshots, but unfortunately, I didn't find that to be the case for most of the time. You will find biomes that have a key feature defining them, but like the approach to resources in this game, much of what I saw were just assets scattered about with ctrl+v. The points of interest in this game felt out of place sometimes, and some are just too samey/lacking in detail to be that interesting. A pretty blunt admission, but I can't really describe it differently. The environments never felt that immersive or convincing with thousands of ores scattered about the entire map, each 1 foot apart waiting for you to stare at it for .5 seconds, paired with eyesore lighting to boot. I felt that presentation is not this games strong suit, with the sole exception being the soundtrack, which does stand out pleasantly.\n\nTo summarize, you might enjoy this game with friends, I was almost capable of it. However, I just found the game too boring and just felt disappointed when i progressed, mined, or explored. I thought to myself that this game is essentially always in creative mode with its lack of urgency or engagement/challenge but it retains the tedium of grinding coupled with the illusion of scarcity included with your extremely limited inventory space and lack of handcrafting. I wanted to like this game. I tried to hamper my expectations as it is an impressively cool project made by only 2 people and its almost as indie as it gets. My point, is that I respect these developers greatly, but I just didn't understand most of the praise for the game.

The game has the potential to have strong game core mechanisms but it still feels very early access. At any point, it doesn\u2019t feel like a fully released game with version 1.0.\n\nPros:\n- The whole world is changing when you are terraforming the planet and you can see it on every single step of your progress. I never had a similar experience with any other game. \n- If you played Subnautica, many mechanisms, gameplay elements and exploration will be already familiar to you.\n- You can build your base (once again: in a similar style as Subnautica)\n- Relaxing gameplay (for the 3 hours of gameplay).\n- Enjoyable exploration.\n\nCons:\n- Very repetitive when you reach midgame. You will still be unlocking new features in this game but the progression will be much slower. I don't mind grinding if the gameplay is interesting but at some point, I started spending most of my time transporting resources from one place to the other. Building and exploration was a much smaller part than it was in the first 2-3 hours of the gameplay.\n- There is no system of connecting electricity. You will get it anywhere from anywhere. Solar panels are working at full power even during the night. Wind will always generate the same electricity, so forget about putting it higher to get more from it. Electricity in this game is just a number like oxygen or the pressure of the atmosphere.\n- There is no additional functionality when you will unlock the next level of mechanisms or your suit improvement. Generated numbers are bigger and it will start to feel like a classic clicker: get bigger numbers to unlock other elements of the gameplay which can generate even bigger numbers. \n- After 4th hour of gameplay, I was putting the same machines next to each other without thinking if it would be a good-looking spot because I knew I would need to remove and build a more effective machine in the future. In the end, I finished with 30 drills standing next to each other, 10 nuclear reactors next to them and also 20 oxygen machines near it. The initial feeling of \"Oh wow, I can't wait to terraform this area with spreading grass everywhere!\" disappeared because in the end, it doesn\u2019t matter if you put all of them next to each other or maybe in each corner of the map. The game doesn\u2019t care at all.\n- Buildings are often wrongly attached or built in the air without any support to the ground. Many times buildings (and iron scaffolding) didn't want to snap properly. Rotating buildings (and all elements in general) is painful.\n- The scale is just ridiculous\u2026 I could build the rocket launchpad with 9 small items and it will be bigger than my whole base. A rocket needs only 6 small items and it's bigger than 6 floors building in my base! 20 small drillers can somehow fully terraform the whole planet to start having water. Yeah, I get it \u201cIt\u2019s a game, just please enjoy it\u201d, however this game is constantly breaking the immersion by such a ridiculous scaling.\n- Crash ships exploration is boring. Almost always it's the same look ship with a bit different layout of rooms and most of the time similar loot.\n- A lot of things are missing proper description/tooltip: if you build the rocket, it will multiply one part of terraforming by 1000% but is it done every single time? I didn't know it till I launched the next rocket. Is it working the same for the GPS rocket? Nope. I didn't know it and I lost a lot of resources to launch the satellite which I already launched in the past. Machines have no information about where you can put them (some oxygen machines you can put only inside the building, some others only outside). There is no information on how big buildings or machines are. Nuclear power plants don't require nuclear fuel to work. I thought the nuclear rod was the fuel for them so I didn\u2019t build them for a really long time till I gathered enough rods.\n- Sometimes you will experience a meteor storm next to you (and your base). They are harmless. I don\u2019t see a point in having them in the game. Many times I was struggling to walk by the base door because the left parts of the meteor blocked it. I couldn't build my machines in specific locations because of that meteor lying in the exact spot.\n- Many QoL functions are behind the progression wall. I can understand preview map can be blocked for the first couple of hours but I don't understand why the function of pin the blueprint needs to be unlocked in the middle of the game. The proper quality flashlight is unlocked in the midgame as well. The first version of it was absolutely awful and I couldn\u2019t see anything during exploration. Really annoying part which fully destroyed the initial exploration of caves and crashed ships.\n- The textures look awful like from the cheap asset game from 2008. Each type of mineral which you will find has got one, single model. I saw my avatar from the third-person perspective and I started laughing. It looks so bad and ugly.\n- The light in this game is working odd. You can stand in one place inside the crashed ship, move one foot and light will start going fully dark. Also, it is animated so it\u2019s working always in the same way. If you build a base with a chemistry room, you will experience a weird light effect: inside the room light will be a bit blue. Step outside the room and the light with immediately change to be normal once again. Same thing with the room where trees can grow: inside? Yellow-ish colour. Step outside the room? Normal colour.\n\nMost of these negative aspects of the game I started experiencing in the first hour of the game but I still wanted to give the game a chance to shine. I couldn\u2019t finish the game because it\u2019s just too boring, not deep enough and feels like a chore.", "timestamp_created": 1713566451, "timestamp_updated": 1713602036, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551284909248352051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162679543": {"recommendationid": "162679543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045295849", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1689373804}, "language": "english", "review": "Nowadays Indie games make way better and more enjoyable games that AAA shit studios.", "timestamp_created": 1712862073, "timestamp_updated": 1712862073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550247251987457275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162604948": {"recommendationid": "162604948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118827565", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 4010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3808, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1713473186}, "language": "english", "review": "More of a thumbs sideways trending down for me.

If you want a (relatively) stress free Builder, don't hesitate to buy this game.\n\nI purchased it a couple of months before the 1.0 launch, which was complete through the \"flora\" metric.  From the time I first launched it, to the end of my run, I was completely addicted.  The game is stunning, fun to explore, incredible to build, and has enough little hidden things to find that it just ticked all the boxes for me.\n\nIf you play in standard mode, in the early game, you can die if you don't manage the survival mechanics required of a barren wasteland, but there is really no penalty, other than having to retrieve all of your dropped inventory. (Nothing is lost, like in some games)    However, if you want more of a challenge, there are many customization options you can make, including permadeath.\n\nGamewise, the upgrades to gear and base building are frequent, and come at a steady pace,   I never felt like I was waiting \"too long\" to get the next improvement.

However, the building components do not snap to this ground, despite them being the same length and width, meaning if you want the base to look smart, you had to place it, walk around, check you did it right, deconstruct it if you didn't, then try your luck again.\n\nIt allows you to \"chain constructions\" but doesn't tell you what that means. As far as I can tell, it means you can place 2 down in a row... then you have to reselect it if you want more. Very odd.\n\nThe game starts with toggle run turned off, then doesn't tell you that you can run. I'm playing on controller, so I honestly thought I was just slow at running for an hour before I unlocked boots and realised that nothing improved. Only after looking at the controls did I realise the game wants you to hold L to run.\n\nSpeaking of which, the gamepad controls are a disaster. Whoever designed them clearly is a mouse and keyboard player, because so little thought actually went into them.\n\nTake the crafter as an example. You open it, move to the right, select water, then click build. It then kicks you out of the menu. You then have to reopen it, but the game hasn't remembered your last position in the menu, so you have to scroll to the right again, and repeat.\n\nI got into a loop of doing this, until one time I did it in the wrong order. After getting kicked out of the menu, I pressed right-D, then pressed A... which, of course, deconstructs the crafter machine. Terrible implementation. Why not have people hold down the button to avoid players destroying things by mistake?\n\nWant to put all your objects in a line so they look tidy? Rather than assist you with this, the game makes you do it manually. There is a very small grid, so you CAN achieve this, but again, on a controller, it's a real chore.\n\nThe graphics are bizzare. There's a crashed ship, and the outside is cel-shaded, but everything else isn't. Lighting is faked, so when you enter a dark area, rather than rely on realistic lighting, the screen just becomes darker. Take a few steps back, and things are light again.\n\nThe game gives you ONE warning that you are low on water. If you happened to miss it, then you will die. At the end, a heartbeat sound will start, indicating you have 5 seconds before you die, rather than having that sound for a 30 seconds or so.\n\nThe menus are such a chore. Again, on gamepad, selections are barely highlighted from white to a light blue. Instead, you have to rely on a big square box of text to assume where you're looking.\n\nIf you plan on being efficient, you likely want to have storage dedicated to certain resources. So, if you want to place iron in the iron box, prepare to place each one manually, one by one. Core Keeper, Stardew, etc allow you to press a single button to put everything the same into storage. No idea why this game doesn't do that.\n\nCrafting. The game DOES have a crafter that automatically grabs things and uses it to craft things, but that's later in the game. For the first few hours, be prepared to look at the resource you need, go to each chest in turn to take them, forget what you're looking for, have to check again, then collect the rest, then go back to the crafter and craft them. Why make things fun and simple when you can force people to micromanage?\n\nAt the start of the game, in building my base, I cannot build walls. I can build windows which I can use as walls, but no walls. Also, when I build a large 2x2 square, the game puts a nice large pillar in the middle of my room. Honestly, this just screams \"I don't know what I'm doing\" or \"I can't be bothered to do it\" from the devs. Weird, to say the least.\n\nAfter playing the game for a couple hours, my daughter and I quickly got bored of having to eat and drink. Want to turn it off? Tough! You need to start a whole new game!!! WOO!!!\n\nI could go on, but I'm boring myself here. Basically, I can't think of a single thing this game excels at. It does everything just slightly worse than one would expect.\n\nUsually, when people improve a game design or system, people take that and improve it further. If this game was made 10 years ago, I probably would think it was good, but at the moment, everything feels dated.\n\nAs it stands, if this game out today on early access, I'd think it has great potential.

At time of writing this, there is a little bit of an amateurish feel in regards to certain aspects of the game, which could either be considered part of the charm, although some might not like it.\n\nPlanet Crafter is an enjoyable and, on standard, there's no real pressure to achieve certain milestones. The game focuses more on exploring than full base building from my experience. The general game loop seemed to be: explore/gather resources, potentially unlock something useful, return, add a couple of buildings then rinse and repeat. So breaking down this game loop:\n\n[h2]The Exploration[/h2]\n\nPros: \n- Basically every direction from where I landed had something to explore or catch my eye\n- Without spoiling anything, there starts to be a bit of intrigue in regards to things you find on the planet\n- Exploring often helps gather more complex items that you could create, but are often easier to find in new areas, encouraging you to do so\n\nCons:\n- Travelling around and gathering stuff can get a little frustrating at times, it takes a long time to get to certain destinations and even if you make a small stop point or second base, you eventually need to ferry your items to your main base anyway. I understand that it helps fill the time while the machines at your base terraform but towards the mid-late game it was getting a little frustrating even with the best backpack, jetpack and exoskeleton for that part of the game.\n- Certain areas felt a little rough to explore due to a certain messiness with how some of the areas seemed to be put together, a few areas felt particularly unpolished\n\n[h2]Base Building[/h2]\n\nPros:\n- You can start building your base within 5 minutes of starting the game with minimal instructions\n- Destroying and creating buildings return and use the same amount of materials, meaning you can easily undo a mistake without losing anything, or even upgrade and get all the materials back\n- Power is distributed over the entire planet, so you don't have to worry about wiring things together which simplifies things greatly\n\nCons:\n- For a good portion of the game, I seemed to need so many of the largest storage available to me at the time. It did eventually become clear that I'm supposed to destroy some items (more on that later. This meant that I spent a lot of time expanding my base and trying to build more storage to handle all the items I had to store for later parts\n- Building can feel a little janky. There's this \"extend\" or \"link\" option that is helpful for expanding a base while inside but you can't actually see what orientation it's at for parts that care about that, or how it sits in the world making the feature a little annoying to use at times.\n- The deconstructor sometimes highlights the wrong thing, fortunately it can't deconstruct things with things in it but I've almost deconstructed a living quarter when trying to remove a thing inside it a couple of times\n\n[h2]Gameplay/Progress[/h2]\n\nPros:\n- The world changes as you terraform it which gives you a good sense of progression. It also means you gain access to new areas to explore as well as a few shortcuts between areas, meaning that the terraforming aspect of the game feeds into the exploration and vice versa\n- The game provides you with hints as the game goes on, some a little more subtle than others (such as it's a good idea to build your base at higher altitude) which means if you don't figure something out eventually then it'll let you know a little clearer but if you have figured it out, you pretty proud of yourself.\n- Unlocking drones later on in the game feels like a major turning point and progression felt very fast after that point, I also felt more free to build up my base and less like I had to go out and pick stuff off the ground.\n\nNeutral:\n- Balancing on standard at least seems to lean a little more heavily towards casual as very little things you do aren't undoable, the recycle machine is great but it does feel a little odd being able to recycle water into ice, or a tree into a plant and some mutagens.\n\nCons:\n- This isn't a huge con but progress feels like it comes in bursts, there are some periods in the game where I feel like I am just waiting to hit the next milestone. This might be because I was playing the game wrong but I was using similar strategies for all the resources and some felt like they were zooming ahead while others felt like they were lagging behind in progression\n- The game has very few buttons to press, which is fine, but it does mean that certain buttons are doing quite a bit, namely left click. Left click is use (in world), pickup/mine, construct, deconstruct (based on tool). This resulted in a few cases where I accidentally deconstructed something I wanted to use because the tool was wrong, or constructing something when I wanted to use some stairs. \n- It's not 100% obvious (perhaps I missed it) what one of the tools does, it looks like a light but left clicking doesn't do anything as there's a specific toggle light key.\n- The graphics are somewhat lacking, as are the animations. Pop-in is common and dramatic. I've got a pretty modern machine and I'd occaisionally have the game pause as it pops in a bunch of assets.\n- Certain Physics are wonky or felt like they were unnecessarily added. For example:\n  - rockets have physics attached to them, meaning that they sometimes fall over or behave weirdly but still function mechanically,  just acting as an obstacle. They should just be an animation going up (and down in the case of one).\n  - You fall faster in some situations if you activate your jetpack, in a very backwards form of logic.\n  - When meteors land, they produce a bunch of annoying physics objects that you cannot do anything about save for wait for them to despawn so you can either move past them (if they end up inside your base) or grab the items inside them.\n\n\n[h2]UI[/h2]\n\nNot doing pros and cons here. The UI is relatively minimal but generally felt slightly clunky. All inventories do feature a sort button which is nice to see as many games don't have one. There's 2 pages of progression trees and going up and down each section them felt a little clunky and to a certain extent wasteful on space.\n\nSome of the machines have subpar interfaces. A few machines have a screen for recipes and then a screen for actually using the recipes, which felt the most clunky, and seemed to be so that the various interfaces could be reused (as seemed to be the case for one of the screens that even has the wrong machine name.\n\nSeveral aspects of the UI are locked behind upgrades (map, compass, pinning recipes, hiding old recipes) which I'm not against. Certain parts can also be improved further by finding better blueprints or building rockets. \n\nThe map, however, is awful. It looks stretched and distorted and allows you to move out of bounds, peeking behind the curtain a little. You're not marked on the map from what I can tell either, and it is probably the most amateur looking things in the game. So much so that I actually generally avoided using the map.\n\n[h2]Overall[/h2]\nI know it looks like I've put quite a few more cons than pros, but I am being a nit-picky. It's a game I've thoroughly enjoyed playing even with a few pain-points. I think there are some aspects of the game that could do with a little more love, or attention and some parts of the game do feel half baked, but the core gameplay has been very fun.", "timestamp_created": 1713551665, "timestamp_updated": 1713552292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528234422206878662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163115981": {"recommendationid": "163115981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062696569", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 108, "playtime_at_review": 1770, "last_played": 1713459666}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Planet Crafter feels like an idle game with extra steps[/h1]\r\n\r\nI want to like Planet Crafter, I really do, but Planet Crafter does not respect the player's time. Automation isn't unlocked until you're 20+ hours in. Almost all of my ~30 hour playtime has been walking resources from point A to point B or fiddling with my inventory. There are brief moments of levity when I get to do some base-building or get to walk somewhere [i]without[/i] needing to sprint as fast as possible to ferry items. And in those moments the game is genuinely enjoyable; the execution of watching terraforming happen in stages is gratifying and well done. Unfortunately, those bits are few and far between. Most of your time will be spent hauling a handful of items at a time on five-minute jaunts between your farms and hub.\r\n\r\nI do like inventory management, when that mechanic [i]matters[/i]. Inventory management does not matter in Planet Crafter. At the time of writing there are no hostile mobs, and the environment is a non-threat. Time and danger are not constraining factors, so my \"choice\" to bring X or Y items don't impact my gameplay beyond drastically extending the time it takes to do anything [i]agnostic of my choices[/i] after the point where the atmosphere becomes breathable. \r\n\r\nThis game desperately needs a beacon-type item that allows the player to build or craft using the inventory of any structure within the beacon's radius while the player is near that beacon. If Planet Crafter wants to utilize a logistics system, it should draw on the models of successful logistics titles like Factorio and Satisfactory. Those games give the player HUGE inventories because building the thing that makes you not have to move stuff around shouldn't require so much running around that you question the cost-effectiveness of building that system in the first place.\r\n\r\nFood and water are needs that could be considered 'constraining factors,' but they're so trivial it would be an insult to put them in that taxonomy. Yes, your hunger and thirst bars drain quickly, but those resources are also easy to come by. The food/water mechanics feel like a waste of my time that breaks my immersion every ten minutes-- this is to say, they feel like Phantoms in Minecraft. This isn't a challenge, it's just annoying, and doubly so given most of this game at 30 hours has been ferrying resources. Food and water makes you have fewer inventory slots to ferry other items.\r\n\r\nTooltips are lacking. There's a lot of items that, when you unlock them, you'll have to search every machine to figure out which one crafts them and then just remember that bit of information. This is, IF you've even unlocked the thing you need to craft that item yet. The game is not good about only giving you items after you've unlocked prerequisites. The wiki is also pretty out of date, even on items released several updates ago.\r\n\r\nThere's also a bunch of machines that have variable outputs depending on which item you put in. E.G: Different species of butterfly make the butterfly spreader output more or fewer insects per second. This is well and good until you find or create a better species and then have to track down in the world, by memory, where that structure that needs changing is. Clumping a bunch of 'spreader' structures together tanks your framerate as these structures create a bunch of visual noise that's fantastic to look at, but creates performance issues in dense quantity. This gives the player conflicting incentives to space 'spreader' structures out for performance reasons, and to place them closer together so you don't have to do more tedious walking to find and replace obsolete parts.\r\n\r\nIt's cool, but there's way too much tedium. Playing Planet Crafter feels like playing an idle clicker game where you're performing the same numbing actions waiting for a number to go up in service of that brief moment when you can play the actual game.

I think with some modifications and updates it could be a truly great game \n\nFirst some positives. I think the early/mid gameplay loop is fun and well done\nThe transition the world take as grass and trees grow is truly remarkable and probably my favorite thing in the game\nI like using the keys to unlock doors and finding little snippets of lore! (I just wish there was more!)\nThe wrecks look incredible and are really fun to explore\nThe movement is great and helped keep the game at a faster pace\n\nAs a note I definitely didint play the game optimally, these are just thoughts on how an average player is going to have an experience, not a min max run.\n\nSome Suggestion on the off chance a dev reads this\n\nI really loved the timers you placed with this such as ice blocking your way until its melted. The only problem is that with either jumping or jetpacking you can often reach areas long before youre meant to.

The building system and all of its rooms is really good, but basically impossible to build anywhere on the ground. Fixing this would greatly improve being able to build non floating bases\n\nLate game pacing needs some work. i played until about the tree/Larva era. Until that point I felt that upgrades were well placed and I constantly had motivation to build new things and move forward, however at around tree/larva era it felt like things slowed down dramatically. We had explored basically the entire map, the best thing we could do was build more of the same machines which gets boring after a while. I think a great fix is perhaps add some automation to the late game unlocks. Let me transport water and food into chests. Let me pipe materials from far away drill back to my base. This would keep the player engaged enough that theyll actually make it to the late game. The late game looks so cool! Except ill likely never see it because I dont really feel like waiting around.\n\nRockets could be more clear on their value, should I send up 1? and many as I can? Do they stack? things like this would help clarity.\n\nI mentioned above how I liked the story points and and little tidbits of lore but I just wish 1. there was more and 2.  it was a little more clear where these places are, a lot of the ones we found are really tucked away under cliffs and while I understand wanting your players to explore, the map is large enough it get boring really quick just searching.

The dissonance happens when you realize the interconnected systems are not really connected at all and just contribute to an abstracted terraforming score. Improvements _do_ unlock in the different tech-trees, but the overall rating is still the most important thing. Combine this with things like summoning huge meteors _into your base_ which does nothing more harmful than create some debris you cannot walk through, isolated rooms being able to supply you with oxygen (in fact, you don't really need to produce oxygen at all, it is better and more convenient to build a \"hut\" than carry a bottle of O2), drawn out late-game and uninspiring lore; and you end up with a mediocre game.\n\nThat said, I do understand why the abstractions were made and I overall had my fun with the game.

As of writing this review, I have 100% completed the game, getting every achievement and finding everything in the game. My aim with this review is to critique the game itself and inform those unsure of whether they'll like this game.\r\n\r\nA brief summary of the game: The Planet Crafter is a game about terraforming a barren wasteland of a planet into something habitable. It is a peaceful survival game, meaning there are no hostile creatures that attack you. The only things that can kill you are your hunger, thirst, a lack of oxygen, and your own stupidity. You build machines to terraform the planet and explore to scavenge for resources to build said machines. You can automate this process later on. It's for a pretty specific niche, but that doesn't make it any better or worse.\r\n\r\nI'll start with the good bits. The game is very chill and relaxing. No threats means once you have a reliable source of food and water, you can live forever. This also lets you take as long as you want to complete the game, which is really appreciated. Because of automation being an option later in the game and a very forgiving oxygen system, you'll never have to pick up and move your whole base for convenience, meaning you can live in one spot for the entire game and never be massively inconvenienced. You can do that, but you don't have to. The last good bit I want to point out is the simplicity of everything. Many large-scale survival games fall into the trap of \"You have to go here to get this thing, now you have to go there to get that thing, now you have to go all the way across the map to get that thing\", while this game mitigates that impressively well. There is still a decent amount of travelling and exploring to be done, however the mandatory amounts are relatively small and don't make it feel as atrocious as some other games do. This is in large part thanks to the game's various speed upgrades making your run speed extremely fast by the game's end and thus making traversing the quite large world feel very quick and like a quick, in and out, 20 minute adventure.\r\n\r\nNow's the point where I bring up the unfortunately large number of complaints with the game I have. As I said in the opening, I've been playing this game since early into early access, and I've seen it grow and evolve. However, not everything has grown and evolved in good ways. I'm going to have to break this up into a few sections because it's a long list.\r\n\r\nThe single biggest problem is the game's frame rate. My laptop can run Hearts of Iron IV and Minecraft at at minimum 60 FPS, however it struggles to get above 30 here quite often. Simply walking around trees is enough to tank the frame rate from the 60 I can get to around 20. Why this is the case, I don't know, but I blame poor optimisation.\r\n\r\nNext biggest issue is the graphics. During EA when I got the game, my first thought was \"Kinda simplistic and crappy UI, terrain looks kinda bad, but those are prolly just growing pains\". Now I can say that they were unfortunately not growing pains. The UI isn't bad but it could be significantly better, and the terrain textures are still pretty ugly. I get that it's supposed to go from barren to lush, but the \"lush\" textures just look plain gross in many places. My other graphical complaint is the fog. When there's fog at all, your vision goes from infinite to near-sighted. You can't even see 2 feet in front of you.\r\n\r\nNext up is the progression speed. In the early stages, you would gather resources and practically fly through terraformation goals. Closer to the end, however, it takes HOURS to make even a few percentage points of progress to the point that a friend of mine and I just left the game on while we watched YouTube because there was nothing left to do. I get that you can just place more machines and whatnot to speed it up, but that circles back around to the frame rate issues. Placing things just tanked the frame rate further, and I was already sick of the PowerPoint presentation. It doesn't help any that making larvae is the single most annoying thing in the game and yet they're vital to pretty much anything late-game.\r\n\r\nNot as big but still a complaint is that the ground is still so unpolished and easy to break through that the devs left the F4 un-stuck button in the game in 1.0. You'd think they'd fix it up, maybe add some invisible walls so you can't just use the jetpack to completely break the game wide open, but no, you can still go literally anywhere if you wiggle with the jetpack in the right way, and you can just fall through the floor if you do the wrong thing in the wrong place. I didn't even know how F4 worked until I fell through the floor and got stuck inside a building. Had to use it to get out and now I can see just how abuse-able that button is. Shouldn't need to be in the game post-1.0.\r\n\r\nLastly, and I'm sad I have to say this, but the endings are awful. A few shots of the planet and some text on the screen just feels like a slap in the face to the 50+ hours I put into this save file (my other 10 were other files). I was so excited to finally see the ending to this game that I've loved for so long, but that was just... disappointing. They're all achieved in the same way but with very, very minor differences and just different text on the screen.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I want to say that I love this game. I really do, flaws and all. I love it because it's the kind of game I always wanted to make. I always wanted to make a game where you survive on an alien planet and build up your base/the planet itself and eventually leave it. The whole experience was almost what I wanted, but its problems just sadden me to an honestly upsetting extent. I want to recommend this game so much more, but I just can't.

Yes, I enjoyed my 50+ hours with the game, but I feel like you definitely get diminishing returns on your investment as time goes on. You see the sky slowly turn blue, that's cool. Lakes start to form, that's awesome. Now you've got green grass and vegetation, that's pretty neat. But what should arguably be the most exciting part of the game, creating wildlife, just falls completely flat, and the entire biomass stage of game seems to actively work against itself. Eventually, the big numbers getting bigger no longer engaged my primitive monkey brain, and the grind began to set in. I had discovered all the biomes, fully explored all of the wrecks (not counting the 'distant wrecks', which were little more than procedurally generated instances), and was very happy with my base and automation setup. I've got to extend quite a bit of grace to Miju games, because what they've accomplished with such a small team is truly remarkable. That being said, the game lacks quite a bit of technical polish. The game isn't great looking, the lighting is completely broken (your flashlight either does nothing or the resulting bloom blinds you), and you can easily clip through pretty much any part of the map, and the performance for such a basic-looking game is quite bad.

It has online co-op and you can play solo. I've done both, and both are great, although it does seem that you progress a lot faster with co-op than alone, which could be seen as good or bad depending on how quickly you want to progress.\r\n\r\nThe game looks and sounds great, the controls all make sense and feel good. The most important thing in any game is a solid foundation of the basic stuff like visual appeal, sound design, and movement. They're all exceptional here. \r\n\r\nBeyond that basic foundation you've got quite an unique and compelling game here. I've seen a lot of people compare to subnautica and I get that, but I'd say that it's also so different from subnautica that the comparison isn't really that close once you get past the surface level of the two games. \r\n\r\nThis is a game where exploration, crafting, base building, and looting take turns. You always have a bunch of stuff you can be doing, and yet you never feel like you've got anything you NEED to do. What I mean by that is that the game really lets you play it how you want to. You can focus on exploration and ignore everything else. You can focus on terraforming, or building and crafting. You will eventually have to do about equal parts of all of it, but the game doesn't force you to play it one way. Progress is locked by new technologies and sometimes by discovering locations in the world. Technologies are mostly locked by hitting certain terraforming goals like a certain amount of heat, pressure, oxygen, etc.\r\n\r\nThis game is big. This game is fun. This game doesn't hold your hand, but it does teach you what you need to know to enjoy it and do what you need to do in the game to progress. \r\n\r\nIf you're considering playing for solo, go ahead. I have over 30 hours in solo and enjoyed every minute of it. It's more like playing subnautica in that you're all alone on a whole planet you need to discover. If you enjoy that idea, then you literally cannot do better than this game. There's nothing like it. I wish there was something like it because someday I'll want another game like this, but it stands alone, much like subnautica.\r\n\r\nIf you want to play co-op, I'd argue it's even more fun than solo, which is impressive considering just how fun the solo experience is in this game. That said, you will progress quite a bit faster co-op, and you may unlock a landslide of new tech in the first 4 hours or so of gameplay. It can get overwhelming, but luckily there are screens you can build to check and manage every single thing if the game if you want to, so it's just a matter of looking at a few screens at any given moment to know everything going on in the game, what you could be working on next, what's going to unlock soon, how the power is looking for your base, etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, so basically you explore, loot, build a base, and create new technologies. You have a clearly defined goal always for terraforming the mars-like planet you live on in the game. As you progress, you get to make bigger, more impressive, and more impactful changes on the planet. It just gets cooler and cooler as you play.\r\n\r\nOne thing people love about Subnautica is the sense of wonder and scope you feel on your first playthrough as you explore the alien world. Planet Crafter has a similar yet different vibe. You feel a sense of wonder and accomplishment from the way you CHANGE the world. In Subnautica, it's about exploration, survival, and the story. In The Planet Crafter, it's about exploration, a bit of survival, the story, but mostly it's about changing a dead planet into a healthy thriving planet. And that is a HUGE difference between the two games.\r\n\r\nI've never felt anything like I've felt while playing this game. There's nothing cooler than watching a red-orange Mars-like sky of dust and death and meteor storms turn into a blue sky with clouds, rain, and eventually living creatures flying around. Each step is slow and takes a lot of work, so you really feel a sense of accomplishment when you see your sky turn blue, or your first rainfall, etc. All of the changes are gradual too, so you can see the sky slowly changing on its way to blue, or you can see a dry riverbed starting to pool a bit of water as it slowly becomes a river again. \r\n\r\nThere's magic in this game, and sadly I rarely get to describe a game that way. I also have absolutely no complaints about this game, something I also sadly hardly ever get to say. I highly recommend you play it, even if it seems like it won't be your kind of game. You might be surprised. \r\n\r\nI've got a lot more playing to do yet in this game, but I can already say it's in my top 10 of all time, and that's saying something considering all the games I've played since the 1980s when I got started in gaming. \r\n\r\nJust ask yourself if you're interested in the idea of transforming a dead planet into a living one, exploring it, and discovering...some things I won't mention because they would spoil both the story and the surprise but they're great. Do you like building a cool base? Do you want to play a game that rewards you at a deep level for the time and effort you put in, while being really fun all the time anyway? This may be the game for you.\r\n\r\nI truly feel sorry for anyone who enjoys games and never plays this.", "timestamp_created": 1713400071, "timestamp_updated": 1713400071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163064795": {"recommendationid": "163064795", "author": {"steamid": "76561199249045884", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 2009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2009, "playtime_at_review": 672, "last_played": 1713765892}, "language": "english", "review": "loving this so far.... i wasnt sure i was gonna, but I am pleasantly surprised!!

It is kinda slow, but maybe it's supposed to be like that. \r\nAnyway, I definitely had my portion of fun, recommend to any fan of this genre.\r\n10 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1713370348, "timestamp_updated": 1713370348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163050471": {"recommendationid": "163050471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100497277", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 956, "playtime_at_review": 714, "last_played": 1713466594}, "language": "english", "review": "PSA: Planet Crafter is very fun, but if you play the demo DO NOT continue your save file after buying the game. You will be ineligible for achievements. If you like the demo, just start fresh immediately when playing the full game. Don't realize 12 hours into the game like I did.....\n\n-------------\n\nThat specific gripe aside, Planet Crafter has been an enjoyable experience for me personally. The game starts simple like most survival games, with the usual collectathon into basic base building, but then on top of that, Terraforming works idly in the background with satisfying scaling and incremental upgrades that in many ways remind me of an idle game, but with an actual game to play in the foreground that's genuinely fun to play. I know that's a weird way to put it, but that's the only way I can think to phrase my thoughts.\n\nTo put into perspective how much I have enjoyed the core gameplay loop of Planet Crafters: I played 12 hours yesterday not realizing it had been more than 3. This morning, I woke up to play more, then realized I hadn't been getting any achievements. After a little trial and error, I discovered that that's because I had started with my demo save file, and the only way to get achievements was to start fresh -- losing those [b]twelve hours[/b] (technically 11.9, but still) of progress. Normally, that would be the point where I put down a game for good, however Planet Crafter's core loop is so fun that even though I was in the mid-to-late game (I think), I'm totally okay with resetting and doing it all over again with the only benefit being the knowledge I have from the first time 'round.\n\n[b]Try the demo[/b]: the only thing you have to lose is a little bit of your time, and the potential gain of enjoying this game is tremendous.", "timestamp_created": 1713368140, "timestamp_updated": 1713368253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163048117": {"recommendationid": "163048117", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976537801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4422, "playtime_at_review": 5236, "last_played": 1713504689}, "language": "english", "review": "The Planet Crafter can be a relaxing open world crafting experience with a polished base building feature and an interesting planet to explore.

The map is a decent size but traveling around collecting resources can take awhile. \n\nThis game would benefit greatly from some sort of transportation vehicle.\n\nIf you're a fan of Subnautica, the base building is the most similar feature and you'll find maintaining your oxygen to be quite similar in the beginning of the game.\n\nAnother review mentioned that this game is a budget Satisfactory, which is really only a hit on the graphics. They're pretty different games and I find Planet Crafter to offer a higher reward and drive. \n\nAnyways, fun to play casually and funner with friends.

Also can't vouch for coop features since I played pure solo.\n\nThe Planet Crafter is, at its core, an incremental game masquerading as an open world survival craft game. You are a convict sentenced to terraform the planet you land on, and to do this, you are to raise the oxygen, heat, and pressure levels of the planet. As you do, you unlock more things to craft, many of which help you terraform faster. Repeat until you unlock everything, at which point you have the opportunity to choose one of three endings for your run, provided you've met the prerequisites.\n\nSeeing the planet change and new paths open (and some old ones submerge) as you reach different terraforming levels is super satisfying, and this happens a few times over the course of a playthrough.\n\nThe biggest complaints I have about TPC is that pop-in is noticeably bad, base building feels finicky at times, random events are super annoying (i.e. meteors targeting the player and the subsequent debris taking forever to despawn, torch chip being useless during night cycles), the lategame gameplay loop is extremely repetitive with lategame wrecks being particularly bad offenders... but despite all that, TPC is incredibly fun and chill (on standard difficulty, at least) for the majority of the game.\n\nFinally, at the time of writing, there is not much reason to replay the game (the planet's topography is the same between playthroughs), but I still felt like I got my money's worth from a single playthrough.

I first started playing this game a week after the launch of early access, and I expected it to be very early access, buggy, crashes etc. I was surprised that it was the most stable early access game I had ever played, and with very low spec requirements. Since that time ive played on and off, coming back for big updates, and even playing hardcore. This game is extremely difficult at the start, and extremely relaxed at the end, so it fills that role of a chill game while also having challenge. \r\n\r\n1.0 released last week, and I just finished the game officially an hour ago. I was underwhelmed by the ending, both plotwise and because im so used to games with big fancy cutscenes and a credits screen. Then I thought, how would a credits page work for a game with only 6 people working on it (and the bulk of the development just 2 people). And in that context, I could excuse not having a triple A level ending, because ultimately, the plot and the story are very loose and weak, because they don't need to be a big thing. \r\n\r\nSo without a story, im left to dwell on what this game does absolutely phenomenally well. Gameplay. I need to make a note for the music here which is great. Visually, this is a unity game, visuals aren't the main focus. The main gameplay loop is not as repetitive as other similar games, and there is a big feel of progression.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you what that progression takes the form of. I was playing through the game, getting my terraforming index up, and improving my base. But I was aware I was on the cloud stage. Then it started to rain when I was working on my base. I didn't take any notice of it at first, but then I stopped and realised, it's raining. Raining for the very first time on this planet, and it was all down to me. The next moment like that was seeing small lakes start to form. This game has so many special moments like that and no game ive ever played has a more impactful changable environment as this game. This is one of the game's real selling point. When you weigh up things this game does well and things that could be better, most if not all of the things that could be done better would need a much larger team and budget to do so. \r\n\r\nI want to leave this review to say I give this game a 10/10.

Well, the game is basically separated into two parts: Idle and Exploration.\r\n\r\n[h1]Idle[/h1]\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the game is \"make numbers go up\". There is no way around this: You want the numbers to go up (Pressure, Temperature and Oxygen in the beginning, other numbers later) and once you have set up the corresponding infrastructure, they keep going up in a steady rate. No need to insert coal into generators or anything like that. You build a thing that generates power, you build a thing that increases pressure - congratulations, now your pressure increases at a steady rate. The trick is that things keep getting unlocked. Let's say you generate 1 oxygen, pressure and temperature per second (don't worry about the units). Once you reach 100 oxygen, you now get a thing that generates 5 pressure/second! Cool, let's build that!\r\nThen you reach 1000 pressure and you get a thing that generates 100 temperature/second. Build that and once you reach 5000 temperature you get a thing that generates 40 oxygen/second, once you reach 4000 oxygen you unlock the next pressure thing...and so on, and so on, round and round it goes. Exponential growth goes brrrrr.\r\n\r\nThe thing is - you need resources to actually BUILD those things. No resources ever get used up, you can always reclaim everything (well, everything that doesn't respawn anyways), but you NEED them to climb up the exponential ladder. For that you need...\r\n\r\n[h1]Exploration[/h1]\r\n\r\nA big part of the game is exploring the world and collecting the stuff you need to build up your base. And that part is very fun as well - the biomes change things up nicely, you keep finding stuff you did not expect and the best thing - while you are away, the numbers back at your base keep ticking up (there's that idle game component!). And as one expects you keep unlocking and building stuff that makes exploration easier (faster travel, more oxygen, more inventory space...).\r\n\r\nWhat the game lacks (after the 6 hours I played so far) is automation. Playing it with friends is therefore recommended because that makes the game a lot easier for sure - if you enjoy exploring and bring back a lot of stuff your friend can use that to build up the power grid while you set up more plants to grow, for example. When exploring big crashed ships you halve the time you need to haul all that good loot back to base.

Everything else will require you to scavenge for metals across the planet's surface and use your crafting machine to gear up and build a base for you to breathe oxygen in. Inside, you can build chests and certain machines to help you with the terraformation process. Every time you reach a certain milestone, you unlock more blueprints and the means to terraform the planet even further.\n\nWhen you reach terraforming milestones, you will see the subtle changes in the world as new resources and worldwide shortcuts reveal themselves to you in the form of ice melting in caves and roots growing to pave new pathways. Once new areas are available, that means new resources will be accessible for you to gather and new wreckages will be made available for you to find special loot in.\n\nAs somebody who played Slime Rancher, this sorta scratches that same itch for me, alongside the Astroneer-like I've always wanted. I like seeing progress and unlocking things while having a clear goal to meet, so whenever I finally meet those goals, find resources to craft vital materials, and find brand new things in the world that will help me further, I get that small dopamine rush in me to keep on going.\n\nThis game is great for what it's designed to do, even though the map and movement still has a bit of rough jankiness to it. I only recall getting seriously stuck once, but the game gives you an \"Unstuck Button\" as a bit of a patchwork solution to that problem. Every now and then, you'll see the seams of land and water surfaces where they shouldn't be visible, but if you're in a hurry everywhere you go, you can easily look past it.

If you want to work with literal scientific nuances that would be involved in terraforming a planet, this isn't the game for you.

Falls behind other games in the genre, maybe even the bad ones.\n\nBuilding is practically impossible since there's no snapping until you build one little square building. You can't place them nicely on foundations, and if you put them on the ground they're going to collide with a hill the moment you want more than one square. It also seems there's just little squares, no larger prefabs or modular buildings, so you'll just end up with a grid of squares.\nThere's no power network concept at all. Make some wind turbines, throw them down anywhere on the planet, they power your base a hundred km away.\nFood is not obtainable until a decent amount of time passes. You can find it in chests placed around the world. There's no way to restore your hunger meter unless you go scavenging for a few hours at the start of the game. At least Subnautica let you eat random fish.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, oxygen doesn't need to be managed at all. If you bring enough resources to build a box house you can quickly place it down and restore all your oxygen. Because there's no power network.\nProgression is kind of confusing. You can't build the things that increase the temperature of the planet until you go scavenging, and you can only make one thing that increases oxygen before you go scavenging. Have I mentioned the game never tells you that it wants you to seek out wrecks?\nInventory. Oh my god. There's no stacks so you'll fill your inventory with singular units of random useless ores. Ores are also just scattered around on the ground. You don't get them from deposits or anything, just pick up the enormous amount of native nuggets this planet has lying around. There's also chunks of ice. On the surface of the barren desert planet.\nEquipment, for some reason, has limited slots that can be upgraded by equipping a piece of equipment that gives you more equipment slots.\nTerraforming progress is essentially a timer sped up by building more heaters and drills and whatnot. I don't really mind this personally, since I've played Dyson Sphere Project - but I must mention there's not really any optimization going on here like there might be in that game. Just build more, they basically run for free. Throw them in a random spot you never look at again because there's no power network.\n\nThere was a positive review that said this game felt like playing Minecraft for the first time, and I have to say I agree.

I do like it though and am excited to see it through.  The world is pretty as it advances.  I really like how calming it can be in the forests I created or watching the fish under water.

I use a controller and it's not fully usable for the build and inventory screen.  When I switch over to using the keyboard, it can lock and I have to reopen it.

The crafting, base building, food, oxygen and watering systems are all directly lifted from Subnautica and play at similar levels of difficulty (from chilll to moderately difficult).  Where the games differ is the playing experience.  In Subnautica the world is handcrafted with distinctly different bases to discover, technology scraps to find and a mystery to solve.  In Planet Crafter there is no discovery or suspense.  Your goal is clear from the start - to terraform the planet.  The tech tree is laid out in full from the beginning and progress is made by grinding out production machines that will build a terraforming score.  When the score gets high enough there will be a change (e.g. clouds form) and then its back to the grind.  When the score gets high enough a technology will also unlock for no apparent reason.

It's such a cool game, other than that one detail. \r\n\r\nLike, add in a tier 1 ore extractor right from the start, and a device that pings hidden underground nodes, so it's like a treasure hunt. That would be so rewarding. Then, as you level up the tiers, you can find larger nodes that produce more resources faster.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I highly recommend this game.

It [b]also[/b] plays like Factorio or maybe Satisfactory, with how much you have to build and craft, but don't expect sprawling factories or massive mining plants - all the resources are literally lying around and you have to run and mine them No Man's Sky style.\n\nGraphics are phenomenal, as is performance - I did not expect it to run on max settings with over 60 FPS on an RTX 2060 with so much foliage and water and whatnot. A lot of my idle time was spent just admiring the scenery and whizzing around the world on a jetpack.\n\nSpeaking of jetpack. This currently is [b]the only[/b] mode of transportation in the game with infinite fuel, and as soon as I got it, the game got massively easier. It also got me clipping into a lot of cliffs and weird places, which was also really fun :D I would prefer something like an electric buggy, with the jetpack running on biofuel or something for the sake of balance, but as it's Alpha, it's really not an issue.\n\nWhat I really didn't like, and I hope the devs will fix in the future, is the bad use of scientific measurements as progress bars. Here's a TL;DR.\n\nWhen you reach the (currently endgame) Insect stage (presumably when animal life starts to flourish), your planet has roughly 2 Pascals of atmospheric pressure, some 20 mK (0.02 K) of heat and 10 ppm of oxygen.\nOn their own, these numbers don't say anything, but here's what we have on Earth: 101325 Pascals of pressure, 293 K of temperature and 209460 ppm of oxygen.\nOur planet literally has: [b]an atmosphere 50 thousand times less dense than Earth, close to absolute zero in temperature and oxygen content fit for a vacuum chamber somewhere in a lab[/b]. This is not livable, and makes absolutely zero sense when you look at it from a scientific perspective.\n\nIt also made me laugh a lot, when I saw grass and liquid water outside in what is essentially -273 C (-459.7 F) and no atmosphere to speak of.\n\nAltogether, I recommend it.

I think the price is fair for what you get, but sales are always nice. The game is a mixture between No Man's Sky and Subnautica. [b]Planet Crafter[/b] is relaxing with no enemies or threats (other than keeping water, food, oxygen up.) The end game needs more content, but the game is still a stand-out in the genre for its unique terraforming gameplay. I recommend it but I do have some issues with the game's pacing that I will point out below. *Review will be edited if a content update changes my opinion.*[/i]\n\nThe game is great and as you can see from the reviews, every one agrees. I played the game for just under 40 hours pretty consistently over the past few days and I really enjoyed it but I did get bored in the end-game. For this review I am not going to focus on typical things you see in a review like graphics, story, performance etc. Instead I want to talk about the pacing of the game because for me that is the biggest thing that can be improved upon by the developers. \n\nFirst a few nitpicks/notes (in-case a dev reads this):\n- The game is open world, but not procedurally generated. This is not a problem, but it limits replayability. \n- The music is atmospheric and gets very repetitive quickly. It also does not match the game's tone and I ended up muting it and listening to other stuff. It would be nice to see the music change as the terraforming stages changed.\n- There is much to explore, but travel in this game is a slog until you can build a teleporter or a T3 jetpack. \n- The art/graphics are mediocre compared to other similar games, but it gets the job done.\n- If you launch two rockets in close succession, they crash and its hilarious.\n- The rocks that the asteroids leave behind cause major issues and frustration. They need to vanish after a minute or so, or the players need a tool to remove them. Half the time you can't pick up the materials the asteroids leave behind because they get stuck under the rocks: especially the pulsar asteroids.\n- In the late game you should not have to eat or drink as much as earlier stages. We need upgrades to reduce the tediousness of this process. \n\nNow on to the \"pacing.\" What do I mean by pacing? Pacing to me is how well the game \"flows\" from start to mid-game, and then from the mid-game to the end-game content. In this game there are very distinct stages as the world terraforms and I want to talk about the flow or pacing from going to stage A then to B then to C etc. Note: There may be minor spoilers below.\n\n[b]Early Game[/b]\nThe early game is great and easily the best part of the game. You gather resources, build machines and are excited when new stuff unlocks. You don't want to explore too far yet because oxygen gets consumed very rapidly and there is plenty to build at your base anyways. When you start to see that hint of a blue sky developing, it is a very rewarding feeling. You start to settle in with upgraded gear and many second tier machines. Much of your terraforming kicks into auto pilot for a bit and you can start to explore the world. Your biggest hurdle at this stage is finding and harvesting aluminum which is pretty scarce and getting a super alloy is like a special treasure. You also have to keep the power going and the tier 2 solar panels are pretty pricey. That said, I think the way the game flows at the start is great \"pacing\" for a survival game as you should have to work to keep making progress.\n\n[b]Mid Game[/b]\nThe ice begins to melt and you can start to explore more areas. You find more materials and in certain spots you can get an ore extractor going. By the mid-game the game becomes much easier and you're not starving for things like aluminium, slufur or irridium. You also can launch rockets into space to give you terraformation % boosts at this time and asteroids will fall with materials for you to gather as well. Creating heat and power is a priority as you start to plant grass and flowers around the land. Exploration is easier now and you will find many secret locations, chests, bunkers and all of these places have loot boxes with very high end materials. Transporting everything back and fourth is tedious and a big critique I have of the game at this phase is there is no vehicle. You get a jetpack, but it is not much faster than walking to be honest and I really wish a teleporter was unlocked in this phase. (By the time one unlocks it almost feels like it is not needed anymore.) The game starts to slow down as you come out of the mid game, but the end game is when it really stalls. \n***If a dev reads this: The rocks the asteroids leave behind are too huge and annoying to deal with. They need to vanish quickly so we can harvest what they leave behind. I had a rock block my door and it sucks to have to reload the game to get rid of it.\n\n[b]End Game[/b]\nBy the end game you are waiting for your terraforming numbers to climb, but they do so at a snail's pace. At this point you have access to literally every material. You can mine everything, asteroids dropping materials happen all the time, your farms are going and providing food, and if you've been thoughtful about your base building it will run like a Swiss watch. The problem I have with this phase in the game is you don't get many things unlocked anymore. At this phase you are very self reliant: your base is working, all your machines are going, food and water are no longer sparse, and every thing is just on \"auto pilot.\" I found myself sitting AFK for awhile and watching YouTube because I was getting bored watching terraforming numbers with no unlocks happening. In my opinion, one can only base build for so long - and sure, I can keep building more machines to keep pumping the numbers up, but that game play loops gets pretty stale. That is how I started to feel about the game in the end: I was getting bored. And I don't think more content beyond the oxygen phase will fix this issue. The issue is not content, the issue is the pacing of the game.\n\nSo how do the devs improve this? I think the timelines between terraforming stages need to be compressed with more machines/content for late game to keep us occupied. I also think some of the crafting patterns could be more complex or take more time to gather/create the materials. Resources are beyond abundant and there is nothing the player has to \"work\" for. This way players work a little harder, but not for as long and the payoff will be quicker. I don't think \"rushing\" is the plan here, but we just need more to do so the process can speed up a little. Satisfactory is a great example of a game that has great pacing all the way through from point A to point Z.\n\nIn conclusion it is a great game that you should play if you like this genre. For a small indie dev studio, this game is a massive achievement. It plays super well, not many bugs, and it is relaxing. Again, for me the issue is pacing. I know more content will come and that is great, however I think it takes too long to get from point A to B in this game and then B to C is way longer with not much to do in-between. Sure you can explore, base build and make more of the same machines over and over, but it just gets stale after a bit.\n\nRegardless, I still recommend this title and I will be returning to it when more content drops.", "timestamp_created": 1671646454, "timestamp_updated": 1671665239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 185, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.94015204906463623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112832942": {"recommendationid": "112832942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024975218", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 1779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 670, "last_played": 1653743116}, "language": "english", "review": "This is proof that demos work.

However, the game does have a few drawbacks which should be addressed in future updates. \n\nI have played 58 hours of the game and have just popped my last achievement for 100% and used a controller for the entire time. Well, a mix of m&c and controller. \n\nTo actually get your controller to work in the very first instance, you will need to pause the game at any point, go to the control options and then make sure both your mouse AND controller camera sensitivity is at 100%. Basically just to be sure, move the cursor down and then back and then hit Apply settings and it will work perfectly. \n\nThe game itself will be enjoyable for many people, but particularly for people that like crafting, exploration, base building and enjoy creativity. I do want to underline the fact that in order to progress and in order to knock off each achievement or ultimately, finish the game - you will be manually crafting A LOT. And I mean A LOT. So if that isn't your thing, I wouldn't play this game. I have played No Man's Sky, both Subnautica games and Minecraft to death and this game has much more crafting than any of them IMO.\n\nYou find yourself on a barren planet with no life and just a few basic materials to hand. You are limited with what you can build or upgrade at the start and will progress towards terraforming the planet into a breathable, lush green paradise with water, trees and life. For the first 10 hours, you will be focusing on base building, crafting and upgrading your gear and machines in order to slowly progress through the terraforming stages of the planet. \n\nThis can be enjoyable, it really depends on you and your imagination. As you advance your machines and progress with upgrades and unlocks of certain rarer elements, the terraforming process speeds up and you will start unlocking stages quicker than at the start of the game. \n\nOne of the main drawbacks in my opinion is that there is some really good, fun and enjoyable machines which you unlock very deep into the game which I think should be available much earlier on. As an example, you will eventually unlock what could be full automation using things such as drones and auto-crafters. If you build the base efficiently and in a good location, you could essentially automate your entire operation properly. That would be really cool to watch and will allow you to explore more and focus on other things such as making a brilliant base. But by the time you get to the stage which allows this level of automation, it's end game. There is nothing else left for you to do.\n\nAs a suggestion to the developers, I think that the teleporter and the drones should be unlockable considerably earlier on in the game and require less rare materials. It would make building more enjoyable and will move things along nicely at a better pace. \n\nWith that main drawback aside, I think the gameplay progresses at a reasonably fair pace. It would be great to see some more areas to explore in the future and i would happily play the game again. In fact, I am likely going to start over again and play on the hardest mode now I have all the achievements done and I know how the game works. \n\nThe other minor issues are snapping could be better when building, there could be a little more variety in parts and the rotation of objects could be more free-flowing as opposed to rotating to specific angles.\n\nFor the achievement hunters it is a dead simple one. You just need patience. \n\nPRO TIPS (SPOILERS)\n\nBuild your starting base in the middle of the map. There is a pod which you start at on normal mode. If you look out of the pod and look for a rock formation towards the centre, there is an open area there which is slightly raised above your current level. Build here as you will need to be above water as you progress and your starting pod will be about 20 feet underwater in a lake.\n\nBuild your base 2 or 3 ladders high off of the ground. The reason to do this, is as you progress and you get access to autocrafters, you can build many things under your base which produce food (farms) or honey (beehives) as well as gas, algae (if your base is built slightly over hanging water) and many elements. With a room in your base with lockers stored full of goodies as well as drones on the roof of your base constantly supplying materials, 2 or 3 autocrafters set up in certain segments and radius's in your base can make your life a lot easier. \n\nYou don't need to build rooms or living spaces to place lockers or autocrafters inside. You can just place the foundations down which cost 1 iron and place anything you want on top of them. This will be useful for when you are forced to build miners in specific places away from your base which have materials that are needed and only found in certain areas. \n\nMake and use plenty of rockets to really speed things up. Each rocket type gives a boost of 1000% (10 times) to whatever your current pressure, heat etc is and the effect is planet-wide. This starts getting diminishing returns after about 10 rockets of each type is launched, but very worth it even after that amount. They are key to progression speed, particularly mid-game. \n\nAlways have plenty of water, food and oxygen to hand. \n\nWhen out exploring wrecks, containers and other things, always take the stuff you can't make such as flower or food seeds. And anything else which would be costly or limited for you to build at that point in time. Do not be tempted to take minerals and other materials unless you really do need them as you will have plenty of all materials as you progress. \n\nBe patient and enjoy the game. It is worth the money and puts a lot of bigger budget and AAA games to shame.", "timestamp_created": 1686078562, "timestamp_updated": 1686126230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 151, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.923742413520812988", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117793356": {"recommendationid": "117793356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263901744", "num_games_owned": 3557, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 3086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2583, "last_played": 1658517488}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR  - Fantastic game, some terrible community moderators (at the time of writing)\n\nEDIT:\n\nThere's a big problem with the Planet Crafter community Discord. The moderators are called \"community helpers\" - one of them going by the name \"Princess Luna\". Often, a new player will join the Discord with a valid question, and this Princess Luna will jump in with a sarcastic reply, or a rude reply, or in some cases a completely incoherent reply.\n\nHaving witnessed this a number of times, I mentioned it. Big mistake. I am now banned from the Discord, and most other moderators (with a couple of exceptions) rally around in defense of this one terrible moderator.\n\nIn private, a few people DM'd me to say they had noticed this behaviour before, but can't say anything due to the threat of being banned for speaking up.\n\nIt's always bad for a community to have a dodgy moderator, especially when there's no way of speaking up against them. This is such a pity, as the game is great, but it is going to be marred by the way the community is being run at the moment. Here's hoping things will change. \n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI sent off a detailed email to the developers regarding the Discord issue \u2013 no response and nothing has been done by them. However, one of the good moderators has since unbanned me, and had a word with Princess Luna (apparently not for the first time), resulting in Luna appearing to be on their best behaviour. To me, this isn\u2019t really good enough \u2013 a bad mod needs to be removed completely, as it\u2019s just a matter of time before Luna starts hassling new players again. People should also never be banned for politely questioning a moderator's actions.\n\nI will update this review further if the developers actually do something about some of their mods abusing power. Feel free to join the Discord yourself and check things out, but just be aware that Luna (or any moderator) might decide it\u2019s your turn to be targeted.\n\nEDIT 3: (hopefully the last one - sorry for the massive wall of text - hope it isn't too boring to sit through :) )\n\nI got a friendly but basic reply from the developers. Very nice people, but they obviously don't really understand how to run a Discord server. Essentially, they say they are aware there's an issue with Luna and the Discord in general, but managing a Discord server takes too much time. They will have a word with the moderators, as they want the Discord server to be a friendly and helpful place.\n\nIt's a nice enough email, but I worry that the problem will persist as long as the moderators have been picked simply because they happened to make a few helpful comments in the past. Having a \"talk\" to them will not suddenly make them good moderators :)\n\nThe golden rule should always be this: Be very careful when picking people online to represent you and your game - especially people you don't know personally. Ask yourself \"why do they want to be a moderator, and what skills/personality traits do they have that make them suitable?\" It's a much bigger decision than a lot of developers seem to think.\n\nAnyways, here is my original review, which still stands as a definite \"positive\" review... the game is excellent! :) Thanks for all the review awards - I really appreciate it :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have just spent 40 hours playing Planet Crafter and it\u2019s excellent fun. It\u2019s still in its early stages, and sometimes it shows, but overall it\u2019s a great game.\n\nPlanet Crafter will appeal to gamers who are looking for a more relaxed kind of atmosphere \u2013 there are no hostile enemies and it\u2019s strictly single player. Your time will be spent collecting resources, crafting terraforming equipment and building your base. The base building options are very limited right now, but I can imagine these will improve as time goes on. However, it\u2019s still very satisfying to construct your own complex.\n\nThe progression throughout the game is perfectly balanced, providing just the right amount of challenge. It never feels annoying to farm items, and you get a real sense of achievement as you slowly see the planet\u2019s environment responding to your actions.\n\nTo me, Planet Crafter is a better game in many ways than No Man\u2019s Sky. There's only one map, but because it has been hand-crafted, it feels a lot more satisfying to explore, rather than the same old procedurally generated planets in other similar games. Still, it would be nice if we could choose from multiple planets, or we could go into space. Maybe in future, there could be hand-crafted worlds as DLC?\n\nI played a very early release, and I\u2019m aware there is still a lot of work to be done. However, here are some of my thoughts/ideas/suggestions for the developer:\n\n1) Consider dropping \u201cThe\u201d completely from the name of the game.\n2) When upgrading the backpack, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary to remove it, as this causes things to drop.\n3) There needs to be the option for multiple saves within the same game.\n4) On the screen mapping terminal, when zoomed in, the player should be able to move the screen and scroll around.\n5) The foundation grid\u2019s dimensions don\u2019t match up with the living compartment\u2019s footprints, making it impossible to sit a compartment perfectly on a foundation base.\n6) It should be possible to remove a door and window without deleting the compartment. Currently, you can \u201coverwrite\u201d them with something different, but not remove them.\n7) It should be possible to upgrade the jetpack again to allow for higher flight \u2013 this would help with building, as it\u2019s a bit too low at the moment.\n8) It should be possible to block off internal sections of the living compartments. For example, if you join two large ones together, you should be able to decide which walls are \u201csolid\u201d.\n9) There should be markers on the floor of compartments to help align things when placing lockers. The large compartment does fit six neatly along a wall, but it takes some practice to learn how to do it exactly.\n10) It should be possible to slightly terraform uneven land. Currently, there is no way of knowing if your large settlement will work, as it is only once you have started placing compartments that you find out the land isn\u2019t quite right and the next compartment can\u2019t be placed. Same goes for trees and fixed rocks \u2013 they should be able to be deleted.\n11) It wasn\u2019t obvious to me (until someone told me) that you hold CTRL to keep placing more of the same building items.\n12) The deconstruction tool is currently too dangerous. It is too easy to accidentally delete something you don\u2019t want to delete.\n13) I know the world is still getting expanded, but until an area has been made, it should not be possible to go out of bounds on the map - there are many places where it is possible to wander out into unmade areas. These should be closed off until they are ready.\n14) It should be possible to place the large wall info screens higher on the compartment walls. If you have a table with small screens, and wish to place large screens behind them on the wall, the bottom of the large screen is too low, meaning the info cannot be read behind the screens that are on the table.\n15) The placement of the tree collection point in biodome T2 is awkward. When you come in a door, you either have to turn to the side to collect, or go across the room to the other one.\n16) Seed jars and tree seed jars look too similar. It is easy to get them confused. They should look distinct from each other. For example, maybe instead of them both having a graphic of the seeds in a white container, maybe the tree seed container could be green?\n17) The position of trees cannot be saved by the game, and are regenerated in different positions each time your save is loaded. This is going to be frustrating for people when it comes to planning out their bases.\n18) There's no save confirmation when quitting.\n\nOverall, I would rate Planet Crafter a solid 8 out of 10 in this current early stage, with real potential to hit 10 out of 10 in the future :)", "timestamp_created": 1656425605, "timestamp_updated": 1657120268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 609, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.917537093162536621", "comment_count": 79, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128688918": {"recommendationid": "128688918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064134962", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 797, "last_played": 1671921521}, "language": "english", "review": "Subnautica, without terror.

My first 8 hours ore so were spent getting to the lakes terraformation stage, at which point I realized my base in the starter valley would soon be under water. It's at this point I would typically quit a game from discouragement, realizing all my progress was wasted and being too lazy to move my base. But it only took me a few seconds of deliberation to realize I really wanted to start a new save and do it correctly from initially loading into the new, barren, desolate world.\nI started the new save, made my base on the top of a hill, and the next 32 hours have been on one save. \nWhat does it get right? It provides (what I find to be) a relaxing singleplayer survival game that's about steady progress and steady expansion. For my gaming habits, it strikes the proper balance of chill and engaging that I personally get lost in. (Not physically lost in my surroundings, that stopped at around 20 hrs in) Time passes and the only way I can tell is because the screens indicate my machines are contributing to the total terraformation process number that moves ceaselessly upwards.\nWhat does it get wrong? In my exploration of nearly every corner, I find many objects that are easily clipped through, which has put me in an inescapable void one too many times. Errant geological structures aside, there's a number of issues that are present and irritating, but as the game gets closer and closer to 1.0, I'm sure the building will become more intuitive and flow better. As it stands, there is nearly too much freedom to build, and base pieces are difficult to link together at any angle other than head-on. I haven't yet found a way to repeatedly build one type of base piece, every time I place one I have to re-open the build menu and select the piece again. (This may be user error, but I don't think so. Feel free to let me know if I'm just doing something dumb.)\nWhat about the devs? I don't know anything of the studio or developers, but I appreciate the notes they put in the update logs and they seem to care about their player base, taking small tidbits of feedback and also preserving the vision they have in their heads for the game. In the short time I've been playing, they've added QoL things that do what they intend, improve quality of life and ease little moments of previous frustration.\n\nTLDR; If you like singleplayer survival/crafting with intense focus on exploration and progression, it's worth every penny you spend on it.", "timestamp_created": 1666054086, "timestamp_updated": 1666054086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 146, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911480724811553955", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113324824": {"recommendationid": "113324824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053034593", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1061, "last_played": 1649085474}, "language": "english", "review": "This is obviously early access.

Absolutely recommended :)\n\nThe gameplay resembles \"Subnautica on land\" because you need to explore the game world with its different biomes, you'll gather and grow ressources, craft and build (equipment, bases and different types of machinery). \n\nLater on you can even dive into large lakes, (albeit currently without underwater plants), plus just like Subnautica, the game is not providing you with actual quests other than the tutorial tasks (no rewards for those) and is not really telling any story to follow (so far), instead you'll find messages that others (NPCs) have left here and there with a bit of a background story.\n\nYour task of terraforming a planet is really unique though, and that's why I'm in love with Planet Crafter :) \n\nIt's awesome to behold how the look of the barren desert game-world changes into a beautiful green scenery with blue sky, all caused by the work of your own hands. \n\nIt's really cool to watch how the lakes fill up, how the ice melts, the water level rises (and rises, rises, and then rises even more!), how the yellow-orange sand slowly turns into green \"moss\", how grass tufts start to sprout, how algaes start to form around your growers on the water, grass and beautiful flowers grow anywhere you want them to, then even unique looking types of trees... And I totally love the (new) different kinds of meteor showers!\n\nAnother unique task of this game is building \"base camps\" along your way to provide yourself with oxygen and water at first, also storage, later on with food etc. This is something that I always loved to do (like in GRAV for example), but no other game than Planet Crafter actually requires. Plus: plundering the wrecked space-ships and underground hideaways is a real fun activity too :D\n\nThe game is very well made, I didn't find any game-breaking bugs found so far even though the game is still in EA :) Just beware of saving and reloading inside of wrecks ;) \n\nFYI: I've currently only just reached \"insect stage\" and a \"fish stage\" will be up next. It's a nice thought that we can bring the initially \"dead\" planet to life this way :)\n\nCan't believe these amazing graphics were made by only two people! Love the large space-ship-wrecks so much ^_^ Their different shapes look really cool. And the bunks even come with small toilets - so cute :D \n\nActually, everything else is awesomely designed too: the many things we can craft and build, the lovely sky, the meteors that come crashing down, the falling sand from the cliffs - it all looks very beautiful and makes your stay on this planet enjoyable :)\n\nStory-wise there's still work to do though I guess... Well, it's EA after all, so let's see how this will evolve :)\n\nAlso in terms of game balance, I'm not 100% happy (yet) - while being aware that everyone has their own ideas and taste of course.\n\nHere's some additional thoughts:\n\n1. We're a convict with the task of terraforming a cold desert planet and bringing it to (green) life. Someone (presumely the \"Sentinel Corps\" that left the message on the screen in our capsule) must have invested a lot of money: we were brought to this planet, were dropped down in a sturdy capsule, we got a fine space suit and a sophisticated multitool.\n\nOn the other hand we aren't provided with much food in order to survive, and we brought no seeds to grow?! Even worse: our food grower blueprint is not available from the start? This significantly reduces our chance to survive and by that our chance to fulfill our task. If we fail, all the investments for this project will have been for naught... \n\nThis does not make much sense to me.\n\n* Possible solution: just let the food grower blueprint unlock very early in the game or even be unlocked from the start, and provide us with at least one pack of seeds. We'll need to find aluminium in order to craft the food grower anyways and then we will also have to wait for the food to grow.\n\n** I'd like it if the different game modes could come with different starting options - relaxed game mode with more and better seeds for example, while hardcore mode could come with accidentally spoiled seeds so that we'll have to find seed packs first.\n\n2. (Randomly) filled chests are lying around all over the place. Also: you'll find better and rarer stuff depending on your terraforming progress. Why? Who dropped those in the middle of nowhere - and why would chests in your starting area contain much rarer stuff if you only open them later in the game?\n\n* Possible solution: wouldn't it make more sense if we found backpacks next to spacefarer's remains (empty spacesuits or something) instead of chests?\n\n** Wouldn't it be better to have fixed findings in all those storage containers - but differently depending on the chosen difficulty mode? The current randomness will just make players save the most chests for later, and also will lead them to saving their game progress just before opening any storage container, then reloading until the randomly generated content will satisfy them...\n\n3. So we can deconstruct chests, a few solar panels, heaters and specific iron girders, but nothing else in those really large wrecks? I would love it if we could gain cloth by deconstructing bunk beds in spaceships rather than randomly collecting cloth from chests. \n\nActually: the more we could deconstruct and re-use/recycle or even fix in order to make it work again, the better in my opinion ;)\n\n4. How believable is it to build a whole building module that also procudes oxygen (!) out of nothing but iron and titanium? And we don't even have to craft semi-manufactured products beforehand for such large multifunctional objects? Not even to speak of Biodomes T2 with several tree types inside even though we don't use any tree seeds for their construction...\n\n* Possible solution: how about adding oxygen-producing algae or slime or so to the buildings? Basically an organic substance that our capsule should have integrated somewhere, since it too produces oxygen? \n\nWe could take part of this substance from the capsule and when erecting a building, this substance would be put either in tanks next to the door in order to produce oxygen, or maybe even into a whole layer of the building. After it multiplies with the help of sunlight, we could then again gather a part of it in order to erect more buidings that will produce oxygen as well ... and so on.\n\n5. I'm also a bit irritated by message screens left by former crash-survivors, while our crafted \"signs\" are much smaller and we cannot write and leave behind message screens ourselves. \n\n* Possible solution: it would be nice to read different messages - those that were sent to the now-wrecked ships or abandoned bases (so that they could provide bits of the game world's background-story) rather than \"last words\" left by the castaways themselves...\n\n** Alternatively, I'd actually also be happy enough if we could \"write\" our own message screens ourselves too just like the shipwrecked ones did ;)", "timestamp_created": 1648564604, "timestamp_updated": 1650981063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 254, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.906606376171112061", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112946518": {"recommendationid": "112946518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054246272", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1122, "last_played": 1648925894}, "language": "english", "review": "Subnautica in space.", "timestamp_created": 1648428752, "timestamp_updated": 1648428752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 420, "votes_funny": 51, "weighted_vote_score": "0.905997514724731445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112941408": {"recommendationid": "112941408", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980915285", "num_games_owned": 1060, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 3381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 567, "last_played": 1712886531}, "language": "english", "review": "Numbers go up.\nWorld looks prettier.\nReceive serotonin.\nRepeat.", "timestamp_created": 1648419539, "timestamp_updated": 1648419539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 198, "votes_funny": 81, "weighted_vote_score": "0.902509212493896484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136898541": {"recommendationid": "136898541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035738267", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1795, "last_played": 1690897696}, "language": "english", "review": "great game, very addictive...

On the one hand, it's more comical than anything, but on the other, it does slow me down as I wait for them to pass.\n-  I would love to see a little more visual change in some stages of terraforming. I realize that may be in the works, especially for later stages, but it's such a satisfying feeling to see things change. \n-  More decor items would be awesome, both for casual players and for those of us waiting between content updates to keep us entertained in \"creating\" new bases/ideas.\n- On that note, none of the decor items/furniture hold any real in-game value. Would be interesting if they could provide temporary buffs like sleeping in a bed makes your hunger reduce slower, etc. \n- A day counter or some kind of time-keeping system would be nice.

I can't say I encountered any game breaking bugs, but don't expect a fully finished, AAA quality. My ony personal pain point is optimization - game seems to lag at some points. Which is normal for an EA game and restarting it fixes it, so not a big deal.\n\nImportant to note that I've been following the game for a while and they've been consistently releasing patches and adhering to their roadmap (which, you know, exists) which for me is the most important things for ea games.\n\nThe second important point to know is that, quite unique in the genre, there is no violence. You aren't fighting aliens, you aren't even evading alien water monsters (talking about you Subnautica). I believe meteors can hurt you (although I never had one fall on me, it's pretty easy to avoid them) and other than that, the only way you can die is fall damage, thirst, hunger or O2. For me, this is a unique and great experience. But not everyone might appreciate it.\n\nNow - if you are fine with the above points, I heartily recommend the game. For me it's closest to Subnautica: You are all by yourself (Even more so, as there are no cutie fishies) and you have to figure things out. You start by trying to survive, than expand your capacity and in the meanwhile, discover the fates of others before you and discover more about the planet.\n\nThe way it works is that you have to work on improving the Heat, O2 level etc to transform the planet to be habitable. They are represented by numbers and at certain points, you unlock new recipes. You harvest resources, many of which requires exploration.

Exploration is mostly a boring chore since the map looks kind of similar (similarly bland, that is) everywhere and there is no sense of danger at all. And at the few spots where there are special \"biomes\", the transition is very poorly done. The lighting and the skybox changes so dramatically when walking over the area boundary that it really kills your immersion. The poor graphics of this title don't do the feeling and exploration any favors here. And the random ships and structures you encounter all look the same and offer no sense of wonder when exploring them. All in all, exploration and discovery are the weakest aspects of this game. \n\nAnother very frustrating mechanic is the building. It currently is very badly designed - for example, when you want to remove a door or window, you have to rebuild the entire structure. The set of decorations and placeable features is sorely lacking as well (there's not even indoor walls). To top it off, nothing aligns properly, and most things don't snap in central spots, making aesthetically pleasing builds very frustrating to accomplish. A far cry from Subnauticas simple but very pleasing building mechanics.\n\nHowever, I would still recommend this game because it also does some thing extremely well. For example, the core gameplay loop of farming and gathering -> improving your equipment and machines -> exploring and unlocking -> farming and gathering again is very similar to Subnautica, making it rewarding and well balanced. The game has you always wanting to accomplish the next milestone or unlock the next machine.\n\nThe terraforming is also a really cool feature, if not the standout feature of this game. Seeing the world slowly come to life through your actions is really rewarding and well designed. A truly unique feature as well.\n\nAll in all, this game is very good at hitting the spot of wanting to do \"just one more thing\" and keeps you engaged this way. The terraforming mechanic is unique and rewarding. But if you are easily distracted by cheap graphics, lack of polish, bugs, and repetitive farming tasks, the bad might outweigh the good for you here. And if you expect Subnautica-esque emergent storytelling or harrowing encounters with terrifying alien fauna, look elsewhere.\n\nObligatory reminder that this is an Early Access title, things will probably improve, and there have been big updates and good developer interactions in the past.", "timestamp_created": 1681331915, "timestamp_updated": 1681331991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 117, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864930510520935059", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116606829": {"recommendationid": "116606829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068624557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1700256035}, "language": "english", "review": "Remember when your dad yelled at you because you left the door open too long in the winter and he said he didn't want to have the heater on for the whole planet?

You need to gather recources to inprove air quality and temperature so that lakes will form and plants will grow.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nThe graphics of this game look incredibly cool, the scenery is epic and the lighting looks good (I use Ultra settings, but even high and medium look awsome). As a person who likes landscapes I couldn't be happier with the view of this land. The graphics also keep inproving with the game after your planet inproves to a lovely place.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nIf you like looking around and building stuff, this is the game for you. You can search pretty much any place and find cool stuff if you look hard enough. The constant inproving of your place is very rewarding to look at aswell.\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nI am honestly not the best person to descibe audio, but the sounds that have been put in this game do fit the game very well, giving a calming feeling while you look for all the necicary recources. The sound feels emersive and very well placed.\n\n[b]Audience[/b]\nThis game can be played by anyone, just don't expect a competitive or PvE experience.\n\n[b]PC recuirements[/b]\nYou are just fine if you have a decently recent pc. 4GB VRAM and pretty much any CPU should be enough. I'd say: 'If you can run Minecraft, you can run this'\n\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\nThis game has multiple difficulties. You can choose the gamemode that is very relaxing, forgiving and easy, where the objective is just to have some fun with exploring and building. The standard difficulty is still pretty forgiving, since you can still get your items back after death, which isn't the case with the harder two modes, where you also die a lost faster. Lastly you have the hardcore mode, where you just have one life and death is the end of this run.\n\n[b]Grind[/b]\nIf you like grinding a game, this game could be for you, but grinding isn't necessary. You can plant down some ore generators for the common items and craft more complex things from that. There are some rare items though, which you have to look for in the open world. Most items don't need more that 6 items to build, so even to being creative grinding is not a big obstacle.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nAs far as I know, there is not a lot of story in this game. Being a sandbox game I wouldn't expect anything else. You do get some messages every once in a while, but I don't feel like they really deepen the lore.\n\n[b]Gametime[/b]\nTechnically you can play this game infinitely, but after you built everything you wanted and unlocked everything it could become a bit boring. But unlocking all the items and world events will take at least 10 hours, and if you take building with that, you could drag it up to 30 to even 50 hours per world.\n\n[b]Price[/b]\nI'd definetely recommend buying this game if you like adventuring and being creative. It is not a very expensive game (currently about $16), yet it is very fun and exiting to play.\n\n[b]Bugs[/b]\nBeing still in the early access, the game has some bugs, but that is to be expected. It mostly has hitbox bugs with some high up objects, so it would be hard to get there anyway.\n\n[b]Final rating[/b]\nIf this were a fully released and refined game, I would give this game an 8/10, but I can see that the developers are still putting lots of time in the game and I'm exited to see the future.

The graphics are not bad at all and it's fun to see things change as terraforming progresses.\n\nCon: Those prone to motion-sickness in first person games (as I am) may have trouble with this. I've had to keep my sessions relatively short and the view angle very low (which is not my preference), as the fish-eye and nausea effect are super strong otherwise. The camera shake during meteor showers is another issue for me, on which I've given feedback as that could/should be an accessibility option.\n\nLast and relatively least, the translation from the French isn't that good (I'm bilingual and a professional translator to boot, so I know whereof I speak), but it's also not terrible.

You literally collect loose resources spread around from the ground and craft stuff from those in your pod. Not exactly something that looks very appealing at first sight. \n\nSo first impression is not particularly positive, after all i recall i have a few games in my library that looks and feels like this one - except this game works as-is and doesn't require you to learn some obscure logic that the devs had in mind to even make simple things. Here you build to survive primarily and then build to terraform the planet secondarily. So you build first a lot of power generating tech and other survival related stuff and then when you got the chance heaters, pressure drills and oxygen generating devices that slowly terraform the environment and as you do that you unlock new tech accordingly.  Building stuff is very much like Subnautica where you built stuff with a builder device on atom level from thin air with resources. Also exploration has Subnautica vibes to it as you are constantly running out of oxygen.  First 5 hours is pure survival as dwindling food and water supplies force the player to keep moving until the situation stabilizes slowly. \n\nGame is already pretty fleshed out despite Early Access. The little under 20hours i have spent on it this far has just been hours flying away as you constantly have new things to explore or build. Love it how the enviro looks SO dead and barren yet contains lots of secrets to find. Also in the spirit of Subnautica the few answers to your questions will be found when going down from the surface. \n\nIf the topic of surviving and terraforming your environment interests at all i'd recommend checking some gameplay videos first and then considering if you want to try it out. For me at least this is the first of it's kind that 'just works' without being some kind of epic No Mans Sky like game or block building and endless exploration sandbox like Empyrion. It nicely finds it's own niche between bigger titles and for that i give it a thumbs up.

To top it off, there is hidden lore scattered across the one map currently in the game, and even some story elements to the game that you mostly discover at your own pace.\n\nMy Experience: \n\nI must say, i have had a blast playing this game! \n\nThere is always something for you to do in it, whether its growing more trees, increasing Terraformation levels, exploration or just building your base(s). It's completely awesome to watch the planet change to be a paradise. Even when you get to the (current) final stage of the terraformation process - for me it was amphibians, there is still more you can do to beautify the world. By simply playing the game at face value and doing what I want, i unlocked all of the achievements. This game has no achievements that are ridiculously improbable to happen by sheer chance. they are accomplishments for exploration and progression in the game\n\nThe game may not be finished at the time of this review, but what is included in the game makes it a joy to play through.

But here, it gets just more busy for the sake of the planet.\nAnd I'm not willing to play another 10 or 20 hours to finally get to Drone stage to make my life easier again.\nSo, I think you can easily sink 20, 30, 40+ hours into this game if you enjoy the environment to get more pretty.\nBut don't expect to ever having more time to see, what you have created so far.\nIf you stay at your base and look at the blue sky and the algae in the lake, you will not progress.\nYou constantly need to be on your toes to do more of the same with your own hands.\nMight be for you.

You start on a hostile barren planet and slowly transform it into a green one by adjusting the atmosphere. It's basically an incremental game in disguise, but the progression system is so well integrated that you don't notice. It's very Subnautica-esque in terms of resource gathering, exploring and base building. It's addictive to keep upgrading your gear and the base as you explore the planet and slowly see it start to change over time.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n- New blueprints are unlocked based on terraforming progress\n- Excellent atmosphere\n- Meteor storms (which leave new resources)\n- Very similar to Subnautica in terms of exploring wrecks, survival and building styles\n- You build machines which require power, which raise 3 different attributes of the terraforming index. As the Ti rises, you unlock new technology\n- As you raise the temperature, some things melt which open up new pathways\n- Chests have built-in labels\n- The building system generally works really well. There's a lot of snapping pieces together - although putting a base on foundations that line up is impossible because the building units are larger than the foundation grid\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- UI is very barebones, but it works\n- Movement is extremely basic. Moving across the ground feels like you're floating. When you fall off a cliff, you just move downwards at a constant, relatively slow rate, with no fall damage.\n- I'd love to see something like resource nodes and mining. Right now, all elements are just randomly scattered on the ground which doesn't make any sense at all\n- You can currently build anything in mid-air with no support. That shouldn't be possible\n- You currently don't have to connect power generators to anything - it's just global, which feels weird. I'd quite like something like Satisfactory's wire system.\n- Some way to remove rocks. The landscape is littered with rocks, and you can't build over them or remove them\n- Would like to be able to sleep in the bed to skip night, even if it doesn't advance the Terraforming Index\n- Please add toggle to run instead of holding the key\n- I discovered after 10 hours that you can build multiple copies of something by holding ctrl.

At first it seems a little Lo-Fi but that's actually not true - it's just barren at the start so you're kinda seeing the same few textures on everything. It is bare-bones compared to those bigger name titles - but I think it hits it's brief real nicely. If you stick with it it's actually quite fun to watch the environment change around you - something the other titles don't do. So yeah, no-brainer for me. If you like any of the aforementioned titles, at least give the demo for this one a go. The full version is a bargain. Warning - if you're a survival crafting addict like me, this will feed right into that.\n\nI do have some criticisms but these don't break the game as such. For example, the base-building is most rudimentary and not allowing any sort of excavation is kind of annoying. The platform system is a single metal frame that provides plenty of flexibility in terms of placement, but annoyingly isn't size-compatible with the habitat buildings. So as you place habit components on the foundation, they will over or under-hang and will do so at different amounts on each side. You don't get the warm fuzzy feeling of symmetry! The foundations also don't provide any real improvement in aligning your structures and don't improve snapping - structures will clip through etc...\n\nAnyway, I still think this is a worth-while tile.

I don't know why people latch so much on these superficial comparisons between the games. Yes, there are wrecks. Yes you need to grab resources and unlock blueprints. But this does not make a game Subnautica. The gameplay loop is completely different.\n\nYour goal in Planet Crafter is to reach a certain terraforming score, which essentially means this is an \"incremental\" builder game. Anything you work towards to is to be more efficient at gaining score in arbitrarily chosen categories (O2 , Heat, Pressure, Biomass) I do hope these get reworked to be at least semi balanced because having only O2 as your atmosphere is a very bad thing. :P\n\nNitpicks aside, this is still a fun gameplay loop experience. You start off with almost nothing and have to first expand your equipment so you can actually start to build. From there the loop is basically:\n\n- Invest resources into buildings to accumulate more score to gain unlocks to gain points more efficiently\n- Explore the map to find resources you need for these\n- Eventually see results of your \"Terraforming\"\n\nIt's pretty relaxing, a good podcast game. So if you think you'd enjoy this kind of gameplay loops, then the game is for you. At the moment of when this review was written I'd say the main downsides are:\n- Garish color palette thats way oversaturated\n- Lots of clipping bugs, its very easy to leave the playable game area.\n- No animations / feedback for the player character. You're always a static gun arm with almost no movement.\n- Resources are just randomly placed all over the map, it looks very weird/lazy.\n- Performance tanks if you actually start to plant greenery.", "timestamp_created": 1648627164, "timestamp_updated": 1648627164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 139, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.77911299467086792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112802759": {"recommendationid": "112802759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039510426", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 3976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "playtime_at_review": 767, "last_played": 1712973895}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine if Subnautica and Satisfactory had a child. This game is fresh out into the world and already has the best elements of both games neatly packaged into it's own unique shell.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Story is both vague and interesting, making me want to search for more clues\n-Constructing and deconstructing things is like crack. I've built, un-built, moved, rebuilt, removed and replaced my base so many times. It's easy. It's fun. It's aesthetically pleasing. There's no downside.\n-Gathering is at that perfect sweet spot where it feels like a rewarding chore that you eventually completely outsource to your machines.\n-Rewarding core mechanics of terraforming. See your planet and your surroundings change slowly while also unlocking new technologies and secret areas for rare resources. Cannot stress enough how amazing it feels to finally be enter some of the ice caves after your planet heats up enough.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Map is very large, but not quite large enough for hundred hour play-throughs.\n-Endgame slows down drastically as certain resources are not unlimited\n-Feels like a AAA end product and has no right shaming other games by being an early access game\n-Only one linear route of planet progression (for now?)\n\nTL;DR - Game is good, better then our reviews\n", "timestamp_created": 1648220867, "timestamp_updated": 1648220867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778409898281097412", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113041089": {"recommendationid": "113041089", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968208825", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 3996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 161, "playtime_at_review": 772, "last_played": 1713498882}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty chill and on normal you get full resources back when you deconstruct stuff so the game doesn't punish you for trying out stuff and breaking it down later.", "timestamp_created": 1648592423, "timestamp_updated": 1648592423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.775203466415405273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118006057": {"recommendationid": "118006057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040910837", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1153, "last_played": 1661881249}, "language": "english", "review": "You know - the fact there is no hostile creatures makes this for me the perfect wind down game with just the right amount of tact.
