Also, could not make a sawmill necessary to making larger wooden beams--I'd sold off the blade for that, too (since I didn't know it was going to be essential later on). \n\nAnyway, while I love survival/open world-type games, I feel in this case that the developer went a bit overboard in making me harvest something, that in reality would not have been an issue, that prevented me from progressing further in the game.

And this gimmick works pretty well.\nThe problem is, everything else in the game is just extremely boring. There's not a whole lot to find or craft, and what's there is not very exciting. The combat is very basic, the resources are abundant and constantly respawning, so there's 0 chance of you ever dying. The enemy and quest varity is very poor too, and to compensate for the lack of content the game pads out the playtime with overly slow gathering animations.  \nThere's also a few idiosyncrasies in the mechanics that go against what you would expect based on genre conventions (or just common sense,) eg. scooping water from a lake is way more tiring than mining rocks, the best place to get water is the desert, bronze weapons are better than iron etc. They don't really break the game or anything, but definitely weird design choices.\n\nEdit: one more thing I forgot to mention.

It had so much potential but sadly the more I played, the more the repetition began rearing its ugly head.\r\n\r\nThe thing that sets this apart from other games (and probably the best thing about it) is that you build the world yourself. You start off with just a couple of tiles and you slowly have to unlock and fill out the world with different world pieces, featuring many diverse biomes. It has a very slight puzzle element to it as well because only pieces of the same biome are allowed to be placed together. So for example you might have a tile that has half forest and half lake and you have to think about their placement in order to make it cohesive. It's not hard though once you get the hang of it.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is that the more tiles you add, the more tedious it is to traverse the map and even the sprinting speed is slow. Needing just a couple of items from the other end of the world every time gets old really fast.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nVisually the game looks okay, simple, but nice enough. It features a top-down isometric view. You can zoom in and out but sometimes the camera only being able to move in four directions really hinders visibility, I found this especially prevalent when hunting animals thankfully it's easy enough to do, so I couldn't get too mad at it.\r\n\r\nThe UI felt clunky at times. Instead of just having a toolbar you had to press a button whilst in it to set it as your current tool. I'm not sure why this extra step was added. Adding tiles doesn't feel great either once your world gets bigger as the game couldn't seem to keep up with my movements, leading to me closing and entering the placing menu several times. \r\n\r\nThere is a story here (meteorites fell and turned people into zombies) and it had the potential to be interesting but the characters are as dry as the desert setting and only really exist to hand out quests. It feels like the story was slapped on only to give you more things to fight other than the wildlife, and doesn't fit with the overall tone the game is going for. It could have even lost its Western theme and it would come away being the exact same game.\r\n\r\nWhen you're not filling out the map, you are gathering items to craft new things. There are several different workbenches, each capable of producing unique items. If you've played any sort of life sim or survival game before you'll know exactly what to expect; tools, a campfire, a furnace, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe flora and fauna in biomes do replenish after you've exhausted them once some time has passed, but some things are rarer than others so it can be frustrating if you are after one specific thing and you are forced to wait in real time for it to be accessible again. This wasn't really an issue until the mid-game though, and with basic things like wood, stone, and berries will come back faster than you can harvest them.\r\n\r\nYou have to juggle hunger, thirst, and fatigue but\r\nthese mechanics don't really add anything to the game, as food and water are plentiful and it's easy to recover energy by the campfire or by sleeping in bed.\r\n\r\nYou also have to craft and manage your armor since different biomes will have varying climates that will damage you over time if you aren't prepared for them.\r\n\r\nI will say The building of structures and objects feels really intuitive, even on a controller. You can easily move things once you've built them, and even quickly swap parts of your house with their higher-quality counterparts once you have access to them. \r\n\r\nMany objects can be placed inside your house that serve no purpose other than to look pretty, so the creative types might get something more out of this than I did, I just built my bed inside and was done with it.\r\n\r\nThere were a few quality-of-life things in the game that I have to give credit for.\r\n\r\nYou can craft multiple things at a time and all you have to do is hold down a button for a few moments, there is no arbitrary wait time, something that is prevalent in this sort of game so it was a refreshing change. Fishing works in the same way and I was relieved not to have to play another fishing minigame... though the lakes dry up quickly and you have to wait before you can fish again.\r\n\r\nI quite liked how generous the inventory space was and it can be bolstered with additional storage chests too, but it took a while before my backpack was full, and there are quite a few items in the game.\r\n\r\nCooking is also simple and easy to do, you can only add three ingredients at a time, and if you are about to unlock a recipe combination it notifies you, making it easy to figure out what makes a cohesive dish.\r\n\r\nThere are quests but every single one feels tedious and just feels like a means to an end that ultimately leads to you either being able to access new tiles or being able to traverse your existing ones safely. The characters that give them out lack personality and I'm honestly baffled why they made NPCs at all as they could have easily been delivered via a menu. Having to traipse back to them every time to let them know you've finished them was frustrating due to the slow-moving speed that I moaned about earlier.\r\n\r\nThe combat in the game is really poor. All animations are slow, but it's much more noticeable when fighting. You have a dodge roll and you awkwardly have to hit things until they are dead. It feels sluggish and unsatisfying. There are long-range weapons as well but I couldn't for the life of me get them to fire where I wanted them to so I ended up ungracefully hitting things with my axe, often taking unnecessary damage in the process.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of damage, if you do die the game isn't all that punishing and you will only lose a few of the items you had on you at the time. But for me, it was always my rarer stuff...Why are feathers so hard to come by in this game!? I could find loads if I just left my house for a few minutes and I live in a crappy town, not a gosh darn forest! ahem anyway.... That's not my only bugbear, some things just don't make sense in the game such as gathering water from lakes costing significantly more stamina than felling trees for example, I have no idea how they came to that conclusion.\r\n\r\nOverall the game does a great job of hooking you during the first few hours, but sadly it couldn't keep up the momentum. Once your map gets more bloated and you realize you are just going through the motions of gathering things and completing fetch quests to unlock the next tile to do it all over again ad nauseam.\r\n\r\nIt's such a shame because the game had so much potential, but as you play more the poor design choices and general clunk will begin to add up, and you will question if you are even having fun anymore or if you just want to see it through to the end for completion's sake. Transparently, I never made it to the end and threw in the towel at around 10 hours. Maybe someone a lot more forgiving and less well-versed in this sort of relaxing game genre will find more to love than I could, but I can't personally recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1713361426, "timestamp_updated": 1713361426, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525125622749328613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163223828": {"recommendationid": "163223828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201626171", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1053, "playtime_at_review": 1053, "last_played": 1713443117}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed every moment of this game.

They don't really tell you how to get most of the items either. I got stuck multiple times and had to look up how to get the items so I could keep progressing. Some things are just a pain to get. I spent probably a few hours shaking trees for feathers to make arrows. 80% of the time you would just get worthless branches.\n\nInventory management can be a pain too. When I first started I thought the backpack space was very generous, but items only stack up to 30 before they start taking up another slot. In the late game this began to become an issue. I would constantly have to fast travel back and forth to my base to drop off items.\n\nI also encountered a handful of bugs/glitches as well which required reloading the game. About 50% of the time the game would stop responding and crash when I attempted to go back to the main menu.\n\nMy main gripe with this game is the cost. The price of this game seems a bit high for what you are getting. Once you finish the story and upgrade your house and all your tools/weapons, there really isn't anything left to do.

The early quests also got me invested into the story, although I agree with another reviewer who said that locking tile progression behind the story quests clashes with the idea of it being a world-building exploration game. It's really more of an action RPG with crafting/world-building elements.\n\nOnce I got to mid-game, however, the cracks really started showing. The food system is incredibly unbalanced, with the most simple recipes in the game (meat skewers, fish skewers, and plain water) giving the most stats by an overwhelming amount. There's literally no reason to craft any other food, except for a few that can restore sanity, fatigue, and/or health. There is no reward to crafting the higher tier foods (anything that requires flour) outside of using Winterberry Tarts for auto-mining. Farming is a chore that doesn't seem worth it (you're supposed to get higher yields for using fertilizer, but I did not) and the mid/late game seems rushed and not fleshed out. The top-tier housing stuff is also locked behind the max tier workbench, which made it completely useless to me.\n\nThere were also several annoying bugs. Respawns are inconsistent and buggy, with some things respawning over time and others only respawning once you restart the game. Because there's no indication of [i]when[/i] a thing is going to respawn, I honestly don't know if some of the problems I encountered were bugs or not. You could sell/trash shoes you get that are necessary for a quest, rending that quest unable to be completed and ruining your game. There's a catacombs key that you can only get once, but when you reload the game the door it opened is locked (it's not actually necessary for anything, though, which is a problem in of itself).\n\nBut the thing that got me to write this review is the ending. The ending was underwhelming from both a gameplay perspective and a story one. I went into the final area expecting an RPG-esque dungeon with a few puzzles and a final boss with new/interesting fight patterns. What I got, however, was a dungeon consisting of a main room with two branching paths, each of one leading directly to a giant version of the easiest normal enemies. They were so pathetic that I was able to shoot them to death without them even coming close to me. \n\nAnd, honestly, the story conclusion was extremely \"meh\". It really needed more build up and coherence than it got, imo. But I guess that's a ymmv thing. I can't get too into it without being spoilery, but I feel like there was [i]way[/i] too much \"unrelated quests to unlock new biomes\" in comparison to the \"actual story information about the origins of the zombie plague\".

It\u2019s very bare bones in terms of gameplay. That being said the reason I kickstarted this game is because I liked that concept so here's my breakdown so far.\n\nFirst the good I really like the whole you build the world idea they have here. Reminds me of games like Legend of Mana in that depending on how you build the world will determine the ease of access of certain things to your base. I'm also a fan of the character art and game art in general. Crafting isn't a huge chore either, a pitfall many crafting games have where it takes ridiculous numbers of resources to make simple or basic items. I also enjoy that you unlock new tiles be interacting with the biomes encouraging you to go out and explore newly placed tiles to see what items and drops spawn in them.\n\nNow the bad, unfortunately it\u2019s just not that deep and the quest lines and characters in the game are generic with every quest basically a fetch quest. Despite your character's mom possibly being dead and a Zombie apocalypse happening off screen she doesn't even seem to care doing random fetch quests for lazy folks who can't trust her until she gives them X item. I need you to go to X biome to get or talk to Y but you need to collect Z materials to unlock the new biome. They all feel like plastic dolls standing around doing nothing. Also, despite being the wild west the only threat to my character have been Zombies. Slow moving and not a threat at all, no bandits, or interesting western events you'd expect. The tutorial mentions nighttime being more a threat but unless a Zombie is nearby there really isn't anything dangerous that happens and even if there are they glow red so you can easily avoid them. Even if you do attempt to fight something that can fight back you hold down LMB for 5 seconds and it dies. Nothing has even come close to killing me. The sad thing is even with my low playtime my percentage is already saying I completed more than half the game.\n\nHoping there is more content to be added down the road, maybe more in-depth quest lines that utilize the mechanics better. Like instead use the tutorial as inspiration and have your character craft houses or items that appear in the world that the NPCs use or move into versus just standing around in their biome doing nothing. This would give the world more character and would be fun as the PC gets to make their western towns and what not. As now I'd only recommend a purchase if you want a brief but conceptually interesting crafting game but you're probably better off sticking with a game like V Rising.", "timestamp_created": 1685063046, "timestamp_updated": 1685111328, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 115, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85064619779586792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156106096": {"recommendationid": "156106096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089374518", "num_games_owned": 1055, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 1653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 827, "last_played": 1710009526}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Chill, unique but not without flaws[/h1]\nI had Above Snaked on my radar for a while but when I bought it, I only played it for an hour and almost refunded it. The intro was clunky and the buttons seemed very confusing. For some reason, I decided to keep the game, which proved to be the right decision because Above Snakes works brilliantly on Steam Deck. It offers the perfect blend between survival and exploration, and the map building is just refreshing to see.\n\nBut the map is where the game also gets frustrating. Because no matter how well you try, you will eventually reach the stage where you've kind of screwed yourself over with your map building. You don't have access to all map pieces from the start, and you don't know what you're getting next unless you watch a guide. So you can absolutely build yourself into a hole and then end up farming resources to break the pieces again.\n\nAnd when we talk about resource farming, I mean it's GRINDY. Your easiest way of making money is collecting water, boiling it and selling it, for 3 gold a piece. Collecting water makes you tired, so you constantly have to eat and drink as well. That's just unfun. I wish there were more items you could sell or create.\n\nAll in all, Above Snakes offers a unique take on the survival genre, which can easily keep your attention for several ours at the time.

There are enemies, but they can usually be avoided with ease and dispatched with similar ease. I played for 160 in-game days and had made it most of the way through the story before I experienced my first death. (Don't go rummaging around graves when you're low health, folks.) \n\nThe story is nothing spectacular, but is better than just serviceable. Zombies are tired, so I appreciated a zombie story where it isn't contagious. Rather, there is an environmental cause which is treated more like a unnatural poison than a disease. \n\nThe game did not give me what I normally want in a game like this. My favorite genre is Open World Survival Crafting game because I love exploration and expressing my creativity. And neither apply here. \n\nThe world of [i]Above Snakes[/i] is neither hand-crafted nor procedurally-generated. It's [b]you[/b]-generated. You earn the ability to place new world tiles as you gather resources, and you unlock new types of tiles through research and story progression. There are a limited selection of biome transition pieces, adding some challenge to world design. Combine that with extremely limited points of fast travel, and you may have to put some real thought into the layout of your next few pieces if you don't want to trap resources too far to easily acquire. \n\nThe downside, however, is that beyond discovering the resources on your first visit to a biome, there is rarely any sense of exploration. What is over that way? Whatever you put there.\n\nThe game has the OWSC basics: gathering resources, unlocking new crafting stations, and working through tiers. All of which is done in a very basic and functional way. None of it is difficult or memorable. The number of options for base building and crafting is very limited. For example, your house can only have one floor, and it is made out of square sections. No diagonal or curving walls. No interesting architectural elements. And maybe a dozen pieces of decoration/furniture. The base building was quite disappointing. Everything works perfectly, but it is bare-bones enough to feel like it is Early Access.\n\nWhat made up for that was the inventory system. You have multiple, full-size inventories (resources, equipment, consumables, etc). So you have plenty of place to store items, which additionally stack up to thirty (except for equipment). There is no carryweight, which is phenomenal. And no objects that take up multiple storage slots, so no storage Tetris. I had unlocked the ability to make storage boxes hours before I felt I might need one. \n\nThere is only one type of storage item, and the box stores as much as one of your inventories can. So even late game, I had less than ten storage boxes and never felt like my gameplay was swallowed by inventory management.\n\nAnother wonderful feature that felt like a rare gem in this genre was that ignoring your survival needs (Thirst, Hunger, Sanity, Fatigue) does not kill you. You can still operate with one or even all of them at zero. The effects of running these meters out impairs you in other ways, such as halving your max health or taking away your ability to move faster than a slow walk. (The penalty from having zero sanity is beautiful.) But if you are in a safe environment doing routine chores like cooking or smelting, you don't have to keep interrupting what you are doing to tend to survival needs.\n\nOccasionally, I would get stumped on how to progress, but in those cases it was because I hadn't talked to someone, or because I hadn't researched and placed a tile I had available to research, or similar failing. I never felt the game failed to give me what I needed to continue; I just didn't always notice. \n\nHowever, there are a number of mechanics that can be easily missed or function in a non-intuitive manner. For example: fast travel, which occurs between hitching posts, requires a carrot. The game never tells you that. Another: the game determines crop yield by checking if the crops are watered and/or fertilized at the moment you harvest them. (So watering and fertilizing when you plant just throws away those resources. You have to water and fertilize midway through the growth cycle [b]and[/b] be home to harvest as soon as your crops mature, to get good yield.) I made a thread in the Steam discussions to post a list of things like this for the sake of new players.\n\nI played through the entire story and I am still playing it a while longer just for the chill gameplay.

Luckily I think this can be fixed with a few minor tweaks to its core formula, but until then if you're on the fence about the game, give it a pass.\n\nThe game first needs to decide what it's primary gameplay loop is, the thing it wants the players to enjoy doing the most. Right now I see two primary gameplay loops, the combat, and the \"exploration.\" Unfortunately neither of these are currently engaging enough to be interesting.\n\nThe combat feels STIFF. Combat is technically present with an attack, dodge roll, and some ranged weapons, but the way all of those work really shuts you down. When you swing your character gets rooted in place, and the dodge roll doesn't cancel your attack, so you really have to commit. I've seen some attack interruption if your weapon is strong enough, but don't count on it. The dodge also doesn't appear to have many or any i-frames. The enemies aren't all that smart or difficult but the melee combat mostly boils down to baiting an attack and trying to land your own before they recover. Ranged combat is slightly better, but your first ranged weapon, the bow, isn't very strong and feels a bit like a resource sink rather than a viable weapon. If the dodge roll was quicker, if I could move while attacking, if the enemies had better tells or felt a bit more dangerous (don't just increase their damage, change their behavior), I think the combat would feel better. Combat needs to feel like like a dance, and not a posing contest.\n\nMuch like the combat the exploration is serviceable, but there's no draw to it. The tile building is really cool, but you unlock all the tiles, and place them all deliberately, and the only challenge is matching borders? It doesn't feel like a puzzle like dorfromantik or fog of war. I'd say the biggest challenge is trekking across the map to get the resources, to unlock the next tile, to place it, then to walk across the map to get its resources. Sound familiar? the exploration is just a series of fetch quests, but you get a tile big enough for a house or two, not a whole new area. It feels like the game wants me to play as a nomad, but doesn't give me the freedom to build easily away from base, or a large enough inventory to make this worth it. If the exploration is the focus, we need to have a want to explore besides just unlocking tiles or doing what feels like fetch quests. Only the one time unique tiles are interesting, the rest of the tiles are bland and repetitive. In a way it feels like a flat minecraft world that happens to have some trees scattered about. Give the landscape variation, maybe outside my control that makes exploration a challenge. Give me more ways to traverse, climbing cliffs, taming horses, something. Let there be random ruined buildings or an infection that pops up on my new tile that slowly spreads so I have to stop it with barriers or destroy it. Don't let me choose from every tile, give me a selection from what I've unlocked and make me plan. Give me tiles that are 1x2 or 2x2, or just something to add variety. Make the world feel like its fighting me, or give me something more interesting to do.\n\nOverall there's potential, but there needs to be a bit more polish and focus on the gameplay loops. the last 10%", "timestamp_created": 1685776711, "timestamp_updated": 1686427909, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832521915435791016", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139131703": {"recommendationid": "139131703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024117421", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 799, "last_played": 1685244347}, "language": "english", "review": "I was looking forward to this game for so long.

It's beautiful and has so much going for it. But I can't recommend it, because fundamentally it isn't what it says it is on the side of the box. Above Snakes bills itself as first and foremost a world-building and exploration game. It provides a core game mechanic loop that supports that, insomuch that as you take exploration and survival actions in the world, you unlock the ability to place additional world tiles, and get more to explore. Also, like many such games there is a crafting and technology tree to unlock and climb. This is all fine, and exactly what I bought the game to enjoy. Plus wild west! Plus Zombies! What's not to love?\n\nThe issue I have is that the implicit contract of the explore & survive game mechanic loop is broken by the story mechanics. There are technologies and terrain types that can only be uncovered by completing story quests. And there's nothing forcing the story progression. For example, I spent hours trying to figure out how to follow the genre expectations of build/explore/craft and puzzling through many random crafting combinations to guess at how to make progress, only to be frustrated. My player expectations were subverted, disappointed by the reality the game expects you to follow the story as the hard gates in order to actually make progress in unlocking terrain or technologies.\n\nThere is a potential simple fix for this, which is to make the player expectations align with the core mechanics. Currently, the player-reward loop is that you gain terrain tiles to place and expand the world by doing survival actions. This means that the game is rewarding the player as though it is a typical survival game. One possible solution is that because there are hard gates based on story quests, the core mechanic could be changed so that the player only gains terrain tiles by doing story quests instead of survival actions. The gameplay reward loop then becomes \"do quest, gain more terrain to place\". That clarifies and aligns player actions with the core mechanic that's actually moving progress in the game forward. And by making that explicit in how the game works, it avoids subverting implicit genre player expectations and the associated disappointment.\n\nIf I had gone into the game knowing that it was actually a Story Game first and a Survival Game second, I don't think I'd have been disappointed as I am.

Overall, there is a lack of \"fun\" to it, whether it be lack of things to do, lack of polished mechanics, or just generally lacking.\nThings to note:\n- Combat mechanic is slow and janky. There is a dodge roll in the game but the amount of frames it takes to initiate it rends the actual mechanic completely useless as by that time the enemy has hit you. The combat is a lot of 'run away, run back, hit once, repeat' until they die. Even though there are bows and guns, the aiming is so off, for no reason at all the character will aim in the opposite direction or just decide that they want to shoot the nearest tree instead of the enemy 2 meters away from them.\n- The quests are semi-interesting but lacks substance I feel, though that's more of a preference thing. One objective observation is the lack of direction for the player if you don't understand where to get something or how to get it.\n- The tile mechanic for placing the next land is interesting, but again, I feel that it doesn't really add anything to the game at all. Sure, you can make your surrounding tiles to be what you want, but realistically for most players that either means your biomes are on each 'face' of a square formation around your home base, or some really long line, either way it is annoying without fast travel (save for the horse, though carrots to make the horse go anywhere are relatively rare.)\n\nThe good things it has going for it though is the art style and aesthetics. One of the contributing factors to my backing the project to begin with. Animations still need work though as they too can be jank sometimes.\n\nTL;DR: Overall poor combat and relatively useless tile mechanic for land, nice art though.\n\nIf they decide to release some meaty updates later on to fix these issues I might change my review, but in its current state I can't recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1685265774, "timestamp_updated": 1685265774, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737472474575042725", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1685387929, "developer_response": "Sorry to hear that the combat put you off.

Oh yeah, of course I was not anticipating that and processed all my ore to ingots few quests before that.\n\nNow to the tiny little things:\n-Doggo is useless and implemented badly. It's only gameplay function is to stop randomly and dig for useless single resource. If you run away while it's digging, it will simply teleport to you.\nBe prepared to doggo teleporting around a lot as you travel. Why bother making doggo catch up with you by, I dont know, running faster? If you can just make it teleport to player every few seconds. Why bother implementing doggo in a first place? It does not serve any actual gameplay purpose. Useful one, at least.\n-You are forced to make a hide armour that can resist cold early game. It uses your previously made leather armour.\nThe neat thing is that you are then thrown into svannah/desert biome by main quest after than, where wearing this armour actively damages your health. So, game expects me to craft a second set of armour, I guess? Why tho?\n-Inventory management is pain. It's 2023 and for some reason crafting stations can't use nearby storage's inventory.\n-Another fun part is using crafting station only to see game say \"Outside of crafting station range\".\n-My yet another favorite part is forced delay of 5 seconds per craft of single item.

I love the concept of customising your own map and I hope other developers might pick up on the idea but the rest of the game just feels like a hollow shell.\n\nThe game follows a simple loop: Farm items to do quest that lets you unlock more tiles, rinse and repeat. There is no challenge presented to the player at all, except for knowledge of where to farm certain items in order to progress. Combat might as well be non-existent, you either swing X weapon with broken hitboxes or you shoot X weapon with broken hitboxes.\n\nAnd honestly, for a chill-out game, that wouldn't be an issues. The problem is that the 'chill-out' part tends to be as tedious as it could get. Crafting stations sometimes don't immediately register, making it so you'll have to stand in front of them for 3 seconds in order for it to activate. You cannot move items, crafting stations or decorations without destroying them with diminishing returns. I get that system being in place for the building parts (walls, ceilings, floors) but just let me move my friggin' bed without it being a hassle. \n\nThere are no automated crafting stations. The game actually expects you to stay at your crafting station holding a specific button for X amount of time, over and over and over again. Half of the resources your acquire, you do by holding a specific button for X amount of time, over and over again. Cooking, you do by holding a specific button for X amount of time, over and over again. Fishing.. you do by holding a specific button for X amount of time, over and over and over again. You get the gist.\n\nThe good part comes from placing down the world tiles in order to customise your map. But this also comes with its own issues. See, the only way to lay tiles is by collecting X amount of resources. At one point I found myself doing farming runs, not because I needed the resources, but because it's the only way to gain tiles. It felt counter-intuitive. \n\nThen comes the issue with unlocking new tiles. Some new tiles are unlocked by quests, others are unlocked by laying down existing tiles. At times you'll be looking for that certain tile in order to connect some parts of your map and you won't know when they are unlocked or if its even in the game at all. Need that half forest / half snow tile? Well, place these frozen lakes first. Want this half plains / half water tile, well; I don't know if there is one. The issue is that this constantly makes you want to edit your map. Removing tiles and replacing them in order to optimise your layout.\n\nBut removing tiles is as tedious as the rest; they don't get refunded, not even partially. You need ink in order to remove tiles. Ink is made from feathers and berries. Berries are collected by holding a specific button for X amount of time, over and over and over again. Feathers are collected by holding a specific button for X amount of time, and aren't even a guaranteed drop. Then when you remove your selected tiles chances are you'll have to collect some random resources in order to place the replacement tiles. \n\nIt all just feel so tedious, disrespectful of your time, and ultimately made it so I just couldn't be bothered to continue playing this game. According to the save file I'm at approximately 50% of the game, having restarted once I'm guessing this game provides about a 10/12 hours of content with hardly any replay value. I hope the developers pick it up, put in the QOL-features that are required to make a decent survival game (sorting buttons, auto stack items, not standing still holding a specific button for sometimes minutes at a time) and expand on the content because otherwise I don't see myself returning to this game.", "timestamp_created": 1685209760, "timestamp_updated": 1685209760, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679376721382141113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138970570": {"recommendationid": "138970570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064386376", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 89, "last_played": 1690653821}, "language": "english", "review": "This game offers a high degree of freedom and eliminates any time pressure, creating a truly immersive experience for solo players.

And if you don't like how your world looks or is laid out, you can craft ink, which allows you to remove a tile and replace it.\n\nThe game is slow moving- the beginning goes pretty quickly, but it has to, IMHO. Get yourself up and going- surviving. As you progress through quests and the storyline, things will slow down and the grind will begin to take you from surviving to thriving. If you don't enjoy grinding- this game may not be for you. \nLots of gathering and crafting, hunting and fishing, collecting resources to build your home and upgrade it. The building and customization of your \"Wild West\" home  and world- while dealing with annoying zombies, angry bees, and really angry snakes, all of which will hurt you or kill you- is good. You can avoid most enemies, but you'll miss out on collecting some of the crafting materials they can provide. As you upgrade your workbench and skills with weapons and tools, you will start crafting better quality ones, and better quality clothing and armor. The further you go into the story, the more resources that become available for you to hunt or gather- you will have to manage your inventory to not become overwhelmed with *everything*. \n\nI enjoyed the Demo from way back when it was released during one of the Next Fests, but I did not play the Prologue until I bought the full game. Play the free Prologue- it will be a good tutorial to teach you the basic mechanics and how to deal with your needs meters and sanity level. Play it first- the progression you make in the Prologue does carry over into the full game when you start playing it. \n\nAgain- if you are hoping for something like The Long Dark Survival Mode or Green Hell- this isn't it. More like The Long Dark Story Mode with the crafting and building of Survival Mode Subnautica (minus the huge toothy beasites that want to eat your submarine with you in it). That level of grind to progress through the story. \n\nInventory in your backpack is limited- you'll need to build storage boxes to hold overflow so you don't head out with an almost full backpack and have to destroy things to make room for what you just picked up.\nYou can build multiple shelters, campfires, workbenches and other workstations to place in the world so you don't get caught out after dark when the zombies start spawning more heavily while making a long trek back home. Fast travel does become available after a bit- but it isn't a \"go anywhere\" fast travel- there are specific points you can travel to and from. You can't just decide to portal out from the middle of a frozen forest if you forgot to equip warm clothing.\n\nA few bugs have popped up, ans expected right after the launch of a small indie game- but the devs are fixing them pretty quickly, with the most potentially gamebreaking ones seeming to get priority. As it should be.\n\nAnd to help you out- here's a link to About Snakes: Prologue, so you can try the game out to see if it's a good fit for you before you buy the full game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2209150/Above_Snakes_Prologue/\n\n(Quick update- I just completed the game to 100%- 64.0 hours.

So in essence all you do is to optimize the tile layout in a way, so that all resources and unique tiles are as close as possible to you, otherwise you are having a bad grinding experience and long walks. The tiles do not really add any special gameplay experience compared to a randomly generated world. If the tiles would also mean a change in the gameplay loop or the layout truely had an impact on how you progress other than getting your resources and making the walks longer and unfun, than that would have been a new gaming experience.

The resource tiles are not adding any value other than to grind and make distances longer. \n\nThe art and design style is appealing and the game is easy enough to get into for a more casual experience. Combat is also quite simple and might turn some players off, as there is nothing but button smashing to do. Unfortuantely the controls are a bit poorely chosen.

I was excited when I played the demo a few months ago but here we are.\nAs others have said the gameplay loop is fairly simple, which is fine.

No deer = no hide = no progression.\nInstead I found myself 'scooping' up water to quickly get a map tile so I can erase the one I have and immediately replace it with a copy that Miiiight have a spawn of deer? What!\n\nAnother comment mentioned not being able to teardown your base to move things, maybe I want a window over here or maybe I want to move my bookcase. While I agree that, for 'balancing' you shouldn't get 100% of your stuff back, at least set up a system that allows you to move items you've built within the tile they are in if you're worried about people packing up their base and moving it across the map.\n\nZombies also don't seem to respawn, after you've cleared a tile they just don't come back it seems which is vastly different from the demo where you'd see 3-6 a night. I've seen 2 on the map, in a single tile, at one time. \n\nA couple small things, it's cool you have a 3 item cooking process but ffs let me batch cook.\nIf you're not going to make the cooking automated like the crafting of items then let me have a button that says, 'cook all' or 'repeat recipe' \n\nAnyways, I'll probably finish it.

Too many bugs, poor QoL, very dull overall. Perhaps with some updates it could be good or even great, but it's rough. M yplaytime shows 20 hours but it was more like 15 because I was AFK with it open for quite a bit. Here's what I found wrong with the game IMO:\n\n***SPOILERS***\n\nFishing spots don't respawn unless you die, or log out and back in.\nRespawn rates in general are very poor when you need a lot of materials.\nbuying from stores is a joke, extremely expensive items, little sell value of your items.\nevery single item in the game doesn't feel like an improvement. only does modernly more damage. You only need teh next tier because the game locks materials behind the net tier.\nItems dont present themselves logically. For example, you finally get a winter jacket and become immune to cold, then you have the ability to get additional cold protection after you're already immune. Also I never was able to even make that item because the drop rate on a polar bear was so bad. it wasnt even nessecary anyway because you get the next tier of armor quickly. Also this leaves a gap in protection because you cant wear that coat in hot environment which is the rest of the game.\nYou unlock Silver ore after gold, when gold is better. I crafted Silver axe/pickaxe/gun and literally never used them, I beat the game before I killed any monster.\nmine cart system for ores is completely unbalanced. Grinded to make a long mine track and it gave hardly anything and wasnt nessecary.\nDialouge and story options are super flat. Your choises do not matter at all. side quests are completly useless.\nkesy are completely useless. A common key cost 50 gold, so it should be giving you 50+ gold of value right? no, you get rocks, or 1 hide, useless.\nThe wolf cub you get is annoying and digs around but you get basically nothing from it, again like 1 hide or a bone\nthe lake tile is completely useless, you literally can't even access it. there's nothing on it anyway\nThe map is hard to plan out effectively without knowing what the pieces look like because they are grayed out with a lock on them so you have to unlock all tiles in the biome before you can plan out the map. Re-inking is expensive overtime.\nThe map is \"lockable\", meaning you can create dead zones you can never build in based on the pieces that are avaiable, which makes ground navigation annoying\nthe map is only rotatable to the corners of the tiles, not the sides. this makes navigating certain tiles really difficult like the canyon, villages, or tiles with a building on it because the obsticles cover your view from walking or seeing a door.\nrocks and trees can make your homestead delete itself. had several cases of things because deleted after save quitting and coming back. you lose all reasources from it too it doesn't break it just literally disappears.\nbreaking down your home doesnt give full resources back, admittedly this is a minor complaint but some resources early are difficult to obtain. Building a homestead is basically useless, you dont need a \"base\" to play the game.\nalso why is the cheapest and nicest looking building pieces at the end of the game? making wood planks and boards are way more obnoxious to build than using just rocks.\nMy Tara Brown quest glitched, I chose to kill her but she was unkillable so I have a quest I cannot complete even after finishign the game. cannot target her with any weapon rifle or bow, and cannot blow her up using TNT. Also the end of the game goes over the things you did to help everybody and it said I was a  good person for letting her live, but I didn't let her live (well i guess I did because I couldnt kill her but still)\nOnly one fast travel point you can place is very annoying, you get to the point in the game where you have to run back and forth between your base and the progressing areas, took me hours for no reason.\nCook book is mostly unnecessary after you get water and fish/meat.\nbosses and game difficult in general is jokingly easy. Only died because I afkd and something randomly decided to attack me.\nWhy does the game take 3 minutes to load after a death or boot? so incredibly long.\ncombat system is extremely basic, you don't even get a real weapon. I guess your axe is the weapon but feels kinda cheap and not much expression there. Bow, and later rifle, is completely broken because everything moves so slow and basically gets stunned when you hit it. However the combat aiming is also completely broken and your arrows will fly off in some completely random direction because there's some sort of auto aim assist.\nshop owners wont let you shop with them if you choose another dialogue option first, you have to close the dialoug and reengage with them to open the shop.\n\nArt direction is nice... Concept is super cool... Could be such a smoother diamond but for right now its rough rough. I hope the dev/devs can make a ton of improvements as I would love to recommend this game and I see so much potential. Don't regret making the purchase but the value is pretty horrible right now.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1685143346, "timestamp_updated": 1685143346, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588821113109588623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146197735": {"recommendationid": "146197735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097541926", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2426, "last_played": 1694053360}, "language": "english", "review": "It becomes repetitive after a few hours and the story was not engaging at all", "timestamp_created": 1694566401, "timestamp_updated": 1694566401, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588074147701263428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139106285": {"recommendationid": "139106285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122568593", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 490, "last_played": 1685082865}, "language": "english", "review": "This feels like a game where if they spent a little more time thinking about the mechanics they put in the game it could of been great. \n\nProblems:\nThe tile system is cool but it never amounts to anything beyond spam the same tile over and over to get the resource to get the next tiles. \nThere is a sanity meter that does nothing except punish you for looting zombies. \nCombat feels awful. The bow is really wonky to aim. Swinging at enemies feels weird. There is a roll dodge mechanic but combat is easier to just face tank enemies and kill them or just shoot them with the bow. \nThe fact that the horse isnt ride-able is a sin. \nThe decorations in the house are not intractable. \nThe dialogue is very stiff and some lines repeat in the same conversation. There also doesnt seem to be any sort of registration that you already talked to the person so you end up repeating the same long conversation just to get to the characters shop option.\nFarming shows up waaaaay to late in the game for it to mean anything. \n\nIdeas to fix them: \n\nThe tile system should of had a puzzle aspect to it where you had to get the right tiles to line up in order to unlock the quest tiles. You put all these different tile types in but there is no real need to do that. Also would of been a cleaner look to have the tiles blend instead of the cracks running through everywhere. \nSanity meter either needs to go away or increase the loot that zombies have. There is basically zero reason to fight them unless they are in your way. Even at night you just walk past everything. \nCombat needs to get refined.\nMake housing decorations useful. Let me put clothes in the dresser. Let me put books on the shelf. Let me sit by a fire in my house with my dog. \nFarming just needs to be in earlier. Im 8 hours in and I just now unlocked it and I dont feel like I'm taking my time with this game. Farming will give a sense of daily tasks to do. This could also help the cooking and meal mechanic that feels lack luster. \nLet me ride the horse. I have 80 tiles in my game and the only fast travel spots are so close it doesnt make that much of a difference to have that sort of fast travel. \nFrom what I can tell the dialogue is translated to English so that may be the root of the stiffness but maybe give it another pass over and check for the duplicates. I think the fisherman had the most issues with that for me. \n\nEnding thoughts:\nThis could of been a very cool game but it just felt lost. The tiles concept is cool but outside of that it felt like they didnt know what to do. Either commit to a cozy chill game or have a bunch of mechanics. It sits somewhere in between where the cozy gamer will get frustrated with the resource grind and lack of intractability with your home.

I've been trying to work out what it is that makes this game dull and tedious and completely devoid of fun. Here is what I can come up with.\n\nThere is no sense of discovery. FoN2 kept me playing because I was excited to see what come next. It never disappointed, each biome required new praparation and a different approach. In this game, all tiles look and feel the same. You know what you're gonna get. Land =/= exciting place to explore. Land = more running, longer distances.\n\nIn FoN2, every area was full of enemies you had to defeat before you could gather resources. In Above Snakes, you can find the odd zombie here and there. What I'm unhappy about is what they replaced fighting with. They introduced boring time sinks. You run long distances every day between destinations. It feels like a running simulator. You have to wait/hope for respawning resources. Hunger and thirst make you spend entire days gathering to satisfy these needs, there is zero point to it other than a time sink.\n\nThere is no replayability.

Many larger developers can't or don't do that so it's clear that Square Glade Games cares about its product and its customers.\n\nOne interesting core gameplay mechanic is that you create the game world from tiles.  You start off with a very small world and expand the world using tiles as you play.  There are some tile placement rules but they're pretty simple.  Tiles have to transition from one biome type into another gradually.  That means you can't plop a snow biome next to the desert, or a plains biome next to a lake, you have to use pieces that have both biomes on them to join the major biome types together.  It's actually a bit like a puzzle and you do have to think about how you're placing tiles.  If you're careful you can keep most of the special locations fairly close to your initial tile but you don't have to.  Beyond the tile placement rules I mentioned you pretty much have full freedom of where to expand the game world.  If you want to place things very far apart - you can and the game does have some limited fast travel so that won't hinder you too much.  I haven't found the boundaries of the map, nor have I run into any kind of tile limit other than the fact that there are some unique tiles that can only be placed once because they're essentially \"story\" tiles that will move the narrative forward.\n\nCombat is simple but it works fairly well and the farther your progress the more combat you'll probably encounter.  I don't have a lot to say about it.  Click to attack, right click to attack with your ranged weapon, space to dodge roll.  I haven't met any truly challenging enemies yet and I'm a bit past the halfway point so if complex or very difficult combat isn't your thing then you'll be fine.\n\nThe game also has a heat/cold system so you have to wear biome appropriate clothing or you freeze or overheat and slowly start taking damage.  It's not hard to manage once you have the right clothing.  I just have my cold/warm weather chest armour on my hotbar so I can swap whenever it gets cold at night, or too hot in the desert, or whenever I wander into the snow biome.  Walking into the desert wearing fur lined armour should be uncomfortable, and going into a frozen arctic-like biome should be deadly if you aren't wearing warm clothing, and for me it's one of those little immersive touches that I really like to see in games.\n\nGathering will take up most of your time and it can feel a bit tedious when you collect your 30th or 40th plant, or you have to cut down 3 or 4 fields of wheat just to get a dozen wheat, but that's one of the things the developer has been tweaking so that the grind is reasonable.  Luckily you can eventually build crop plots that will yield 2 crops for 1 if you don't fertilize and water them so you can always keep a supply on hand and that drastically cuts down on how much harvesting you have to do.  It's especially helpful for plants that grow in biomes you've placed farther from your base.  Trees, rocks, and ore are gathered using an axe or pick, and you can also harvest some resources from trees by holding the harvest key before cutting them down.  Not quite sure why you can't just chop the tree and get all the resources at once but you can't (hopefully the dev. will address this to further reduce the gathering tedium that can build up pretty quickly).\n\nSpeaking of your base - you aren't limited to one base.  You can build almost anywhere and can build multiple bases if you want to.  Expand as much as you want, move base pieces around if you don't like the current configuration (another recent positive change made by the devs.  Before the change you had to dismantle items to move them which meant losing a few resources, and then re-build.  Anyway how and where you build becomes up to you once you get beyond the initial \"tutorial\" section. Building is pretty simple and as you level up your crafting bench you unlock different things.\n\nThe game's got hunger, sanity, thirst, and fatigue systems in addition to health that you have to manage but it's generally pretty easy to deal with.  Sleep, drink certain beverages, or stand near a cooking fire to replenish fatigue.  Some foods regenerate multiple things, some occasionally have negative effects such as consumables that raise food but lower thirst or raise thirst but lower health.  You can hunt several critters for food and other resources and can go fishing to obtain fish oil and fish that you can cook into one of the best foods in the game - fish skewers.\n\nOverall the game is a fairly slow burn but it's generally well designed with a few things here and there that tell you this is a less experienced developer that had limited resources but that only adds to the charm.  I'm pretty impressed with this game and I'm very likely going to play it through a second time once I finish it and I plan build the world in a very different way when I do just to see how that affects the way the game plays and feels.\n\nI can definitely recommend this one, it would be well suited to anyone who wants a less hectic zombie survival game with a story, and while the tile system is fairly simple its fun to build and expand the world.", "timestamp_created": 1685551113, "timestamp_updated": 1685551113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566644787788391113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139049135": {"recommendationid": "139049135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058967990", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1685824794}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm doing this review because... well, I can, as a valued customer.

Pretty harsh maybe considering the playtime but I'm sure if a reason to change my mind appears, I will. And for that money I'll suffer the boredom no matter what. Besides the devs seem nice and active and the game's been out like a day so I'm not saying this is hopeless. But something exciting better happen to the literal world in the game or a lot of people will be disappointed. \n\nThough if you want something numbingly chill with no hurry or care in the world... THEN this is for you, sure, why not.\n\nEdit 1: Still utterly and hopelessly disappointed. I'm nearing the end of the game and I am STRUGGLING with it.\n\nThe only positive improvement was the ability to move your base parts and such without having to destroy them... but what is the point in that when base building is absolutely pointless otherwise? It's not creative either so there's no fun coming from that side. All you have to do is slap down a few floors where you can place your bed and cartographer table (sure you can make a 2x2 if you need the perks).\n\nThey did add some silly little event that had no point and there was some kind of magical improvement done too which makes half of the users games lag like no tomorrow (including mine). I'm just so disappointed I literally can't say these things in a nice manner anymore.\n\nAnd what else... oh, the map pieces. In the beginning it was fun but now towards the end it's so infuriating how none of the pieces fit anywhere so you have to destroy your old ones which means endless dull grind for beeping berries and feathers. Thankfully half of the map pieces become useless after they serve the purpose (getting items and such needed for that stage) so its no big deal removing them.\n\nWhat made me stop the game and start angrily writing was my armor. You grind and do quests for the cold climate armor then use it for 5 minutes until you don't need stuff from that area anymore and when you enter the hot climate... your armor will be harmful to you so you can't wear it anymore!! Where is the logic!??\n\nI did allow comments now but I'd really like to NOT hear from the developer unless you can arrange me a refund.

Much of your playtime is just repeating the same actions to get enough food and water to keep playing; in terms of fun, that's just wasted time; adding the day/night cycle and monsters at night means that travel time becomes another time sink with no fun payoff.\n\nThe two things that I hoped would save the game are the tile-based world building and the exploration story. If I weren't wasting so much time collecting berries and wondering where to find water after the first nonrepeatable bottle, I think the idea of rearranging the tiles to facilitate your adventure would play well.\n\nThe story is a bit thin, but having one at all is a step up from most \"survival\" games. Again, if I wasn't wasting so much playtime on repetitive gathering, the extra impetus to lay new types of tiles and explore their terrain might actually have been seminal, in the same way that Slay the Spire or FTL created new genres.\n\nThey've announced they are playtesting a \"new game mode\".

The story line feels like a very long training session about how to build everything in this game. I do love this game, so here is an idea for the developers:\n\n1. DLCs can be about new town and new kinds of tiles. (charge us about 2-3 dollars per DLS seems fair)\n2. You have to give the dog/wolf a home, it's tagging along is buggy and not really useful. I think we should have options to leave it home or guard the home tile(maybe)?\n3. We need to do something about the ram usage.  I have pretty high end PC with with recent generation cpu, current generation gpu, 32g of rams, but it seems like it is not enough anymore. (the ram got fill up so quickly when I run around covering more land, I'm thinking load only the tiles on and around the screen?)\n\nNow, something me as a player wants(call them my wishes):\n1. I want to build a second and even third floor.\n2. Can we please have more than one of that horse thing?\n3. I want to build a dock and a boat.\n4. Can we please have the option to upgrade our bags?\n5. Maybe have different sizes of the plant farm? It took me a whole game day every time I harvest and plant them again.\n6.

Is it worth your money? That depends on what you want.\n\nThe game's unique world-laying mechanic is a really clever idea which allows you to create a western landscape of your own choosing. In other games, you will need to learn the map. Here, you get to know it intimately while bringing it into existence. Be careful with you placement though. In the early hours of the game at least it is quite easy to create a situation where you cannot really connect between two pieces (I had a triangle which needed forest, grassland and lake and I did not have the appropriate piece, so for now I am forced to take the long way around repeatedly...)\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid, if somewhat on the grindy side. The flow of the survival mechanics needs some polishing. Do not go about in the correct order and you can lock yourself out of the necessary progress. For example, animals do respawn extremely slowly (if at all; after 5 days ingame the watering places are still empty) and since you need leather to progress you can either create a forest full of little lakes, ruining the immersion, or prepare yourself for a long waiting time.\n\nThere are other minor grievances: Bows shoot immediately and aiming (at least with the mouse) is somewhat difficult, as the directions are quite strict. I have not yet found a way to keep the bow drawn. To my knowledge, crafting tables also do not use materials stored nearby (or the radius for the storage chests is very very small).\n\nBut the story so far is interesting and I am looking forward to play more - in the hopes of a lot of future patches.

But then you realize that the game still has hours of story left and it basically becomes a glorified fetch quest for the later half of the game. The fact that you have to build a world tile farther away from your home to spawn it makes each trek out of your home worse and worse. It's not really worth it to build a new home there since the fast travel system encourages you to stay near the one you built and use it to go across the map. Even then the fast travel points are placed by the user so they're often far away from the actual tile you need to go to.\n\nAlso the story is bad, the writing sounds like I'm talking to a quest board and no interaction with any NPC in this game produced any sort of emotion other than \"I have to talk to this guy to complete my quest and get another one or else I can't do anything because he has the tile pieces I need.\" The story itself is the most bland story: there are zombies, man how'd that happen, good job you fixed it, credits.

There are also character quest to complete which I found to be a great addition, as to not feel so alone in such a sparse existence.  My only real frustration with the game has been with crafting.  I found myself within the game stuck and reliant on internet videos and FAQs because I was unable to update a tool or find a resource within the world.  It's been mind numbingly frustrating and if I ever quit the game, it will be because of that alone.  Aiming is also a bit off as when I am hunting animals in the woods later in the game, I find the controls don't quite help me understand if I am aiming at the target and more often than not, I miss the target completely.  It's at that time that I switch to the ax and just chase down deer and rabbits in sheer frustration.  \n\nI think this game is for anyone who enjoys a level of creation and discovery and loves to micromanage every little bit of an avatars existence.

There is never anything that you don't know in advance about, and you can't find anything \"ahead of the story\";\n- grinding for resources to unlock tiles isn't fun. It makes you feel like a rice- I mean wheat farmer;\n- tiles always have exactly what you expect them to have. No point in random. In my opinion, tiles should come in stacks of 10, with quest or special event tiles mixed in. Scrap farming for tiles, add something different to gain tile decks, let build the world in large chunks at once, don't tell players, what they get. Add fog of war to unvisited tiles;\n- way too little stuff to \"gain\" for surviving / exploration game. All you have is story gated upgrades to (two) tools and a house.
