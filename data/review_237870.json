Quests and item collection work well, although melee combat is wonky (due to lack of damage animation for monsters, you have to watch the health bar). Building and terrain shifting with various tools is surprisingly functional; I didn't focus on building at first, but it's pretty easy to dig yourself a cave to hide out in, or build some platforms to get around plateaus. Vehicles and item building is also easy; the built-in creator is both powerful and simple to learn and use.\n\nDisclaimer: I wanted to play this game mainly as a wilderness survival game at first, but a couple of things I noticed in singleplayer (story mode) made me reconsider. I wouldn't call these problems since they're mainly design choices, but they're worth noting.\n\n1. \"Surviving\" in the sense of keeping your character fed/healthy is trivial; you can carry something like hundreds of thousands of items on your person (including a couple of vehicles).\n2. The main difficulty in the game comes from combat, which feels frustrating; you can upgrade your armor, but it seems to do little to prevent most large creatures from taking out >1/4 of your health each blow, and there's no simple way to dodge if you're stuck in melee (say, against a flying enemy with an AOE ground attack and who's faster than you).\n3. Due to infinite NPC shop storage and basically-infinite inventory, the story mode game sometimes feels like \"kill x monsters for meat (currency)\", buy next tier of supplies from vendors, do quests to get to new vendors, repeat\". To be fair, it's pretty much the entry point for new players, so the parceling out of goods is understandable; it lacks the urgency a survival-oriented game might have, though.", "timestamp_created": 1394600503, "timestamp_updated": 1394768968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 500, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.924507856369018555", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32314702": {"recommendationid": "32314702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032528294", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 3229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3229, "last_played": 1497046691}, "language": "english", "review": "\"There's such a severe lack of polish,\" is something I've uttered many, many times while playing this game.  Most of the bad things you may have read about it are probably true, as are most of the good things.  It's all going to boil down to what kind of gamer you are, and how much patience you have.  \n\nI'm not exactly sure why a sandbox crafting/exploring game is so heavily formatted to be like an asian mmo.  Everything from the UI design, the grinding, the bad voice acting, to the game flow of doing all the quests in one area and getting sent to another and doing it all over again.  I spent years playing that sh*t, and PE doesn't win any points with me for using it.  The story is actually pretty decent, but is badly delivered because of the limitations of this format.  \n\nCombat is clunky, at best.  Hitboxes are awful.  AWFUL.  From early in the game you'll be sent against absurd \"bosses\" that are usually impossible to kill at the time you receive these quests, or at the least without a great deal of grinding.  \n\nI'm going to be blunt: the game isn't finished.  There are people who will argue that a tacked-on sequel-bait ending to the story technically means the game is done.  But not if it's still somewhere in a Beta state, if you ask me.  \n\nAnd yet..... Somehow.....  The game has some bits of real magic in it.  \n\nWhen you crash land on the planet, everything is new and vaguely terrifying.  Is that a tiny stegosaurus?  Is that a large, ferocious plush bunny?  Animals roam this MASSIVE totally destructible voxel landscape in multiple biomes, and apart from some weird fetish the devs obviously had for multiple eyes, all of the alien species are distinct from each other.  There's some REALLY good visual design here - it just happens to be badly optimized.  \n\nThe soundtrack is almost equally decent, although there are strange long periods of total silence because the game doesn't have enough ambient noise to compensate.  The game even has an integrated way to listen to your own music while you play.  \n\nAnd the crafting.  Ohhhhhh the crafting.  We're not just talking about things you can make, and orient when building a colony.  We're talking a brilliant creation system where you fabricate basic parts, and then add material pixels however you like.  People have made all sorts of things in various categories, from flying pirate ships to weapons and armor from other games/films/real life.  I didn't dig too deeply since I stuck mostly with templates, but there's a lot here.  You can even go back and edit your creations later.  THIS is the meat of the game.  You run your colony, you hunt, farm, mine, and make stuff.  If that's not really your jam, the other elements of the game aren't going to do it for you.  \n\nIt doesn't quite last.  Not all of it.  At some point you've been to every biome.  You've seen every species and kicked its *ss.  You have so many raw materials you hardly ever need to harvest anymore.  Colony management can be just as clunky as most of the rest of the game.  At some point you'll just want to wrap up the story, and the story will delay you, usually in the form of travel, or grinding.  I'd estimate there's probably about 40 hours of story, and no, it doesn't end in a good way.  But if you like to make things and do all that other sandboxy stuff, you'll be entertained for much longer than that.  The game has alternating moments of \"Wow, that's kind of amazing,\" and \"Wtf happened?  Was an intern in charge of this?\"  \n\nThere's some good stuff here, it's just that the devs bit off more than they could chew.  Word on the grapevine is they can't do any major code changes for PE, but they're taking on other projects to get funds for PE 2.

That is not to say that time played by default makes my opinions correct, or at all helpful, but I will try.\n\nSo I have been keeping an eye on this game since pretty much the start, maybe 2 years, not sure. But so far I have noted these key points.\n\nThe Developers:\n#The developers seem quite dedicated.\n#They seem ambitious, almost to a fault but not quite.\n#They are a recent announcement to upgrade to unity 5 shows they wish to improve even what seems to be set in stone. \n#They are slow, but they are also detailed, few game crushing bugs have ever popped up.\n#They are a small team, and not as vocal with their community as I would like. \n(keep this last one in mind when I describe the game, as it means alot when it comes to visual assets.)\n\nThe Game:\n#Graphics are pretty good in some ways, but a letdown in other.\n#The art style for humans leaves them feeling a little less real, and can be seen as a little cartoonish\n#Character customization leaves a lot to be desired but has come a long way since earlier versions.\n#Animation leaves a lot to be desired but it has been already announced they are going over the animations from scratch and making very impressive leaps, set to be released in 0.90 along with Unity 5 engine.\n#Combat is currently clunky, ranged weapons are your only real weapon, use a bow at first but aim for a laser weapon ASAP and a large supply of batteries. Combat in melee is not an option at the moment but in a recent video they have shown great progress in the combat system coming in 0.90 Unity 5 update.\n#AI is parted into what seem to be factions, often you will see animals fighting in clear and defined rolls of hunter and prey, truly one of the fantastic parts of this game.\n\nAs for my impression of the game as a whole?\nI like it, I played through all the story that is currently there, and when I hit that first message saying I could not take this mission because it was not currently complete, I was left begging for more.\n\nHowever I do worry the 0.90 update will require a total restart of my play through, but with all I have learned, and baring major changes, I will be able to do everything even better and even faster next time round, I know where you hid my aluminum you sly dogs!\n\nI would buy this game again, but there is one fact I must stress to all consumers. So please read this and take it to heart.\n\nThis is an early access game, you may end up with something you did not expect, it may be bad, it may be good, it may be total trash, but you knew this going in, you paid for an unfinished untested product and it is your risk alone to take!", "timestamp_created": 1426564579, "timestamp_updated": 1428339196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.876311779022216797", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13024734": {"recommendationid": "13024734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005478926", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 2576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2420, "last_played": 1487984887}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: Nearly unlimited creativity.

Even though it's in Alpha, it still has a lot of content and things to explore. \n\nThe in-game creation editor allows you to make pretty much whatever your heart desires in terms of weapons, shields, vehicles, and decorations. I was never an artsy kind of guy in terms of drawing or modeling, but it is fairly simple to figure out how to work the controls for the editor. Also, there is a small built-in tutorial along with of a bunch of help amongst the community.\n\nThere is also a build mode that allows you to place blocks and build structures. Unlike many other games of this type, it allows you to build multiple blocks at once through dragging vertically / horizontally, and offers you various shapes such as cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones, and much more. Along with this, you can also enter a free-view mode, which makes building much easier to control and look over.\n\nI haven't played the single-player campaign to its fullest yet, but it has been nice so far. I have primarily been playing on my multiplayer server with a couple of friends, and have been creating and exploring for many hours. Personally, the game is much more fun when you have others to play with, since you can go on adventures or see what others created themselves.\n\n[b]To server owners:[/b] I personally prefer hosting a server from the game itself by going to Multiplayer > Host. I say this because the server controls are a bit iffy right now, and from what I understand, the \"correct\" way to shut down the server is to find it in the multiplayer list, select it and hit 'Delete'. With this being the case, the admin of the server is whichever character created it, and thus, they are the only ones who can do the process stated above. However, when hosting it from a .BAT file or whatnot, there is no specified character as an owner. As such, the only way I've found to shut it down is to either just exit out of it, or kill the process if using batchmode. Of course, there could be something I'm missing entirely, and I'm sure this will be refined more in the future.\n\nI'm rambling now so I'll just start to rap this up with some of the current, noticeable issues\n\n* Crafting currently seems to be split up between singleplayer / multiplayer, e.g there's some stuff you can apparently craft offline but not online...doesn't really affect gameplay that much though\n\n* The camera can feel kind of unrealistic and annoying to control, but they're supposedly redoing it entirely in the next update, so we'll see\n    * First and third person are both options (use scroll-wheel to change between perspectives / zoom in and out)\n\n* Entities (players, vehicles, mobs, etc) can sometimes fall through the world (primarily when in vehicles going at fast speeds for players [~100+ Km/h])\n\n* NPCs appear to multiply in multiplayer each time the server is restarted (e.g. a town will spawn all of it's NPCs...server restarts...those NPCs spawn back, on top of another set of NPCs.)\n   * Their town decorations seem to do the same (some houses end up with 5 doors on top of eachother, etc)\n\n* Along with that, objects such as turrets sometimes don't spawn in or fall through the world when spawning in in multiplayer\n\nOver all, as many other reviews have said, this is an Alpha game. If you buy it, expect some bugs and crashes. That's why there is a notification telling you this game is in Alpha. I myself have only encountered a couple bugs in game and maybe one crash or two. However, I don't know how other people's computers will handle it and what their experience may be like. All I can say is that if you don't want to deal with bugs or possible crashes, then I'd suggest waiting a while for it to become a bit more stable and then buy it. \n\nCurrently, I'd rate it a 10/10 for an Alpha build, as it is honestly much more than I would've expected.", "timestamp_created": 1401978471, "timestamp_updated": 1401979540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 123, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860546231269836426", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9434885": {"recommendationid": "9434885", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992928723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 5399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4368, "last_played": 1480098858}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit: 11/17/2016\nWell here we are, Release.  If you can call it that, While i understand the pressure the Devs are under to get the game out, It was still undercooked.  That being said, Considering some of the updates its had before this, its very playable!  Bugs? Yes! Multiplayer issues? Yes!  Enough of them to break the game? NO!\n\nA big plus as well is they have promised to keep working on the game, bug fixes, stability ect. for at least 6 months, which i think was the time table for release anyway.  So its not going to be a Doublefine situation where they say \" Fuck it, you all deal with making it better!\"\n\nEdit:2/5/2016\nIts been a real rollercoaster for this one, went from good to unplayable and back a few times now, buts its getting nothing but better as time goes on it seems.  To all of the ppl that say its a \"dead\" game that will be in EA forever, I guess they havent seen the recent improvments that just pulled it out of one of the low points i spoke of above.  Ive seen even thru the low points the devs do their best to get patches and content out...the game may not have a large player base ATM, but its far from dead and poised to be great!\n\nOld review that still stands:\nThis is the game I wanted from StarForge.  This review is wrote in haste, i think i have maybe 3 hours into the game, and just in survival mode at that.  Game includes a Story mode and multiplayer.  So as of right now, the game does show a few bugs, most of which i have been able to over look, and one game breaker when trying to load into a saved game, not sure what caused it but i can imagine being 20 hours in and BAM, saved game corruption.  But becuase of the future i can see for this game, every bug can be overlooked ATM IMO.  Still I would call this a early beta if i didnt know better. So the best way i can compare this game to others you might know is a SCI-FI Minecraft with Better Graphics, the ability to create your own Weapons ( completely design swords and sheilds from scratch ), and design your own Helis and Cars, Recruit others to the bases you create.  You can mine for minerals, hunt monsters, but its set up where you could not have to do one or the other.  Meat is used as Currency, so hunting can get you what you need to build anything.  Or mining can get you the \"meat\" you need buy selling ores.  Needless to say, im fairly impressed with this one.

It is full of bugs, performs extremely poorly (980ti, i5-7600K, 32gb RAM: 1080p <40fps), the movement is jerky and janky, going into first person causes a vibration effect... I came back to this with my friend the other day and the list of bugs goes on. \n\nBefore I get into the problems, Planet Explorers does lots of things you can't really do in many other games, at least all in one application:\n\n- Voxel-based world, so you can dig out the ground and tunnel to your heart's content. \n- Build very easily, with a very detailed system that can allows you to make some really interesting structures. This combined with the ability to dig gives you a ton of creative freedom.\n- The world is cartoony, but very pretty. \n- The music is fantastic! The sound and atmosphere in general is terrific, though it wanders away sometimes, see in bug list below. \n- You can create your own custom weapons and vehicles with a very detailed crafting system, where even the types of materials you use have their own properties. So you could, say, make an airship out of marble but it'll be incredibly heavy. So cool! You can also download many of these off of the workshop. That's terrific. \n- Fun co-op story content. It's hard to get a good story-based co-op experience that fits this sort of game-structure, these days. You can get a lot of open-world cooperative titles, but you won't necessarily be getting a story. \n- Lots of voice-acting though... It's mostly laughable in terms of performances. However, I kind of like it, along with the cartoonish style I find it charming. Really, though, it's not great. \n- Make a world-spanning train system customized the way you like (wow). \n- Create a colony with a crazy amount of choice in how you'll do it: on top of a mountain, in the sides of a giant cliff where you've carved homes into the side of the cliff's face, underground, on platforms over the ocean... \n- The glider pack and jet pack are genuinely very fun to use. \n- Can tame and ride various animals (though I have yet to try this). \n\n\nHowever... Wow. Bugs. I'm not sure you can say this is out of Early Access, and they're already onto another title.\n\nHere's a quick list I made in the last hour or so, because I'm frustrated. These are bugs from jus this morning:\n\n- Gerdy floats around 20 feet in the air above her bed. \n- The movement is very janky, with weird vibrations. \n- Going into first-person is uncomfortable because your character's idle movements cause the camera to make idle movements. \n- Can't get into that first medical bike vehicle. We've read that it's just a bug with that bike, but if we continue playing just to find out that all vehicles are bugged I'm going to be PO'd. \n- I'm running a i5 7600k, 32gb ddr4, geforce 980ti. PE runs like garbage. Though it runs perfectly at first, it will drop to a steady 40fps at 1080p and mostly-high settings. I've turned down a lot of options and.... it's still janky as heck. \n- When I shut down PE - my PE server keeps on running. This would be fine if I could actually access it, but it's just sitting there in the background doing it's thing and I have to end-task it. That's super, super lame. \n- If I host a server, go into it, and then exit back to the lobby it won't let me re-join my own game for several minutes. It just tells me that game's already running. I then have to search for my own server and join it, it won't let me otherwise. \n- If I then go and close said server, there's no visual indication I've done so. I click \"close\"... but nothing on the screen changes so I wind up checking if it actually did it or not. You couldn't even be bothered to tie a sound effect to pressing the close button?\n- When I exit PE it thinks it's still running. Have to shut it down in the BG or restart Steam! If I try to get back in it says it's already running. \n- When you turn down the volume, but flick your mouse over menu options, it \"forgets\" your volume settings on those activation sounds. \"clickclickCCCCLLLLLLIIIIIICCCCCCCKK\" SUPER FUCKING LOUD. Ear-hurting loud. I'm using the volume controls so I can hear my buddy over Discord, so this is an awful problem. \n- As soon as you come near Chen it starts playing Japanese music LOUDLY. You can't hear what he's saying. If it's meant as a joke it doesn't come off that way - it seems more like Pathea doesn't know how to handle sound levels. \n- You sleep with your eyes open. Couldn't get us to close our eyes?\n- Campfire's scale appears to be too large, even in terms of texture.\n- When you make armor it goes into the equipment tab not your armor tab!!!\n- Grammar: in Carter's inventory, you can buy \"the poisonous blood\". First of all, none of your other items have \"the\" in the title. Secondly, all the others have capital first letters. \n- Want to swap items on hotbar? They just overwrite. Seems small, but this is a simple thing to do.\n- I thought, at first, your poor collision models were funny. I see all these giant structures I'd like to jump on, but I just lamely clip right through solid objects. So crappy. \n- Atmospheric and musical sounds just go away sometimes, for a few minutes. It's akin to a talented but distracted child just wandering out of the room now and again, or suddenly singing too loudly (see sound bug below). \n- Breaking up stacks... Can I just please hold shift or something? \n- Stuttering!!!!!!! The game just plain stutters every 20-30 seconds. I haven't been able to find a fix for this.

From mining the terrain to collect resources, to crafting, colony creation and NPC recruitment, to being able to build your structures, weapons, armor, helicopters, jets, motorcycles and tanks, and even your very own Kitchen sink how you wish. \n\nPE utilizes a fully minable voxel world, along with a building and creation system that lets you bring your imagination to life. \n\n[b]*The voxel creation system.[/b] You can build weapons, vehicles, and even armor through a voxel creation system that let's you shape, color, and even texturize. Not only create them, but use them ingame for their determined roles.\n\n[b]*Colony NPC recruitment.[/b] While there are plenty of games out there that have colony management, It's noteworthy to mention that recruiment in PE is about finding randomly generated npcs (aswell as pre-made npcs if you're playing story mode), that you can recruit into your colony for different roles. You can have them farm, gather resources, upgrade equipment, or patrol your colony to protect it from assailants. You may equip them as you wish, and even recruit them as followers to acompany on your journey. They all have unique appearences along with names (The names list is a bit short at the moment though..). They also come with their own sets of skills that you can have them train other colonists to have aswell.\n\n[b]*Sandbox Creative Storymode.[/b] This is a big one.. Pathea has created a sandbox creation game that includes a storymode, without any cut functionality from adventure mode. Not only have they done this, but they've also gone and made it multiplayer. You can either play this on a public server, or host a private game with friends only!\n\n[b]*NPC combat AI.[/b]\nMonsters have been programmed to act according to what they are, rather than a default all-round AI slapped onto everything.. One creature will not engage the same as any other. Birds will keep distance, and swoop at their pray, or come in close temporary for a close range attack before swooping away..  Different bird creatures will even do this differently than others.. Not only do they have their own AI packages, but they also have their own animations specifically designed around them. \n\nHumanoid NPC's, followers and colonists, utilize the different tools and weapons you give them based on situation. For example, you can give a follower a sword and shield, and they will engage into melee, until their hp gets low, in which they will withdraw a distance from the enemy. If you've given them a ranged weapon aswell, they will draw their bow or gun and continue firing at the enemy from a distance, while they heal. If they have an axe in their inventory, they will aid you in cutting down trees.\n\n\nIf you have an inkling for design, and would love to see your very own creations have a purpose and use in a sandbox world, Planet Explorers is a must!", "timestamp_created": 1466468102, "timestamp_updated": 1480035285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 92, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851435363292694092", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31510825": {"recommendationid": "31510825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006682026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 18397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7455, "last_played": 1499088261}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought Planet Explorers during a sale and did not touch it for a long time, but as soon as I started I just wanted to continue playing. There are not that much games that keep me playing long into the night.\n\nI think this game is a highly underrated one. You can mostly compare it to Minecraft, but with Story mode and built using an older version of Unity Engine (but still looking good enough for me). \n\nCompared with \"hardcore\" survival games like 7 Days to Die, the survival aspect is not developed that much. You need to eat but not trink, you need to defend your camp but the game gives you strong weapons to do that. So it is not that \"hardcore\" but a lot more relaxing, and that's a good thing for me. You can enjoy exploring the land, hunt some animals, grow plants, build houses.... I like it.\n\nThe base building system is easily the best I ever saw in any game. You can choose between blocks or voxels to place, you can choose shape (round, triangle, cube etc...), size and texture of the blocks, you can place several at once, rotate them, you can undo your last few placed blocks... you can even save complete buildings as blueprints to quickly build a copy of it. Absolutely awesome.\n\nAnd I'm not even starting with the ingame item creation editor. Do you want to design your own sword, gun, vehicle or helicopter? Do you want to customize it completely, pixel by pixel? You can, if you are creative enough (I'm not. :)) Every creation has some fixed parts that need to be placed (a sword needs a hilt), the rest is up to you. The damage of the sword comes from the material you choose (wood swords are worse than steel swords) and from the amount of material you use.\n\nCombine this with NPCs that offer quests (you that you have a reason to do or craft something) you get a survival/exploration/base building game that offers great value for your money. I even like it more than Minecraft.\n\nSure, it could use some polishing. Unity 4 games should not drop below 30 frames (7 Days to Die Alpha 10-11 never did using this engine), there should be options to change color saturation (everything looks a bit bright and colorful for my taste) and programming could be a bit more smooth (first game start after PC is started is without problems and the game runs smooth, but if I quit the game and restart it, second start takes forever and ingame autosaves makes the game freeze for about 3 seconds. I need to shut down the PC completely to fix that). But hey, it's only 20 Euros... I leave more money at the cinema for a two hours movie and popcorn.\n\nMultiplayer is very entertaining (coop story mode and sandbox mode) but suffers from some sync problems. Sometimes you miss some of the other players animation, if you talk to an NPC the other does not see the dialogue, and setting up a dedicated server is a little bit tricky, but it works. Too bad that no one seems to play this game online any more, so you need to bring a friend or two.\n\nShort form: I'd give this game 8/10.

Build a base, populate and grow it.  Make weapons, vehicles etc.  Explore the world and search for resources such as ores and plants that are found in certain terrains, then use them to craft everything you need based on schematics you earn or buy from npc's.\n\nWhat it does right, it does very right.  What it does wrong, is horrifically bad.\n\nYou can craft almost anything you can imagine.  Guns, vehicles, buildings, etc.  You make them.  All of them.  There are very few premades available in the game so you must make what you want or find the plans another player made.  If you are creative, you can make almost anything.  If you aren't and don't find other players plans, you shouldn't bother with this game.  A year ago, there were numerous ISO's for everything you could imagine, but now there are very few since updates have broken previous ISO's and creators stopped making and updating them.\n\nVehicles include cars, bikes, planes, helicopters, boats, submarines, etc.  They all share one thing in common.  Movement with them sucks.  Real bad.  Helicopters can't seem to fly above the trees and that would be fine if they didn't get stuck on the trees if you hit one.  The ground is so uneven that any ground transport bounces all over the place and hits everything in sight, or just flat out gets destroyed from bouncing and hitting the ground constantly.  Turning vehicles is not as easy as you would think and often times hitting an object, backing up turning, then turning more going forward still results in you hitting the exact same object.  Vehicles can get stuck on the ground, on the plants, on rocks, etc.  Most areas of the map are actually faster to walk through than attempt to use a vehicle.  Drive into anything and your vehicle gets damaged.  Park near a predator and they will attack your vehicle until it is destroyed or they die.  Fly a helicopter into a flying creature you didn't see because of lag and who knows, maybe it stalls and you drop to the ground and die while your helicopter blows up into pieces and leaves you stranded there.\n\nThe map is a limited use abstract with very little details but does allow fast movement between discovered points.  The scanner map shows you more of the terrain, but is very difficult to decipher if you are looking for ore and quickly becomes useless if you are digging into a ore vein since it clutters up rapidly.  \n\nLighting is almost useless since personal lights point directly forward with no means to use them to light up areas above, below or to the side of the character.\n\nNPC ai is getting better but followers still get stuck on terrain sometimes and can easily be lost when you are crossing a long distance.\n\nCombat is very basic with melee attack only or manually shooting a weapon.\n\nMost quests are easily completed but some hunting quests give you only a name of a creature that is useless if you haven't been playing long enough to figure out what the different creatures are.  Some creatures for hunting quests are also difficult to find since they can be very rare creatures or travel around a lot.\n\nUpdates are fairly slow in coming, but progress has been significant in the last year.   Crashes still happen fairly often but autosave keeps you from losing more than a couple minutes of progress so they are a minor problem.  \n\nOverall, the potential for this game is great, but it does need more work to be really enjoyable.  Mostly the vehicle controls and ground smoothing hamper the game at this point.  When it takes forever to walk from known areas to new mission areas, it gets tedious fast when you know a vehicle would be faster, but are so not worth the trouble to use.", "timestamp_created": 1448277529, "timestamp_updated": 1448277529, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 166, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841371893882751465", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41541265": {"recommendationid": "41541265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038051417", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 43297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24656, "last_played": 1709879503}, "language": "english", "review": "[url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/237870/discussions/0/3288067088104099365/]Full review here.[/url].  Stupid character limit.\n\nAfter owning this game for five years and watching most of the development cycle I finally finished story mode last night.  I've also put quite a few hours into the game so I guess it's time to write a review. A quick list of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Amazing creation system.  Create aircraft, ships, submarines, ground vehicles, character equipment, buildings, even FURNITURE, for crying out loud, down to the last minute detail.\n[*]Share your creations with others and download theirs.\n[*]100% deformable terrain.  You can mine and terraform to your heart's content.\n[*]Decent storyline.\n[*]Beautifully hand-crafted story mode world and procedurally generated worlds up to 40km x 40km.\n[*]A variety of distinct biomes, each with its own terrain, flora, and fauna.\n[*]Lots of fun weapons and gadgets\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Lacks the polish you'd expect to see from a 'finished' title.\n[*]No mod support of which I'm aware.\n[*]Combat system feels halfway done and not very satisfying.\n[*]Vehicle mechanics are unrealistic and clunky, especially submarines.\n[*]End game balance issues.\n[*]Voice overs and localization need work.\n[*]Optimization issues.\n[/list]\n\n[b]The TL;DR is that Planet Explorers is a sci-fi survival sandbox of the purest form.  It's a creator's paradise.  It has futuristic technology and pew pew.  And it's finished, but not really finished.  What started as an ambitious project somewhere along the way collided head-on with the realities of game development.  The result is a game that's fun to play but leaves you wondering what it would be if they'd had the time and money to finish it.  Normally I'd pan a 'finished' title so lacking in polish, but I can't recommend PE strongly enough.[/b]\n\nWhen the developers announced the final release of Planet Explorers in 2016 I was angry.  I'd watched for years as this game went through development and though the progress wasn't as fast as any avid player would have liked, it was steady.  When the final version was released it still contained lots of half-finished features and bugs that had plagued the game throughout its development.  It seemed at the time like they were just throwing their hands up in the air and saying, \"Screw it, let's put a wrapper on it and call it done.\"  That impression stayed with me until last night.  \n\nAfter finishing the storyline I read others' thoughts on how it ended.  In [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/237870/discussions/0/276237094331797388/]one comment thread[/url] I saw, one of the developers explained the situation:  They had wanted to continue development but the reality of the industry is that you have to have cash to do so.  Consequently they had to move on to another project to keep the bills paid.  \n\nIt also occurred to me after reading this that all through the development process the team had been more communicative than most development teams, not just posting dev logs but interacting with players and answering specific questions.  [b]My general impression is of a development team that loves this game as much as the players do and wanted just as badly as we did for it to be more than it ended up being.[/b]\n\nIt's because of this that while my review of an unfinished-feeling 'finished' title would normally be a screed about greedy producers rushing an unfinished product to market to milk the cash cow, in this case I sympathize.  I know that PE2 is a possiblity and I truly hope that they get to do it the way they wanted to do this one.  I'll be waiting, cash in hand.\n\nPlanet Explorers was an ambitious project that like so many other early access titles coulda, woulda, and shoulda but didn't.  Unlike many titles, however, I don't feel like it was because they didn't wanna.\n\nIf you like sandboxes, buy this game.

I wouldn't have described it as release quality however.\n\nBefore I say anything more I should probably say I only play offline/single player. With that said the one 'campaign' that ships with the game while not 100% bug free (And how many games are 100% bug free these days?) is pretty well done, the terrain is well made, the progression is steady and it doesn't take long to learn how to play and to reach your goals. There are one or two areas that could do with sharpening. \n\nA large amount of work is placed on the player to create their own vehicles. Yet the tools don't take into account mass, center of gravity, etc. And yet once plaed into the world both of these are pretty essential. Furthermore when using the templates that the game gives you to - I assume - get you started, they either come with parts you have yet to unlock, or don't work as expected. Case in point: The quest was to deliver an NPC to another area, she suggests that now you have unlocked some of the boat parts that you should build a boat to take her to the place she's going.\n\nI'm not a boat builder... so I used the templete provided within the system. The boat it produces looks amazing, however most of the parts used are still locked, having removed those parts or replaced them with the parts I can actually create, the boat will barely move without turning turtle. In the end I make a simple log raft that works pretty well instead.\n\nOften the obvious mistakes are like this, oversights as opposed to actual bugs or poor design decisions.\n\nThe game as it stands has three 'modes'. Campaign mode (as mentioned above), Adventure Mode & Creative Mode\n\nAdventure mode is as far as I can tell there to show you how much better campaign mode is. It's full of bugs and overall badly designed.\n\nCreative Mode is fun for about five minutes, until you realise that while you can build anything you want, you can't interact with the world as there are no animals or NPCs.\n\nThe game is officially now a full release, but if you want to try it in it's current state just pretend it's still in beta. It's not polished enough or infact complete enough (to my mind) to be called a finished product.

So they will not pick it up in case a friend of theirs sees it in their library and judges them non adults or some other social convention i dont fully understand.\n    Ill tell you what keeps me playing though, this game rocks! and dirts! and sands! and you can craft almost anything you can imagine.

The music is shite (its easy enough to turn off though), and the grass is distracting at best (the blades are too fat, and obscure the terrain too well imho) but again, easy enough to turn off...

Sadly that feeling dropped after about 16 hours of gaming.\n\nEverything got repetitive and pointless really fast.

They are just repetitive corridors fulfilled of monster where you get the loot just running through the enemies (ignoring them) and picking up the the loot crates  (mobs and bosses never drop useful stuffs).\n\nThere is no real boss fight and when your colony is under siege, all the defensive work is made by the turrets you've placed all around.\n\nThere is no reason to do real coop. Even the exploration.\nYou can craft huge vehicles to carry all your party members... but ground vehicles are useless (they got stuck in the terrain every 30 meters) and flying vehicles are boring AS HELL.\n\n\nEven when  I found an entertaining way to travel (that is JetPack + glider) the exploration got boring pretty fast. You'll find soon that there is no real danger (you can overrun every creature), no real mystery and not a real rewarding aspect of exploring the world. Even the creatures are always the same. They can change shape and size but the behaviour patterns are the same used over and over.\n\nEven death is not a big deal in this game. You can't really die. You just respawn with everything you have. Damn.. at least take out my stuff and make me get it back where I've died.\n\n\nThe real fun I got from this game is crafting.

My point is, I honestly believe that my search has\ncome to an end. \n\nThis game is amazing. It has the creativity aspect I longed for, it has the construction\nI wanted.

All games have them and this is no exception.

THIS is the direction open world sandbox games should be taking!\n\nI enjoy survival and crafting games, but the biggest problem most of them have is a total lack of purpose beyond simply not dying. \n\nThey usually very quickly become boring and repetative because in game life, even more than real life, mere continued existence is simply insufficient as a motivator for the endless tedium and overly-elaborate crafting systems that lazy developers throw at us in order to disguise the fact that there is only a sketch of a premise for these events to be occuring as they do, or worse, no premise for their game and the player's reason for being there at all.\n\nToo many times have I played such games and tossed them aside because it's just another \"I'm here, because I'm here, because I'm here, because I'm here...\" game. Pointless. Useless. Devoid of purpose or meaning. You may of course have that experience with this game too, if you wish to do so in Adventure mode, etc., but I prefer having some story.\n\nPlanet Explorers is not one of those pointless games. Playing through story mode once just racked up 96.8 hours of interesting and fun gameplay for me. \n\nWhile the dialogue and voice-overs themselves are bit on the amateurish side, the scope and breadth of the story as well as the concepts it seeks to convey are actually quite impressive even by triple-A title standards. Every effort you go to has a purpose. Has meaning. Right from the very beginning.\n\nConstructive purpose, no less. This is important, as most of these kinds of game when they have a premise at all, it is based solely around defense against onslaught by one kind of ravening hoard or other after the apocalyptic downfall of all human civilization. Usually lame-ass zombies.\n\nTo be sure, Planet Explorers also takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. It just wasn't our apocalypse, or our world. Yet.\n\nThe story has a little bit of everything. Humor and meloncholy sadness. Drama and light-hearted fun. Treachery, betrayal, vengeance. The triumph of hard-earned peace and safety along with the horrors and loss of a senseless war no one involved can afford.\n\nThe thrill of real exploration and survival in a harsh environment with the odds stacked against you from the start. Not because of one single reason or agenda, but because half a dozen agendas or more and the chain of events they set in motion converge to create an unforseeable disaster from the viewpoint of any one group.\n\nWhy are you chopping down a tree with this dinky little starting cleaver? Because old Gerdy was in the lifeboat with you and didn't fair as well in the crash. Now you have to craft a shovel to dig up the medical supplies that got buried when you came down.\n\nWhy are you bothering to design your own armed aluminum hovercraft in the creations editor? Because you can sneeze a hole in wood and besides, you want your colonists to look badass when they fly four of them in during their show of force for the Puja in your efforts to bring them to the negotiation table for a peace treaty.\n\nThe game actually strikes a very good balance in the players themselves between the impulse to get more done so they can see more of the story and the knowledge that they must pace themselves, or be caught unprepared at a crucial turn of events in that storyline. A story which has a lot of twists and turns that most often really are very much an unexpected surprise, which is almost always based around a 'Big Thought' concept.\n\nThat's hard to find in nearly any genre of entertainment these days, much less a survival/sandbox/crafting game. This is stuff you usually only see handled in any way by hard and high-level Sci-Fi novels. And even then, only rarely are so many disparate such concepts brought into play for one story.\n\nI would love to see the implied sequal made and would happily buy it in early access. \n\nThese developers did this the way games should be done. They created a world and a story, then built a game around that, rather than building a game, THEN hiring writer to give it an excuse for existing, automatically hobbling any creativity or flexibility in the resulting story, or it's method of delivery.\n\nI could be wrong about that, but even if I am, I must still credit them based on the grounds of their giving the writer(s) a great deal of freedom to tell an interesting story with their platform.\n\nI mean really, when was the last time you actually CARED about your NPC colonists in a game? Knew them by name, personality and profession? Sorrowed if they died, beyond a mere loss in your colony's efficency or production or some such?\n\nStory matters. Purpose in this kind of gameplay matters. Yes the game has some minor faults, but they are made less obvious and more minor because of the engaging story and sense of exploration. Easily overlooked.\n\nGame developers who wonder why their games are being ripped apart in reviews by players on techincalities of gameplay mechanics need to look at this game and realize that the reason it's happening to them, is because they have offered the players nothing else by which to experience or evaluate their games.\n\nNo Man's Sky being perhaps the most recent and glaring example of this downward trend on a lazy treadmill. A game which reached legendary status as and has subsequently become synonamous with the very concepts of nihilistic futility and uselessness of effort.\n\nThis game really does make you feel like you are exploring a new and interesting world, while still lacking in enough specific detail to allow players to fill in the blanks with roleplay if they like, or just fleshing out in their own minds for fun because the concepts and scenario are compelling to think about.\n\nThis game was on sale when I bought it, but it would be well worth the money to experience, even at full price.

Well actually the money at the start of the game is Meat so all enemies you kill increases your money. The story will lead you though the races and history of the Planet Maria that you have crash landed on. \n\nThe story is okay though most that happens is well broadcast beforehand.  Where your main role is building a colony to gather and train npcs in skills to help in defending the colony from attacks. Building a well defended colony with lots of defending turrets as well as reliable npcs. Planet Explorers makes digging tunnels or excavating underground bunkers easy, even diverting flowing water to your colony.  \n\nTo help with this the game has a creation engine in which you can create almost anything from weapons, vehicles, buildings even furniture all depending on inspiration. Something you have created, can be used at anytime if you have the required resources. So although you could craft a massive diamond sabre or golden crossbow you probably won't find those resources early in a story game. Though the games scanning engine helps to find and to dig down to the spot of the resources your looking for.\n\nThe story and quests are quite simplistic but it has a lovely vibe and has been fun to play, getting to use a glider and fly across the landscape can be quite rewarding.", "timestamp_created": 1576107546, "timestamp_updated": 1576107817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800587058067321777", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13228239": {"recommendationid": "13228239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058465036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 2168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1761, "last_played": 1425215330}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent addition to the sandbox adventure/miner sub-genre, Planet Explorers is, in a nutshell, what people who fell for the hype over StarForge were and still are looking for.\n\nWhere Starbound is basically Terraria in space, Planet Explorers has that same relationship with Minecraft but manages to be better. While Minecraft uses block-based voxels to construct its landscapes, Planet Explorers uses OpenCL. This enables the terrain to be just as malleable as that of Minecraft, but look a damn sight better. Though admittedly OpenCL, being a prototype, has a few bugs, one of which is that vehicles travelling at high speed over rough ground have a tendency to clip through the terrain as of 0.85. That said, the bugs present in the alpha of Planet Explorers, albeit slightly frustrating at times, are easily more forgivable than those in [i]certain AAA games[/i] (*stares viciously at EA and Ubisoft*) and barely put a scratch into the rest of the game.\n\nStory mode is easily the best of the three game modes, the other two being Adventure (basically Minecraft Survival) and Build (creative mode). Beneath the magnificent visuals - not to mention the aliens themselves (which look [i]slightly[/i] less silly than those in Starbound) - there is a surprisingly well-crafted storyline with interesting lore and bright characters to explore. Item crafting in Story is tiered depending on how far you are into the story, with simple wooden equipment available for use at the start and more powerful armour and weapons being available for manufacture later on.\n\nSpeaking of crafting, Planet Explorers has what far too few games of this genre have in my honest opinion - a fleshed-out  and incredibly detailed item creation system that is easily mastered to boot. One can create a huge amount of useful, fully personalised items and vehicles - swords, guns, bikes, tanks, helicopters, boats and airborne dreadnoughts, to name but a few. Unfortunately, it is not possible to create custom tools or armour, and firearms are limited to pistols, assault rifles and laser rifles (but this might change soon). Nonetheless, Planet Explorers' powerful item creation system gives it a big leverage over other games of its genre.\n\nTo conclude: do I recommend this game? Of course I do.

At the moment PE is a great construction platform where you can test your creations inside the game environment. \n\nThat said i am missing alot of tools to be able to make better shapes then you can create right now, or only in very difficult and complicated/timeconsuming ways. While i have alot of time and patience myself, i can see why many players don't really try to make nice looking creations, but only stuff 'to get the job done'. Physics are off too in the game, so that makes it even more complicated, for example leveling a ship so it doesn't tilt, or a car getting stuck on every little bump in-world ect. pp.\nI get more to the physics later on.\n\nThe Storymode is fun, because it shows you the mechanics of the game, and introduces you to the basics (and more). At first it can be a little bit confusing when you start in the ship over the planet, but with a little patience you can overcome that.\n\nI didn't play multiplayer very long, because it crashed all the time with memory overflow errors. guess i bought it at a time where they just updated the game from 0.86 to 0.87 and a major bug or bugs kept the game crashing for me. I don't want to get too much into detail what it was, but they fixed that pretty fast in 0.871 so it was playable again. That said, you will run out of memory in adventure mode fast when you travel around alot because the game is still 32-bit, which means that you only have about 3 GB of memory for the game, which is not enough for a long playtime, specially when traveling around alot. (The Textures don't  seem to be updated, they just get added until you crash when you run out of memory space.) I can play story mode in nearly best quality for a long time before things go wrong though.\n\nThe developers are working on a version they call 0.9 which has 64-bit and the new Unity 5 engine, which hopefully solves that memory problem. \n\nGameplay: (i am talking about story mode now, because that is what i usually play:)\n\nAlthough it is alot of fun to play the story, you can see and feel that there is still a lot of work to be done to get the game into more then an alpha stage. i don't really need perfect combat animations, ( they promise to change the combat in 0.9, we'll see), but the world, as pretty as it looks at first glance, becomes pretty uninteresting after a couple hours of gameplay. it just lacks a certain... detail here and there. I think i can explain that to myself reading from others that it's a small team programming the game. How much more detail there will be later on nobody can predict at this point. I also have to put in the fact that the game came out 2 years ago, but they are still working on it, so i see that actually as a positive aspect, keeping a small team in mind.\n\nHowever, there are huge differences in graphics quality that i cannot explain: The animals look GREAT, i mean GREAT GREAT... the area around them for now is more like average compared to them. The animations could be better, but for my taste are more then good enough to make them feel very much alive. The plants, trees and so on on the other hand don't move at all, they are like statues, and if you hit a smaller tree with your ride, it gets damaged and that small tree doesnt move at all getting hit by a 50 t  4x4 tank ;-) . \nPhysics are still lacking here big time, and that is only one example of the physics not really working right atm. I hope they fixe those things later on. \nThe currency in story mode is 'meat', which is... something getting used to. I suggested 'protein' for a supplement, and i got a response they consider it. We'll see :-)  (this is another indicator they take your input seriously)\n\nFrom what i hear they use cash or credit for multiplayer, which is something people just are more accustomed to in games... why just not keep it that way? I never played a game before that uses 2 different currencys in different game modes, and it just complicates things...\nI understand they want to make the story mode more like a survival game mode, but just using a currency that sort of suggests that isn't enough imho. Don't make currency you can eat... no other food at home? just eat some dollar bills! :-)\n\nThat gets me to the fact that i never really feel it being a struggle to survive. At all. You must be pretty dumb or very unlucky to die in story mode. (Running into animals you don't know if they attack or not for example... You can avoid those animals quiet easily.) You cannot starve to death, you just run out of stamina and you get slower. That's it. You cannot dehydrate, you don't need to drink. For me those are basics for a survival game, aren't they? \n\nI don't really see that myself as a big disatvantage, because i like to play in easy mode(s), so it's more of a relaxed gameplay rather then hectic fighting. Getting old.... ;-) But i am sure it will bother other people. Games like \"7 days to die\" do a better job on that: you take damage if you run out of food and/or water plus you run out of stamina while using tools, even more so when you are out of food.\ntalking about 7 days:\n\n [spoiler]On the flipside i don't like those zombies in 7 days (again personal preference), i would prefer dangerous animals that prey on you and that you cannot avoid as easily as in Planet Explorers. But that's another game and another story. I just hope that someday they make a game where the good parts of both games will come together the way i like to play a survival game... :-) [/spoiler]\n\nback to PE:\n\nSpoiler alert: [spoiler] The whole mode shows you how to build a colony at some point, and you can build a monorail later on, which keeps you busy for a while. But survival? Not really at this point. The colony system with planing / harvesting food seems unbalanced and not really needed at all atm, because you cannot die of starvation, you just run out of stamina, and you get slower, that's it. I have a pretty fast computer (i7 3.5 ghz with GTX 770 Nvidia), and my colony is down to about 25 - 30 frames now because of the farming simulation, That really shows it needs alot of optimisation. [/spoiler]\n\nI would prefer they start optimizing things (balancing, physics better framerates) and make the planet look more alive then filing on combat moves. But that is just a personal preference...\n\nI got this game for 50% only a little while ago for 12,50 dollars. (daily deal), otherwise i would have waited longer to buy it. I am happy i got it, i enjoy it alot, even with the shortcomings it still has right now, and as you could see i use it mostly to create stuff. Love that part to death. For 24.99 dollars it's still a good value if you enjoy the story part, which takes you about 20-25 hours to finish (rough guess, depends on many things how long you need for it), and i played that one 2 times alone, because you have the freedom to do it in many ways. Use your imagination.\n\nOh and one important tip: finish the missions one by one, that keeps you out of trouble with bugs. I don't want to go into detail because of spoiler alert and too long of a story :-)\n\nI hope you find my pov helpful, thx for reading!", "timestamp_created": 1428851204, "timestamp_updated": 1428855868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794451773166656494", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30682684": {"recommendationid": "30682684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042327429", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2035, "last_played": 1482571963}, "language": "english", "review": "As others have expressed, I really tried hard to like this game, but it all feels very underdeveloped and unrefined. After playing this game for over 30 hours or so, I wanted to compile a list of things that I had a problem with, for those hesitant about purchasing this game as I have.\n\n*LONG load times: Regardless of which mode you play on (Story, Adventure, Build), you'll find yourself having to fast-travel around the large maps provided. However, each and every time you fast travel, the game has to load in. I've experienced loading times as long as 5 minutes or more and in worst case scenarioes, even had to reload an autosave after the game froze \\ crashed. \n\nI understand that games do need to load in lots of data at a time, but having to wait so long just to get back to my colony is ridiculous and tiresome.\n\n*\"Story\" Mode needs more STORY and character development: I cannot stress enough that there needs to be more STORY in Story Mode. When you first begin Story Mode, it will give you an introduction cutscene showing you and a group of colonists travel the stars on board of a starship. Only moments later, some kind of event triggers and you and your shipmates get shot down and crash land on an alien planet, where you have to survive on. \n\nThe story then thrusts itself upon you as you pick up the pieces. The characters that you meet say that they have met you on board the ship you came in from, but use the stupid excuse that, \"Oh you must have hit your head and forgot who I am\" thing, over and over again. I'm sorry \"Gerdy\" and \"Dr. Allen,\" but I don't know who the HELL you guys are, as the game never gave me much of a chance to meet you prior to this event.\n\n*The voice acting is TERRIBLE: After the introduction cutscene in Story Mode, you'll quickly notice that after talking with the first NPC you see how robotic and how stale and flat-toned the voice acting is. Most people you talk with in conversation don't even sound like a human in real life voiced them; i.e. they sound like a voice similar to Microsoft Sam. It honestly sounds like the voice actors recorded in the bathroom stall at their studio \\ home. \n\nThis is an issue because with a game focused on \"Story\" and \"Character Development,\" it's really hard to get immersed with all these different characters you meet along the way with the dialog so bland and boring. Either hire more talented voice actors or allow us to read text-only dialog, like in Adventure Mode. \n\n*The same BGM (background music) over and over: You can count with one hand the amount of BGMs that are in this game, as there aren't many to go with. It's not so bad at first, but after a few hours you begin to resent the music so much that you eventually disable the music altogether. \n\n*The majority of the questing is BORING: If you've played an MMORPG before, you know the routine: go from Point A to Point B, collect and kill stuff, and turn the quest in. If that's something that interests you, though, then this game will be great for you, as there are a PLETHORA of these type of quests.\n\n*Monster fighting is BORING: Enemies come in 2 varieties, just 2: Charge and attack you straight on with maybe 1-2 abilities, or ARMAGEDDON TERRORS that shoot laser beams and missiles at you. \n\nThe enemies that just charge and attack you may have some abilities that also knock you around literally like a rag doll. Fight with enemies that use knockback are as follows: hit them a few times, dodge roll back, hit them a few times, etc. Repeat this and you win.\n\nThen there are some enemies that are like if Godzilla fused with a Gundam and proceed to start a mini-war with you. If you're playing on Normal like I did, they a virtually impossible to kill, unless you have great gear, a vehicle with weapons on it, or an hour or two in real life to spare taking it down.\n\nThat's not even to mention that one of the only \"difficult\" parts about the enemies is that some of them can take A LOT of damage, e.i. they are damage sponges. \n\n*Skill tree system extremely limits to what you can or can't do: In Story Mode, you don't have the opportunity to use the skill tree system as you are with Adventure Mode, so when I saw the option, I thought to myself, \"Oh cool! This should make the game more fun!\" ..... It didn't and made it pretty frustrating at times.\n\nThe skill tree system in Planet Explorers uses skill points that you can allocate to different skills, such as mining / chopping faster, gaining more materials doing those, doing more damage with weapons, etc. You get these skill points by killing monsters(2-8 SP each), mining(1-2 each node), chopping trees down(1-2 each tree), etc.\n\nMaybe you think to yourself, \"Well, the map is a pretty big place to just be walking around only, so I'll go get the parts and make a vehicle to ride around in!\" You take the time to gather everything you need, maybe even pimp out a custom vehicle ride in the vehicle creator. When you try to \"Export\" the vehicle into the game, though, you'll quickly realize that you need a specific SKILL to even Export something from the creator to in-game (which will cost you hundreds of skill points to farm up to that point). So say you farmed up everything and got the skill to Export the vehicle to the game. You place down your sweet ride and you're about to ride it, but OH WAIT! You need the specific skill to even DRIVE the damn thing (costs another 90 skill points). You see where I'm getting at?\n\nTo even do the most basic gameplay functions requires you to unlock specific skills within the different skill trees. Can't use your new tool or weapon? Get the skill for it. Can't use a specific type of building block or building block shape? Get the skill for it. So on, and so on.\n\nI have played many sandbox survival games for many years and this is the first time I've seen such a system as appalling as this system. If you're playing this game on Adventure Mode, make sure to uncheck this broken system and just stick with the default.\n\n*Food and sleep meter doesn't have much of an impact to gameplay: I never once felt, during my 30+ hours of playing, that the food and sleep meters had any significant consequence against me. I never had the thought that, \"Well, my food meter is almost depleted. I better go eat something before I starve to death.\" There's doesn't seem to be any weight or impact of the gameplay with the current food / sleep meters, other than just losing some stats temporarily.\n\n*NPC Followers and NPC colonists never shut up: This is just a minor point, but every time either an NPC follower or NPC colonists is in need of something, they will vocally tell you that they are in need of it. (I.e. \"I need more ammo!\" or \"I'm too sleepy to work!\").

Build a base, populate and grow it. Make weapons, vehicles etc. Explore the world and search for resources such as ores and plants that are found in certain terrains, then use them to craft everything you need based on schematics you earn or buy from npc's.\n\nWhat it does right, it does very right. What it does wrong, is horrifically bad.\n\nYou can craft almost anything you can imagine. Guns, vehicles, buildings, etc. You make them. All of them. There are very few premades available in the game so you must make what you want or find the plans another player made. If you are creative, you can make almost anything. If you aren't and don't find other players plans, you shouldn't bother with this game. A year ago, there were numerous ISO's for everything you could imagine, but now there are very few since updates have broken previous ISO's and creators stopped making and updating them.\n\nVehicles include cars, bikes, planes, helicopters, boats, submarines, etc. They all share one thing in common. Movement with them sucks. Real bad. Helicopters can't seem to fly above the trees and that would be fine if they didn't get stuck on the trees if you hit one. The ground is so uneven that any ground transport bounces all over the place and hits everything in sight, or just flat out gets destroyed from bouncing and hitting the ground constantly. Turning vehicles is not as easy as you would think and often times hitting an object, backing up turning, then turning more going forward still results in you hitting the exact same object. Vehicles can get stuck on the ground, on the plants, on rocks, etc. Most areas of the map are actually faster to walk through than attempt to use a vehicle. Drive into anything and your vehicle gets damaged. Park near a predator and they will attack your vehicle until it is destroyed or they die. Fly a helicopter into a flying creature you didn't see because of lag and who knows, maybe it stalls and you drop to the ground and die while your helicopter blows up into pieces and leaves you stranded there.\n\nThe map is a limited use abstract with very little details but does allow fast movement between discovered points. The scanner map shows you more of the terrain, but is very difficult to decipher if you are looking for ore and quickly becomes useless if you are digging into a ore vein since it clutters up rapidly. \n\nLighting is almost useless since personal lights point directly forward with no means to use them to light up areas above, below or to the side of the character.\n\nNPC ai is getting better but followers still get stuck on terrain sometimes and can easily be lost when you are crossing a long distance.\n\nCombat is very basic with melee attack only or manually shooting a weapon.\n\nMost quests are easily completed but some hunting quests give you only a name of a creature that is useless if you haven't been playing long enough to figure out what the different creatures are. Some creatures for hunting quests are also difficult to find since they can be very rare creatures or travel around a lot.\n\nUpdates are fairly slow in coming, but progress has been significant in the last year. Crashes still happen fairly often but autosave keeps you from losing more than a couple minutes of progress so they are a minor problem. \n\nOverall, the potential for this game is great, but it does need more work to be really enjoyable. Mostly the vehicle controls and ground smoothing hamper the game at this point. When it takes forever to walk from known areas to new mission areas, it gets tedious fast when you know a vehicle would be faster, but are so not worth the trouble to use.\n\nEDIT: I have played over 100 hours before I got this game on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1467722969, "timestamp_updated": 1470341993, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78036201000213623", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34763796": {"recommendationid": "34763796", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985745942", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 892, "last_played": 1487855673}, "language": "english", "review": "The game could have been excellent, however it suffers from mercurial developers who refuse to complete it because it won't make them more money, like typical avaricious early access indies they have no loyalty or care for the people who bought their game early on in good faith that it would be completed.\n\nDo not buy this game and be very wary of Pathea's future projects as it's very likely they will be abandoned once they feel like they have enough money to cut and run as well.", "timestamp_created": 1504642277, "timestamp_updated": 1504642277, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778233587741851807", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137144070": {"recommendationid": "137144070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071124188", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 7148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7148, "last_played": 1565028965}, "language": "english", "review": "You may wonder why I have over a 100 hours in this burning bag of crap.

I wish these guys would have had the funding or team to bring this to it's full potential, but as it is now as a \"full\" game, I simply can't recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1485448293, "timestamp_updated": 1485448293, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.775194346904754639", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99500814": {"recommendationid": "99500814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035495353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1420030988}, "language": "english", "review": "Abandonware. \n\nCould have been great.", "timestamp_created": 1631885911, "timestamp_updated": 1631885911, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.774616241455078125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32401833": {"recommendationid": "32401833", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978655244", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 28629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26164, "last_played": 1532416324}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh, Planet Explorers. The potential you had.  When it first popped up, it seemed like a decent Minecraft clone, with some MMO bits for good measure. And it even has a thing which allows you to design your own vehicles! ( Seriously, aside from prefab wheels and an annoyingly large cockpit, you make the rest out of voxels, and you can even use your own materials!) I've lost hours and hours to that vehicle creation system. \n\nBut the game itself? Pretty bland, actually. The characters are dull, the voiceovers are pathetically awful, and the AI is just... Well, the 'I' doesn't stand for 'intelligence' here. \n\nThere's also graphical issues aplenty, weird inconsistencies with the characters ( Like for eaxmple how some have voiceovers and some do not, some will give you the same quest over and over again, etc.) Also, the weather seems to sporadically decide whether your structures can block water or not. Vehicles randomly flip for no reason, and there's no way to adjust the turning radius of the cars. Flying is.... Interesting, to say the least. \n\nIt's really a shame with a lot of this because the story ( And there IS a story) gets interesting as you get deeper into it.

It is a mix of survival, RPG and voxel crafting/building. The story is very good (although it can be played sandbox mode) and the crafting possibilities are almost endless. You can custom design everything from armour, weapons and vehicles to building panels and decorations, imported textures/skins and all.\n\nEventhough the building/creative aspect is massive, you can download other player's creations if you are not creative yourself.\n\nIt is still in developement so there are things simply unfinished like the story mode and it has some bugs and optimization issues but these get better with every patch and the devs are very active. The game has been around for years, but it is HUGE. Even the current content is more than any other EA I know of and it is getting bigger.\n\nThe gameplay is super fun, unique and rewarding. Where other games hold back, this game goes all out and does it in a balanced way. You start out with nothing but wooden tools, but not far into the game you will have a jet pack, glider, ground vehicle, helicopter, laser rifles, diamond swords, NPC followers, pet drones and more.  \n\nAlthough the random gen adventure maps need much improvement (and they are being improved) the handmade story map is beautifully made. The flora and fauna are beautiful. The art style is amazing. The creatures are plentiful, well animated and roam in packs that will make you stand in awe as heards of multiple types of creatures roam on the screen simultaneously. \n\nThe resources are balanced and getting them is not grindy. The ratio of docile to agressive creatures seems right and even after hundreds of hours of play I still see a new creature or new plant that I hadn't seen before almost every time I play. There are dozens of different plants and animals.\n\nThe biomes are beautiful, diverse and will keep you well immersed, from the grasslands to the desert to the jungles with luminescent plants that really make you feel like you are on an alien planet reminescent of Pandora.\n\nThere are so many aspects to this game that I could write a small novel just fleshing out a full review and I still wouldn't hit on every point. BUT the game is streamlined enough, has a tutorial system worked into the story mode and has an intuitive enough interface that it does not seem complicated or hard to learn for beginners.\n\nI can't wait to see this game develop and am glad to get in on the relatively early stages.\n\nI would love to see the flight controls have more freedom. Hopefully strafing with A and D will be added as well as rolling with Q and E and directional rotation with mouse movement (like a standard flight simulator) but the relatively basic flight controls aren't really that big of a deal but they could be a lot better.\n\nI recommend playing the story mode to new players as it has a built in tutorial (the story quests cleverly teach you the controls and mechanics of the game) and the map is much more beautiful and optimised. The random gen sandbox maps are pretty bad in comparison and may leave a less than great first impression, but they are procedurally generated and are being improved.\n\nOne can simply play the story mode map as a sandbox by just doing whatever they want and finding the NPCs manually (instead of following the questline to them) to buy the recipes for advanced crafting.\n\nFirst person mode can be accessed by pressing F5 twice. (hitting it once removes the mouse cursor and allows normal third person movement). Although first person mode works alright, it needs some improvement.\n\nRemember that the game is in developement and the story is not yet finished atm (you will eventually hit a dead end) and some colony management mechanics are not finished either. BUT there are already more mechanics in the game than pretty much every other EA survival/crafting game and many hours of fun can be had with the story mode especially since you can play it as a sandbox.\n\nPE can be played single player OR multiplayer, offline on a public server or private coop with friends. Admittedly, setting up a private VPN server is a little tedious as it is not implemented natively yet, but it can be done and I did it just by wathching a youtube tutorial. Even the story mode can be played multiplayer.\n\nYou will not be disappointed with this game if you like the idea of a mixture of survival/crafting/rpg and understand what an EA is.\n\nEven if PE didn't develop any further than it currently is, I definitely got my money's worth and will continue to play it for hundreds of hours, but the devs are not showing any signs of slowing down. PE is headed towards another major release milestone soon and I can't wait.\n\nCheck out my gameplay of PE on my twitch past broadcasts or watch me play live at www.twitch.tv/thresholdseven", "timestamp_created": 1460424065, "timestamp_updated": 1460429548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761999547481536865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19928141": {"recommendationid": "19928141", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979754703", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5663, "last_played": 1458089727}, "language": "english", "review": "((i love this game but the world generator is in a horrible state atm :( ))\n\nOk i have played .9 and i am very happy to say that the world gen is fixed as far as i can tell! the fact that we can play story cooperatively is awesome, there are many different game modes worth many hours of game-play! also im getting close to 70 frames on \"Fantastic\" graphic settings, i believe the devs were right to rework the game. in my eyes a0.9 is a great success although a little late.... still a great release!\n\nUpdate: Wtf Devs??????????????", "timestamp_created": 1451023341, "timestamp_updated": 1695782901, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.755958259105682373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39350102": {"recommendationid": "39350102", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987292682", "num_games_owned": 949, "num_reviews": 320, "playtime_forever": 6290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3064, "last_played": 1520228068}, "language": "english", "review": "01/18/18 EDIT: After 40+ hours of game I hit a game breaking \"known\" bug.

The game is a huge voxel sandbox, with lot's to do and a great crafting system. It's not a FPS, or a shooter for that matter, but an exploration game. There's lots of action, but it's not the core of the game and falls short of many first or third person shooters. First person camera doesn't work very well (I never use it), but those are all the cons I can think of. Other than that, this game is an immersive exploration adventure, with a great creation system (you can design literally anything and put it in game), a simple crafting system, survival gameplay (sleep and hunger). I wholeheartedly recommend this game, if you are out for adventure, not for shooting/action.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Huge voxel world to explore, that can be procedualy generated.\n[*] Story, adventure and creator modes, so you can customize your game a lot.\n[*] Land, air and water vehicles.

It's a great game if you have the patience for it-the dev's also appear to be constantly updating the game so hopefully this game will improve. \n\nFirst off, the game has a steep learning curve and doesn't fully explain many mechanics in the game.  And just enough bugs and glitches to have you wondering if this is a game glitch or just a mechanic that's not fully explained.  For this game I found that google was my friend and often looked up problems I encounter in the storymode. \n\nThe building, mining, collecting resources are fun. You have a tool/weapon progress that starts at simple wooden tools and progresses up the technologicl tree as better resources become available. Although this too feels unfinished, as if they intended to release a few more higher teirs of tools and weapons but never released them. \n\nAs you can see by the pictures, you can craft some amazing things. Custom vehicles, weapons, etc except again there's a large learning curve and it's not very practical. Let me explain. So you wanted to craft a new gun, you collect the necessary parts, enter the creation system and start designing the actual lines of the gun. You make the gun look amazing, except due to the wierd rules of the creation system, your amazing looking gun does little to no damage.  After spending a good chunk of time designing a gun that looked neat but did no damage I entered the creation system. Put all the gun parts in the area and filled the entire area with diamond block. My \"gun\" was a big block of diamond with a barrel sticking out of it, that did 600 damage.  Vehicles also seem to full of problems. Driving cars take high amounts of durability damage along with a plague of other problem that make traveling with vehicles nto really worth it. Which sucks because the map is large and things are really spread out.\n\nThe Jetpack and glider were my bread and butter for transportation. \n\nThe storyline wasn't anything special at first, although they threw a few interesting curve balls and twists. I felt like the game ended in a satisfying way, although the overall experience felt like something was missing. Honestly I'd love to see what this game company can do with their second Planet Explorer game. \n\nPerformance. I had no problem running on max settings, although I noticed that regardless of my settings when NPC colonists would sleep for the night the game were stutter and freeze with performance issues. Upon looking online it looks like this is a fairly common problem. \n\nThe colony system is an interesting one. They are actually useful at maintaining your colony and will do a variety of tasks. Although the AI isn't very good, NPC would often hangout underwater or walk off tall buildings/cliffs. Various machines that you can build inside your colony have different functions; some of those functions are finished while other's I suspect will be changed in future patches. \n\nAlthough this review is full of criticisms that game is fun, the storyline can be interesting and underneathe all the flaws the game is really amazing. But there's alot of flaws, you need patience to play this game.  \n\nAt first I recommend this in the review and then after a few days comtempllation I reversed my recommendation.

Planet Explorers has every mark of an over-ambitious idea that the developer struggled to fulfill. \nGameplay is a tumorous mass of many different systems that range from kinda fun to passable to downright infuriating. I could pick nits for days: The durability system is rage-inducing. The combat could use a [i]lot[/i] of tweaking. The creation system, while cool in and of itself, has only a marginal effect on gameplay.\nThat said, there is about as much jank and brokenness here as there was in Skyrim or FO3 at release, and those [i]were[/i] triple-A titles with a similar premise.\n\n\nNow that I took a dump on the game, here's why you should get it: [b]Do you want to feel like a Planet Explorer? Get this game.[/b] Planet Explorers gets a thumbs up and a permanent spot in my \"good games\" bookmarks because it captures the joy and wonder of exploration. Up until the very end of the story playthrough, the game consistently delivers moments of \"whoa, this is awesome,\" or \"what the hell is [i]that[/i]? I should poke it and see what happens.\"  \n\nThere are several different biomes - not a new concept. Yet, unlike those of some other games, the biomes of Planet Explorers actually look, feel, and sound different. There is an astounding amount of (visually) unique flora and fauna. The landscape is sprinkled with several landmarks and points of interest that are [i]not[/i] marked on your map until you find them (unless it's for a quest). Sure, my companion NPCs may be teleporting repeatedly into midair behind me, but I don't care because I'm hang-gliding through a massive freakin canyon with like three kinds of weird lookin' birds flying around and HOLY FUCK IS THAT AN [spoiler]ALIEN DAM[/spoiler] UP AHEAD?!\n\nA word on the story: It's actually pretty good, and, dare I say, engaging! The pacing of the story is interesting as it progresses from pure survival, to exploration, to colonization. There are a few twists and memorable moments. I was also pleased that, despite the glitchiness of the game systems, I did not run into a single case of the story getting stuck or quests getting messed up.\n\nTL;DR: The gameplay systems are quantity over quality due to overreaching ambitions, but the atmosphere is freakin A+ good. 8/10, would explore again.\n\nAside: The original kickstarter for this game asked for only $100k, and got $140k. Comparing this to all the KS's that got millons and produced jack diddly (looking at you, Broken Age), I'm impressed with what these guys managed to pull off.

I enjoyed it, thus thumbs up, but I would be really careful about recommending it to anyone. Unless you know you are into such games, don't buy it. It has nice storyline, and I spent hours downloading and tweaking helicopter models, but there is not much beside that. \n\nThe main supposed feature of the game - dig anything, build anywhere and whatever you want - it is not there. Yes you can dig up any terrain, but there is little sense doing that. You need to dig mines for resources. slowly with wooden tools first, then faster and faster, as you progress through iron, steel, diamond and ultimately CheatEngine universal digging tool, giving you literally billions of any resource in a couple of seconds, because farming in singleplayer is not something I fancy doing during this couple of free hours that I can spare for gaming. \n\nApart from mines, there is nothing to dig for. I never found any caves apart from those from the plot, I never needed to build a bridge, dam or any other stuff that took hours of my time in Minecraft. \n\nYou can design literally any vehicle, item, armor, weapon, but this design is but a skin. Mechanics-wise that will still be the very same default game object, just reskinned and with tweaked numbers. Vehicles are treated as single objects with HP. You can make a dumb sheet of steel with driver, weapons and engine just sitting on top, or you can make an intricate APC with components shielded by armor, and both these variant will work exactly same. When HP drops to 0, it explodes, can't damage a weapon, engine, or kill the driver. \n\nFunctional buildings are all pre-made, so you just dig resources and 'buy' a power plant, which is just an object. I remember fun I had, designing monster plants in MC (where you literally build a facility with real output from irrelevant stuff that was not specifically meant for that purpose), nothing of the like here. Building a colony is little fun after you figure that you just need enough even land to place a bunch of buildings-objects together, but can not really design anything meaningful by yourself. \n\nGuess were it not for the story, I'd spend way less time in the game, and I have no idea what I'd do in it now.

That said, single player is very much alive and well, and the world is simply [b]AMAZING![/b] I've played Minecraft, Terraria, Space Engineers, and Empyrion, lots of sandbox games, but I feel Planet Explorers nails what I've always felt was missing from those other sand box titles: A purpose for all the resource gathering and crafting. Yes some of us play those games for the sheer joy of building stuff. Kuddos to you guys, I'm not one of them. Do I enjoy building things? Yes, to a certain extent or else I wouldn't be playing these kind of games. However, after a while, it just starts to feel like a job. Here, the crafting isn't about building a castle that I lose interest in 1/4 of the way in. It's more about helping your fellow colonists survive in an unforgiving alien environment so they can help you not just survive but thrive there.\n\n[b] Things that I loved about this game: [/b]\n[list]\n[*] [b] The Ambience: [/b]  Seriously, the scenery and creatures here are marvelous to take in. Some creatures are fine, and there definitely some you don't want to screw around with, especially when you're just getting started. \n\n[*] [b] NPCs! [/b] I don't care much for multiplayer games, in fact I go out of my way to not play a popular game that is strictly multiplayer. I don't want my hard work to turn into a farm for an overly powerful A** HOLE. But as I learned from Space Engineers and Minecraft, the world feels a lot emptier and more lonely without semi intelligent NPCs. In addition to filling out the world, these NPCs really are HELPFUL. You need to work with them to trade, and learn scripts from them. (Scripts are how you learn new crafting recipes. Without them, you're stuck with your starter gear.) You perform quests and you get or learn valuable info. Once you've helped some warriors enough, they will permanetely follow you. (Very helpful since this world can be very dangerous.)\n\n[*] [b] Single Player Story: [/b] The Single player story is very immersive, and I would definitely recommend any new players to start there. I did the tutorial, wasn't that helpful. But the story, they walk you through the game mechanics. (They're quite different from any of the other sand box games I've previously built.)\n[/list]\n\n[b] What didn't I like or care for? [/b]\n[list]\n[*] [b] Mining: [/b] While I am loving the purpose they've given me for resource acquistion and crafting, harvesting those minerals can not only be difficult, but just straight up a pain in the butt. You eventually have access to ore scanners. YAY! Except they're buried deeeep underground. Like worse than finding diamonds on Minecraft. Took me forever to find coal and petroleum. Then once you do find them, I tried build a winding tunnel down, except I always seemed to miss the minerals. If you're reading this, just don't do that. Dig straight down once you see you're standing directly over an ore deposit.  (Counter intuitive if you played minecraft I know.) Getting out is easy, fast travel and then you don't have to worry about digging yourself out of the hole you dug. Pun intended.\n\n[*] [b]Scripts:[/b] I have a love hate relationship with the scripts. They were a serious pain at first because I just wanted to find a way to get started immediately, dig and find those high quaility ores and get instantly strong. Doesn't work like that with this game. You have to cultivate relationships with the NPCs, once you've done enough to help them, they teach you scripts or you can simply buy some from some of them. \n\nAll in all, this is  a fantastic game, with a lot of potential. Even if the devs are done working on it, it stands pretty well on its own.

Here some examples: \n- Water behave weirdly. It is in infinite quantity (like in Minecraft) and therefore is not always very realistic. Water passes right through wall and any placed block so when it rains, it rains inside houses...\n- NPC are brainless (e.g. they dive of cliffs and roofs without care), have the weird ability to pass through walls and the uncanny habits to always end up where they will most bother you.\n- the world is beautiful on the surface but in adventure mode you will have things like sand on roof of caves, patiently waiting (without falling down mind you) for you to mine it. In general caves are plain unrealistic (and there is no cave-in so mad miners can feel free to dig and dig and dig)\n\nThe good:\nThe concept is truly great and I SO wanted a solo game like wurm or rising world where you could built towns that would not be just empty ghost towns and where NPC actually do some work in it (farming, processing)\nThe replicator concept is great and work really well\nOverall, I do not regret buying this game because it is fun and has all the things I really was searching for. But it really feels like it needs some polish to feels less like an early access and more like a finished game (with the potential of a blockbuster). I do hope that its release doesn't mean that it will stay like that and that patches will be released to fix all that needs to be fixed.

Since launching, it's given me trouble, most of which I've experienced in the last 24 hours. \nUpon buying, I played it for a few hours, wasn't extremely impressed with gameplay, etc., but was very much looking forward to the potential of world-building, as I did find the mining system to be satisfying and unique. After this experience, I neglected the game for a good while because of reasons. \nA few weeks ago I decided to give it another shot, as I was looking for this type of crafting, world-building game to play at the time. But alas, my save was gone. Honestly, not a huge deal, as I wasn't that far into the story, so I somewhat regrettably made a new character to start again. This save however, I had put much more time into (give or take 12 hrs, the majority of my game time overall). I was feeling much better about progressing the story and thinking about all the cool things I'd get to build later. After saving and auto-saving many times throughout, I had scratched that crafting itch and put it away for a few weeks.\nYesterday I launched the game yet again, and, to my chagrin, no saves... I think, \"Alright, I'll go in and find the saves location and load it that way.\" Nope. Nothing there. I see nothing online to help. I see online that before a certain release (.8 ?), saves shouldn't be deleted anymore, but here I am, V1.1.3, and everything is gone. Needless to say, I am very disappointed. And now, somehow, Steam registered the game as if it was running for longer than it has, tacking on an extra 4 hours, which in itself is not an issue, however if I decide to get a refund might cause a problem.\nI've gone to the website to see if there's a support page, but all it is is a small list of questions about what type of game it is, and whether or not your computer can run it, nothing Support-related. I also see they \"hoped\" to launch in 2015... So the support page is not even a support page, there are no forums, as the link leads to an error page, which I feel is a huge mistake for any up-and-coming game devs. There is the Steam page, but that is often nothing but an annoyance to navigate.\nI understand there have been some staff changes at Pathea, but I'd have liked if things were more up-to-date in late 2018, and functioning so that I don't have to make a new character very time.\nUnfortunately I cannot recommend this game as it is.

Despite some rough edges, it's entirely playable and quite fun. I think the game gets a lot of hate because of how much unrealized potential there is. There are just a lot of game systems that aren't fully utilized, or sometimes even used at all.\n\nThe creation engine and base building aspects are super powerful and something I hope to dig deeper into on a second playthrough or other game mode. If you're the kind of person who enjoys building stuff in minecraft, this will definitely appeal to you. It's especially cool that you can make functional vehicles, weapons, armor, etc.\n\nI do recommend this game, but with some caveats. If you like survival crafting and creative games, this is definitely a cool one and can be a ton of fun. I have really enjoyed my time playing it.\n\nHowever, you do have to realize that it's unpolished. Some of the interfaces are janky, a few quests have oddly specific requirements, some game systems and quests are unfinished, the graphics look out of date, the game has issues with crashes, etc. It plays like an early access game or day 1 release of a normal game. Don't buy this if you want a fully fleshed out, polished, bug free game.\n\nOn a final note, I am really, really looking forward to a possible Planet Explorers 2.
