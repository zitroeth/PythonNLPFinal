I hope oneday i CAN\nrecommend this title.\nThis review was originally posted, beginning of May 2019.\n\nEDIT 1 : just got killed by something the size of a fox while on a horse\nbecause it took over 3 min to transition from a rifle to a handgun... not good...\n\nEDIT:2 More ugly i'm afraid, When you exit the game, it often continues running\n(Check your steam page). You have to MANUALLY shut it down with the task manager.\nGraphic glitches such as WHOLE BUILDINGS both player made and prefab persistantly\nfail to render in leaving all your stuff floating above the grass... Not good in a multiplayer game. The render issue is getting worse,\nAvoid the pub servers, they go down for days for no reason*. all your livestock will\ndie every time this happens.\nOn the plus side i can change my graphics settings and i can \"BUY\" horses...\nFor 10 grand each...Lol..From a stable that costs 3 grand.\n\n* they are not updated or maintained during the outage.\n\nOk patched to Ver 1.1.7. \nRendering issues and connection issues still exist. There is still\nlag and the \"official\" servers are rubbish.\nThere are some really good private servers though and the updates are\nstill coming every 8-10 days so the dev's are still trying.\n\nOk patch 1.1.9 is in.\nOnce again, still has major rendering issues with EVERTHING !\nStill has Major connectivity issues and you still need to use task manager to\nshut the game down AFTER closing it the normal way.\nYet more placables have been added, Yes, as usual they are as buggy as\nhell. All official servers have been wiped.\nI will continue to play SP for a while but not worth starting on another \npub server right now.\n\n\nOk,27th july now and after a LOT of patches we still have a game that often \nwon't connect or render the placeables that have been added. As far as PvP\nis concerned, forget it. The bugs allow players of low character to phasethrough\nwalls dupe TNT charges and tons of outher exploits. \nI can still not recommend this game and it is becoming likely i never will.\nFYI, The pub servers are utter rubbish, i STRONGLY recommend checking out \nthe private ones. The connectivity is better, less re-sets and better maintained\nand moderated. Choose wisely though, some of them can be pretty rorty,\nespecially the PvP ones.\n\nOk, it is the 4 Jan 2020. After MANY more updates there are still connection issues\nand pub servers just randomly disappear. Rendering issues are still a thing and \nthe hackers/cheaters have practically de-populated the game.\nThere is now however, a dev that appears on the forums. This could be so positive but \nthe dude is quite rude to anyone but the fanboys and the bans are just purile.\nIf the developers cannot handle a critique then just shut the forums down....\n\nI will continue to follow progress for a bit longer...\n\nOK, 9/4/20...\nGoing to un install for a bit. The state of the game is as such...\nThe rendering issues still persist, The crash/kick from pub servers is worse since the introduction of \"battleeye\" that also has done nothing to slow the griefer/gankers...\nThe playerbase has taken a BIG hit and most of the major bugs (IE falling through the world and getting stuck in rocks etc) still persist, a lot of the placable buildings are hard to place \naccurately and many are \"glitched\"... I could go on but if you read the whole review, you will\nget the picture....\nStill think it could be a great game but seems more and more unlikely....\nIt just seems like the dev's either just don't care or coversely, have no idea how to fix\nthe major issues this game has....", "timestamp_created": 1556950961, "timestamp_updated": 1586402102, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 220, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.905451536178588867", "comment_count": 44, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66118141": {"recommendationid": "66118141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039223327", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4995, "last_played": 1585517281}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is broken.

Why? Because I think this game deserves some credit, and half the reviews here are complete BS or either people don't know what to expect from early-acces games. I'm about 40 hours in and can tell you this:\n\n1. PRICE \nThis is an Early-Acces game, in it's very early stages with a small dev team. Keeping that in mind, the game is already looking really good, and people shouldn't expect a game this large for all functions to work smoothly yet. \u20ac17 is a damn fair starting price. They don't charge you \u20ac20/30+ for a very EA-game and keep the price correct and acceptable. If you like survival/building/crafting games, i advise to get it now before the price goes up!\n\n2. DEV-TEAM\nOn that same note, this dev team is working day and night and is dropping patches nearly every week, sometimes even two a week. There is an active discord community, where the devs read all our bug-reports and if necessary respond to our trouble-shooting.\n\n3. GAME-MODES/OPTIONS\nThis game supports all kinds of play (PvE, PvP and RP). I have to say it's leaning more towards the RP part with PvE and PvP functions. So know what you are getting in to and don't expect an all-out western brawl shooting game and then give it a bad review because the PvP sucks. You need to build, farm, maintain, support and most of all, grind. Yes your horses and livestock can die if you don't log on every 2 days, so lasso a new horse, get new life-stock, it doesn't take long! The map is huge with different environments and all kinds of wildlife, with bandits and outlaw gangs roaming free. There are no set PvE buildings or NPC's, however you can build several for your town if you like. You can make party's and guilds.\n\n4. SERVERS\nAs this is EA and certain updates/patches can have a serious impact on the environment, you have to expect map wipes on official servers every so often. (this is no different from other survival-building games f.e. H1Z1, 7D2D, Rust, Miscreated, Ark, ....) If you can't handle that, run your own private server and narrow that down to a minimum. There are plenty of servers for many different regions which is a plus. On the downside there are some connection issues on the official servers as i've heard. I'm however on a private RP server not experiencing this.\n\n5. FUTURE \nI think a lot of people, myself included, have been waiting for a fun western themed game to come out. And I can tell you this, with work and fine-tuning and people playing the game, this one could become a very popular MMORPG, western style in the survival/building genre. However knowing the stage it is in, you should accept that this is for a lot of people not the game to play non-stop yet. Play once in a while, have some fun and wait for improvements to drop (keep a cool head and know to expect bugs and glitches for at least the next year or 2).\n\nI could list you all the things you can do and build already, the pro's and con's, but nothing tells it better than a video. The game is already being captured and streamed enough, so i'd say go watch a video. If you like grinding, building, customizing, and most of all, just have good laughs with friends being silly in a game... Building your own towns in great detail with this amazing crafting system, I do recommend adding this one to your librabry.\n\nIf you expect a graphically perfect game with loads of PvP-shoutouts, go play RDR2, or a fun shooter like Fistful of Frags.

At first glance, surviving in the late 1800's American west sounded like a lot of fun. I had visions of riding from mining camp to native village to frontier outpost until I found some perfect spot to build a base of my own, perhaps even a town. My optimism was not to be rewarded.\n\nJust to start, it takes far longer than it should to get into the game itself. Even loading a single player server takes way too long. On my decent computer it never takes less than 5 - 7 minutes. It's also unnecessarily annoying. There is a purposeful, very bad blurring of a loading screen that has things moving on it. My eyes declare vendetta on the rest of me if I don't look away from the screen while the game loads. When that loading screen goes away it's replaced by a series of still, in game shots in which game characters stare at you with soulless, dead eyes. There aren't enough letters in the word creepy to describe just how creepy it is.\n\nCharacter creation is bland, boring and ugly. There is nothing to differentiate it from character creation in games a decade older. I'm pretty sure Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion had more and better options than this game does.\n\nYour character wakes up in a coffin. You break out before you have any control of your character. That's pretty cool to see. It explains why your character is out in the middle of nowhere: Someone left you here, either thinking you were dead, or intending for you to be dead shortly. After all, you're left in nothing but a union suit (the one-piece long underwear with a flap in the back) with no supplies whatsoever.\n\nEverything goes downhill from there. Open up your crafting menu, I dare you. Yes, you can create most anything in the game already. At most, you're only one menu away from creating it. Much of what you can initially make are crafting benches or tools that open up more crafting options. Make a mallet and you can build basic wooden house pieces. All of them. No learning system, no customization, no receiving new items to build as you progress. Nope, the game developers simply dump everything on you all at once. It's about as fun as you think reading the descriptions of dozens of items trying to figure out what you need to make first in a game that has no pause option. That's right, even hitting escape to bring up your menu doesn't pause the game. I hope you never intend to go AFK because your character will get hungry, thirsty, and die if you're gone too long. Even in single player.\n\nExploring is next to pointless. There was a decent place to build a single house within sight of where I spawned in. When I died, prior to having a bed to respawn in, the game always started me back in that same spot so I'm not sure if there even are any other respawn points in the game.\n\nWhen I did start exploring it was only after I'd built a mailbox at my house. I hadn't realized it was actually useful in single player. I'd assumed it was just for sending in game messages to players who weren't online. Nope, there are contracts. You can hire various npcs and some prefabricated buildings through it. Which meant I could, theoretically, construct a town.\n\nSo I moved my house to somewhere that sorta resembled flat land, built a larger house and then realized I needed money. A game set in the American west is going to use dollars, of course. But how to make money? Well, you can sell things to npcs...except you have to buy the npcs first. But there must be a way to make money initially, right? There is. Sort of.\n\nBandits. They can be in groups of up to 4 and range in difficulty between the sort of bandits you see in comedic westerns up to four man gangs that seem to be comprised of strafe-happy aimbots. Kill bandits, get money. Slowly.\n\nAnd that's assuming you can kill the bandits. Once you build the appropriate crafting table you can build every gun in the game. Or at least you can build about twenty different guns. I suppose it's possible that others exist. Build yourself whichever guns seem best and go bandit hunting.\n\nJust don't try to zoom in to aim better, you lose your already terrible aiming reticle and movement becomes a stuttering nightmare. Maybe my graphics card is too weak, but game graphics aren't impressive so I find that explanation less than satisfactory.\n\nAnd the game is now over. Sure, you can kill bandits by the score until you have enough money to buy an npc to sell things to. Then you can buy more npcs and prefabricated buildings. But why? More than any other survival game I've played thus far, and the single biggest failing of Outlaws is the complete lack of any answer to the question \"why?\"\n\nWhy explore? Why build? Why hunt animals or bandits? Why should I care about the fate of my character? Outlaws has no answer for any of the questions that make survival games enjoyable.\n\nThis is the first survival game I've played where I could realistically build a house exactly where I spawned in and collect almost every resource in the game without leaving sight of that building. And yet I'm left without any particular motivation to do that.\n\nMaybe Outlaws will improve. I'm hoping it does. But purchasing the game in its current form would be a mistake. I bought it when it was on sale and even that small quantity of money feels wasted. I'll likely keep trying to find a purpose in this game because I have spent money on it. Don't make my mistake. Keep this game on your wishlist in the hopes that one day this digital Old West will be fun. As it stands, Louis and Clark would have turned around and headed back east after a few hours had this been the land they were exploring.\n\nJuly 29 edit: Changed Roman numerals in Elder Scrolls reference.", "timestamp_created": 1564099743, "timestamp_updated": 1564461534, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 195, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.829316198825836182", "comment_count": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102506610": {"recommendationid": "102506610", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989899136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 17274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13440, "last_played": 1671916406}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, just know it is an abandoned game, the devs quit updating it in October of 2020, however that being said it is still a fun game and had tons of potential.

I Kept looking at the game on my wishlist, and knowing how early access games can be buggy, I kept putting it off. Did I mention EARLY access? I think I did, yes. Ok, Now that that's out of the way... I saw the game go on sale a couple of weeks ago for like 50% off or something like that. No longer could I resist getting the game at a price of $10. Does the game have issues? Yes, but I've never played an  \"Early Access\" game that didn't have issues. Some pathing issues with wild life, items poof out of and back into my inventory. My horse (Must be union) sometimes goes on break in the desert and refuses to move... Was very annoying until I found a work around. (Walk away from horse and use the radial menu to summon your horse and it moves again). If you like sandbox type survival games, the likes of Conan, then you will most likely enjoy Outlaws. No boobies like Conan, so don't bother looking here, But the mechanics of the horses are damn good. Some of the best riding in a video game I've done. No walking off a cliff while trying to turn my horse around like some other games. They even did a good job working trajectory into the ranged weapons. Two thumbs up for that. \n\n    The world looks great on a middle of the road 32\" monitor, and Plays fairly well on a Windows machine that is 10 years old. It's a steep up hill battle when you first log in. Bandits, Moose, Bears, and even fricking Badgers....nasty little suckers, keep trying to kill you. Oh yeah, don't forget the goats... They're not very nice either. After you die 20 or 30 times early on you will get the hang of it. It's actually a very fun and enjoyable game for the genre. Mind you, I'm playing in single player atm. I wanted to learn the game a little before I added players to list of stuff that wants to kill you. After 100+ hours of play, I would just like to point out that bears STILL suck. The Grizzly bears that is. \n\n     It's crashed a couple of times on me, maybe 3 or 4 times. Not too bad for as much as I have played it. I've had \"Full Release\" Games make that look like a walk in the park. So if you're scared, you really needn't be, It's worth a try. If that's not enough convincing, just wait to catch it sale. I mean....who's gonna die if they spend $7, but even at the full price it's only $20 and it's easily worth that.\n\n    BattleEye: I'm not crazy about it, but in a game that has PvP and people being what they are... You're going to have jerks that suck so bad that they have to cheat to try and win.  What else can I add? Hrmmm.... Oh yah! The world feels pretty huge on foot, get a horse early. It makes the world LESS huge, and also helps keep you alive, mainly because your horse can outrun a grizzly. I think I mentioned those nasty MF'ers earlier. \n\n Have fun, be safe, or not, and kill $h!t", "timestamp_created": 1588560162, "timestamp_updated": 1588560382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820324361324310303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89258981": {"recommendationid": "89258981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011395348", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 4659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4452, "last_played": 1644524770}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't waste your money on this abandoned game.

Decent polish for Alpha.\n2. Decent open world map.\n3. NPCs to kill and loot.\n4. Money system to buy guards and mines and such.\n5. Decent music and western sound effects.\n6. Potential.\n7. The Theme.\n8. The Price.\n\nCons\n \n1. Lag spikes are stuttering and frustrating. Could be mix of engine and servers. (played on official PVP server) EDIT: I'm not running a potato and my video card is a 1080.\n\n2. Harvest is a chore more than most games. While advanced tools help, mining iron is a choir at the low rate you receive.  You can find iron everywhere but you'll be spending most of your time farming it for bullets and bars.  Sulfur nodes are the hardest to find, so expect limited ammo that isn't pistol.\n\n3. Building system is limited and everything needs iron bars no matter the tier. And thus the issue with #2, farming iron is a chore. Careful is the ground isn't perfectly flat, because you'll end up preventing yourself from placing foundations. EDIT: You can make some neat look homes, I just had frustration with foundation placement mostly. You can't place a foundation partially in any any sort of terrain, so if you want to build a house around a large rock you will have a gap that can't be near the rock. So hard to build that house on a spire away from raiders, so no crazy bases like in other games. Also the tool system to build different tiers is a little awkward with the wheel system that pops up.\n\n4. PvP is broken. Currently bugged that anyone can raid your base with a building hammer. Then people just grief you by destroying all your crafting tables. Just log off with your important stuff on your body. Even a safe is useless. EDIT: Patch 3/19 fixed how easy it was to break into homes.  This fixes most of my complaints on this. Will test to confirm.\n\n5. Horses die of starvation when you're logged off. They don't drink and eat from their trough automatically. Expect to get a new horse every day\n\n6. Table sounds are a bit annoying on the ear when your making planks, grinding resources and your forge is on. \n\n7. Dumb AI.\n\n8. EDIT: No ability to drop items on ground to be looted. If you destroy a container, don't expect to get loot.\n\n9. EDIT: If you die too far from your spawn point, good chance you will lose everything you have. This seems to apply if you get disconnected. I died with my body 5 squares away and game crashed twice with fatal errors when trying to build rope in an effort to find a horse and run to my body. Logged back on, X where corpse is was gone.  Ran to corpse location, only my old horse was there.  Corpse decay is one thing (which is too short), but losing your corpse because of being disconnected is another.\n \nTL;DR- Nice open world and theme but hampered by lag, bad building system, frustrating harvesting system, horses dying when offline, super easy to raid bases with basic hand tools no matter the tier.\n\nWait a few years, maybe it will be more polished like Conan or Ark or Rust. Then I hope I can recommend it.\n\nEDIT: For those commenting on my time played, open world building games aren't deep like an RPG.  I'm still currently playing the game and when things get better, I'll update this review as needed.  I said it's has potential and yes i compared it to games that have been out longer in the same genre. Those games are way better now (even with all their bugs) than when they released.\n\nIf you want to support the developers, by all means.

Completely abandoned. Wandering Wizard moving on to another game which will likely fail. It's sad because I had a lot of fun. Still worth picking up if you don't mind the emptiness and bugs, but I can no longer say I recommend it.\n\n-----------\nUPDATE:\nServers are up, but dying slowly. You'll be lucky to find 3 people on a public server. Game purchasers feel burned. The owners blocked the devs from updating. Very low hope for this game. Still recommending it 'cause there's a lot of gameplay and exploration even by yourself, just be prepared to play basically alone....\n-----------\n\nI do recommend this game to a point, given a few things:\n\nBuy on Sale. Try it out. Be prepared to forgive bugs.\n\nThis game is a \"Paused\" Alpha in development. There are bugs which may never be fixed.\n\nIt's very playable. A few I've talked to in-game, stick around because it's their favorite game. It is enjoyable. It can be fulfilling. Some bugs are frustrating, especially knowing they may never be fixed.\n\nThe publisher and devs went to court over the continuation of this game. The publisher point was the game wasn't supporting itself (?). But what starting big Alpha game does in under a year? The devs HAVE a big update, but are blocked from applying it. The devs want to continue this game, to my knowledge. Could take some time to straighten out, if it ever is.\n\nOk. That said, this game was planned to be an A-lister by the same publishers behind ARK and PixARK. It's damn beautiful game. Scenic.\n\nThere are a number of servers, but few with an active population. Population numbers remain low, with a few dedicated players (thank you for playing!).\n\nPvP and PvE are available, but some players take advantage of bugs, exploits, and loopholes in PvP; just be aware. I do recommend PvE, as someone will probably troll you unfairly in PvP.\n\nSingle Player is also available. You can develop to your hearts content without interruptions. There are few NPCs: store vendors which you place yourself, 2 guard types, bandits, a few wandering sellers, and crazed miners in a mine. Even so, it can be rewarding to build your own wild west world (WWW? haha)\n\nMap is large and based on quadrants. Around 8 km wide (East-West) and 16 km long (North-South). Biomes are desert, grasslands, highlands, montane. This allows for environmental gameplay and animal species are locally based. You don't find bighorn sheep in the desert.\n\nAnimal behavior is different per species, and animations look pretty realistic. (Remember this was going to be a high-end game). However, animals and NPCs do get stuck on rocks, but not so much trees. It can be a handful to have a horse or three follow you through the entire map.\n\nThis game could use some love. Population and attention would be very helpful. An update would be even better!!!!!\n\nI do recommend getting the game. It's addicting, fun,  and beautiful. Better to get on populated server or bring friends to play with.

There are no native villages or bandit encampments, no ranches or farms. There are no missions. There's nothing but an open world with some wildlife and a few bandits running around. In under an in-game week I'd gathered enough mats, animals & food to supply a military base, but I had no idea what to do with it all. I heard there's some sort of mini-game in some mines, but that's it. Sure it's early access, but in my opinion this just wasn't worth releasing in its current state.

I see a bandit no more than 5ft from me so i let my arrow fly right over his shoulder.  It's his turn to shoot so I slam the door.

I am the devil!\"  I lined up my shot and right before I fire, he warps outside.  Warping must've taken quite a bit out of him because he froze by the bank of the river.

I go back to ARK :-(\n\nDesignating a game as early access means that it is constantly being improved. But before you improve on details, you should start with the most obvious flaws. This game is nicely set up, but there are still far too many vulnerabilities:\n\n\u2022 There are many places on the map without grass or structure that look like an empty carpet, with a geometric shape.\n\n\u2022 There are also places where trees hang in the air as if a mountain had been there before.\n\n\u2022 When you ride in the desert everything becomes lame. I have a fast PC and a very good graphics card and a lot of ram, but the structure of the desert seems to be overloaded. If you want to start riding with the horse, it starts like a slow motion and only after a few seconds you can ride again.\n\n\u2022 When you build a house, there are sometimes places that are marked green and still do not accept building elements.\n\n\u2022 If you want to turn the horse on the spot, it turns like the needle of a compass and absolutely unnatural. This also affects other animals, a little more animation would be helpful.\n\n\u2022 I do not know if it is so, but I believe that each region is handled by a different DEV and therefore has different criteria. For example, in one region you can fit devices into the house nicely, in another region the devices have an unnatural distance to the wall. That's annoying.\n\n\u2022 Annoying is also when bandits run around the house, so you see, for example, a head that runs through the floor and remains trapped somewhere. Walls are not there to offer the bandits as ghosts can easily go through, right?\n\n\u2022 What annoys me the most is the behavior of the bandits, because that looks like a cheap shooting gallery when you aim at them. With the telescope you can watch it best. The bandit slides to the left and right, and when you come with the crosshairs on him, he disappears immediately and appears again 10 m further. And for a very long time. These bandits do not move at all naturally and remind me of an old DOS game from the sixties.\n\n\u2022 In some regions, the bandits disappear as soon as they are looted. In other regions you can plunder them and they will still be lying. Sometimes one has been killed, and there are three on the ground that can not be plundered.\n\n\u2022 Which is very annoying, there are very nice regions where you have to ride very far to find material, that's a pity, but you can still accept.\n\nBut what really shatters the game is spawning all over the map. One rides fast through the area, and suddenly the animals always fall from the sky in the same place, always the same ones always running in the same direction.\n\nThe same goes for bandits, with the only difference being that bank robbers sometimes originate in the same place, sometimes a camp with three bandits. It can not be that hard to put in a bit of random. \n\nIt would be nice if the spawning does not always occur directly in front of the eyes and not always the same animals, in the same place, running in the same direction. This makes this game an idiot game, because if you need wool, for example, you go several times to the place where a sheep is created, killed it comes again until you have enough wool. That's like in the supermarket.\n\nIf you need money, look for a region where two bandit camps regularly arise, kill the first, run to the other camp where you kill the second, and go back to the first ones you kill again, and so on. That's not really fun. That too is like in the supermarket.\n\nThis game bears much resemblance to ARK, but not the quality. In ARK the animals stay where they are and of course move there, have a much better AI. You will also find them in the last place about hours later. In this game, everything is created right in front of your eyes and disappears as soon as you take a few steps away from it. If you have fought with bandits, need to get ammunition and want to go back to kill the last two bandits, they have not existed for a long time. That is and of course and destroys this game very much.\n\nFarming too easy. In ARK it takes half an hour or more to build a house. In this game 6 or 7 minutes, including devices and content.\n\nIf you wear too much material, comes an indication that you are overloaded, but runs around as if you only had a rusk in your pocket. For comparison with ARK, there you go slower and slower as you wear, and if it is too much you can not move at all. This is much more natural.\n\nAlthough it is convenient when a Map is big, the gallop of the horses is far too fast and therefore very unnatural. That you get stuck in between on a plant is added.\n\nIf a bear beats you and you die, that's normal. If a goat gives you a head butt and you die, that's not normal, right?\n\nWhat I do not like is the water. Totally unnatural. When it flows down from a mountain, it is smooth as a lake and lifeless. Again, ARK has been done a lot better. Many parts of this map look the same and are boring. You should work on the design of the card a lot to make it look more attractive, that's my opinion.\n\nWe hired a server and hoped to be able to do settings there like in ARK where there are hundreds of them. But you can not adjust anything, not even the length of a day that is far too short in the game. This is very disappointing and makes the game boring. I'm starting to regret hiring the server and wondering if we should rather play ARK again, it was much more exciting.\n\nWhat really annoys me is that you do not get an address of the DEVs, where you can tell all that I have written here. Only chat and forum where you can only mention drop by drop single points, which are then discussed by many players around so long until they have become uninteresting. How to improve a game when there is no real communication with the DEVs?\n\nI will play the game for a while, hoping that step by step, something will be done to really improve the game. \n\nIf all these vulnerabilities stay long, I'll go out for good.\nPLEASE SEE COMMENTS FOR UPDATES", "timestamp_created": 1568160850, "timestamp_updated": 1571362144, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753721773624420166", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103149609": {"recommendationid": "103149609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304279782", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 30569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29980, "last_played": 1641765740}, "language": "english", "review": "Been playing this game on and off since it came out in EA.

By all logic and other survival games you should get more rss with advanced tools but not here, you get same amount it don't matter if you use stone or steel/iron tools. So when you see all other reviews and players who have 100+ hours in this game, guess what did they do? WOOD CUTTING \n\n- PVP Raiding ? Is this a joke? You can easly glitch and get through walls of enemy bases, if that don't work just sledgehammer it! You want to use TNT ? LMAO it do jacksh*t don't bother with it.\nBut the worst thing in raiding is that in 90% you won't be able to loot it. Usually other players workbenches are glitched and even if you do manage to get stuff out of them it will just disappear from your inventory after some time, puff magic at it's best.\n\n- Map is fairly big and desert is most bugged from all parts, so don't get surprised of invisible walls and holes, that will gltich your player especially  on horse every few meters, veeeery annoying.\n\n- I won't even speak of any tutorials or help for players new to this genre, there are none. \n\n- Should I mention that your own stuff disappear with relogs from time to time, especially horses they just don't want to stay tide :) \n\nI can really go with this forever but you should get the point so far.\n\n\n[b]BUY THIS GAME[/b] only if you wish to support it's development.

It gets exciting at first, because you want to explore and figure out how to play. And what you'll notice after about walking around an hour in PVE or 2 minutes in PVP, where you'll end up shot for no apparent reason, is giant mansions and large boring towns with equipment you can't use and stores that are expensive. The only way for you to make good money is to sell your gold after taking down a particular type of bandit that only spawns once in a blue moon. Otherwise you must result in crafting thousands of arrows to sell, hats or hide shirts. Once you get to a point of being able to buy things you'll quickly notice, via in game mailbox, all the stores that you've already witnessed in other town you can't afford to buy from. Essentially what you're doing is playing for 10 hours a day just to copy and paste the same building nobody will go into to buy anything. I mean $500 for a shirt that  only costs you a few hide to make? Wtf were developers thinking?\n\nThat's right, they weren't. They never are. They turn down suggestions and off the start they forget they were once gamers. They forget what it's like to play these type of games and yet they go and develop one.

What's the point? Nothing's happening.\n\nMy advice, stay away from this game completely. Yes it's Early Access so there are bugs and hours of game play gets erased, because of a company wide server wipe, so you shouldn't expect much. But almost immediately you can see there's nothing to do even if there weren't any glitches.\n\nThey don't plan on making this game any more interesting than it already isn't.\n\nComplete waste of money.

However, the devs look like they're fairly active and the community is only growing.\n\nI like the crafting and building system. The taming system could use some work. After you've established yourself, I feel like the game might need to add some more. Somebody commented that there should be quests that are given to you by NPCs. I think that would be a fantastic addition to the game. Besides that, shooting baddies and rounding up horses ends up being the thing you'll be doing for a majority of the game besides crafting and resource gathering.\n\nI'm leaning more towards yes than no at the moment.\n\nOther disclaimer. I personally hate ARK. The fact that the devs for it sold DLC WHILE IT WAS IN EARLY ACCESS was the worst.

I recommend picking it up for 15$ because I have a strong feeling this game is going to succeed and make it out of EA and into an official launch. Once it gets there, it'll more than likely get a 60$ price tag.\n\nI recommend playing on an RP server so you can get both PvPvE without the griefing.

Fraud!\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/840800/eventcomments/2646360117222846372\nhttp://98.153.121.35/index.html\n\nThis is fraud and not a giveaway at all, but a raffle / draw. These companies have been pulling crap like this for over half a year and have been getting away with it. Don't support fraudulent and or misleading advertising on Steam.\n\nReport these companies to Valve for fraudulent business practice.\n\n\nUPDATE 04/14/2020\nWell the game has gone passed its Early Access deadline of around a year and I must say that this game has not even marginally improved. Trains are still broken, horses and wagons get stuck on invisible obstacles, game content got removed, the animations after catching fish or horses, etc. is still laggy, bandits still phase and teleport all over the place and don't even walk or run like they should, performance is at the bottom of the trash can (worse than launch day which was terrible), the anti-cheat wasn't tested properly and is now banning tons of players, building radius permissions is still a problem (was never fixed), balance is still way off the bar, some parts of the map still can't be built on or used an entire year later because it's so broken. There are holes in the map, invisible barriers on the map and the list goes on and on. The game is actually worse than it was in April 2019.\n\nFurthermore, the developers and publishers are still bald face lying to their customers about things being fixed. They also still lie about not being aware of bugs that were reported over a year ago. They repeatedly use sales tactics to boost player population too so the game appears to be more alive and well when history proves otherwise.\n\nThis game has not done well through the course of its year in Early Access and it's still not doing well. Avoid it if you value your time and money.\n\n\nUPDATE: 23/12/2020\nThere have been absolutely no updates to the game since June 3, 2020. It's been over an entire half a year and not a single thing has been done to develop or fix the current game breaking issues. Wandering Wizard (the publisher) and Virtual Basement LLC (developer) companies have left this game for dead to work on their latest game contract, The Wrestling Code. Meanwhile they are both happily and completely ignoring their Outlaws of The Old West contract. They could dissolve the contract, cancel the game and refund everybody, but they're not interest in refunding anybody. Virtual Basement obviously cares nothing for their reputation either as Wandering Wizard drags their company into the quicksand. Wandering Wizard (Snail Games) is known for not giving a darn about anyone or anything, but their profits.\n\n\"Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?\" Valve asks their publishers and developers.\n\nI quote Virtual Basement & Wandering Wizard, \u201cWe estimate Outlaws of the Old West will remain in Early Access for about one year.\u201d Time's up . They broke their word since the beginning and there is no excuse nor reason Virtual Basement LLC can't dissolve the game development contract. They just rather keep it since they've been paid, like to blame Wandering Wizard for all the problems, no updates and never hold any self accountability over their business actions and decision making.\n\nUpdate: 24/02/2021\nThere has been no updates delivered since June 28, 2020. No new substantial news has been announced anywhere on their websites or on Steam since last year. Development seems to have stopped and all the profits of this game got dumped into their new wrestling game they started while this game isn't even near close to being finished. The player base is next to none and only a handful of people play still - maybe 50 people by average at best. The thousands who got scammed by these companies moved on. Valve won't respond to this game being reported and is ignoring the community that bought the game who want a refund since the game has been abandoned.\n\nShould you buy this game in 2021? Absolutely not.

Like, seriously alpha gameplay. It has all the bugs and issues you would expect from a game that has literally only just started to be tested.\nIn the short time I played it (keeping my playtime under 2 hours in case I refund) I...\n- Fell through the earth endlessly \n- Tried to drop something on the ground for someone to pick it up, and it disappeared\n- Shot a deer 5 times with a gun and it still didnt die...yet 2 shots with the bow killed it\n- Encountered endless FPS drops and loads \n- Tried 5 times to start a single player game but couldnt get past the loading screen.\n\nAnd yet...I didnt hate it at all. Its absolutely bare bones atm but I can see a brilliant game under all this IF the devs keep the updates rolling out.\nI love the leveling system and there is a TON of stuff to craft. So if they can fix the issues and add a bit more to the absolutely massive map (more than just a few roaming bandits) then there will be a very playable and perhaps even enjoyable game for those of us who like a bit of a grind and building a home.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that is even remotely near being complete and dont want to be part of bug reporting and testing, then stay away for another 6 - 12 months.\n\nI'm hanging on to it for a few weeks to see if they fix enough so that I can at least play single player and then I'll revisit this review. I'm giving it a thumbs up for now because I like what the devs are doing and so far have no reason not to trust that they will keep up the updates.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: 4/04/21\n\nAfter years of 'development' its still unfinished and now seems pretty much abandoned.

One of my reasons for recommending this game was due to the frequent updates 1 every month or two sometime 2 in the same month.. but now it has been over a year, the project has clearly been abandoned.\n\nWhen I did recommend it:\n(Single Player Review) Highly recommended for those that enjoy casual survival building style games. \n\nI've been playing over 100 hours now (single player) and have crashed I think only once or twice exploring the map (which is huge and can take 3 game days from top to bottom). Crashed on initial attempt to play on official multi player server during character creation. \n\nA few bugs but nothing game breaking or game crashing (some stuttering and lag while assets load while exploring), some lost items, some duplicated items, but resources are easy enough to collect that it takes no time at all to recover. The dev response and patch frequency is unmatched by any alpha I have owned (which has been many).  \n\nThe number of animals types I am impressed with as you move around the map the animal populations adjust to the terrain appropriately: Bison, Bear, Wolf, Coyote, Fox, Deer, Moose, Horse, Badger, Beaver, Squirrel, Rabbit, Sheep, Mountain Lion, and many more, likely many I have not found yet. Took forever to find my first Mule to power the level 1 Mine.\n\nCombat from horseback is great. Assortment of period weapons is pretty good so far. Bandit AI needs work. Bears are a greater threat (big foot is HUGE threat) unless its the scull gang that jumps you 4 to 1 while chopping trees and encumbered.\n\nMountains have snow biom, north and center of map is forested or grass lands, south is desert. The transitions are gradual which is great. Amazing scenic areas.

Enjoyed the rust type feel game play but in old west setting.  my only complaint and its kind of a deal breaker is the servers.  it is almost impossible to find the same server twice.  not sure what is going on with that , it makes you not want to invest time into building and crafting.  once they get the server issues fixed then i am all on board until then its solo play for me when i want a relaxing game to play.", "timestamp_created": 1553959724, "timestamp_updated": 1553959724, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654468297958374023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72465335": {"recommendationid": "72465335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086255144", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 2962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2905, "last_played": 1595007268}, "language": "english", "review": "Outlaws of the Old West is a good game with a few bugs.  Animals / bandits get stuck in place at times and are easy to kill.... making it no challenge at all. When animals and bandits are not stuck then it is often difficult to kill or catch them. There is no tutorial so you just need to figure things out.  Crafting is somewhat simple but it seems that I need a specific tool or crafting bench for different items.  There are so many different crafting bench's to make in game that it is ridiculous!  The devs need to reduce the number of crafting bench's and allow more items that can be made from them. After building a house and stable to game got dull for me. Yes, I made and brandished some firearms and learned to lasso,.....Yes, I became a miner..... Yes, I trained two horses and saddled them..... and Yes, I set up a corral with live stock...... but after that? It got boring real quick.  The quest was to grind for materials and I did my part. The problem was  after doing all of the above things got too easy.  There is no end game in this game, yet. Though I have enjoyed the ride (pardon the pun) I'm hoping that the devs keep working on the game and create an endgame.  The world is vast and it is pretty to look at, there isn't much to the survival aspect, food and water are plentyful.  I never worried one about dying due to lack of food or water. My three biggest issues with the game is that it lacks challenge, there is no end game, and no one is playing it.  It's a good game and I love the old west theme, but it needs to be fun to play.", "timestamp_created": 1594423036, "timestamp_updated": 1594423036, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.65356975793838501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55615680": {"recommendationid": "55615680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012631660", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 7256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5251, "last_played": 1571752808}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game! Is it early access? Yes. Are there bugs? Yes. If you want a perfectly clean game, good luck. They don't exist any more. \n\nHowever, for an early access game, this is fairly smooth at this time. I rarely crash, when I do it seems to be graphical related. So be sure you have a high end graphics card. And no, I don't run on max graphics. and yes, I have a high end card.\n\nThe game is like many other survival games. You eat, you drink, you harvest and farm. But this game allows NPC's, trading and highly lends its self, through design, to a very strong community based economy system. I currently do not play on a PVP server, however, like all wild west type games, it is truly built for pvp. You can trade between towns, build railroads, trains, shops and even have a fully policed town via your own NPC hired posse.\n\nThings I love:\nHorses are build correctly. This is my number one pet peeve in a game. Artists who never even bother to learn basic four legged mammal anatomy and yet try to create things like horses. Horses actually look like horses. They have Mustangs and Quarter Horses atm, and they are discernibly different, to a horse person.\n\nThe ability for one person, playing alone on a server to have an impact and build a whole town on their own. Though I am sure this would be different on a pvp heavy server.\n\nThe growing repertoire of items that we can build. I hope this keeps growing. There is so much amazing potential in this game. I'd hate for the developers to do what many other survival games have done and give up part way through.\n\nDid I mention the horses?\n\nThings I don't like:\nGraphical bugs. Rarely life threatening, but can be annoying and make it hard for immersion in such an otherwise beautiful game. Example, hair sticking out through the hat. Items not always sitting on the ground, etc... simple stuff that will likely get patched in the future.\n\nLack of easy method to reporting bugs to devs. There doesn't' seem to be any communication, that I have found, between developers and the community. When I run across bugs, I'd love to be able to report them, but that is not a viable option in game. Nor have I found a reliable place to do so outside of the game.\n\nLack of other tameable animals such as dogs, cows, goats. The latter of the two exist in the wild, but unlike the horses, there is no way to tame them. Or at the very least run them into a paddock where I can farm them for meat and hide later.\n\nLack of breeding. Such as for horses or the above mentioned cattle and goat herd, if we could have them.\n\nThe reliance on seeds from NPC's to farm and cook recipe meals. There should be more than fruits and berries found in the wild.\n\nBandits that can slide sideways across the ground as if they were flying. I can't move that fast sideways, they shouldn't be able to either.\n\nWell that isn't a full list, but it should be enough for you to get the basic idea of the state of the game. It is in development. the Devs are still adding and making regular fixes and changes. So there is TONS of possibility with this game, and I look forward to spending many hours on it. Oh, and I have played, Ark, Atlas, Conan Exiles and such. So I do have some experience with these types of games.", "timestamp_created": 1571148058, "timestamp_updated": 1571148058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652338683605194092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 19, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 1959, "total_negative": 1290, "total_reviews": 3249}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwACbX7zluME": "Mon Apr 22 23:48:04 2024"}}
