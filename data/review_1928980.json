Top rating.\n\nFinally.  I'm 70 years old and have been gaming since my Amiga computer in the '80s.  I do NOT play 1st person games because I suck at them.  I love crafting and building.  However, my 2nd most played game (following Rimworld) is 7 Days to Die with 2600 hours.  I don't really like 7DtD.  I'm not into the whole zombie thing.  I don't like the run-down broken environment.  I don't like the whole horde attack thing.  The character graphics really suck and, after 10+ yrs in EA, there's still no story at all.   I do like the survival aspects, provided I can dial them down to grandma level, which I can do in 7DtD.  And I love the voxel-based crafting and building that does not look like Leggo.\n\nI always dreamed of a game where I could actually be a character in a beautiful world.  Not a linear story RPG, but an RPG-like game with progression, good graphics, and Nightingale gives that.  The gear-based progression is as good as any other system of character growth.  The grind is the same as in any crafting/gathering game.  And I actually get that \"Gee, I wonder what that is over there!\" feeling...often.  Even though there's a lot of unfilled space, there are enough little encounters with animals and sites to keep the exploration great.  I like the building mechanics; not as fiddly as the voxel-style.  I don't see 3D irl, so this is much easier.\n\nThere are obviously issues.  Some examples:  The keyboard keys lose focus frequently (ESC stops working periodically...thank you for the Close button).  It's 50/50 whether you load properly or get a tool bar of shovels (TAB, run cursor over them brings back the icons).  The slight rest potion does nothing at all.  How to close a window is very inconsistent.  And I will very often lose connectivity when changing realms.  So the game isn't what I would call \"stable\" yet.  And if you remember the launch of any MMO back a few years, you'll recognize the feeling of frustration with servers that won't let you in.  But the game works pretty well for me.  Yes, I play on grandma difficulty, but the realm tailoring is what stands out.  I can adjust difficulties in-game.  The crafting system is quite fiddly -- OK by me -- and the interface is funky but I got used to it.\n\nAll in all, this is the game I've been waiting nearly 40 years for people and technology to make.  Thank you Inflexion Games.  I don't know how much time I've got left, but you've made the gaming ride worthwhile after all.", "timestamp_created": 1708729158, "timestamp_updated": 1708729158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1376, "votes_funny": 47, "weighted_vote_score": "0.94200664758682251", "comment_count": 54, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158849787": {"recommendationid": "158849787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013601014", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1708896779}, "language": "english", "review": "I Like It So Far....BUT\nHave dropped a few hours in now and want to give some honest feedback.\n\nThe Good\nFirst, the graphics are damn good, I mean their in the holy hell look at that category of good. The building mechanics are nice though early game your options do limit your creativity a little. The soundtrack similarly is very nice. Character outfits are great with the capacity for a lot of customisation.\n\nThe Okay\nThe harvesting mechanics though grindy are fairly easy to grasp. The weight of the melee weapons/tools feels good. It feels like your hitting stuff when you use it. The stamina system is not to punishing and makes you approach fights slightly carefully.\n\nThe Character creator is ok, but needs some more customisation options. In particular in designing the players eyes and jawline. It also needs a wider variety of voice options.\n\nThe Bad\nThe start of the game is dull, very frigging dull. This is very concerning as I can picture many players refunding the game before the time limit simply because of how dull the opening is. I hope the Dev's add some spectacle or drama to the start. I'm not talking Michael Bay levels of spectacle,but something that will grab a new player like say a Christopher Nolan movie ;P.\n\nTying into this, is the whole Puck as a guide thing. He is far from a likeable or interesting character. A central character such as this needs personality alot of personality. This again may put players off of the game. Though I get this is the aesthetic and style the Dev's are trying to imbue the game with, I would be concerned it may appeal to a limited audience.\n\nThe enemy AI is weak, very weak which is a shame as they look amazing.\nI urge people to get past the opening stages of the game and give it a good try, though this does remove the refund option. Perhaps Steam should look at extended refund windows for survival crafters.......", "timestamp_created": 1708476008, "timestamp_updated": 1708476008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 600, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919086039066314697", "comment_count": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160566932": {"recommendationid": "160566932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029584875", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 17071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8748, "last_played": 1712539786}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]This is an early access review.[/b]\n\nNightengale is not a bad game. Currently, I find the game mildly enjoyable, and I want this to be only a [i]slightly[/i] negative review. But in its current early access state, I cannot recommend it. The ideas are great. The mechanics are clunky.\n\nThe game has a solid Victorian-Gaslamp-Fae aesthetic. From your home base, you conjure up small, procedurally-generated maps with the biome and difficulty type you specify. You can further modify these realms or your home realm with a single set of modifiers. These modifier, biome and difficulty options come in the form of \"cards\" you unlock. Quests and a desire for gaining better equipment or more options drives you to explore ever more dangerous realms, all theoretically in a quest to reach the fabled Nightingale city after a disaster obliterated stable fae-realm transportation.\n\nAll of that is very good. The developers nail the aesthetic. But the elements beyond that feel shallow or clunky.\n\nThere are famous figures from history and mythology, like Doctor Frankenstein, to meet and get basic fetch quests from. These characters are not voice acted; their models are barely more then mannequins. And they won't offer more than a paint-coat thin level of lore. Your titular guide, Puck, is a far more interesting character, delightfully voice-acted, and with obfuscated intentions. Puck is intriguing. So far as I have played, he is the only one.\n\nI have played for a considerable number of hours and have not reached the end of the current content. At the same time, I somewhat feel like I did long ago. There are three distinct biomes which the difficulty cards modify with largely cosmetic changes. I thrilled at seeing airships in the sky for the first time, or industrial towers, until I realized they were just stage dressing with no baring on gameplay. I'm still looking for the same landmarks, still completing the same three-note musical puzzles, still fighting many of the same enemy types. As difficulty increases, I will occasionally slightly more complex musical puzzles, or a new monster to pickaxe to death. But these changes are too incremental.\n\nThe building is clunky but serviceable. After playing games with glorious building systems like [i]Valheim[/i] and [i]Enshrouded[/i], it feels like a step backwards. The same goes for crafting. I craft what I can with what I have, but feel no drive to push up a technology ladder. There's no dangling carrot. Neither building nor crafting are [i]bad[/i], but they fail to inspire.\n\nA few survival elements are beyond superb. The penalties for over-encumbrance in [i]Nightingale[/i] scale. And you are always able to teleport back to your base regardless of encumbrance. This a [b]phenominal[/b] bit of game design! Yet other survival elements are mediocre at best. The hunger rate in the game is obnoxious. Nobody needs to eat that many animals worth of meat a day to avoid starvation. Hunger does not work that way.\n\nThe largest problem, however, is that [i]Nightingale[/i] is plagued with poor mechanical choices, tragic complexity, and one of the worst documentation systems I have encountered.\n\nInventory can be a nightmare. Things only stack with things that are exactly like it, and minor variations abound. You will find your storage containers clogged with single-digit stacks of small variations of the same item. Even the same meat from the same type of animal killed in a different realm or under different conditions might craft with a post-decimal difference in one stat, making it require its own slot in your backpack. This problem extends into crafting, where you cannot craft an item that requires two pieces of leather if your two pieces come from different animals. To an extent understandable as some items gain bonuses based on which animal's hide went into its crafting. But most don't, and this issue applies unilaterally.\n\nYour crafting tables receive bonuses by building augmentations nearby and/or putting them in suitable positions. This is a wonderful idea implemented exceptionally well in [i]Valheim[/i] and echoed in many other games. [i]Nightingale[/i] takes it a step farther by having these augmentations also give extra plans. However,  crafting tables only accept limited augmentations and you cannot chose which ones they are drawing upon. Plus many of the benefits listed for augmentations are locked until unclear conditions are met. \n\nThe answers to these and many other questions might be found in the byzantine labyrinth of in-game documentation, but just as likely doesn't exist outside asking people on reddit. In some cases, different information about the same game element are available on different menus with no explanation. Some information is obfuscated unnecessarily. For example, when sorting by weight, you lose the ability to see how many items are in a stack. At the same time, the game has features that would be very welcome if it was clear they existed. I am by far not the first player to rack up multiple digits of play hours before learning you can break down higher tier essence for the lower tier needed for item repairs. \n\nTo exacerbate matters, there is a lack of complexity where it is sometimes needed. For example, one quest requires you to betray a trust in order acquire further vital quests. That is not fun, especially since you feel railroaded into it. There should be another option. Similarly, building in general needs a lot more room to be creative. \n\nI could list other examples, but the point is already clear: the developers need to give many systems another pass, tightening them up with a focus on fun over tedium and a wariness for non-beneficial complexity. They need to completely overhaul the in-game documentation.\n\nI believe this game has a lot of potential. I find the [i]idea[/i] of it fun. I find the aesthetics of it delightful. But right now it has too many problems to be more than mildly enjoyable. I look forward to the day when it becomes so, and I hope to change this review at that time.", "timestamp_created": 1710486787, "timestamp_updated": 1710489046, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 808, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.917073845863342285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158979194": {"recommendationid": "158979194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399756409", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 983, "last_played": 1709184133}, "language": "english", "review": "Very much enjoying the game so far! I do see alot of negativity but almost all of it seems to be a lack of prior research into the game. For anyone reading this, i want to give a quick explanation on the basic mechanics and the pain points often mentioned, so:\n\n Always Online:\nEvery \"Realm\" is a server, every combination of cards is like a server code basically. So, yes, the game needs to be online even if your single player, I sure wouldnt want my PC running the 5 different servers im going between at my base currently lol I can understand that some people are bothered by it, but I have also had no server issues at all in my experience so far.\n\nCrafting:\nThis isnt a \"Survival Lite\" game. It is not palworld or Enshrouded at all. This game is like an older style survival with many layers of in-depth crafting and building. For example, One Saw Table can have 5 or more modifying building pieces. These are usually a fun decoration to go with what its modifyng, like a saw horse or a saw stand and things. Building these gives new recipes for the saw stand. If the Saw Stand has lights you put up nearby, and a roof, it modifies the crafting time!  You also need to Realm-Travel for new recipes for the saw table, what wood you use on the table also changes the look of the outcome item, such as purple wood, or orange etc. Once you make a product, lets say its equippable, you then can make an augment for the product and also level up the product to increase its level. Augments have their own crafting station and there is tons of recipes to learn and make. These are like modifiers to increase damage, durability, weight, even playstyle on weapons and many other things. All of that to make one product your proud of on the Saw Table. Then, you can start going to even higher tier realms and find an even better table to do even more! So, with that small example, you see that there is a ton of depth to be had here that I have personally been looking for in a survival game for a while. \n\nThe Exploring:\n It's fun and the environments are very pretty, there are dungeons to delve, Magical creatures to behold and even interact with, quests to follow, puzzles to solve, hidden caves to find, NPCs to aid and even recruit and bosses to find and defeat! As you get into higher tier realms, you start running into mobs with better ai and that are much more threatening than the grass hoppers trying to eat you in your desert starting realm. Mobs also take better damage from different damage types which can be a fun challenge when all you brought was a maul and this hippo could care less lol\n\nBuilding:\nThe system I have also found quite enjoyable. It uses a blue-print system similar to Day-Z, so you can fully sketch out what you want to build first, and then you and your friends or even your NPC buddy can get the needed mats and just interact anywhere in the 3D blue-print. This will auto-take all those materials you carried and apply them. Rinse and Repeat and now your beautiful box, or family home, is complete :) You can find more detailed and better Tile-sets as you progress into harder realms. So yes, inverted roof pieces, pillars, railings, and triangle pieces exist for those builders who know the potential that means! There is also a farming system for my fellow players who get too caught up hand-watering 45 plots/flower pots and cooking things lol\n\nSurvival Jank:\n It is a survival game. If you have EVER played one, there is a special jank that they all have sometimes. Like your NPC follower will teleport to your roof for some alone time, or a boss yeeted you down a mountainside, or your NPC vanished when you dismissed him and you come home to him trying to harvest your decorative trees much to your horror, or a tree monster has opted into the new air travel program. Sometimes you travel to your home realms starting point instead of your assigned Respite. It happens, and honestly, the jank in this game is much much less obtrusive than other games in the genre that have been out for years now. \n\nThe UI and Sorting:\nIt is a little different than other titles, which I like. We need more creativity and less copy-paste. It uses a folder system similar to current Ark's engram system when looking for blueprints, unfortunately, it defaults to some folders being open so it can get a little cluttered when trying to find the correct \"folder\". This is remedied by just using the search bar offered above the blueprints. The crafting table UI does have some quick buttons in the bottom, so I had no issue quickly making food or just quick inserting mats to make for a item I just needed in bulk. The quick buttons have a \"Fill All Slots\" and a button to make as many as you have mats for. You can take your time to put in higher quality or specific mats if you so choose for a higher quality or different looking item. The game does have a challenge system similar to Conan to follow for some simple goals but you do need to find it in the guidebook.The game wont tell you. For sorting, ive seen some pain-points about it but all chests have the ability to label them and when your in the chests inventory UI, or your own, you can change how you want to view the items as a sorting method. I.E ABC, Weight, Newest etc. \n\nThe Tutorial:\n Its fine? Does it give you a good sense of the game? not really. It's a small lore intro to get you some context of the world and shows you the very basics of the game and as well as small bare-bones versions of 3 of the biomes. Magic was never really explained, nor how to use umbrellas, and the in depth crafting is up to the player to discover. This is very fine to me, but I see alot of people complaining about it. At least it even has a tutorial lol lots of Survival titles simply do not, especially in an early access launch. \n\nThe Combat:\n Have you ever played Skyrim? pretty much that with a little extras. You can headshot, and heart shot for some extra interest, the knife has a built in dash/dodge, and guns can be pretty fun. The combat opens up once you get modifiers into your weapons. For example: An Augment can give you a dps boost after blocking, or the more you shoot with a gun on a crit spot, your dps stacks higher and higher, or your hammer now has a  big aoe ground slam. But the early game, its gonna be the ol classic, dodge left and hit enemy, rinse and repeat. Your early mobs have very simple \"jump at you angrily\" ai until you get into some of your dungeons and harder worlds. The mobs also don't seem to have a proximity spawn to the player, so you will encounter them just kind of appearing on top of you sometimes when they spawn in. For what this game wants to be, its pretty decent overall! If you really want a fun an in-depth combat focused Survival game, thats Conan Exiles. \n\nFollowers:\n You can have one NPC that you recruit. They carry ALOT of supplies. They can be given different tasks determined by what you equip them with (this is very limited though, they are not that great at it) Pick=mine stuff as you travel, Axe= Harvest Wood, A Weapon=help me fight, and so on. They also put the mats from their inventory into a blue-print that you interact with. Thats about all. Their AI is pretty lackluster overall and they dont speak. They have a short tether range to you and will teleport to you when you are too far from each other. They don't always finish harvesting what they were working on either. If they go down in a fight, you can just help them up and they will help you when your down as well. Needs a bit of work still but im happy for the helping hand regardless and its a good start for the devs to build upon.\n\nIn Summary:\nI'm enjoying my experience with the game, but the game style isnt for everyone and thats okay! The Survival genre has all kinds of games with their own specific focus.  I have already found the game worth the price and I haven't even gotten to Nightengale yet! haha \n\n\nI might add more details and format better later on <3", "timestamp_created": 1708615618, "timestamp_updated": 1708620863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 746, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.916904926300048828", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158910647": {"recommendationid": "158910647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004356577", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 798, "last_played": 1712545865}, "language": "english", "review": "[h3] For all my chill builders who want a pretty new world to explore and love building mansions on waterfalls this game is for you[/h3]\n\nI am a conan exiles, ark, no man's sky, gamer and I played all for the building and exploring.

Nothing was lighting a fire beneath me. At some point, when you start hopping through portals and discovering new realms, everything clicks. This game puts a compelling spin on a tiring formula - and the deeper I got, the more engrossed I was. \n\nThe game has some real problems. Follower and enemy AI is rudimentary. It's missing some key quality-of-life features. The crafting system has so much to it, but it's a slog to use because it's impossible to find which chest you left your materials in. The menus need work, and some systems aren't well explained.\n\nThese are all things that I hope will be addressed by the dev soon. Currently, they're stopping a good game from being great. The issues are hard to ignore, but they don't outweigh the strengths of the game in my opinion. \n\nIf you're on the fence, it's probably wise to wait for some fixes and improvements to smooth out the experience.

They fill up all fired work stations (even of random NPC camps) with burnable material even rare and high tier material and you then need to actively get it out of the crafting stations and replace it with stuff you don't mind burning. ADDITONALLY they also dump high tier and rare materials into building projects they pass by or need to be build for settler NPCs. Super frustrating if you remembered picking up some new biome material and then its all gone.\n- Speaking about building projects, I would love to not have the \"auto fill\" option as default and the manual select by keeping it pressed. The amount of times I was mad because the smart \"auto fill\" took something I really didn't want to use because I did not keep it pressed for long enough or accidentally hit e to collect stuff while being to close to a project. Alternatively allow us to get the material out until it is actually completely full and under construction.\n\nSo now back to the realms for me, while it could be better it is still an interesting world to discover.\nIf you are enjoying the game: great. \nif you are still undecided or disappointed at the current state, wait for a sale or come back in a couple of patches.\nThe foundation is good but there is still some work ahead.", "timestamp_created": 1709474590, "timestamp_updated": 1709474590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 238, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.854628026485443115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158996573": {"recommendationid": "158996573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046553857", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 448, "last_played": 1708718990}, "language": "english", "review": "I would recommend, but maybe wait a few patches.

After about 50 hours and reaching gearscore level 270, here's my two cents on what should be changed.\n\n1) The crafting system needs a massive overhaul. All of the endgame recipes are as follows: you craft a thing so you can use that thing to craft another thing, which is needed to make a different thing, then that different thing makes another 'nother thing, and then the 'nother 'nother thing is used finally as a reagent for what you actually wanted to craft in the first place. And that thing you actually want to craft needs about 4 different items that all have the same issue. It is ridiculous and needs to be simplified. How do you fix this? Let us use base materials for everything so we can go from point A to point B instead of making it Points A, B, C, D, E, and F for no reason. For example: instead of using hide to make leather, then leather to make straps, then straps to make wraps, then wraps to make a hilt, then a hilt to make an item, just let me use the equivalent amount of hide to make wraps and get straight to the point. Cut out the middle man. For a crafting survival game, the crafting is tedious and really hinders you from getting to the more enjoyable parts of the game.\n\n2) The game needs an Essence conversion system. Specifically, we should be allowed to turn Tier 3 essence into Tier 2 or 1. Though the realms themselves become irrelevant quite quickly, you still need some Tier 1 and 2 essence in order to upgrade your gear from grey to green to blue to purple. It is such a complete waste of time to have to go back and do content that I am massively over-leveled for just to get the essence I need to upgrade my endgame gear. \n\n3) There needs to be better distinction between the types and quality of resources. I know it's very early access, so there are a lot of placeholder icons for crafting materials (which is fine), but this is more directed at the fact that certain items are vastly better than others for making weapons and armor, but the game gives you no indication that that is the case. Fabled Elder Eoten Wood Bundles are the exact same icon, color, etc as standard Wood Bundles that offer no attributes whatsoever. One you want to save to use for weapons and armor, and the other you likely just want to use as fuel, but because they are so visually indistinct from one another you may end up wasting a rare, valuable material on something you shouldn't use it for. \n\n4) There needs to be a better indication of exactly what each crafting recipe gives you. The crafting system works as follows: weapons and armor have base power levels that are dependent on both the recipe itself, as well as the materials used in that recipe. The base power level ultimately determines the maximum item level that is possible for that particular piece of gear. The issue is that the game does not tell you the base stats or power level of ANYTHING UNTIL YOU CRAFT IT. You have to completely waste materials just to find out if something will be worth keeping or not. For example: which is better? An Ornate Maul, or a Dauntless Maul? Who knows, they both cost Tier 3 essence, and they both require similar materials to make. What's the difference between Mystic and Dauntless (that cost the exact same amount of T3 essence)? Who knows! Game doesn't tell you. \n\n5) There are just too many damn benches. The sheer amount of benches is frankly ridiculous once you factor in all of the augmentations, which are just mini benches, that are needed to craft some of the items you want. You want to craft a full Dauntless set with your Excellent Work Bench that took you forever to farm for? Too bad, you need 7 more mini augmentation benches that you also have to farm and go through ridiculous crafting trees before you can do that. \n\n6) You can't upgrade the materials that you use to build your base. In the beginning, you start out with crude wooden and stone patterns and can build rudimentary structures. As you progress, you get recipes to build more elaborate and aesthetically pleasing structures like you see in the game's promotional footage and trailers. If you want to use it, however, you have to slowly take apart your current base one wall at a time, being careful not to destroy any of the benches and mini-bench augmentations that you've farmed tirelessly for. It would be nice if you had the option to use materials to convert existing walls and structures into other blueprints without having to go through all this hassle.\n\n7) The combat scaling is quite ridiculous. The spike in power level from one set of items to the next typically has you going from doing no damage at all to suddenly one or two-shotting everything in your path. However, as strong as you may be, you are still susceptible to being one-shotted yourself by bosses like Fabled Sun Giants. I would like to see more balanced scaling and combat. The fodder enemies die far too easily, meanwhile the Apex Creatures kill you way too easily as they do significantly more damage than anything else in the game, and there is no way to mitigate damage or tank them other than the blocking efficiency stat which usually lets you survive about one big hit at the cost of breaking an arm, or you get one-shotted through blocking anyway. There are really no mechanics to bosses other than run at them and swing, maybe dodging occasionally. This is really just an issue of how each individual mob type is tuned, and can easily be fixed with adjusting damage/health values. \n\nAll in all, I think this game has a TON of potential, and I would love for it to get there someday. At present, the crafting system is tedious and monotonous and makes the game significantly less fun than it could be.

Hard sideways thumb on day one. For me, it's about a 7/10, but it's...already a bit polarizing. \n\nThe Bad - to get this out of the way. \n\n1. Inflexion chose to have the whole game - including single player - to be online-only. If you live outside of NA - you're going to have a bad time. If you live in NA and aren't with an ideal ISP (like me - I'm on high orbit satellite) - your mileage is going to correlate with how well you can manage your expectations. \n\nI was hopeful that their system would be more like No Man's Sky - polling the servers to generate the worlds/realms, then only pinging periodically. That's not the case. For me, with solidly \"ok,\" for satellite internet, I lag and rubberband and I get stuttering, no matter what I do with my settings (and I can play virtually anything not needing internet on Ultra - for context). \n\nThis early in the dev process (it's Day One, writing this) the devs haven't really talked about their long term plans, but the *possibility* of having local hosting (which would be drastically preferable) has been talked about. If that's important to you - sideways thumb. Wishlist it for now. Because unless you're on a fully-wired connection (and especially if you're into co-op at all), it'll be difficult for you, if not unplayable. \n\n2. Polarizing Design Decisions. The character designs are stylized in a way that's very love/hate them. They're not photorealistic - if you come into this wanting that? You're going to have a bad time. I personally like what they did with the art direction, but plenty hate it. Either way, the process is interesting (it's not all bad). My beef is with the UI - it's actually the worst UI I have seen in the genre that's not from \"basement devs.\" If you remember the sheer jank that was early Conan Exiles and Valheim, before the UI overhauls and streamlining - yeah, it's that. Bars everywhere. Tiny timer icons (what are these? Icons for ANTS?!) for a frankly huge variety of buffs and debuffs (also not all bad). Very stock-looking health bars taking up a huge part of the screen real estate, etc. This extends somewhat to the crafting and inventory menus. They remind me of OG Skyrim - a separate button for everything, and difficult to intuitively move through the menu. It doesn't help that the in-game tutorial is very barebones at the moment. For example. \n\nYou get a mission to craft a thing. The game doesn't really tell you how. \n\nSo, you'd press I, maybe? Ok, that opens your inventory. You can see your stuff to craft with. But you can't craft. \n\nOk, so you hit C for Craft? You're SOL there too, because you have to close the inventory menu first. Then you can press C. \n\nThen it gives you groups of stuff - Cooking, Survival, Building, etc. Ok, you click through them and get blueprints for your tools and crafting stations, and more opens up as you go. Great, so you place your campfire - get it where you want to, press E to assemble it, press E on the bottom half to load your campfire with fuel, click \"ignite\" to light-switch it on, close that menu, press E on the top half to load it with food. and then you can finally  craft food. \n\n^ This is not, as you can tell, a very intuitive or fully-sensical process. These kinds of systems are very clearly not designed with UX in mind. Inflexion really screwed the pooch by not having more extended playtesting vs. server stress tests (though...given how well the servers have performed on Day One, I can absolutely understand why they were more worried with that side - despite the decision to release a few days early). \n\nA lot in the game is like that. It feels like very different teams pulled different things out of a hat to work on - and then didn't talk to each other at all about them until the very end of development, and then they were told \"it's fine, we'll just release in EA and fix it as we go -\" which seems to be the plan. \n\nBut aside from general Day One in EA jank - the controls are a little clunky/floaty, there are some balancing issues (stamina costs to swing a knife are absolutely insane, the material costs of structures and stations vs. your encombrance - and my god, it's 2024. Can we go back to not having encumbrance systems for games where the core loop centers around carrying a whole bunch of stuff from one place to another? That's not realism - that's just straight up an anti-fun system for extending playtime, and difficulty, artificially). There are obvious Day One performance creaks (there have been some dropped connections, unnecessary lag, some CTD on AMD cards and chipsets - at least from what I've seen of them), but from an Intel/Nvidia box, mine's handling that part fine. \n\nThat said. \n\nHonestly one of the most innovative, gorgeous setups I've seen in the genre, and it's one of my fave genres. \n\nThe whole concept? \n\nThe year is 1880-something. \nA long time ago, the Fae gave humans magic with a contract (as they do). Humans got greedy (as they do) and unleashed a magical plague-storm that led to the Faepocalypse. There's one human city left standing (Nightingale - the Zion of the Faewilds), and you, a Realmwalker are guided by Puck (You know, Robin Goodfellow. The merry wanderer of the night) for reasons that seem to very much be his own, and play steampunk stargate-meets-Quantum Leap trying to find your way back home to Nightingale with magical Stargate tarot cards. \n\nNeat stuff - and the voice acting and writing, while not exactly high literature, are actually a high watermark for the genre. Puck's VA's performance is stellar. And the writing is nicely 'period,' without a lot of the bloat that comes with that. Think more of a steampunk Firefly than Jonathan Strange. Nice lovecraftian undertones while still being very steampunk fantasy. \n\nAnd speaking of eldrich horrors beyond our comprehension - again with the art direction. The creature designs are to die for (you prob won't much until later in the game. AI is simple in the early game at least, and again - day one jank), they're oozing character and absolutely nail the vibe of the Faewilds being a very alien place just below the surface. Tinkerbell, this ain't. \n\nMusic is solidly ok - though somewhat forgettable and bland so far. Nothing really jarring, it's balanced well, it's a workhorse of a score. Does what it needs to do, when it needs to do it, then goes back to the barn. Not the kind of score you're likely to get stuck in your head. It's one that's so fitting - that it just blends into the background all the time. Which is kinda tragic. The composer is obviously very good, it just doesn't have a lot of soul and spice to it. \n\nOnline stuff - I'm a solo gamer myself, but for those of y'all listening to me ramble might be wondering about how multi works and if there's safe zones. Yes. You get a safe zone that's all yours, to build a base (here, an Estate) in. The rest is in instanced realms (procedurally generated, hosts up to 6 players), until you hit endgame with the big social hub. Til that time, you can play drop in/out co-op - and it is very much co-op. It's not designed to be more MMO-lite in the sense of grouping, raiding, etc., for the bulk of the game as it is. If you're looking for that for PvP - you're going to be sad. \n\nIf you obsess over period correctness (esp in terms of gender, race, etc) you're going have a bad time, and try dying mad about it for me, please and thank you. \n\nAs it is - very \"what are you willing to deal with,\" at the moment. Feels very early access (frankly feels pre-beta, maybe early-early beta for me), and there are the connectivity concerns and polarizing design choices, but it's mostly all here. If internet is a non-issue for you, and your box can run it - def worth at least a try at a little over $20.

This game on the other hand has done exceptionally well at keeping me intrigued. I've read reviews saying \"I was bored after 20 min\" and \"Typical Server issues\". These people have no concept of how a survival game works. Yeah, there may be a tutorial start that's slightly stretched, but its necessary considering the amount of aspects you need to understand, to be an efficient player. And yeah, there may be some server issues while transferring to another realm. This should be and expectation for a server based game, lets be real. \n\n There are a few things i look for when determining weather my time is worth putting into a survival game:\n1. What aspects of \"survival\" do I have to endure?\n2. How many resources are there to farm? \n3. Is there depth to the base building side?\n4. How much meat is there to the progression? \n\nNow the last question may be the most important considering this is a non-mmo (initially)\nMy thoughts are that because this is still in early access there are plans to make some sort of transition into an mmo, based on the interactions I've had with NPC's. One could argue that wishful thinking, but it only would make sense. As far as staying busy, im 25 hours in and only lvl 60 gear score with some resources needing a lvl 400 to farm.\n\nAs far as aspects of survival, there's plenty to worry about. From thunderstorms that produce hail to burning rays of sun in the desert biom's, the struggle is real. I was especially happy with the extreme variety of cooking to the game, which segways to my second detail. Resources. The amount of resources in the game is comparable to mmo's like ESO and Runescape. 25 hours in and still discovering new plants, minerals and hide.\n\nlastly id like to get into the base building. The only problem I have with this side of the game is the amount of time it takes to unlock detail i can put into my homestead. They've put great detail into different materials and styles of this aspect and its refreshing to see. No problems with snapping foundations or roofs like others in the past. I give an A- on the building side for that reason alone.\n\n Overall i am very pleased with what they've done so far and am crossing my fingers that this isn't a full release disguised as an early access.

For example, I can select an infusion that I may want for my weapon, spend the resources to make it, only to find out that it can't be used on my weapon but only on 3 others items I have. This is a huge problem and I am not sure how they expected players to know what to craft for which items. Huge slip here that has nothing to do with early access.\n\n-Yet another open world survival crafter with ONLY square building pieces that fails to give players triangle pieces. it would literally only take a triangle foundation and a triangle floor as the game already allows players to mesh building pieces together.\n-Can only play online. This one doesn't bother me as much, however, I can see how this is a big problem for many people, and it does seem short sighted to not offer an offline mode considering a lot of people whom play open world survival crafters want to play alone offline.\n-No weight indicators unless you go to your inventory\n-The raise elevation function for building pieces just doesn't work ....at all. Maybe it's just on my end, idk\n-The options for melee weapons early game is....tbh terrible. You have tools that you have to use as weapons or a large maul that swings really slowly. If I can craft a semi automatic pistol, I should be able to forge a sword. Early game melee has terrible flavor and it made me feel boxed in a lot (however this could just be because it is in Early Access).\n-The first armor set is ugly, and it makes sense that is it, as you're making it out of bare bones crafting benches made of just uncut wood. However, the second set of armor looks even worse somehow....I really do not understand this. And then then the 3rd and 4th sets look great and amazing. The pacing is a bit off here obviously.\n-There aren't that many valuable off hand options besides potions and one's umbrella (and there's a separate slot for healing potions already so you don't need an offhand for that). Although the umbrella is such an amazing offhand choice, In would really have loved to see grenades or some other effective off hand for combat. It would have been better to not offer me a separate quick heal button for health potions so I felt i could use my off hand my effectively.\n\nAll in all, this game is incredible, with my only real big gripe is not having triangle building pieces.\nif you were on the fence about this game (and live in North America so as to avoid the connection issues others are having) I can safely assure you as a very experienced Open world survival crafter player, invest in this game, and you will not be disappointed.....Unless you just despise Victorian looks and Fae for some reason.\n\nHappy Gaming", "timestamp_created": 1708933597, "timestamp_updated": 1708934084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803055703639984131", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158869680": {"recommendationid": "158869680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020845757", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1708492504}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is gorgeous and there are many good elements and foundations here with the portal system and the story, but I have some reasons to wait on this one until it's ironed out.\n\n[b] Wait till QoL is better: [/b] Storage is just horrible, no way to move items easily or to craft from storage, both are unacceptable for me, I just can't play this until at least this is better.\n  \n[b] Wait till the UI is better: [/b] It's still so cluttered and it feels like there is just endless buttons and windows you have to go through to do one simple thing, you don't care about 90% of the information being shown to you on screen. \n\nHere's the cycle to cook at a campfire:  \n[olist]\n    [*]E to open crafting window\n    [*]Click recipe to open recipe window\n    [*]Click ingredient to open ingredient window\n    [*]Click ingredient from inventory\n    [*]Click ingredient 2 to open window\n    [*]Click ingredient 2 from inventory\n    [*]Maybe a 3rd or even 4th ingredient\n    [*]Click mange fuel to open backpack and fuel window\n    [*]Click and drag fuel from backpack to fuel window\n    [*]Click ignite\n    [*]Exit\n    [*]Click craft\n    [*]Exit\n    [*]Wait for craft time\n    [*]E to collect crafted item\n    [*]Congrats you've made 1 cooked berry flower mix\n[/olist]", "timestamp_created": 1708497016, "timestamp_updated": 1708533123, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 419, "votes_funny": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.791909396648406982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158826964": {"recommendationid": "158826964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198933146542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1709341358}, "language": "english", "review": "BETTER WITH FRIENDS , I HAVE NO FRIENDS", "timestamp_created": 1708456496, "timestamp_updated": 1708456496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 233, "votes_funny": 160, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790781736373901367", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158852741": {"recommendationid": "158852741", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978819758", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 260, "last_played": 1708593272}, "language": "english", "review": "I REALLY like a lot of this game so far, but this is getting a negative for one giant issue. I'm sure if you've seen any other reviews around mind, it's for the same reason.\n\nBeing always online, even when playing solo, is absolute nonsense. There is no reason a game like this has to be online at all times.\n\nWhich is only compounded by the servers being a trash fire currently. Don't get me wrong, I totally understand that server management is a difficult especially at launch when you don't know how many people will be playing at one time, and the servers get a giant wave of activity.

Not to mention, gorgeous music. If you like exploring the world, building, farming materials, grinding for gear, surviving, etc., as is the case in all survival games, this game is a good addition to your repertoire. Basically, If you like survival games, you'll probably like 'MOST' of Nightingale. Unfortunately, the game is very very early access. It might be a good idea to wait a few months for this one. Some of the issues are too much to bear. \n\nCons:\n\n- The beginning/tutorial of the game is unbelievably dull. Not to mention, it is too long and un-rewarding for what it is.\n\n- The HUD, menu system, crafting system, and storage system need serious QoL improvements.\nThe crafting menu system is so bad in Nightingale that they have included an 'auto-fill' button for crafting. You don't simply move items from your inventory into a crafting table or just click a button to craft and it uses the items that you have. No, you have to first click 'autofill' for some weird reason. You can't even see your inventory while in a crafting station. Really strange design choice.\nAs of right now, you also have to reach across your keyboard for 'esc' to close out of everything or swipe to the top of your screen to find the 'close' button in the top right. It gets very annoying after opening a few things in your base.\nThere's also no straightforward ctrl-clicking or shift-clicking options to stack/split/take-half/take-one of the items. It is only if you are opening something that you can use the janky shift-clicking system (it's still really bad). As someone who has played a lot of survival games, this is a MUST FIX. This game is going to give people carpal tunnel. \n\n- Items would benefit from colour-coding based on tier-level. \nRight now, items are a field of beige and grey's which is not great to look at or easy to distinguish between. If you have the same item of multiple tiers, there's no easy way to see what tier it is without hovering over it and reading what tier it is. \n\n- All materials in the chests in your general vicinity should be accounted for when crafting.\nThis isn't a problem in many survival games, but because the menu system is so bad and there are so many materials and different tiers of the same materials that all do different things in Nightingale, there is no reason why crafting tables should not be able to pull stuff from chests that are close to you. Enshrouded did this very well with their 'magic chests\" and Nightingale desperately needs something like that. \n\n- The building system overall is meh. Doesn't feel good. \nIt is crazy how small the early weight capacity is (even with an early backpack) which makes building very annoying early on. You need multiple materials for every build, except you can't hold that many without being encumbered. Therefore, it results in a constant running back-and-forth from storage containers and using their very bad menu system to grab a couple items to run back and place something, running back again, grabbing a few more things, using the bad menu system, running back, placing an item, etc.\n\n- This game can feel empty and the creatures do not always feel like they belong in the world. \nThere are cool POI's in the world, but many of the creatures and NPC's feel 'copy-pasted' with their sole purpose being for you to run into and kill. Very few of the animals and creatures look natural or like they belong in the environment. Many of them stand in place staring out into a void until you get close enough where they finally 'activate.' They do not feel real. I wish there were more animations for the creatures which showed them just hanging out, playing, eating, doing things with each other, etc. The behaviours and animations are seriously lacking and at least for me, it disconnects me from the otherwise beautiful and cool looking game. \nAlso, You will often run into a creature where 12 metres away there is the exact same creature just standing there, and 12 metres away there is the exact same creature just standing there, and 12 metres away there is the exact same creature just standing there, and 12 metres away there is the exact same creature just standing there, etc. Again, this makes the world feel fake and eerily empty. \n\n- There should be more variety in the types of POI's (it is early access though, so I'm hoping for more). \n\n- Combat is lacking mechanics. Very boring. \nEvery creature I have come across or seen in videos so far attacks in a straight line and you can just back up in a circle and go around them over and over waiting for your stamina to come back. The combat devolves into holding 'A' or 'D' or 'S' and waiting for your stamina bar to replenish. \n\n- The whole gear-level requirement to get into dungeons is dumb. \nPlayers should not be met with a gear-level number requirement that basically says \"get better gear\" in order to enter dungeons. This isn't an MMO. At least not in the beginning. \nAs I understand it, this game will have a dungeon-like or raid-like end-game mechanic so maybe in late-game when you've already done everything it is okay. But when you're just out exploring and feeling a little immersed only to be hit with numbers that don't allow you to go into places because you have cloth instead of leather pants.....it's just dumb and immersion breaking. Players should have to figure out for themselves that they do not have the required gear or stats to beat something and be punished for going out into the world when they are not ready. Conversely, they should be rewarded if they do beat it when they are not prepared. Some of the best moments from survival games comes from venturing out where you don't belong and being absolutely annihilated by a creature you didn't even know existed. It also works as a tease and motivates you to want to get back there.\nOverall, the immersion-breaking progression gate-keeping is weird and uncalled for. TAKE IT OUT. \n\n- I've heard that progression is very slow and grindy.\nIn my opinion, this would be okay if the world itself felt more lived-in, immersive, and enjoyable to be in. Valheim, for instance, is a very grindy/slow progression later on. However, it is very dense and despite the graphics/art-style, the world feels natural/lived-in so people love simply 'existing' in that world. If Nightingale could add more animations, polish up the creatures, make combat more enjoyable, make building more enjoyable, get rid of so many number indicators of level requirements (strange immersion-breaking progression gate-keeping) and convince the player that the Nightingale world is real overall, progression taking a long time shouldn't be an issue. The problem right now is the world can feel empty, unnatural, and janky, and so you just want to progress quickly rather than exist in the world for it's intrinsic value. Unfortunately, if it takes forever to progress and you don't want to be in the world because it doesn't feel real, there is an obvious problem with wanting to keep playing. \nStill, if the progression is TOO grindy as I have heard people saying, that is simply never good. Regardless of how real the world feels. People have lives. \n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI have been waiting for Nightingale for almost two years now and unfortunately, I am disappointed. The world is so beautiful and it has so many opportunities for improvement, but as of right now, it feels dead, empty, soul-less, and unnatural. The setting/atmosphere/skybox/environments/music are gorgeous and unbelievably refreshing for someone who has over 4000 hours in survival games. However, nothing feels real. The HUD and crafting system is going to give you carpal tunnel, The combat is boring, the game is grindy, the creatures are cardboard cutouts, etc. With some serious work this game could be great. But as of right now, it is a struggle to even enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1708640851, "timestamp_updated": 1708640851, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 435, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.783753871917724609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159071253": {"recommendationid": "159071253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198432150864", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1708645178}, "language": "english", "review": "Nightingale is a promise of what could be, but what it definitely is not at the moment. I am a fae and Victorian era lover, so the blending of both in -- even better a survival crafting game -- was an enticing exciting idea. Add to that the promise of beautiful reams, magic, and beautiful haunting beasties and I'm hooked. However, this game is just missing the dart board for me. \nThe UI:\nFirstly, the UI is clunky, more so than other survival crafting games which can often have clunky UIs. Some items do not have pictures, they simply have a wax seal with the letter N on it. I thought for a while I had lost items I picked up because of this. I understand early access, but every item SHOULD have a distinguishable picture even if it is not the final picture it will have. There are simply too many items in this game for something as common as chitin to not have an icon. \nI did see someone else mention different colors for different tier levels, and yes each item has different tiers of quality, and I agree. Even if it is as simple as a different color background helping me to identify the difference between a tier 1 and tier 2 hide would be lovely considering there are so many items and tiers of these items.\nThe exit button... You must hit 'e' to open a storage container, or 'b' for the building menu etc. however, you cannot simply hit those buttons again to close the menus and even worse the close button seems to be in different parts of the screen depending what menu you've open. I should not have to spend minutes looking for the close button in a menu in a game that does not have a pause button even in single player. It does not feel good, it is not a good flow, and it does not help that the cursor speeds between my FP perspective and the menu is WAY different. I have lots of wrist problems, and a few minutes into playing this game I can feel it.\nThe Crafting:\nThere are too many items, too many item tiers, too many crafting benches, too many add ons for those benches, too many storage boxes needed, and too little carry weight for this game not to pull from the chests in your base or have storage options themselves. Crafting is a level 12/5 in annoyance, and this is coming from someone who enjoys the crafting in games like Conan Exiles, and Valhiem. I will say that the base building itself, allowing you to place down the blocks and allowing you to add to the building from anywhere building it all at once is a feature I like. \nThe Armor/Dungeons:\nFirstly, I'd like my starting gear back thank you. I look like a vaguely Victorian inspired caveman at the moment in patchwork brightly colored YELLOW hide clothes. Personally it does not feel good to feel as if your gear has been downgraded when you are supposedly 'upgrading' it. The starting gear should not look better than the first gear you are forced to craft and wear. And yes, you are FORCED to wear it otherwise you are bared from dungeons. I do not like this mechanic. I would rather run around in my starting gear (which was explicitly stated as having been prepared for this journey in the case of character creation) yet I must do away with it moments after arriving because this ugly, yellow hide number is twice as good. Now this isn't a visual downgrade with a story to it. Its not garnered off the back of a powerful early game enemy one must defeat and wear as a sort of trophy or because this creature offers some sort of magical extra protection. No, its made from simple boar and deer hide. HOW is that better than the explorers gear I started off with? The simple pack looks like it can hold maybe two rocks, how is that better than the explorers pack made by much more skilled hands than mine surely are?\nDungeons require a certain gear level (gathered by downgrading your visual look and upgrading your other equipment) to enter. You are barred from entering unless you meet this requirement. Absolutely hate it, it breaks immersion. While this is explained away by the spirits deciding if you are worthy or not, it makes zero sense. I would much rather have tasks I have to complete, monsters I have to slay, or puzzles I have to solve be the deciding factor in my 'worthiness' than what level of gear I'm wearing. More than that, accidentally stumbling into a far too high level dungeon and either being instantly vaporized or having that nice little 'you are about to enter an area above your skill level would you like to continue' menu pop up is much more preferable. \nRealm Walking:\nI do not mind the always online aspect. Do I believe an offline single player option would be something we should have? YES. Recently they announced they are working on that, and good, honestly that should have been the thing it came out with. I understand wanting massive co-ops, but most people play alone or with one or two other friends. Having one realm open at a time and forcing everyone into that realm for co-op and allowing an offline single player option would have been a MUCH better start. However, as I stated, I don't mind the always online aspect since I understand what they are going for.\nMy issue with realm walking is this: My partner and I just arrived at our first realm, we're greeted by an incredibly generic NPC (all of which go on incredibly boring, un-voiced press next or E to read the next line text chats, this is however a rant for another moment) and are given a task. One that requires upgrading or infusing or something of that nature a spyglass. This requires the benches we have back on our main realm. Oh, but when I try to return I'm met with a message saying I may not be able to return to the realm I've just opened.\nSo what am I to do? Re-build EVERY ONE OF THE INSANE NUMBER OF BENCHES EVERY TIME I'M MET WITH A NEW TASK? That is absolutely ridiculous if it is the case. And there is no help to figure out a fix for this, as like many games (in fact this one is a worse offender than most) it does not hold your hand and guide you into what to do and how to do it, because otherwise I'd have to basically re-build our home base in every new realm only to leave it for good when we head back. Progress lost, locked, stolen, thrown to the ether. What?! I saw someone here mention they have like five realms open at once, how does that work? Because I'm now scared to leave the realm I just opened because if I leave and lose it, I won't be able to finish my quest.\nEnemies:\nI don't know about late game, but early game the AI is janky at best. You hit a monster or mob and they run away from you only to return at breakneck speeds. And often music is the only warning something is near as most of them make no sound. The number of times a wolf or boar has blindsided me is ridiculous. They should make SOME sound. A howl, a grunt when they hit you, the soft footfalls on the leaves, something. No, the world itself is very quiet.\nMusic:\nThe music is lovely, the ambient sounds are alright though they are MOSTLY disconnected from the surrounding wildlife.\nIn closing:\nI am fighting to want to keep this game and not refund it. I WANT to enjoy this game, but there are so many issues, not even counting the bugs and other problems it has, that just make it very hard for me to want to spend the MANY hours this type of game requires to get enjoyment out of it. I can see the developers listen to what the fan base is saying, and that honestly is the only thing keeping me from emailing steam right now for that refund. \nI would not recommend that you pick this game up at this time. There are far too many QOL issues to truly find it enjoyable. However, if you wish to give it a try anyway, I can see the potential in this game and that it COULD be great. It has all the fundamentals, just no execution.

Sometimes reminded me of walking around in skyrim and just enjoying the ambience.\r\n\r\n- the climbing picks are really cool, but also very buggy. They allow you to scale pretty much any vertical surface.\r\n\r\n- a few interesting dungeon templates. I mainly liked the one with the extra portal at the bottom of the dungeon that led to another dungeon. More 15-30 minute content like that would be great.\r\n\r\n- complex crafting system that takes material quality, crafting station, and crafting station augmentations into account when determining the outcome of the craft. \r\n\r\n- the building system works well\r\n\r\n- music is good and fits the theme well\r\n\r\n- weapon hit feel is pretty good\r\n\r\n- sound design is pretty good\r\n\r\n- having both headshot and heartshot as critical weakspots is cool. enemies have vulnerabilities to different weapon types and damage types.\r\n\r\n- they have a framework to create an interesting combat system that takes some inspiration from skyrim, vermintide 2, and destiny 2\r\n\r\n- the realm card system is really interesting even in this game's early days. Lots of room to expand.\r\n\r\n- can name portals, chests, and some other things which is nice for management\r\n\r\nCons: \r\n- Combat. While the foundation is there, currently, combat lacks complexity and it seems you can get by through chugging health potions and lmb spamming enemies down. \r\n\r\n- The application of procedural generation here is immersion breaking at some point. You will see the same structures over and over. I can't help but think each \"level\" and \"type\" of realm should have a bespoke and unique dungeon with greater rewards. Sprinkling the same towers/dungeons all over the map just makes me feel like i'm wasting my time and doesn't encourage me to try other realms.\r\n\r\n- QoL is severely lacking in a lot of aspects. The developers, at the time of writing, are actively working on this.\r\n\r\n- This game is currently online only and has pretty long load times as I assume every time you enter a realm they are reactivating a dormant server via a cloud service.\r\n\r\n- Very grindy. I think this could be addressed by lowering the amount of resources required for some of the early and midgame crafts. Issues related to grind were exacerbated by early encumbrance limits (later mitigated by magic backpacks), painful inventory management, and lack of QoL.\r\n\r\n- Way too many items in the game. There isn't just one type of lumber. For example, lumber alone has multiple tiers and variants like tier 1 swamp lumber, tier 1 forest lumber, tier 1 desert lumber, tier 2 swamp lumber, etc. These items do not stack and makes the cumbersome inventory management of a survival game even worse.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nThe game definitely drew me in, but once the shock of the pretty visuals and novel experiences wear off you are left with unfinished game systems, mid combat, and repetitive short-form content. They should focus on improving combat and reworking the fae towers/ruins/encounters (what I'll call \"resource towers\"). The resource towers sprinkled across the map would be more interesting if they were fewer, more rewarding, and longer form. Some other improvements are probably down to QoL changes and math/stat tweaks to make you feel like you're playing the game rather than playing an inventory management sim. This game is so close to being awesome and I'm looking forward to more updates. \r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1709687900, "timestamp_updated": 1709687900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776141762733459473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158881434": {"recommendationid": "158881434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045833434", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 934, "last_played": 1708950364}, "language": "english", "review": "Difficult to recommend in the current state.\nThere are a lot of mechanics in this game that are very player unfriendly. Here are a few things I didn't see anyone else mentioning:\n\nFirst, my group is stuck. To progress, I'm 99% sure we need to finish a quest where we get \"2 heartshots and 3 headshots\" but no one has managed to get a single \"heartshot.\" Not one. We've tried shooting all manner of enemies in the heart. No luck. If this really is a requirement to progress, maybe tell us what we need to do, explicitly. Everything feels vague in this game, and the quality of life is very low.\n\nThe game's biggest problem is that the start sucks. It's just not all that interesting and, more than most games, you're not going to know what to do. The character creation feels extreme, in a good way. Let's say you design a relatively stylish character.  The game is going to force you to almost immediately throw away your armor and put on the ugliest yellow clothes I've ever seen in a game like this and you're going to keep those clothes on for.... I don't know. I'm 15.5 hours in and still haven't upgraded. Just why? Seriously, I'd prefer to wear trash bags.\n\nInventory management? How about 6 different stacks of slightly different plant fiber? Oh and everything in your inventory moves FOR you. You can't put something in the slot you want... in a survival game. It might drive you mad.\n\nWant to progress in a group? Great!... well, until one or more of you falls behind. They can still progress, they just have to go to take time out of their day to run to several big empty towers, climb to the top, and click on something to progress. This happens a lot.\n\nMovement is okay, but climbing feels awful. This isn't BotW. This isn't even Assassin's Creed. Be prepared. It's janky, but climbing seems to work a LOT better when you don't running start and you constantly mash the jump button (unless you have a parasol in hand, then you can't climb at all).\n\nSpeaking of parasols... you can equip a parasol to glide down slowly, right? Cool. Unfortunately, the parasol has to be equipped, in a hotbar slot, and it takes up a lot of the screen. You can even add movement speed buffs to your parasol and it will shield you from rain/sun, so the devs EXPECT you to be running around with this thing taking up a lot of screen space like 90% of the time. The parasol engages when you hit it's use key - \"F\" or when you hit jump... but only when its equipped. Thing is, this game has a LOT of climbing up very tall towers, slowly. And pretty much every boss has a way to knock you all the way down. Some of the weapons have a very fast dash attached (which is fine, don't change that). When you fly off of a tower, you should be able to panic press your parasol button (it already annihilates your piddly stamina bar, which you might not have very much of during a fight). Instead, you have to switch to the parasol mid-air then use it, and for all of that work sometimes the game doesn't even seem to register that you've activated it and you still die.\n\nPuzzles. Look, I like puzzles, and I like doing them with a group. The puzzles in this game are fine, but you'll be repeating content by your third or fourth one. The variety is lacking to an insane degree.\n\nI still have a lot to talk about, but I need to sleep, so let's cut straight to the twist ending: I think this game can and might end up being great. Combat is basic but can be a surprising treat. Very few games make the 2-handed maul feel like you're hitting someone with a giant hammer, but a lot of the enemies crumple from one swing, then when they try to get up, you down them again with a jumping swing to follow up.

Performance outside of server instability has been fine for me, better than Enshrouded. Portal mechanics are interesting and Estates are cool.

I believe this game has the potential to be a very fun and exciting game but at the moment it is missing a lot of core mechanics and quality of life that would make it worth playing in the first place.\n1. The combat though seems like it has potential consists of enemies that don't have much going on except health bars and lame leaps and auto attacks.\n2. Puzzles. The game has \"Unique locations\" that contain puzzles to access upgrades, Bonuses, and Recipes. Sadly, the puzzles are super simple, a 5 year old child could solve them and doesn't feel super engaging.\n3. Though the game is forcing you to play online, which itself is an issue since you are yet again at the mercy of unreliable servers, their is no side by side progression through quests of tutorials with any of your 5 other friends you could be playing with.\n4. Speaking of tutorials, the tutorial takes 30 to 60 minutes to complete depending on how quickly you catch on to mechanics with limited inventory management and material efficiency, all of which you have to complete before being able to join someone else's world/host one\n5. The player limit being 6 for a game that boasts size and versatility is sad and a bit of a let down. The world variety is a grand total of 3 at first and cards aren't varied either which is what would have made this game stand out.

I think that you should have held this game closer to your chest and maybe released it a little later in production so that there would have been a cleaner and more focused direction in your game. Maybe a longer discussion and better decision making in what you want the content available upon release needed to be had but this game as is, disappointing to say the lease.

Beautiful vistas, inhabited by whimsical creatures who might be friend, for or neither, chock-full of intriguing ruins and points of interest scattered all over the place, with all sorts of small puzzles and challenges to overcome in exchange for some loot and new crafting recipes. And when you feel like you've had enough of that world, you can simply teleport back home and from there open a portal to an entirely new world. You even get to select the type of world you want to visit next, by combining destination cards to customize the destination to your liking.\n\nThere's a story running in the background, but the game mostly leaves you to your devices and doesn't hold your hand for long. You're pretty much free to explore and do whatever you want instead of getting railroaded every step of the way; the story quests simply point you the way. You'll eventually get to meet, or at least hear from, such historial persons/characters as Victor Frankenstein, Allan Quatermain, Nelly Bly, Ada Lovelace and Bass Reaves.\n\nBuilding is simple and the crafting is very, very extensive (every piece of gear you'll ever use needs to be crafter) but not complicated or annoying. No RNG. Through using slightly different materials and selecting different upgrades and magical powers, you can create the gear with the stats and powers you want instead of relying on blind luck and chance.\n\nNow sure, there are some niggling issues. The UI is pretty and functional but needs some fine-tuning here and there to make it more usable. Inventory management is an issue because there's at least a handful of variations to each type of material, and storage space is at a premium. However, once you craft yourself a backpack and unlock storage chests instead of the storage bags you get at the beginning, things get much better. Plus, the game has a great feature: it lets you, at any moment and anywhere, turn anything into magical dust that has no storage limits; this magical dust is what you use to repair your gear, to buy stuff from vendors, and to craft some stuff. If you, like me, keep picking way too much stuff off the ground (plant fibers! rocks! sticks!) you'll love this because it means you'll never have to feel guilty again for having to leave stuff behind. Some people complain about the enemy/friendly AI but I find it adequate. I'm not looking for Dark Souls combat, thank you very much. Combat feels dangerous enough.\n\nUnfortunately I haven't had the chance to try the coop multiplayer because Nightingale came out right after Helldivers 2 (I love it too), and in the same week as Last Epoch and Pacific Drive, and that's what all my friends are playing right now.\n\nAnyway, the game is in Early Access, and has only been out for four days, so give the devs time to sort things out.

I provided feedback and hoped they would fix some of the more glaring issues. Instead, they doubled down on some of the more annoying aspects. There are now in my crafting view, 27 augments for various crafting benches. These are items you craft and place near the other benches. Some augments affect only one bench, some affect multiple. \n\nThe augments don't actually unlock anything, for that you need to buy the recipe or unlock it during encounters / story progression. So I don't see the point except to sink all your resources into junk and make you run around more. They literally have a checkbox that says \"don't show augments\" because it's so much useless clutter in the crafting menus and know this and made a special checkbox for this. Maybe rethink why you needed the checkbox and eliminate the reason for it. Like I have 27 augments and out of ALL of those, I have 4 or 5 recipes unlocked. The majority are absolutely worthless and there's no reason to be able to craft them. WHY?!\n\nThen of course all 8 or 9 of the crafting benches you created at the beginning of the game are obsolete after using them to craft one series of items - full kit of tools - now it's worthless. But - those same crafting benches maybe can't be used to craft the next tier of benches or at least not easily. New benches seem to require advanced materials you can't craft until you have the new benches. So the only alternative is to play fetch by going to another realm to buy the materials which you mostly pay with tier 1 essence earned in the game by grinding through encounters.  Have I mentioned it takes a couple minutes to open the realm to the place where you might randomly encounter a trader that might have the items you need but there's no guarantee so you start over after 30 minutes of wasted time running across the map?\n\nI still don't know if the developers have ever played video games before. The quality of life mechanics you'd expect in survival craft games time and time again seem to get left out until the community has to remind the developers of what's expected in this genre. \n\nChests : It's auto sort only and not by material type, it's by name. You can't rearrange anything in your inventory. \nQuickbar : you can use the mouse wheel to select slots 1-5 but slots 6-0 can't be selected by the mouse wheel. You have to hit the number and the number is furthest away from WASD. \nCrafting menu : This is absolutely painful and seems to have gotten worse for release. 20 different categories with all the same color scheme, crafting benches are in different categories based on tier level and also some other random design thought? Click on the item to craft has to be done twice sometimes for some bizarre reason then you have to click on the \"place\" button to tell it you want to craft then you have to add the items to craft to the crafted wireframe model before it fully crafts. On top of that, it's set to auto use whatever it wants from your inventory if you interact with the crafted item even. Let's say some low tier junk metal is your preference but you have tier 3 refined etched metal in your inventory and hit interact on accident... goodbye expensive items. You can't default to asking you what to use as crafting material, it's hold E for 3 seconds every single time to avoid using your best materials. \n\nI could go on. Like tons of items don't have graphics in your inventory. A simple placeholder graphic or item name in place of a generic icon would be useful. Coal just has a logo'd N as well as 10 other items.

(I know some of these will come out in updates over time but it still seems undercooked even for EA).\r\n\r\nHere is a quick list of my personal problems/issues/complaints:\r\n- No quick stack items\r\n- Recruit AI is the worst I have ever seen (they provide literally nothing other than bag space reliably)\r\n- Why can Puck not let me fast travel to the top of the dungeon I just painfully climbed all the way down (as if the magic don't exist or whatever?)\r\n- The UI and menus is cluttered as hell and clunky to interact with in general\r\n- Why are there 2 build modes? (no build mode tutorial, hard to naturally find the way to dismantle/move objects\r\n- No quick pulling from chests for crafting (ah yes let me crawl around with all the raw wood and stone I need to craft things)\r\n- Terrible traversal; ledge grabbing is inconsistent and clunky, climbing picks are jank and buggy as hell, the picks and parasol DRAIN stamina like a mf\r\n- Puzzles that are based on said terrible traversal and other kinda bland mechanics for almost 0 reward\r\n- Why do buffs from rewards literally last like 2 minutes? What is the point?\r\n- The player icon/pointer on the map blocks the POI you are near or standing on, so you cannot see what it is\r\n- With the way menus and UI exist in this game a search function should be implemented\r\n- My main gripe with no offline play is being unable to actually tune the world settings to my liking (if I dont like the grind they decide on well tough luck)\r\n- Feeling like you need to build bases in each world/realm but they quickly become meaningless, making hopping realms feel a bit tedious\r\n- Game loses its cool aesthetics and vibes when you are stuck in rags and shacks for god knows how long...\r\n\r\nAnyhow thats enough complaining, things like quick pull from chests for crafting and quick stack have been hinted to be some of the first things devs will add to the game but releasing without these in 2024 after solid competition released isn't exactly a great start.

It has a detailed and deep crafting system, a good (with a couple of exceptions) codex, various puzzles and bosses. The game already has a whole set of mechanics for interacting with the world and created objects. There is even some, but quite sane, end-game content (at the very start of EA!). And the optimization does not cause me any particular complaints, it produces 4k 120 fps with minor drops at ultra. Yes, with upscalers, well, neighboring games don\u2019t  work normally even with them.\n\n I don't understand at all how people use enshrouded as an example for a nightingale, which I like and which I completed with pleasure, but to claim that it is better, much-much better  than nightingale? What are you talking about?  Here  literally  every aspect of the game is, if not better, then at least not inferior. Including crafting, which is  almost completely useless in enshrouded, including coop, which has there absolutely no balance or meaning, including activities, monsters and almost everything,  the Nightingale is a cut above.\n\nSo, if everything is so good, why does nightingale have mixed reviews? Well, not everything. Here are several reasons. The biggest of them is that the idiots were written three times that the game REQUIRES an Internet connection, they buy the game, see the lack of an offline mode and write an angry review. Hello there. To be fair, the developers screwed up both - and the servers and their optimization, true, the biggest L. I wait THREE times longer for server responce when loading locations than it actually takes to load those locations. This also causes the portals to reboot for a minute before waiting for the server and the portals are... one of the main activities, may be used  for like a 10 times per hour. This one is first. Second - QoL. The game has nearly 69 thousands of different resources and goods, a quarter of which still don\u2019t even have icons, a bunch of tiers for items, the tiers of which is also not indicated on the icon. Items are crafted in 5 stages, literally assembling the product piece by piece and with all this obscurantism in the game there is no possibility of crafting from chests. Damn IKEA warehouse simulator, 2x24  in the yard, what were they  thinking? And here, these are the main negative aspects of the game. A fix for both is already in the works. Ofx, there are others too, such as repetitive content, slightly clunky combat and a stifling barrier to entry into the mechanics, but to say that all this is much worse than in the reference Valheim? No, not much.\n\nTo sum it up, for the first days of early access, IMHO, a more than decent game with huge potential. And that's why my review is positive. The project is worth giving it a chance to develop and doesn't deserve to be drowned in dirt at the very beginning.\n\nYes, and add some more localizations for the CIS countries, pretty please.

I would recommend this game if you are into and have time to grind. The bugs are minor for an early access game so if this is your type of game you'd love it and the bugs didn't affect my gameplay to a point that it annoyed me or even frustrated me, they have done a good job. The whole lore is very well done. They put a lot of time and effort into bringing the RPG side into this but also not making it overwhelming, the maps are very well made and the atmosphere of the game is really something I like. The building is amazing. I played the game with the minimal external help. I wanted to experience and find out everything myself.\n\nMinor things that are not bugs that bothered me. \n\nRecruited NPCs \nWhen they are standing in your face when they are not in combat (but there are 5 bound running behind them attacking just you), this made me die a few times and feels overall awkward when you are crafting something and when you exit the bench they stand nose to nose with you, I built walls and stood face to face to the walls to avoid this.\n\nBenches\nDifferent tier benches look the same and it's hard to determine which is what. My problem with this is, I didn\u2019t want to dismantle lower tier benches because the resources are only easily obtainable if you grind. You have to have the resources in your inventory and you can queue your crafting. However the way everything is made (using wide range of different resources to create something specific) fits in well with the other survival games I have played,so no complaints from me on the chain of resources. \n\nBastilles - Puzzles\nI love puzzles but sometimes it was just a bit too much puzzling for my liking and no puzzle is the same and there\u2019s no clue to finding out how to solve it, at least not what I could find looking only in the game.You can spend hours trying to finish just one. Don\u2019t get me wrong this was fun the first 5 times but then it gets too much. The puzzles makes complete sense when you take the lore into account and this is something that I like but no I avoid the big puzzles\n\nGear Score\nI believe Gear Score can be explained in more detail. I only understood it close to the end nearing the Watch. I didn\u2019t exactly read every single thing Puck said. I ran around in mustard yellow clothing up until right before I could enter the watch and then discovered I didn\u2019t have too. Cosmetics for me is a big deal in games so I was sad to find out I didn\u2019t have to look weird all the time in yellow mustard clothing with a weird towel on my head.. I miss a concrete attribute and xp system. Don\u2019t get me wrong it\u2019s built in there, it\u2019s just not explained at all. It\u2019s a live and learn situation. \n\nQuesting and Building\nThe fact that you can only have your home in one of the starter realms was sad for me, it\u2019s grinding to find the materials to make a simple house in your home realm (I mean if you want to make it look like something) but then you have to waste any other precious materials on helping NPCs built theirs, this I found overwhelming. I never went past a 6 x 6 wood house. Any resources I kept for essences and helping npcs. The chests could use some work. \n\nOverall feeling.\nIt\u2019s a pretty game, I love the setting and I love the lore.\n", "timestamp_created": 1709925818, "timestamp_updated": 1710311378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718893468379974365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159015020": {"recommendationid": "159015020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014007576", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 656, "last_played": 1709781827}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.

Like post-traumatic therapy level of help. At first, it needs to reduce the scope of what it wants to be. Its MMO mechanics are from another decade and already feel antiquated. Its survival aspect is fraught with a bloated and disconnected crafting system, large biomes that primarily act as resource node containers with a bare-bones exploration aspect. Combat, UI, and responsiveness feel janky. \n\nEvery system in this game needs to be marie-kondo'd, if it doesn't spark joy, then get rid of it or rework it until it does, and if the whole game is at stake then so be it. Otherwise, I don't see a clear vision of what the developers want the game to be. If procedurally generated mystic Fae realms are supposed to be the focus point, then work on it. The whole idea of having Fae realms that can be tuned and tweaked with cards sounds interesting, but the current implementation absolutely isn't. Put the idea of multiplayer at rest for now and work on the systems that revolve around the single-player aspect for now, and make them work. Begin with the crafting, work your way up to the discovery and exploration aspect, then combat and boss battles. Right now, it's sad to see promising ideas handled so badly, and if nothing changes, this will be at best a single-play through experience.\n\nEDIT: Yes, I am still playing it.

Cyberpunk released and was dang near unplayable this game at least has an active dev and player community geared to helping others worst case you dont like it refund it but id give it a 7.3/10 and would recommend this to anyone who likes crafting/survival games that are alittle more complex.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1708964408, "timestamp_updated": 1708964408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709823846817016602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159547346": {"recommendationid": "159547346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198806338072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 253, "last_played": 1709837763}, "language": "english", "review": "As it is right now, 2024-02-29, there is no way to play the game in a offline SP mode, neither there is the possibility of installing your own dedicated private server, [i]or renting a hosted one,[/i] put it simply: [b]If there are issue with your Internet Connection or any issue with this game official servers (e.g. full, offline, maintenance...) or any issues with the Internet routes between your PC and this game official servers, you aren't able to play the game for which you have bought the right to play.[/b]\nWhat happens if Inflexion Games fails or closes or Tencent sell it to another entity?\nWhat happens if Inflexion Games decide that Nightingale doesn't give enough revenue and closes this game official servers?\nWhat happens if Inflexion Games, [i]or Tencent for them,[/i] decides in its rightful right, to change its revenue model/strategy toward a subscription model?\n\nIMHO today in 2024 a SP/Co-op game should have official servers, on top of offline, client side hosting and player (rented) hosted dedicated private servers.", "timestamp_created": 1709223070, "timestamp_updated": 1709223380, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706743359565734863", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158852257": {"recommendationid": "158852257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166035886", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1708663132}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fun and VERY VERY early access. \nI am running at Quality graphics across the board.\n\nMy \"survival\" game background:\n50+ hours(completed) Enshrouded - I played archer and farmed sticks, I know the grind, trust.\n50+ hours(completed) Valheim\n50+ hours The Forest\n50+ hours Green Hell\n50+ hours Sons of the Forest\n100+ hours Stardew Valley\n50+ hours Moonstone Island\n\nI have completed the first 'dungeon/boss' at the starter realm after tutorial - fight was fun.\n\n****First and foremost RUSH the lvl 20 armor - increases your carry limit to about 90. HELPS SO MUCH.****\n\nPros:\n1) It is new, it is exciting, the combat doesn't really feel THAT bad, but it doesn't feel amazing. Mediocre.\n2) First/Third person: Having the option is a pro, first person feels immersive - skyrim-esque.\n3) The character creation is FREAKING AMAZING - just have faith and progress through it, yes it is scary to see 20+ fetal alcohol syndrome faces looking back at you at first, but it does get better as you customize more, I promise.\n4) Dash on dagger is best movement(in my opinion), 15 stamina for a far leap, backstab(knife) and headshot damage with ALL weapons is a nice touch.\n5) Building is fine. lay down all pieces and then gather all required materials - The Forest and Sons of the Forest - esque.\n6) Storage is easy with plant fibers gathered en-masse.\n7) Turn rocks into stone marbles(ammunition for 'Slingbow') and convert to Essence = easy essence farm.\n\nCons:\n1) No split stacking of items(that I've discovered) makes moving materials or using fires quite irksome. I would recommend using plant fibers as fuel for all fires to save wood and prevent encumbered moving wood around.\n2) Items are dependent on what drops them. Example: prey animals drop Prey Meat and predators drop Predator meat. Barely any difference in the stats of cooked food BUT forces another inventory/storage slot to be used for EVERY SINGLE variation of each item. Frankly, this f***ing sucks and forces your abode to become a storage shed.\n3) Third person run animation is Hunchback of Notre Dame - esque and it is ROUGH to look at - would recommend first person.\n4) Gliding is trash. Having to equip the umbrella AND initiate gliding with spacebar again is awful. In my opinion the Umbrella should auto equip like the glider in Enshrouded.\n5) UI is convoluted BUT you will get used to it - frankly you have to if you want to play.\n6) Slingbow and most likely firearm firing animation causes a GIANT puff of dust/smoke when fired that blocks your screen and hides projectiles unless you shoot them way over the range and therefore most likely missing every shot. Reloading is NOT automatic and requires ANOTHER input - rough.\n\nConclusion: it is day FREAKING ONE PEOPLE. Relax. Yes, this game is lacking in some CRITICAL departments. Yes, it is not as PERFECT as you expected. That being said, the game is fun, worthwhile, and will certainly get my 50+ hours.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1708478488, "timestamp_updated": 1708478488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 140, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700689852237701416", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160250553": {"recommendationid": "160250553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065538649", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5048, "last_played": 1710172638}, "language": "english", "review": "The game came out as an early acces, but very good, very little bugs.\r\n\r\nbut then the developers patched some things:\r\n\r\n\u2022they took away instant home teleport...why?\r\n\u2022they fixed the free repair bug... allright i enjoyed the game until this point, now i have to farm grey essence just to keep playing... not nice. \r\n\u2022also lumber is worth the same as wood, so no increase in value, why should i bother it anymore\r\n\u2022they turned off the description panel. now i have to click for every single item just to know what doing what.\r\n\r\ni lived this fixing as a negative quality of life. still recommend but its less enjoyable now", "timestamp_created": 1710065627, "timestamp_updated": 1710065627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699341714382171631", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158858937": {"recommendationid": "158858937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041715478", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1710604270}, "language": "english", "review": "After an initial 5 hours, I figured I would leave my thoughts somewhere of what I thought of the game.\n\nVisuals: They look great. The environments that you go through look fantastic. In terms of survival games, this is one of the better looking ones out there. I don't really have much to say, just watch the trailers and judge for yourself.\n\nPerformance: Runs better than I thought it would, however there are still hitches and (infrequent) FPS drops. They don't happen often enough to be a big deal, but it is still noticeable. After playing 5 hours straight, I didn't experience a single crash, however your mileage may vary.\n\nNetwork: It's always online, despite whether you play by yourself or not. No idea why this is, maybe there is a mechanic that they need it online at all times, but I have no idea what it is. No disconnects after a straight 5 hours, but again, mileage may vary.\n\nCharacter Creation: Some options, not alot. I don't really care about this portion tbh but was plenty enough for me.\n\nGameplay: So I will break this into chunks.\n1. Combat - This feels weird, no lie. It legitimately feels like there is lag when hitting or shooting anything. A delay that just throws you off. Its not that big of deal when engaging in melee but it feels SUPER weird when doing anything with range. The pebble shooter legit feels terrible to use, and it isn't worth using anything ranged until you get a gun or just sticking with melee.\n\n2. Exploration - The environments look fantastic, and there are alot of landmarks that you can see from any point in the map. The downside is that there isn't a quick way back home. In games like Enshrouded and Palworld, you can quicktravel to waypoints, and in games like 7daysdodie, you have vehicles to get to where you want to go quickly. This game (as far as I can see) has neither of those. Its possible there is a card that does it for you, but I haven't found a way to do this yet. So traveling far feels discouraged, however it feels like there is more to find than the other games.\n\n3. Building - The building in the game feels pretty good, and with the bonuses you earn makes you feel like placement somewhat matter more than other games. Its not THAT big of deal, but it gives it a tiny bit of depth missing from other games. It also has a QOL feature that lets you place the blueprints down, and you can build it all in 1 go rather than having to go to each piece. This means you don't have to walk around encumbered building piece by piece.\n\n4. Crafting - The UI makes this so clunky to do. Its the same for building but its worse when crafting. The menu's don't show enough, the sub menus are confusing to navigate, and some of the benches have to be aimed at weirdly for the prompt to pull up. There is so much wasted screen space that could be used to show more to make it a bit easier, and the benches need bigger hit boxes so you don't have to aim right on the legs to craft. Lastly, and this goes for ALL survival games, I'm sick of my storage not counting towards my inventory when I'm at base. Its such a huge QOL and its so stupid that not every builder/survival game does this automatically at this point.\n\n5. Quests/content - Again, only 5 hours in so far, but it looks like there is plenty to do. Along with the plenty of POIs in the environment, there are quests that can be earned. They are simplistic, but give the game more than just mining for materials and crafting to go do more mining.\n\nSo far, the issues with this game are mostly fixable, but it really does need the QOL updates, a UI revamp, and a fix for that \"lag\" so combat doesn't feel weird to do. However the fantastic visuals, the card system, and interesting lore and world, make this my go-to over enshrouded and palworld.", "timestamp_created": 1708484867, "timestamp_updated": 1708484867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697730183601379395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158826888": {"recommendationid": "158826888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052105418", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1708456352}, "language": "english", "review": "Must connect to a sever to play , enjoy your nice 170ms if your not in NA", "timestamp_created": 1708456442, "timestamp_updated": 1708456442, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1065, "votes_funny": 45, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697287261486053467", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159495831": {"recommendationid": "159495831", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992008859", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "playtime_at_review": 306, "last_played": 1713258440}, "language": "english", "review": "Waiting for server.\r\nBro, i got no friends, let me play single player offline.

I saw someone say the opening bit was a bit boring. I don't think so honestly, its a tutorial, but you can explore each map you're brought into. Once I was done, I literally had to drop stuff because I had too much to carry!

You can find new modifiers on existing enemies, and some unique versions of existing enemies depending on biome. \n\nOptimization is lacking. Enemy packs spawning in makes the game drop to 20fps. Certain enemy groups, like groups of deer fleeing when they notice you, will tank FPS briefly. Lots of little ways for the game to chug.\n\nBuilding is great for a OWSC, but there are limitations. Connected structures have an object limit, but you can bypass this by dividing structures up, if you're making a larger building. 300 structure objects per building, 350 functional items per realm (portals, workstations, lights, etc)\n\nThe game holds a lot of promise, but maybe wait a few months.

This is the best advice I can give new players. Explore the realms, take in the absolutely stunning landscapes, expirement with minor realm cards. Build a magnificent mansion. Nightingale is very much a stop-and-smell-the-roses, enjoy-the-ride type of game. \n\nAs far as the early access reviews.... 7days to die was shit in the beginning. Ark was shit in the beginning,  and is arguably still a waste of money in its \"completed\" state, and I'm pretty sure Baldurs Gate had some unkind early access reviews \n\nIn its current state, Nightingale is 30 to 50 hours of enjoyable gameplay for $30. That's half price compared to modern games, and Inflex is gonna spend the next year adding to it. I personally played for 140 hours before reaching the endgame loop, and I'm probably gonna get over 1000 more hours before the end of early access. \n\nAs for gameplay, Nightingale is a crafting/exploration game with soft survival mechanics similar to valheim. Food and armor determine your health, stamina and \"level\".\n Go collect better materials to craft better gear, find traders to collect recipes and schematics. As far as actual crafting, you place additional structures to add your known schematics and various crafting buffs to a workstation, like valheim. But there's a slot cap, meaning you can't have everything on a single crafting bench without moving these augmentation structures. That said, I love this crafting system more than anything else I've encountered. \n\nThe building system is similar to Grounded and The Forest, you place pieces and have a preview of the entire structure before you add the materials to actually construct it. Final structures are clean and beautiful with several different \"flavors\" of architectural themes. Overall I find it very satisfying.\n\nWorld lore is presented in ARK-inspired explorer notes, you either love it or hate it. For the storyline, there's currently the bare minimum required to even qualify as a \"story.\" I hope Inflexion are doing the Larian thing and are holding back 99% of the story in early access, because this setting and premise are a HUGE opportunity do make something awesome.\n\nOverall, I would give EA Nightingale a solid \"This Is Promising\" out of 10, with high hopes for full release.

There is a lot to dig into, between finding advanced recipes, using better mats, and different augmentation combos to help with crafting.\n-Survival wise it's pretty similar to others, and in a decent spot in my opinion. Not too harsh where you have to spend too much time micro-managing it, but does need to be kept up with or you'll have to deal with some annoying debuffs. \n-Weapons/tools feel good so far, and there's plenty of grind for those who enjoy that. \n-Graphics are absolutely gorgeous, especially the coastal areas. Game runs pretty smooth on my 3080 with everything maxed (1440p).\n-The lore is interesting, and the realm concept is pretty novel (and well done imo.)\n\nNeutral:\n-Building isn't terrible by any means, but missing some QoL stuff. \n\nCons:\n-Networking errors when changing realms sometimes.\n-Combat can be a little simplistic at times (AI needs work.)\n-NPC hirelings are useful as meat shields and pack mules, but really need their AI fleshed out as well.\n-Scattered bugs (nothing game breaking so far, though.)\n-Storage/UI needs some work, and the ability to use mats directly from storage for crafting (in the works already per the devs.)\n\nOverall this is a definite buy in my book as I feel I've already gotten my money's worth, and yet I've only scratched the surface. There are great bones here, and with some polish/QoL stuff this is set up to be an absolute gem. Launch has had some hiccups, but has gone *much* smoother than many AAA games of late.

Unfortunately, my experience, shared with my significant other, was marred by a glitch in the escape portal occurring twice and a myriad of other issues.\n\nIn the initial 2-5 hours, navigating the game proved to be perplexing, lacking the desired level of intuitiveness. The abundance of \"quest dialogs\" further contributed to a somewhat overwhelming experience, though I acknowledge that personal preferences may vary, and some players might appreciate the narrative depth.\n\nWhile the game boasts a variety of materials and storage options, there is a notable need for improved sorting or easier splitting of materials. Additionally, a finder feature for materials without icons would enhance the overall user experience. The repetitive nature of towers/events and the somewhat clunky AI further diminished the enjoyment, often leading to a monotonous cycle of opening portals, completing towers, and engaging with traders.\n\nA specific issue arose when attempting to locate coal for ammo, as the color representation in the game differed from the expected \"dark gray\" to an unconventional white. This inconsistency, compounded by the challenge of distinguishing between different veins, proved to be a source of frustration.\n\nFurthermore, the interaction between upgrades and crafted items was problematic. Upgrading a station resulted in the disappearance of crafted items, a situation exacerbated when upgrading the crafting table led to the disappearance of all items. Seeking resolution, I resorted to the Discord community for guidance.\n\nDespite these challenges, I remain intrigued by the game's concept. However, for a more immersive and enjoyable experience, attention should be directed toward refining the AI, addressing material management, streamlining quests, and mitigating the monotony associated with repetitive content.\n\nAdditionally, the follower AI leaves much to be desired. They are occasionally AFK while you are mining or cutting trees, or they run away to mine while you are in the midst of a fight. Another noteworthy point is that when your follower cuts a small tree near your stone house, the house and everything inside get destroyed, which makes no sense (Because it was a small tree).

TL;DR - the great potential fun of the game is obscured by 1) an unfun grind the further you progress, 2) weak and convoluted systems/mechanics, and 3) a bland endgame with yet more repetition, and bad design for multiplayer PUGs and loot.]\n\nIn its current state, I'd entirely skip Nightingale. It's not a buggy mess, it's not wildly devoid of any content, it doesn't have a bad premise or a terrible dynamic or is otherwise a trash heap. So what's the issue?\n\nLemme start with the good. It's a BEAUTIFUL game. The novel mechanic this game brings is RAD; procedural worlds (via cards) can be customized in terms of biome, intensity (gear score), difficulty (easy - extreme), public/private, and even further with minor cards (less damage but more resources, better crafting, harder enemies but more treasure, etc.). The combination of ranged, melee, and magic is good. Finally, the intense customization of all craftables (depending on the stats of the resources you're investing) gives great control over everything from gear to food to buildings.\n\nAll of that should really make for a good game, which is exactly why I'm so disappointed. Those good qualities of Nightingale, and all the fun they should bring, are buried beneath a pile of sometimes innumerable rough edges or, in many cases, outright terrible design. As one of MANY examples, y'know that interesting gear customization I mentioned? Completely dulled by hours of resource grinding to craft one or two items, clunky and disjointed crafting sequences, and a bizarrely convoluted 'crafting bench buffing' system that can end up requiring you to make multiples of each crafting bench or literally rearranging your workshop just so a recipe will show up on a crafting bench. And, after all that, your gear might only be marginally better than the Twitch drops (some of which I'm still using). With an absence of any kind of meaningful 'builds,' the stats don't even seem to really matter much more than just making you generically more powerful than before.\n\nThe endgame and multiplayer feels weak at best or bad at worst. Vaults (endgame dungeons) are essentially tougher repeats of all the encounters you've had a hundred times leading up to endgame, followed by a boss (which you probably already fought). In these vaults, you're likely to get paired up with other random players, which is out of your hands. And then, there's no in-game communication (that I've found) other than emoting; good luck coordinating anything. Resources in vaults are free-for-all, so if you happen to be playing with a loot-goblin rando, you're coming out of it with very few resources for so much time investment. Aside from vaults, you'll get the ability to craft higher tier cards to go back through the same three biomes you've been playing all along and repeat the same gameplay loop laboriously with the same enemies until, once again, you get enough essence to get the blueprints you need to craft better gear to hopefully run vaults faster for more essence.\n\nAnd still, the single biggest flaw of the game is, in my opinion, it's overwhelming lack of information. A game needs one of two things - intuitive design or detailed info. If you've got intuitive design, great joy can be found through the act of discovery and learning the game simply by playing and figuring it out. But that ain't Nightingale. Chances are great that you'll struggle AGAINST the game to try and make it fun, to try and learn how some basic feature works, ultimately wasting hours thinking a mechanic functions one way only to learn agonizingly that it's nothing like how you thought, doesn't work how it should, or actually doesn't even work at all. My biggest pro-tip for this is to google everything you're wondering, or watch some guide videos, or pop into a Twitch chat to ask all your questions. Personally, I think games that require that kind of out-of-game searching so constantly are just poorly designed and need to do much better.\n\nI gave 70 hours in the hopes that, if I could just get to that next tier or understand those couple of mechanics or make a better set of gear or tough it out to endgame, I'd finally find the fun that all the mess was leading up to. I'm finally concluding that the fun just isn't there right now. All in all, I ABSOLUTELY think Nightingale has some great potential and will probably be exceptional in a year or two after some serious refinement.", "timestamp_created": 1708491553, "timestamp_updated": 1708994622, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668111562728881836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158832637": {"recommendationid": "158832637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045498523", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1708460557}, "language": "english", "review": "Forcing solo players to connect to a server is just bad practice, if you wanted to play this as a fun solo survival get ready to suffer through bad servers and high ping even if in a single player world.", "timestamp_created": 1708460784, "timestamp_updated": 1708460784, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667993724346160889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160071596": {"recommendationid": "160071596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198443704013", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4394, "last_played": 1709858665}, "language": "english", "review": "It's meh.

My initial obsession began to dwindle around hour 30. \n\nThe environments go from breathtaking to meh. The first time you visit each of the 3 basic realm types, your mesmerized, and seeing how these are Fae realms, excited and nervous of what creatures, aggressive and passive, lurk just beyond the view on the portal. \n\nCreature designs are fantastic, no pun intended, and each new species is unique. We go from boars, wolves and deer, just normal animals, to Desert Elephants like something out of Lord of the Rings, terrifying Harpies, and what resemble Falmor, if they were armed by Mordor, The Bound. \n\nCombat isn't bad, but it's not very complex either. It reminds me very much of Oblivion or Fallout 3, for better or worse. Actions depend on weapon type: large weapons like picks and axes are slow and wide sweeping, with blocking as alt-fire. Knives and climbing picks much faster, offering a dash I used in traversal more than in combat. Firearms are clunky, with long reloads, which is accurate to the time in which this game takes place. Hits on weak points are where firearms gain their utility, with much larger critical bonus damage. \n\nThe crafting system is intense if you're not used to material systems like Nightingales. The shear number of material types and tiers, each offering different bonuses to the gear they are used to craft, is daunting, but exciting if you're into that sort of thing, allowing you to really take your time and pick the specific material bonuses you want for your play style, or go hunt for new and rare materials. Collectors will have tons to do.\n\nThe equipment system needs work, as does the system for crafting equipment and improving gear score. While it can be fun to try lots of different material combinations to find just the axe or firearm you want, the results are lackluster. I noticed very little difference in the materials used on the same tool type. An axe of tin or copper feels identical to an axe of iron or even something as rare (and cool sounding) as Pursuit metal. Some material usage will effect how parts of your gear might look, which is a great touch, but ended with most of my character the first 40 hours just covered in leopard print and looking rediculous.\n\nThe \"leveling\" system is not great. Gear score doesn't slowly ciimb, allowing you to survive stronger realms and dungeons, as much as it jumps every 10-15 hours. The idea is trying new materials you find as you explore to make your equipment, but score is effected so little, you just use what you first craft upon obtaining the next tier of crafting benches. From 20s, to 70s, then upgrading rarity of your equipment jumps to 120ish and 200s. The different in material types for equipment needs to have more and less effect on gear score. Easier prey and ores with less addition to gear score, and new/rarer materials and tougher mods giving mats with more effect. The difference currently has very little effect.\n\nAs crafting is what you'll be spending a lot of time doing, the system needs a lot of work and balancing/buffing.\n\nI have a lot of criticism for this game, but I actually really enjoyed the first 30 hours, maybe even loved them. It's early access so it has a lot of work to do, but the foundation here is phenomenal, and the potential to be up with the greats.\n\nI recommend this game to those who love survival crafting games, and understand it isn't a finished product.

However, after sinking (only) over 30 hours into the game, I find myself deeply disappointed and frustrated by the experience.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues plaguing Nightingale is its abysmal server stability. It's utterly disheartening to invest time and effort into a game only to be constantly met with server crashes, disconnects, and lag spikes. This instability not only disrupts gameplay but also undermines any sense of immersion or enjoyment.\n\nFurthermore, despite being in early access, Nightingale feels alarmingly incomplete and lacking in direction. Progression is sluggish, with essential mechanics such as magic locked behind tedious grinds and unclear objectives. Crafting, touted as a core feature, proves to be a mind-numbingly dull chore rather than an engaging gameplay element.\n\nThe narrative of Nightingale is another sore point. Promised a rich and immersive story, I instead found myself struggling to connect with the world and its characters. The supposed fae, a central aspect of the game's lore, are disappointingly underutilized, with only one notable presence in the form of Puck. This lack of depth and diversity robs the game of its potential for the intrigue and wonder I was hoping for.\n\nTo add insult to injury, recent attempts by the developers to patch the game have only exacerbated the problems. Entire player bases being reset due to egregious errors is simply unacceptable, showcasing a worrying lack of quality control and foresight on the part of the development team.\n\nConcluding... Nightingale falls far short of its promises and potential. With its unfortunate server stability, lackluster gameplay mechanics, and underwhelming storytelling, it comes across as a product rushed to market before it was ready. As it stands, I cannot in good conscience recommend Nightingale, as it offers little more than frustration and disappointment.

I am playing for the sake of completing it. At least wait for them to make a proper solo play option. Network disconnects happen often enough, especially if you are outside the USA. Besides that, there are a number of features that need to be fleshed out and made better. Bugs are not uncommon.\n\nEDIT4: So, I reached end-game. I still say, wait a number of months before playing.

Its aesthetics, which was a big selling point and a focus of the trailers is all but gone. i could show you how characters and structures look 30 hours into the game and you couldnt tell the difference between nightingale, conan exiles or rust.\n\nonly 2 things made nightingale different and interesting. aesthetics and the card system, and the aesthetics are gone. somewhere between the whiteboard and the dev cycle it evaporated; fizzled out in codex entries and a terrible onboarding. They were going for an alt victorian look and all you build after dozens of hours is a square of twigs and hide armor with no flair, even the most basic structures, crafting tables and armor SHOULD look like they crafted by someone who thinks in victorian aesthetics mind, as that is the main character, that is us making those things, instead of an ugly chestpiece that looks from a ps2 game the characters should 'try' to make it into a lappeled jacket, our first head piece is a head wrap, a head wrap?! do you have any idea how important the entire hat making industry was in the victorian era? we would be failing at it since the materials are trash but they would try some couture because that's what the character knows. \n\nSame with architecture, even the most basic twigs building piece should have some flair to it, bent wood to form the classical gingerbread decor is a must (gingerbread is what the victorian architectural detailing is called, in case the devs failed to do even the most cursory of homework, which seems to be the case).\n\nBut the worst aesthetic sin Nightingale has plagued us with, is the writing. Watered down contemporary English like the NPCs were part of a netflix series. We meet gods damned Victor Frankestein and he talks like generic NPC n42. we can even break 4th wall and ask if he's *the* dr frankenstein and the answer isnt some overly verbose and nervous stream of consciousness, no, it's just boring. we get to his abode and we cant even find letters to read, no letters, in frankestein's home, am i the only one who sees the fault here? the entire genre of romantic victorian literature was written as letters of different kinds, missives sent between characters. this isnt just a missed opportunity this is wrong. The only reason i can think of why this would be a conscious design choice is the devs thinking we players are too dumb and ignorant to read, they want to avoid an \"i skip Urianger's dialogue\" situation.

For me there are way too many tables going on for my taste and you cannot que up items.  So if i want to extract leather from the numerous sources i got hides from, i can only do my wolf pelts, then my pig pelts, then my little critter pelts one at a time leaving me babysitting a crafting table when i'd much rather be out exploring.    Also not all leathers are created equal, even though the end result description is leather.   so if i have 3 different hides that all make leather, but because the leather is extracted from different animal types, even though once processed it says leather, it slots them all in different spaces.   so if I have a recipe that requires 2 leather and I have 3 different leathers in my inventory and they are in 3 separate slots because they are not all from the same original source, it won't let me craft that item because it is saying I don't have enough quantity, even though I actually do. this ultimately is taking up wayyy too much space in my inventory.  the weight restriction is also a PTA.    so only 7 hours of game play and I'm disappointed.

Steam says I have 70 hours in this game but that time was honestly mostly spent sitting in my base waiting for shit to craft and organizing boxes. I would recommend buying any other game but this one.\n\nI want to give this a positive review but I just cant in it's current state. The game is fairly grindy the npc's are very boring and the game is ok but not great. The devs learned very little from other survival games or they knew they just chose to ignore the quality of life features other games in the genre have. They launched without crafting from storage and an auto sort(palworld has both of these and their dev team is like 7 people) I never realized  how spoiled I was in palworld by these basic features but they save you literal hours of organization and slow walks with an overloaded inventory to the area up to your roof where you want to dump them. The progression is also gated by item level so you need to craft things at the highest item level not just at the highest material level to progress. It's like destiny but you carry rocks to box instead of shoot aliens. The combat is bare bones but it does have blocking and shoving so it's about one step below conan and one above ARK:SE. \n\nThe Art of the world is nice and the animals is great and the environments are kinda fun to explore but Item level kinda kills it and the A.I are kinda dumb and have obvious animation gaps for free damage. NPC's are meh and when you can recruit them they're almost totally useless other then to take a hit or two and they sometimes don't even do that. When you move around a dungeon your companion will teleport to your location in the most jarring way imaginable(Think creepy watson from that sherlock holms game) The best use case of npcs is just use them as human pack mules and they don't even do that right. You cant assign them to do anything at base and you can't customize their looks or name. Then on top of all that  they are all ugly as sin. The game has an arachnophobia mode but I wish it had Anthropophobia mode because everyone in nightingale looks like they are product of a cruel joke at best or incest at work. If these faces are because they wanted certain people to \"Feel seen\" lets hope they meant through a rifle scope. These faces are also used for character creation which has a bunch of useless features like choosing your ancestors but that only serves to make you have to undo a bunch of things in the later menus. It's like oblivion but every button is the ugly button and not just the randomize one. ESG score +100\n\nThe game can be fun but I don't feel the pull to comeback and keep playing like I did for V rising and palworld. If anything this game exists to remind you how damn good those other games are.  This shit needs some time to cook and un fuck itself before it's ready for prime time\n\nOther annoying shit includes but not limited to\n-no locks for your boxes for multiplayer(how do you launch without pin codes??)\n-npc's if given access to a box will try to load expensive mats like shaped wood into a campfire to burn it because thats fun\n-Npc's won't do anything useful\n-Game has a Vram leak that gets really bad after about 3 hours or so\n-Crafting stations take ages for simple items\n-No private server to up rates for materials or the crafting speed\n-Game feels like a stealth live service\n-I don't see myself having access to a firearm for another 10ish hours or more.\n-Tools are more effective weapons then actual weapons are(I can sprint up and kill wolves with the skinning knife faster then anything I currently have access to)\n-Realm gimmick gets annoying when you need like 4 of something and have to run to the portal then play the cards then teleport for like 4 of a single item to Finnish a craft. (You can plan around this but it's still a pain in the ass)\n-You can fast travel to your base but not to the portal so it's best to build near the portal which limits base location unless you want to walk 5 min to the portal\n-The menus are awful console ones with a lot of wasted space and they don't always save your filters which makes building a pain to navigate It feels like they hired one of those \"I'm a professional UX/UI designer\" guys to do the G.U.I since it reeks of modern design U.I stink and that's after they fixed the beta U.I.  You cant even tell what most of the blueprint cards are supposed to be because they have no color and all look the same. They need to color those in or just use text.\n\nThings that are actually good\n-Essence system\n-The art for all of the building types is great\n-Finding minor cards and using them to speed things like gathering up or do crazy stuff to your home realm and they kinda work like halo skulls but with more positive effects then negative ones\n-Ranged weapons work well and it's easy enough to make rocks for the sling bow\n-The card art is very very good\n-The world looks and feels great to just exist in and the sound design is pretty good\n-The fishing is fun and not an invasive mini game\n-You can blueprint your entire base layout design to get a feel for what you want then actually fill it in to finalize it.\n\n\nI'm going to keep playing and will update this if I can but this review is for day 1 early access.\nUPDATE: The game is just kind really really boring. Every realm is just the same 3 areas with different colored trees and plants for higher tier materials and maybe 1 more enemy type. The A.I is awful and I lost my npc companion and all of the loot on her because of a bug where it deletes them if you remove a map marker which is insane that is even a thing and it took ages to make that gear. The quests are more shallow then mmo's from the early 2000's and every major card boss is just the same Wish dot comie version of the skyrim dwemer teapots and ridiculously easy to cheese if they even fight back in the first place. DO NOT buy this game and do not trust anyone who puts a train wreck like this out as a first pass early access.

There are more tools required than fit on your tool belt which is a pet peeve of mine. The crafting is clunky and requires like 7-8 crafting benches that do not allow you to queue up crafts. Like I have to refine each material individually 15 wolf pelts>wait 5 minutes > manually collect > 15 rabit pelts > 15 more minutes >manually collect > run back and forth to your storage since you cannot hold everything.

Ignore the negative reviews, People are upset about online only which I understand, but the developers have already said they are working to make it offline after the backlash. Hint signs of a good developer. Now to my review.\n\nFirst off this game deserves way more than the lousy 58% you guys have given it at the time of this review. Wait to review a game after the first few patches if your are going to dis the whole game on one stupid feature you do not like. This game looks great, plays great, and the developers defiantly put the work in and you can tell. A lot of reviews try to say this is just another \"Survival Game\" you are right, but what do you mean exactly cause this is a pretty good damn survival game. If you don't want to play another survival game then go buy something else. I have played almost every survival game that managed to even be in probably the top 50. This game has a lot of elements most survival games never think of. I almost did not even buy it because of the negative reviews but I figured I would give it a shot anyways seeming most of them were \"Online Only\" or \"Just another survival game\". I thoroughly enjoyed the first 1.5 hours I have played. If I had more time I would still be playing.\n\nIf you like survival games this is a good game with different elements from any other survival game. The only thing I could have to say is it could use some optimization but that is probably my fault with having a AMD graphics card and a 4K monitor, but nothing lowering my settings a little cant fix. I just prefer the highest settings. Seems most indie games do not work well on AMD cards like the RTX cards.

Playing it now though, I realize I had rose-tinted glasses on. Much of the footage and gameplay you see is of the \"fun stuff\", but very little is shown of the mediocre, draggy gameplay sections.\n\n[h1]Good:[/h1]\n+ The game environment looks good, even on low settings\n+ It's decently well optimized, so for someone with mid-specs like myself, it runs at about 80-100 FPS\n+ Sound effects are crunchy and crisp, and balancing is good\n+ So far the voice acting is good. Only interacted with Puck so far though\n+ You can use two items at once, right hand and left hand equipment\n+ Repairing items in this game is simple, just use essences that you get from salvaging materials/equipment\n+ Resource nodes tell you how much tool strength you need to harvest them\n\n[h1]Bad:[/h1]\nOh boy. Here we go:\n\n- Always online. Man this one was disappointing. I hate when games offer no offline mode\n\n- Character creation is insanely deep but oh my god the models are so terrible looking. These are genuinely some of the ugliest models I've laid eyes on, in any game, even including 7 Days to Die. 95% of the hairstyles look kinda uncanny, like the hair has no volume to it and is just a sheet of paper covering your head.\n\n- UI is needlessly complex. I've never struggled this much with a campfire in any survival game ever. Cooking a Healing Salve requires me to ignite the campfire in a separate UI, then go into the crafting UI, then click on the recipe, then click on the bone component, select which bone I want to use, then click on the fibre component, and select which fibre I want to use, then click on the number of crafts I want to make, then click Craft, then wait for all of it to craft. If you read through all of that, you're insane. As are the people who designed it this way.\n\n- UI is somewhat inconsistent. I can Shift+Drag to split stacks one way (into campfire), but not the other way round\n\n- This game uses Valheim's food system, but an even worse version of it. In Valheim, you need to eat to raise your core attributes, but choosing not to eat will not kill you. In this game, you need food to gain attributes, AND not eating will kill you\n\n- Carrying capacity at the start of the game is atrocious. 50kg seems like a lot, when 1 stone block is 1kg, but yeah it's nothing. You'll run out of room real quick\n\n- Building is not smooth at all. You gotta open the build menu, click the dropdown list for the building category you want, then scroll around till you find your component, then double click its icon to pull up the blueprint into the world. It's so many clicks for something that should be so simple. Furthermore, you can't just place something down. You gotta place the blueprint, then add materials to \"finish\" the construction, even if you already have the materials on you.\n\n- I have no idea how to move an incorrectly placed blueprint, and at this point I don't care to find out. I spent a solid 5 minutes figuring out how to move a campfire off the soil, since they said it would get a stability penalty. In the end I just gave up cause highlighting/clicking \"Move\" in the interaction wheel did nothing.\n\n- To be entirely honest, I don't get what the cards/realms systems are for. What it's saying to me right now, is that my builds are all temporary, and I'll have to start from 0 (building-wise) everytime I move realms. I have no idea if this is how it's supposed to work, but I guess I'm not gonna find out anytime soon, since the game has already lost my interest\n\n- I don't understand resting in this game. I put a bedroll under a shelter, and pressed 'E' to short rest, and it refilled some of the blue \"Rest\" bar. It didn't fast forward time, it didn't lock my character while I \"slept\", and since it didn't fill the bar completely I just mashed E until I was fully rested. Is this really how it's supposed to work? That's weird as hell\n\n- You can't drop stuff in this game. Again, I spent like 2 whole minutes trying to figure out how to drop things, only to realize that Extraction was the only way to remove it from my inventory. It's not intuitive at all. Also the game never showed the \"Shift to split stack\" tooltip when dragging the item to extract, so it wasn't clear to me that I could salvage part of a stack. It's another inconsistency, cause the \"Shift to split stack\" tooltip shows up in the campfire UI\n\n[h1]Overall: 4/10[/h1]\nHonestly, it's not even that the game is bad. If I'm looking at it in a vacuum, the game is actually fine. However, as someone who plays a ton of survival craft games, yeah I'm not impressed. It's one of those situations where the endgame could be amazing, but I'll never know cause the early game was so disappointing.", "timestamp_created": 1708461839, "timestamp_updated": 1708462333, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 98, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647458136081695557", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158929847": {"recommendationid": "158929847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064009552", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 134, "last_played": 1709863303}, "language": "english", "review": "in short...

It makes no sense. \n\n- The game runs pretty poorly: Whilst having great visuals the performance is really inconsistent, the shader compilation stuttering is prominent in this game which is a common issue with UE titles. Even on lowest settings on a 4090 I still had regular annoying stutters.\n\n- The UI and User Experience is a nightmare: It's so hard to navigate the inventory and crafting menus a lot of the time, and often just makes me scratch my head and wonder why the developers decided to design these menus in such an un-intuitive manner. It's like they actively tried to make it as hard as possible to use. The HUD is also very cluttered, and when I'm trying to take in the breathtaking world and art design, I am inundated with constant pop-ups of status effects and other various elements that should be moved or made smaller. \n\nDespite all of the negatives I mentioned above, the game is fun, and I am finding myself wanting to play more, I think there is a lot of promise here and with a good few updates that address the main issues, the game could potentially be a top contender in the survival-craft genre.

Suffers greatly  from performance issues and also from some archaic design decisions like overly complex crafting pathways and not being able to pull materials from storage in the vicinity on-demand. Biomes, building blocks, and progression systems are still rather limited.\n\nI'd rate it a 7/10 (I do not hand out free points just for being in early access, so I expect this score to increase over time). A lot of the negative reviews (pulling down the overall rating) seem to be only concerned with the fact that the game requires an internet connection. Make of that what you will.\n\nMore in-depth feedback:\n\nUI: God-Tier\n-> clear visual hierarchy, sparse and tasteful usage of fancy fonts, important info is never unreadable, HUD is generally not intrusive or immersion breaking\n\nCombat: S-Tier\n-> great hit feedback (hitstop, camera shake, sound effects), aim-based crit system, fast-paced fights where enemies generally die in 2-3 hits, you have to manage stamina and positioning in group fights; simple animations for repetitive actions (i.e. basic attacks)\nPS I do think the combat is objectively speaking at least \"good\", but taste differs greatly when it comes to combat. For some, it might not be flashy enough\n\nConcept: God-Tier / Implementation: A-Tier\n-> You travel through procedurally generated realms. On your adventures you collect 3 types of realm cards,: biome, major and minor. With biome + major card you create a new realm, with minor cards you can alter the rules within a realm. The results of the procedural generation are breathtaking. For now, the amount of biomes is very limited and I'd like to see more dungeons rather than just random shrines where you kill of 3-4 enemies.\n\nGathering: A-Tier\n-> When hitting a tree with your axe, it busts a wedge into the trunk. This is very satisfying. Unfortunately, once the tree starts falling, it has very wonky physics, sometimes leading to breakdance, because little branches have the same rigidity as the stem (imo the branches should just not collide with the ground to fix this). Also the tree goes \"poof\" once it's felled, turning into small bundles of wood ready to pick up. This is nice, but often the tree goes poof before even hitting the ground, which is annoying. The mining is very enjoyable. With each hit you carve out a big chunk from an ore vein.\nYou can hold down the E key to AoE collect materials.\n\nProgression: B-Tier\n-> You progress your character by visiting new islands and crafting new gear and making better foods. I would like to see a talent tree, and also \"learning-by-doing\" skills like woodcutting, mining, etc.\n\nCrafting / Building: C-Tier\n-> Building blocks are very basic, e.g. there are only 2x2m wall blocks, nothing in between. You cannot build or craft from storage, which is an outright sin in the current day and age, especially in a game with such a limited inventory. In the early progression you have to craft a lot of random stuff with multiple dependencies where it's not always clear if you are even able to make it or not.\n\nPerformance / Graphics: C-Tier\n-> For me the games becomes slower the longer I play. After an hour or so I hit <20 fps, at which point I have to restart the game. I have read that lowering \"Lumen\" in the graphics options increases performance a lot. That is true, however it does not really fix the performance issues and also, it makes the game look incredibly bad. For me, lowering Lumen beyong \"high\" makes all shadows disappear, all the colors change and it looks like a game from 2009. When Lumen is enabled the graphics and ambience look amazing, but the game becomes almost unplayable. Take Cyberpunk as a counter example: There I also get performance issues when enabling RayTracing (on my RTX 3070), but when I disable Raytracing the game doesn't suddenly look like hot garbage without any lighting/shadows at all - the reflections are just less accurate. They absolutely need to fix the lighting without Lumen", "timestamp_created": 1708875761, "timestamp_updated": 1708876694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612388134002685547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158902473": {"recommendationid": "158902473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032311137", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1708457676}, "language": "english", "review": "I knew there was going to be issues after being a part of the closed beta on this game. Conceptually, this one hit right on the mark for me. A strange, victorian-era fantasy game with unabashed gestures toward lore and wildly strange creatures. It seemed inspiring, different, and in some ways familiar by combining survival/craft mechanics with a fresh new look on Unreal's freshest engine. But it all fell short\u2014and in some ways\u2014flat on its face.\n\nThe closed beta felt stiff in ways that were hard to quantify. The world was pretty, but it wasn't alive. The building options were well-textured, but limited in architectural fluency. The enemies looked wild, fantastic, dark, but they stumbled aimlessly and their AI was poor. In the distance, I saw hulking, meandering creatures, one-of-a-kind, only to see them stumble on basic topography, and cheese out to uselessness. The menus were overly complex, the combat didn't pack a punch, none of the many complex systems, all filled with the same potential, delivered. And that's what's most frustrating: This game offered hoards of potential and it seemed to fail on account of every single opportunity to shine.\n\nI'm sure that even those rating this game positively will realize, sooner rather than later, that this game needed more play testing, a later release date (even in Early Access, which has granted it so much grace due to this), and more consideration. It needed stronger developers, people who understand these systems better, are more organized, and can implement them in ways that feel fluid. The tutorial, the first introduction to the game, is convoluted, confusing, and fails to do what tutorials should: teach players, in process, how to play and enjoy the game. Instead, it teaches them what they will actually experience: cumbersome mechanics stumbled through with uncertainty.\n\nI understand people wanting to hope for this game. I did, which is why I invested in it so early in the development process. But, as is with so many games these days, they jumped the gun, and drove a knife right into the back of all of their work, spending their hype currency way too early, and likely losing everything they worked hard to build.

Having to manually click close on every container you open is soooooooo annoying, especially in combat. No dedicated dodge, except with a crappy dagger, is horrible, and the constant server errors and inability to log in are really aggravating. The game NEEDS to change from online-only. It's a horrible and outdated idea. It needs to switch to an offline mode and give people the ability to make dedicated servers of their own.\n\nCombat and farming feel somewhat redundant, and the companion system feels very clunky and exploitative. I was able to defeat a level 70 boss with only level 20 gear by just running and resurrecting my companion constantly and letting them fight for me. Additionally, the companion AI is horrible. They will often just not attack at all, or they will start farming even though you don't want them to. You have no control over their actions and can't give commands (except for just removing their gear that allows them said actions, which is tedious at best). Companions lack any real depth in terms of realness and aren't very interesting. They are all just a cookie-cutter, copy-and-paste version of the character creation system (which is also very flawed), and unvoiced except for minor grunts and sounds. They just don't feel special.\n\nThe realm card system is very fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Cards being able to change the look of the realm you are in was very cool to see. My only problem is that there are currently only three biome cards (desert, swamp, and forest), so hopefully, this gets expanded on. I'd love to see ones for a tropical setting with beaches and islands, as well as a snow setting with mountains. I also feel the limitation of only two cards per realm could be changed, as well as only one realm adjustment could be increased. It's a very interesting system, but it feels limited.\n\nThe game also suffers from a lack of quests, the majority of which aren't very interesting. It's mostly just fetch quests or kill quests, and it doesn't feel like the NPC you are interacting with really needs your help or brings anything to the story. Many of the quests are redundant and annoying, like the gather material fetch quests to help build structures for NPCs.\n\nBuilding is interesting but lacks luster. Even in late game when you get better building theme pieces, which does help, it feels kind of empty. Build limitation of area and piece amount is annoying and doesn't allow you to create grand structures. The building system isn't diverse at all. You can't build little details, and the lack of parts and decorations is boring. You are stuck mostly with just foundation, walls, floor, stairs, and roof pieces. There is nothing special about the building system. It's better than some I've seen before, but it isn't grand or anything. It just feels... lackluster.\n\nIt's a shame this game has so many problems. I really want to like it.

Took me 20 minutes just to attempt to make someone who actually looks like a human, and it still doesn't. Features are ok, and newer survival games are better. The current state it's in makes it look like it was rushed and made within 6 months, not 3 years. This game should of went another year before being released in EA.

I've not reached endgame yet so can't review the game routine for now but so far so good.\n", "timestamp_created": 1709453397, "timestamp_updated": 1712255528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599612712860107422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158822082": {"recommendationid": "158822082", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964238519", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 3256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1709763566}, "language": "english", "review": "Nightingale is what you get if you transmute Valheim, Enshrouded, a teaspoon of gunpowder, a sprinkling of fairy dust, and a picture of Mary Poppins inside a Horadric Cube.\n\nSo if you're in the mood for a highly immersive true survival game set in a fantasy fae universe that actually has both first and third person perspective, you'd be scamming yourself by not trying out Nightingale.\n\n[spoiler]Day 1 purchase and no regrets.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]As far as always online goes, by the time servers are ready to be sunset, Nightingale 2 will be out and offline play will be an option.[/spoiler]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Initial Observations[/h2]\nMelee combat is actually quite satisfying in Nightingale because you can swing your weapon while moving to make for a much more agile experience.  Hitting enemies in melee can also knock them around a bit giving it a more impactful feeling.  In addition, if you are blocking, you can press the attack button while holding a block in order to shove an enemy.  This can sometimes knock them down making subsequent hits deal more damage.\n\nThe art of the cards is quite charming and a bit of a nice change from usual survival game UIs.\n\nThe ability to get significantly more essence from processed or crafted raw materials is a nice incentive to craft.  For example, 30 crude quality rocks can be turned into marble stones for more than 6x the essence of just extracting the crude rocks.\n\nThe fishing mini-game is probably the best I've seen in a while.  Essentially you just reel in and slowly deplete the fish's \"health bar\" and keep slack in the line by keeping the fishing rod tip pointed at the fish as it moves around.  Once caught the fish drops in range so you can just hold down the loot button to pick it up.\n\nThe ability to pretty much repair your gear at any time by using Essence Dust is a great feature.  Upgrading gear by simply applying the next tier of essence is also very nice instead of traditionally having to grind a new tier of raw materials to craft a new set of weapons/gear.\n\nPerhaps there's a tool later in the game, but it's a little odd that you can't use a sickle to get a harvesting bonus on wild flowers and other plants that provide a consumable instead of just plant fibre.\n\n[h2]Observations after 30 Hours[/h2]\nNightingale certainly has a slow burn at the start when it comes to gear and weapon progression, gated largely by the combination of a main questline and equipment rating.  On top of that, the crafting formula and the needed materials to make items has more in common with what you'd expect from a factory building game than your typical open world crafting survival game.\n\nPersonally however, I'm fine with the approach as it's a reasonable price to pay for the flexibility of having such control over the stats of the final product of crafting.  Though, as a consequence, the amount of inventory management and space real estate required to comfortably manage this approach can appear a bit more than you'd expect.  This mixed with no means if \"crafting from container\" just yet, can make for a frustrating or uncomfortably time consuming experience for some players.\n\n[h2]Observations after 40 Hours[/h2]\nEnemy variety and combat options are opening up:\n[list]\n[*]Spiders in the Gloom have ranged and melee attacks and they will engage in melee with you for only a few hits before they retreat and try and hit you with a ranged poison attack.\n[*]Other ground creatures continue with the charge behavior or up close melee.  Some having a poison component to their attacks.\n[*]The assassin and the other bound that dual wields should spawn more often at the combat POIs.  The darkweaver (or whichever one drops the Petrified Ichor) seems to be rated at a high value because whenever it spawns it drastically reduces the total number of bound that show up even though they are fairly easy to kill (not very mobile and have low HP).\n[*]Can start to make a variety of enchantments ranging from AoE melee attacks to fire enchanted attacks to healing over time.\n[*]Can make more charms and infusions as well as being able to upgrade to rare with the option of having multiple on weapons/armor.\n[/list]\n\nNow that I'm cooking with the \"refined\" crafting station it's certainly worth it to take the time to use specific ingredients.  The difference between Mixed Plants vs. Salad is very significant and worth the time to craft.  Same goes for Roasted Meat vs. Tender Steak.\n\nSame dynamic with crafting higher tier tools and then upgrading them to rare.  Starting to be worth it to make a \"refined\" tool then upgrade it to uncommon > rare rather than just taking the previous \"simple\" uncommon tool and making it rare.  Plus it gives the player a chance to use new higher grade materials.  i.e. simple tools are wood/stone/straps, refined is lumber/ingot.  What continues to be nice is how you can get lumber/ingots as loot from killing the bound and minor automaton enemies.  So you might be able to make 2-3 items without even setting up the production chain for the item(s).\n\nFae Towers are different in Gloom vs Herbarium (and the other lower level Major Cards).  Personally they are my least favorite POI so far.  Traps and mazes just aren't as engaging and satisfying as combat and jumping/memory puzzles.\n\nThe POIs in general are getting more involved.  The memory and traversal ones require additional navigation and mazing to complete (some including breaking walls).  Have had quite a few traversal POIs where I had to climb to the highest structure and then jump off it to use the climbing picks to get to the top of a narrow tower object.\n\nThe \"boss\" fights at sites of power seem to now have two automatons instead of one.  Each is a different variant.

I'll keep trying to play it sometimes just to see if things get fixed. After all, I already paid for it. I'll let you know if things change.   \n\nPacing:\nIt is hours before you get through making a character and the tutorial for all the basic old school elements of past survival games.

You never actually feel like you're playing the game, you just feel like you're desperately trying to scrounge enough component and resources to qualify to play the game except you never qualify to play the game, you just have to scrounge more. In my opinion, gear scores belong in MMOs and ARPGs, they don't belong in survival games, I don't feel like I'm doing anything of value trying to grind out the next tier of currency to have just enough to turn a piece of gear I'm using a slightly different color with a slightly different number.\nBecause of this, and extremely strict onboarding process which can take days of gameplay, you burn out very quickly. You cannot sequence break. You cannot stop the \"story\" to go to the side and find some epic recipe or item that will make you feel rewarded, hell, you can't go off to the side at all. The game starts you off and tells you to craft your first set of gear, but it doesn't matter it's your first set of gear because it is the ONLY set of gear you can get and the ONLY set of gear you will have for the next dozen hours. Then the game sends you to the next island where you're told to take one of those pieces of gear you made and make its number slightly higher. Then you're returned back to the previous map where you're told to make the other pieces of gear number slightly higher so you can go get the next card to go to the next island where you'll presumably be told to make the number slightly more higher than it was higher the last time you made it higher. It all feels so mindless and pointless. \nYou cannot stop here. They've spent all this time touting and bragging about the portal system, but the game doesn't let you open a different portal and run off to do something else to decompress at this point, 10 hours in and this is the ONLY track you have available to you. This single tiny island to farm tiny green orbs to get your white gear to be green gear to do the same on the next island. \nI'll probably try this game again in a few patches, I think the artstyle is interesting and gameplay has potential if it's ever actually presented to you as something you choose to do rather than just as a thing you're forced to do.\nBut as it stands now, the experience is so tightly controlled and so little freedom given in what you do step to step, that if there was a game category labeled 'visual novel with extra steps' this would be in it.", "timestamp_created": 1708798430, "timestamp_updated": 1708798430, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584089815616607666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162344450": {"recommendationid": "162344450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110031742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1467, "playtime_at_review": 792, "last_played": 1712798689}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun game. still a bit glitchy.

When playing one of these three biome cards you can add a modifier card that changes the difficulty of the realm you end up getting. But that's really all it does, it adds some different colors to things. but ultimately there's only three different realms you can travel to (with some minor procedural generation to it). I assumed before the game released that the amount of flavour, wonder and mysticism was going to be drastically different between a lot of the same biome realms you travel to.

(1080ti, Ryzen 1700X, 32gb ram, NVME M.2 drive) It also has graphics up-scaling that can't be turned off, which is a bit of a head scratcher, considering common opinions about up-scaling. So the graphics were fuzzy as all hell and had constant artifacts at the borders of moving objects.

Granted, most games are clones of something else on one level or another, but there's a fine line between drawing inspiration and flat out cribbing. This definitely feels more like the latter. \n\nOverall, I'm very disappointed, because I was genuinely looking forward to this game for a while, which is rather rare for me.

They do okay with mining since the ore \"spawn\" instantly when mining and they will try and pick the ore up. Trees they struggle with. Since there is a fairly long time between felling a tree and the logs \"spawn\" most of the time the follower will leave that tree to go find another and not pick up anything. In combat they do okay with a Axe as it has a wide swing. My best suggestion for dealing with follower is give them a axe and Treat them like a extra backpack, anything more is Bonus\n\nThe Quickslot bar,\nYou got your standard 1-0 quickslot bar with a Single extra slot for a potion.\nnow the 1-0 bar is split in half. 5 buttons for \"main hand\" and 5 for \"offhand\" its a interesting idea however since there is no option for more bars and no way to adjust how much is Main hand and how much is offhand it gets very frustrating. there are alot of tools/weapon types you interact with on a \"journey\" into the realms. and almost all of them are main hand. This leaves you going into inventory swaping a item on quickbar, then use it, and then swap it back again while on the offhand bar you have almost nothing. you can have your 3 foods (that you interact with like every 20 minuttes, a Torch(that gets obsolete with magic imo) and umbrella that is rather useful. Not to mention that it IMO hurts the crafting, you can try and make realy good gathering tools at the expense of damage. I would like to do this but with the limit on quickbar/inventory slots i just dont feel its worth it. \n\nWhen and I do hope it is When some of these issues gets  fixed/changed i will revisit the Thumbs down Because is realy do think there is a fantastic game idea here and want to see where the game takes us\n", "timestamp_created": 1708744723, "timestamp_updated": 1708744790, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574349701404571533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158833483": {"recommendationid": "158833483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027906973", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 75, "last_played": 1709662391}, "language": "english", "review": "Guess it would not be bad, I was really looking forward to it, but where tf is the singleplayer/offline mode?!", "timestamp_created": 1708461447, "timestamp_updated": 1708461447, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573897182941436768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158939329": {"recommendationid": "158939329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026220388", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1710304960}, "language": "english", "review": "Was extremely stoked to play even though all of my friends hated the stress test for several reasons. played the tutorial after making the best attempt at a toon that doesnt look like some hybrid fish human troglodyte.. and the final portal  quest bugged out, leaving me forever stranded in the tutorial swamp biome since you cannot drop and restart quests.

A well solid build for an early access game. For an overall game a 6/10. I say this because the foundation of the game is fantastic. This is the first survival game I actually got into and I have played all the big titles (Ark, Conan, Subnatica, enshroud, no man sky.... etc). This game actually has a story pushing you forward instead of the insensitive of surviving to survive. not saying others don't, but this one actually grabbed my attention. It is interesting to say the least. The crafting can be overwhelming sometimes but very little compared to the thought that this is the time of the industrial revolution and that building and crafting where so huge during that period of time. Building is good not great, but good. I have seen better but also seen a lot worse across the board. The game has nice mechanics (except for jumping this can be improved). Combat is enjoyable and not overly difficult, I play on easy and like it like that hitting monster is responsive and feels rewarding. Gun game play is nice and getting ammo is not super inconvenient, so I do not feel like I am scarce for bullets.  The realm system gives you a sense of a home with enough material to to create and prepare yourself for the next realm that you come across, and it all randomly generated based on cards such as biome and difficulty. You can even if you want keep the realm you made or reset it this was a nice touch for the developers to keep in mind. The tutorial in place does a good job of holding your hand, but giving you freedom to grow and develop like any good parent should do. Last the graphics, I feel like with the people at least I love. I know some people will say it looks outdated, but I \"think the developers were going for a Victorian style of art that depicts people. If that was the vision they hit the mark. Mostly everything looks good to great no complaints for this day and age of graphics. It is a well rounded game with plenty of content.\n\nThe Bad \n\nIt being in early access so I take it with a grain of salt. Though some things the developers kind of just completely missed. The biggest one for me is bricks..... You can make bricks, but not brick structures  it is the time of the industrial revolution I mean come on. There is even brick structures in the realms, but I can not craft a factory base that would look awesome. Climbing like I mentioned before could use a little TLC, but not a game deal breaker. Missing asset pictures and some realm cards are pretty useless, not a complaint, but the developers could have spent time else where.  Now this is my last complaint and a personal one. From a development team that was once on the BioWare team the game lacks RPG elements in terms of leveling up. I know you level up based on gear, but that is not really an RPG in my opinion. You don't get better at something just because you have better gear, you get better at it because you have been doing it and have learned. The better gear helps and that is what they should implement here.... \n\nIf you read my whole review please gives a thumbs up if it helpful\nand some fun facts\nI am an Elden Lord \nI love RPGs \nZelda is not an RPG", "timestamp_created": 1709229038, "timestamp_updated": 1709229038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568426609039306641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161814317": {"recommendationid": "161814317", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970505072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 771, "last_played": 1710811159}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to really like this game--my wife had been looking forward to it for some time, and I haven't had anything to play with her in several years.  So I really want it to be good.\r\n\r\nIt just isn't.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong--I don't hate the game and it's not a bad game; it just isn't very good. \r\n\r\nIt's a survival and crafting game with some combat and story.  But it doesn't do any of those 4 things well.  The survival is very light, and I appreciate that because I'm not a huge fan of the genre, just a small one; but all you do is occasionally cook a few mushrooms and eat once or twice a day, plus sit on your bed once in the middle of the day to restore the rest bar.  Truthfully, you could remove the survival mechanics altogether and no one would notice.\r\n\r\nThe harvesting portion of the crafting is terrible.  It has a floaty feel that I just can't get into.  You can hack at a tree for 5 minutes and make no progress, then change your aim point up or down by about 3 pixels and suddenly the tree falls over.  But the wood doesn't go to your inventory--you have to go pick up each separate log.  Rocks you hit once and a couple of bundles of stone pop out, but you can't see them because of the animated large chunks of rock obscuring your vision that you have to wait until they clear.  You have a hireling who can go harvest wood or stone, and they will chop at trees or rocks...but then they don't pick up any of the logs or stone, so you still have to get those yourself.  And then they weigh so much, you can barely move, so you talk to your hireling and learn they can carry so much more than you can--just give them everything that they wouldn't pick up.  Crafting on the other hand requires the use of several different stations, and several different ingredients.  But the ingredients are made from things that are made from things.  The game doesn't tell you how to get the ingredients you need, you have to look at each of the crafting stations and work out \"I make this over here, then I move the output over there, then that gets me the piece I need.\"\r\n\r\nCombat feels like someone once described combat to someone else and that someone else tried to approximate it.  Click your mouse to swing that weapon!  Don't worry, the animation will eventually start!  Your enemy has probably hit you twice by the time it does, but it'll go eventually!  Fire that sling bow!  Yep, you pissed off a wolf, now it and its 2-4 buddies will run up to you and jump on you!  Don't worry about not having a reload button--just press the fire button again and we'll start the reloading animation.  I'm sure you'll be fine while you wait!\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the story.  I love games with stories in them--my favorite studio is BioWare.  But I just couldn't make myself care enough to read all the pages and pages of lore dumping.  And what happened to NPCs with voices?  I get that games with real acting cost more to make, but I sure miss having NPCs speak to me rather than hand me a piece of paper with their dialogue written on it.  Except for your narrator, Puck.  While I do enjoy the flowery language as a piece of the setting, and while the actor does a good job with delivery, I can't help but wish you could put that on 2x speed because it takes so long.\r\n\r\nSo I really want to like this game; and maybe these systems will be improved by the time they get to full release.  But 12.9 hours in, I finally had to pull the plug and go play another survival game named for a guy who flew too close to the sun to wash out the taste of bad harvesting.", "timestamp_created": 1711815236, "timestamp_updated": 1711815236, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567456841468811035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159532408": {"recommendationid": "159532408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002298183", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 6430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3762, "last_played": 1709802304}, "language": "english", "review": "Whilst have 60 hours plus in the game and I am enjoying it. I can't recommend it, at least in its current state.\nThe game suffers with major quality of life issues;\n- There is no point to farming as you are always getting deminishing returns.\n\n- There is no clear instruction when it comes to farming or way to remove seeds from planter other then destroying them. A lot of plants don't seem to want to grow in them and there is no info if I can only plant them in a certain Biomes or they just take longer. \n\n- Its horrible trying to find plants required for cooking in the realms (I have been playing for 60 hours plus and only  have found 1 wheat)\n\n- Crafting times are horrendous\n\n- A lot of crafting recipes are locked behind Augments which are decor items but you can only apply so many to a station and its hard to keep track of which is doing what. This leads to having to make multiple of the same crafting stations and with a structure limit that is not helpful.\n\n- Realms are not very well explained\n\n- Resetting a Realm does not delete the realm which can lead to losing important structures if you forgot to build an respite point and try to fast travel.\n\n- You can only build Respite points (fast travel) in a certain realm, meaning when in the Biomes you HAVE to walk from point A to B and making setting up a base in Biomes a waste of resources. \n\n- Crafting isn't very well explained and its a lot of trail and error trying to make gear with good states\n\n- there is a structure limit and building limit, which with the building limit if you built anything in a lost realm you have wasted a building slot with no way of removing it unless you by dumb luck manage to back travel through various portals.\n\n- there is not way to show the path between realms so you can get lost easily\n\n-demolishing building or items is all manual, meaning it is very easy to accidentally destroy a wall when you are trying to remove a wall decoration\n\n-climbing thing is horrible and since there is quite a bit of vertical in the game it just makes it even more laborious \n\nSadly if a lot of this is not address I can see the game dying pretty soon.

The premise is alluring and the environment/world building is probably some of the best I've seen in recent surv/crafters. However, Nightingale does not respect your time. It, in it's current standing, demands of you constant attention and effort put forth into its crafting aspect. Everything else about it seems to take a backseat. \n\nFor example, most crafting games now a days will either pull resources from your chests when crafting, or offer ways for this mechanic to be introduced if not given to you immediately. There is no such functionality in Nightingale. Combined with the inability to rapidly move items from your chest to inventory or vice versa and having to fight with the unintuitive interface, it compounds the amount of time you already spend fishing through chests and the like. \n\nPile on the fact that there's multiple tiers to each item, each crafting station, each drop by an enemy (predator and prey hides are different here), the fact that each item requires multiple components that they themselves also require multiple components, etc. and you can see where you start to sink all of your time at.  \n\nAnother example being the basic tier 1 house building. These items such as windows and platforms require multiple resources themselves, wood, fibre and stone, but also require multiples of these individual items for each piece you set down. Building a simple house goes from a 2-5 minute affair to a 20 minute job. \n\nBecause of these issues, you tend to start noticing other problems as you try and break from the monotony of the grind, ie. the combat is lackluster. The initial impact of fighting begins to wade quickly as the game tosses swarms of low level enemies with very basic attack patterns; lunge, swipe, repeat. During my initial couple of hours with the game, this pattern repeated constantly, and from what I hear, it doesn't get any better. \n\nThis game has potential, it's just unfortunate that some design choices are severely hampering what should be an enjoyable trek through alien lands.", "timestamp_created": 1708462004, "timestamp_updated": 1708462004, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567290306091308594", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160569502": {"recommendationid": "160569502", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999546591", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 504, "last_played": 1710376273}, "language": "english", "review": "I down voted this game for 1 reason.

The only redeeming feature of the game was a Developer's mistake which got patched out. What had the potential to be an incredibly rich and in-depth crafting system is now just like all the others.

There are hundreds of different crafting materials but the vast majority of them are completely useless. You can decorate your house, but those same decorations determine which items you can craft at the various stations (which are limited in range and number of decorations they are affected by) requiring multiple copies of crafting stations and decorations and making it difficult to create an aesthetic.\n\nBuilding is similar. You can build 100 different small houses in one realm with 350 pieces of furniture or decorations each, but you can't build one larger house with more furniture.

Likely due to the fact they have their own servers and due to high amount of new players there is a bit of lag. \nHaving fun still, built a base, nothing special as I just get my baring in a game I've never played before.", "timestamp_created": 1708453778, "timestamp_updated": 1708471216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564431190490722656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158906052": {"recommendationid": "158906052", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984818087", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1708505459}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm paying money for a game, but what happens when they turn off the servers?

Some good, some bad. Some AAA games, some by 1 man in a basement. This game leaves me perplexed. On one hand I want to write a bad review. I feel like this game deserves it, on the other, its so impressive and multifaceted I want to sing its praise. In the end though, I think I'll have to obstain and just state the facts. So keep these things in mind if you're planning to buy Nightingale.\n1) The Learning Curve: It wasn't until about 35 hrs in before I realized how intricate and tricky the crafting system is. Materials have more info on them than a 4E D&D Beholders stat block. Material bonuses only apply when used in gear that has the bonus to begin with. But the gear doesn't show you which of the 15+ stat modifiers it has. Boots that give +speed+stamina gain nothing for using epic level leather for +sneak. You won't know that until after you craft it and wonder why your stats are missing. Finding these materials and understanding how to harvest them can be just as tricky. If you don't pay attention, you'll never unlock ANY new gear anyway, because its only thru specific traders in specific realms. You can check that in the \"Trader tab\" but the game never mentions this. I could write an entire novel just explaining all the ways this game hides important information integral to progression.\n2)Difficulty Curve: This one perplexes me. On one hand, normal mode feels super easy. With a little grinding you can far outpace the realms you visit. On the other, if you start in extreme difficulty like me, the game becomes impossible to progress. Gear Score is locked behind materials, locked behind realm cards, locked behind dungeons to unlock those realm cards, locked behind the very gear score you can't achieve, See the circular logic here? Extreme difficulty set my t1 realm card dungeons GS requirement to 85. Completely unachievable in the starting world. Thru some jank, I fixed this, but normal difficulty was such a breeze it made no sense. I had lv60 enemies in my T1 extreme world, and lv 60s in my t5 normal world. With no increased loot rewards, interactions, or unlocks in the extreme version, there really isn't a point or reward to do so.\n3)Building: The main feature of a survival world. Nightingale does it beautifully. Streamlining base building with an easy blueprint placing system. It also expects you to build MASSIVE bases if you want to add all the crafting stations, and all the augments. A cannon is a fun choice for unlocking military gear. Notably a rifle. It takes up more than a whole foundation of space, and needs to be close to 4 different crafting benches. Cool decoration, far to crowded. Otherwise I quite enjoy these feature.\n4)Leveling/ GearScore: I touched on this earlier, but there is no leveling in Nightingale. You are jane/john doe and not special. But your gear can be. Craft it, enchant it, augment it, put a charm on it, and upgrade it. What annoys me is the sheer lack of options. Let me list all the weapons in the first 40 hrs of gameplay: Stone cudgel, hammer, pick, wood axe, knife, pistol, rifle.... Thats it. besides the better versions of each, thats about all you get. Same with armor. I JUST unlocked my 3rd set of armor, and it doesn't come with pants. I remember when gearscore became a thing in WoW nearly 15 years ago. I hated it then, I hated it now. Especially when the gear has hidden stats, and only 5 options thru most of the game. Even worse when compounded by every single unlock having the classic tv toy set *accessories not included* meaning your unlock is not unlocked, until you unlock it, by unlocking the thing that unlocks it.\n5)Exploration POI: This game is beautiful, and terrifying. Just like the Fae. Several famous stories and myths walk around in flesh and blood, Unique takes on ancient evils like the Harpy and Grendal. Some fae want to be left alone, others may give you a gift, and yet more still may seem docile only to rip your spine out or melt your fact at earliest convenience.\n6)Bugs/Glitches/Crashes: Sadly, even a week after release there are far to many issues with the game for me to simply write it off as early access. It would be one thing if it was a simple graphical bug or a few naughty surfaces fixable with the unstick menu. But these are serious, and NEED addressing. Getting stuck zoomed into a spyglass, a DOT that never ends, NPCs that won't spawn or talk to you, dungeons that lock you out and block progression forever, Resource counts for essence not updating when you get more, but updating when you spend, UI that won't show you gear stats, unlocks, blueprints, or objectives. I encounter at least half these every day I play. They either launched to early, and some how missed every major flaw/bug/glitch or saw them and decided to launch anyway. Not sure which is worse. \n\nOverall, I'd wait another month or two while they fix the issues before buying. That being said, I'm also a bit salty at losing 40 hours of progress, my entire base, and home world, all because the game didn't update my \"Estate\" (your spawn point) and decided to portal me to the tutorial world that I had deleted and rerolled after making my base elsewhere. Ergo: Everything is back to Day one in my 2x2 wooden shack. Before this incident, I would have recommended this game in a heartbeat. But a bug that allows a player to lose all their progress is just too egregious to ignore.\n\nHope you enjoyed, and good luck", "timestamp_created": 1709074676, "timestamp_updated": 1709151636, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158839424": {"recommendationid": "158839424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029815405", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1709509918}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished the tutorial and am currently building my first base and here's my experience playing solo with an 80mbs connection , RTX 3070 and RYZEN 7.\n- No lagging or rubber banding.\n- No crashes\n- Character Creator was a lot of fun.

So a lot of the game just feels like walking simulator.

There are so many better survival games out there.\n\nIt feels like this game doesn't know what it wants to be. It combines so many elements of so many different games and genres and each one of those systems are mediocre at best. Its a mediocre survival game, mediocre building game, boring crafting game, awful action combat game, horrible rpg, terrible exploration game.\nOne of the main feature and interest in survival games is the freedom to explore and do whatever you want. But in this game you have no freedom, you are constantly gated behind arbitrary barrier like gear scores, crafting recipe unlock, cards etc. The game gives you a checklist of things to do and you have to do them in the exact order otherwise you cant progress\n\nAlso, it's less of a suvival game and more of a melee slasher/combat game. And let me tell you, for focusing SO heavily on combat and killing mobs, the combat is one of the weakest part of the game, its just so bad, janky and unsatisfying.\n\nThat said, if they can at least fix all the jank about it (mainly UI, combat, movement, crafting and inventory management) maybe it'll be \"playable\", not good, just playable. But even then, honestly, some of those systems need to be completely scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up.\n\nGood\n- Graphics look great\n- Voice acting is good\n- World is unique\n\nBad\n- Always online on a server even for single player\n- Performance is very mediocre (i played on a 4090 and got 60fps in 1440p, this is unacceptable, game looks good but not that good, cyberpunk looks better, is bigger and runs better)\n- UI (one of the worst UI in gaming)\n- Progression and pace of the game is extremely slow and tedious. Also you are constantly gated behind gear score requirements to do anything\n- Combat is atrociously bad and janky\n- Exploration is boring and meaningless, every POI (point of interest) is just placed senseless in the world, repetitive and useless, all you get is a generic chest or 2 with some generic loot inside, or some bad puzzle to solve to get a useless stat boost\n- Movement is hyper clunky, you constantly get stuck on rocks and such.\n- No QOL features for anything, inventory management is a joke and makes me want to end myself, stamina drain is insanely overtuned\n- Even though the graphics look great, immersion is basically non existent because everything else in the game is so bad. Companions / loot mules are completely dumb looking and janky, they teleport all over the place and are super annoying to deal with.\n- ...\n\nI could go on longer listing the bad but you get the idea.

Feels like the devs spent lots of time on the concept and structure and forgot about the interface.\n\n\nUpdate 2/24 - \n\nStuck with it and got to Herbarium realm.  I like the detailed build-out of the crafting, although it seems like its going towards serious micro-management.  The card unlock quests are challenging, perhaps a little buggy, but the combat is better than the faceroll Fae tower essence grinding runs.  Devs if you read this stuff I would recommend a couple things:\n\n1) For all the augmentations/upgrades make it clear in the notes about what's need to open \"X\" schematic.  The lines to the relevant crafting station are helpful but not precise.  Still not sure how to craft my rifle ammo consistently, because it seems like I can only do it when the saddle isn't next to my refined workbench.  Even when playing the Artisan card, I have recipes that I bought but cannot craft.  Consider something other than the janky spacial based thing you have going.\n2) The combat pretty bad and you guys know this, enough said and not a deal killer.\n3) Given the complexity of your crafting streams, consider some kind of streamlining via leveling - i.e. you get to the next craft bench upgrade and you no longer have to have these 8 augmentations.  Clarify which stations need to be placed in close proximity and remove some of the guesswork for the end user who has bought the schematic and is trying to craft said schematics.\n4) Like the status effect balances and ability to experiment - i.e. What food + gear buffs can I use to nullify the need to use an umbrella at all times in the desert.  Liked what the NPC fae hinted about frost.\n5) impressed with the procedural generation, although its unclear how to get to certain places at times.  The climbing picks could use some work but I think I'm doing it as intended.  \n6) If my initial load-in times out with the server and I have to try again, from then on \"esc\" no longer lets me exit chests or crafting stations and I have to use my mouse cursor to close.  Just adds clicks to an already complex game, should put that one at the top of the ticket pile.\n7) One last thing - my hired help keeps putting my new T2 wood in the fuel pile for the cooking/smelting/etc station.  Consider some controls in which you can specify the level of material that your NPC hireling can interact with instead of just having certain chests be non-accessible?\n\nWill keep playing towards endgame, its mostly enjoyable (I do hate the swamp, but know thats intended)  Look forward to the alpine biome and keep up the good work!", "timestamp_created": 1708495619, "timestamp_updated": 1708755400, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560832798480987549", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158902360": {"recommendationid": "158902360", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972800482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 417, "last_played": 1709932654}, "language": "english", "review": "Haven't gotten too far but the game play is super smooth, The graphics all on ultra look great.", "timestamp_created": 1708533568, "timestamp_updated": 1708533568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560452163219451904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159239966": {"recommendationid": "159239966", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985545445", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1727, "last_played": 1709252401}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me start off by saying I haven't completed the game yet.\nMainly because I can't progress due to a game breaking bug relating to one of the sites of power.\nNow I can preface this by saying I want to commend the game developers for what they are trying to do here, while it feels and sort of plays like an older game, what they are trying to do is still new.\n\nSo lets just get straight down to it, without any of the biased BS that other reviews on here has.\n\nGraphics:\nGraphically it's nothing to write home about, it's pretty good but not extraordinaire.\nYou won't be 'wowed' by them as there are far prettier games out there, but when you're trying with something as expansive as a survival game with a big scope, you have to cut back on some things and graphics is part of it, that way you can reach a larger audience.\n\nStory then:\nIt's there, it's not great but it isn't bad either. You can tell what they are trying to do, but because of the leaps you do between each mission, you feel a bit disconnected from it, sometimes this can be good as it's a world you want the player to explore and expand into, but if the stretch from each mission to one another is too far, you simply end up not caring much because you will have forgotten about the story once you reach the next threshold to progress.\nThis essentially just makes the story a gated way to progressing in the game, which will turn a lot of people away.\n\nCombat:\nIt's not awful and it feels good when it works, melee swings feel impactful and gunshots feel like they have power but.\nThe AI is rudimentary, unintelligent and feel like they are being controlled by a drunk puppeteer who can literally only move along the X or Y axis of an A4 piece of paper. Something charging you? Move slightly to the right or left and it will run past, slowly turn and do another direct charge. It's too easy, bland and boring for myself, but maybe some people will like it?\nThe \"bound\" is a little better to fight as they actually have a bit more nuance to them, but animals are just bad, not sure what the developers were thinking there.\n\nGathering:\nI'm sorry but you done messed up a bit here and I urge you to look into it.\nThis game is all about progression and it stands to reason that you should do what it says on the tin to progress right?\nStarting materials come from starting portals and so on and so fourth and as you \"realmwalk\" deeper, you get higher and higher tier materials, that is a given. However, I think they missed the ball completely on making the progression seamless which would make sense in a game like this where each material and tier has it's own stats and benefits.\nGoing to look for Tier 2 wood in a tier 2 Portal, which starts when you come to Herbarium is an actual joke. It is still 95% Tier 0/1 wood everywhere, with a smothering of Tier 2 wood here and there and it's the same for Any other material which is supposed to be in the realm tier.\n\nTo stop myself from going on a long rant as this is my biggest pet peave, so I'd like them to and hope they will take a pass on and investigate the following issues:\n\n1. Why do we find more higher tier materials in the tier BELOW the tier they are supposed to be in?\n+I need Tier 2 wood? I farm it in Tier 1 realms, same for general resources, except ores TO A DEGREE. You still find ores needing a 200 Mining pick in a Tier 1 realm.. BRUH??\n\n2. Having to create multiple Abeyance realms to be able to do the Sites of power because the one in your own will literally disconnect you the second you walk inside.\n\n3. Lets us give followers specific orders about what to do in base as well as hire more than 1.\n+I don't know how many times I've had to pick up my coal from various crafting machines when making gunpowder because this idiot keeps using it as fuel when she has no access to any storage in my base.\nWhat is the Checkbox for Survivor access even do if not prevent them from accessing it?\n\nSteam needs a middle ground between recommending and not recommending something.\nBecause at the moment I can't not recommend it because it is fun, but I also don't want to recommend it because some of these bugs are simply too much, even for an EA game, for which I have thousands of hours playing as I know what I'm getting into and what to expect, but even this amount of game breaking bugs is surprising to me, with how good the developers have been about fixing things so far. \n\nI do have high hopes for the game and with added mod support in the future if that ever comes, this game will be incredible.", "timestamp_created": 1708866010, "timestamp_updated": 1708866010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560293138027191162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162269908": {"recommendationid": "162269908", "author": {"steamid": "76561199469119003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1401, "last_played": 1712462148}, "language": "english", "review": "Even with all of the bugs/not finished content, this is a solid play.

Plus, you don't know the stats of what you're about to craft. Is it better, or worse than what you have? Who knows!? Just waste the materials which took hours to obtain to find out! (It doesn't show any stats on the crafting menus).\n\nI hope you like crafting tables, because you're going to have an abundance of them and they require some item from another crafting table that required another item from yet another one and they all require the same types of materials.. so back out you go to forage, chop and mine - rinse and repeat. Also, the resources to keep some of the tables active (unless you shut them off every single time and then restart them when you need to use them) such as sticks....guess what? The tables/camp fire rip through them too quickly - so yet another journey to get yet more materials. Then there's the having to eat every 12 mins +-, don't you dare walk away from the game without logging out... the timer is ticking and most likely you'll come back to a character who's died and now you get to go get your inventory back where you died. I am beyond tired of feeding my character.. it feels like she has an eating disorder and is always stuffing food in her mouth.\n\nSecondly, the combat lacks a LOT. Its clunky and boring...just keep mashing the same button over and over. The keys at times don't respond, so you keep pushing to use your climbing picks/axe/skinning knife etc. only to keep using your previous weapon/tool over and over. Need to heal? Keep mashing that button..perhaps it will switch over to use your healing kit/food.. maybe I'm just not pushing hard enough.. maybe I don't have any left..Nooo.. keep pushing the button hoping.. need to exit? Keep pushing ESC eventually it will activate and allow you to leave.\n\nI want to be fair; it is a pretty game with some beautiful terrain and I enjoy building but....\n\nAlso, for some reason it won't allow me to add the final two sections of roof, I've tried so many different combos and I still have two gaping holes in my roof. Want to upgrade from a stick/wood house to stone? You have to dismantle EVERY single wall, ceiling..floor individually without knowing as you're hitting it if you're actually hitting the wall you want to remove or perhaps one of your crafting tables until it destroys (you can't just move something) - the fun continues though.. you need to remake that crafting table but for some reason the amount of materials you recovered when you accidentally dismantled it aren't the same as you now need to rebuild it.. time to hoof it again to get yet more materials. \n\nFinally, the world lacks something... the animals clump in the same spots every single time.. no roaming unless you run through them..no worries though.. turn around and come back and they're back in the same exact spot! I wish I could explain what its lacking, I understand its after the worlds changed/died off..but it feels empty despite all the beautiful sunsets/rises and purple/pink trees..  I think its partly that you're going through portals to new realms yet they all pretty much look the same, at least so far.\n\nI really want to like this game and perhaps eventually I will after some more work is done on it. Unfortunately Steam doesn't have a maybe or a wait and see option - just thumbs up or down..for now its down.\n\nI would like to finish by commenting on the character creation, I know they're still working on it..but dang.. the current choices are a big bulbous nose or... I know a big bulbous nose with a narrow bridge? The presets are atrocious looking. Now, don't get me wrong I don't need a beauty queen..but come on! This game has some ugly female creation..

World generation has a difficulty setting for example, but you have no control over certain aspects to customize your experience, such as resource spawn rate, enemy health, enemy damage, player health, player damage and so on.\n\nThe UI is... well. It's there and while I do not absolutely hate it, I have seen better in most survivals I have played. I feel like they tried to create this steampunky feel to it, but they went way overboard with it and made it too complex and messy. Even quit button was harder to find than in most games and the game can only log you out and you need to log back in or quit, so you can't simply return to the character selection screen.\n\nSomething about mob AI and hitboxes feel weird, but I have only been using the most basic of tools and have not gotten actual weapons yet, or killed any of the bosses, so there is little for me to say at this point.\n\nBuilding system has functioned, though again the UI is very clunky and confusing. Getting materials for building can be tedious though, since you need about 600 stone to make a big stone house and the minable stone takes only a single hit, but provides three stone, that weigh quite a bit. There is the possibility to open the map though and return to your base after mining yourself full of stone, so that helps, but unless better tools provide more stone (which I don't yet know), building something like castles may get very tedious.\n\nOverall I think the content so far has been decent and I'm not feeling cheated buying the game, though my expectations were slightly above what the game currently is (mostly for the UI and AI really based on my first impressions, as well as the always online way of playing).\n\nI will say 55% recommended and 45% not recommended, so this is why I say yes.

You'll be mid boss fight, mid dungeon or mid farming and just \n   get kicked to the title screen. Its happened around 20 times in the last 24 hrs. \n   I have gig internet, and my network runs everything else fine. This isn't an issue anyone should be having \n   in a solo game. \n\n [h3][h3] Game Play [/h3] \n - The game play loop so far has been to stare at the ground, or a tree trunk gathering. \n You're giving about a half dozen crafting and half dozen refining tables very early, but most items don't say \n what they do, or how to use them. \n\n [h3][b] Gathering [/b] [/h3]\n - You will spend almost ALL of your time gathering resources and walking back and fourth to your base to unload the resources you've gathered. \nI love the resource grind usually, but this feels terrible, low yield, low storage/carry weight and a burdensome amount to craft housing items. \n\n [h3][b] Combat [/b] [/h3]\n - The combat is on par with Waldheim but worse. You swing until stuff is dead. \nThe \"Dodge\" mechanic is a joke where you leap 20 yards in the direction you last moved. \nin level 10 armor, I killed multiple lvl 45 mobs using range and my follower and the poorly functioning AI of the mobs. \n \n [h3] [b] Guidance/Direction [/b] [/h3]\n - There are no real directions/indicators for anything. \nI don't like games that hand hold too much, but there are almost no player ques to indicate when/where/what for items, enchantments, gear comparison, restricted areas, etc. Areas with high level mobs/restricted look identical to areas you can just walk into, and nothing tells you why you can't enter an area (gear score, story progress? idk) \nYou'll end up on the internet asking \"how do you use X\"\n\n [h3][b] Visuals [/b] [/h3]\n - Visually, the game is very good looking.

However in this instance, and in fairness, only the first week of Early Access, I have to give this a thumbs down in light of there being no mid-thumb on Steam.\n\n[b]TLDR[/b]\nSome glaring design flaws right out the gate. Which could be addressed but you have to consider that the people fixing those flaws were happy with them all the way up to Early Access release.\n\n[b]Review[/b]\nGiven my limited playtime I'll just focus on what I've encountered so far. \n\n[i]Online only[/i]\nThe immediate issue is, of course, the fact the game relies on servers regardless of whether you are playing solo or co-op. While this is being billed as \"online required\", which is an issue in itself for some. The major problem here is that, if you're looking at solo play, you're being weighed down with all the sacrifices of online infrastructure with no benefits. In my very short time playing so far I've seen consistent \"Waiting on server\" messages when entering the game or changing realms, I've also been repeatedly disconnected from the game and pushed to the main menu for \"Inactivity\". Why can't I idle in my base? Well because it's wasting server resources. See my point about the sacrifices for no benefits.\n\nWhile it hasn't impacted me yet, server updates and resulting downtime mean you simply can't play at all. There is also the very common end game of these servers being shut down if the game isn't a commercial and sustainable success (read that as short lifespan and probably paid DLC aplenty).\n\nIn the Dev's defence, they have acknowledged this and said they're looking at it as a priority. Depending on when and how this is addressed I'll happily come back to this review.\n\n[i]Procedural Content[/i]\nSo that chonker aside. The game itself. Well, here is the rub. The game has a solid foundation but much like the online, it seems those foundations are built on unstable ground and it's going to be a question of whether the developer can fix that.\n\nThe procedural realms suffer from the classic procedural issue. Grand structures, touches of flair, stunning landscapes. All cut and pasted from a pool. Many are just aesthetic in nature with no function or, by necessity, when you can interact with them the loot at the end is low value to maintain a gated levelling curve. Ultimately, the sheen wears off fast and that feeling of awe and discovery soon becomes devalued.\n\n[i]Twitch Drops[/i]\nWhile I'm moaning. Have they seriously locked content behind an 8 hour twitch idle? So I buy the game and can't have a pet dog? I can't idle in the game for 20 minutes but running a twitch stream on mute for 8 hours is just fine? The lack of content and hypocrisy isn't the biggest issue here. It's again that the developer has made a decision to penalise and restrict the player to the detriment of the game itself. In this case, clearly for a financial benefit. It begs the question of what other design decisions have and will be made using this logic?\n\n[i]NO PAUSE[/i]\nI'm seriously tired of developers failing to address this very basic QOL accessibility feature. If a game offers single player then it should offer an immediate pause feature. Phones ring, kids shout, pets piddle, doors are knocked. It's further compounded in Nightingale where you can't even risk perching yourself somewhere \"safe\" or teleporting back to your base, as stats still tick down and environmental debuffs apply. And of course even if you do that you'll be kicked for inactivty anyway. Even quitting to the main menu is a multiple button and click process.\n\nWe have a arachnophobia mode right out the gate but nothing to address that real life exists.\n\n[i]Content[/i]\nI'm only a little way in but I'll say that there does seem to be considerable effort put into the 'tech tree' progress. Many (too many?) workstations exist, materials of many types, items to craft, upgrade and enhance. Building is a thing but is somewhat outshone by Enshrouded's system. The story/mission structure seems sound so far, pushing you in the right direction without too much of a heavy hand. I can't speak too much on gating/grind or a repetitious nature of missions but the dev clearly seems to have focused on this predominantly for their EA release.\n\n[i]Character vs Environment[/i]\nJust a small point but I find the player/npc models very jarring against that of the environment. It's like they're very low definition and made more so against the detailed and rich environments. It's very distracting and made somewhat worse by janky animation and pathing issues. \n\n[i]The summary, summary[/i]\nThere's enough here for me to continue playing more despite these issues, I'm eager to get further into the content and tech tree side of things. I've bought the game after all. That said, I feel there are some red flags in here that may mean this never reaches a level that is more than an average game. They can turn this around, look at No Man's Sky, but that is more the exception than the rule.\n\nBuyer beware.

It's like they plucked a random person who never played a survival game off the street and told them to design one. There are things in game that shouldn't have made it past the alpha stage.\n\n- Building: You're given the impression you can build to your heart's content. You cannot. The building limits are realm wide for all buildings in that realm INCLUDING the ones the game generated. That limit is incredibly low. Check the forums if you want specifics. In short: forget about building a giant castle, not going to happen.\n\n- Crafting: inventory bloat. They made so many versions of resources that you're always struggling with storage space. It feels as if at some point the game was supposed to have been an mmo where they sell inventory slots in a cash shop.\n\n- Clothing: unless you got the Twitch drops you're going to be stuck in yellow hobo gear with turban for a large part of the game. This clothing has nothing to do with the victorian setting you're supposed to be in.\n\n- Character face presets: please provide paper bag.\n\n- AI, or better said Artificial Stupidity. You get a helper NPC who can cut down trees near your house that destroy the walls should they drop on them. The resulting wood he stuffs in your forge/cooking fires even when you don't want him to. Or he puts it in some random house plan of an NPC quest when you didn't start that quest yet. That is if he picks up those resources in the first place. Most of the time he doesn't.\n\n- Realm design: yes, the realms look pretty. But there's only a few types and it's only surface deep. You keep getting similar points of interest in them just at different locations. It gets repetitive. Yes, I know how to reset realms.\n\n- Fishing: counts as inactivity. I've had to get 16 fish for the MAIN quest (which is a cardinal sin in my book, fishing should be a side quest at worst, abolished at best) only to get disconnected at fish #15.\n\n- Tests of Agility: just no. Burn with fire, then bury the ashes, then pee on the ashes. That at least would give some satisfaction.\n\n- Augment stations: I'm so frustrated with the augment system that I'm going to take a break playing. This is the most sadistic crafting system I have ever seen. Range is too short, recipes get unusable if there are too many augment stations for your crafting benches, you have to put a CANNON, a plough and a rainbarrel inside your house. I won't have room to move around anymore. AND it takes away from the building limits, this while my main reason for buying this game is being able to build something huge. \n\n- There's more, just check the forums.\n\nLook, I've played a lot of early access games and I'm aware the game is not finished. I cut most EA games some slack because of this. I'd not write a review yet if I think that game will be salvageable in a reasonable amount of time. I've 50 hours played so I really tried to give the game a chance. But some of the above are simply inexcusable design decisions. Hopefully it will be changed eventually, but since the game is only going to be about a year in EA I don't think release is going to be able to fix all that.

I have never experienced it worse than with this game, and while 3rd person does help, it's janky as all hell.\n\nSecond, the story progression is pretty slow and, so far, boring. Since it seems like character progression is locked behind story progression (which is a really weird decision for a game of this type), you're limited to basic equipment for a long while. I want to jump into an exciting world, fight new enemies with interesting weapons and build cool buildings with new and exotic materials. I do not want to be railroaded by a little guy in a mask with my best weapon being a stone axe. \n\nThird, always online. While their reasoning for it makes sense, the implementation of it is just stupid. Let people set up a server if they want to, don't force them to.\n\nFourth, the building system is pretty bad. Grinding resources is a massive pain, and navigating the menus is a nightmare. The actual building is also pretty janky compared to similar titles. I haven't yet progressed to a point where I can build with more interesting resources than basic stone and wood though, so I can't comment on whether or not it becomes better. So far though, the building system is thoroughly unimpressive and frustrating.\n\nAll in all, Nightingale seems to have great potential with an interesting and unique setting, but interacting with the world as a player is not entertaining.

That takes way too long.\n- you do the same quests on every map ( clear this point, farm this, kill this )\n- half of the items have no own item symbol\n- farming wood, stone and stuff takes w8 too long. you should get more mats per stone/tree.\n- you have like 50 chests with items in yor base and it takes ages to sort it or find what you need, cause many mats look the same, but have different qualitiys.", "timestamp_created": 1708461880, "timestamp_updated": 1710148093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548006594181060791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158864974": {"recommendationid": "158864974", "author": {"steamid": "76561199410411124", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 605, "last_played": 1712441000}, "language": "english", "review": "Came here to give this game a positive review only to see that at the time reviews are mixed... huh?! this game even in early access is easily better than 90% of the other games in it's genre.

There seem to be a lot of superficial, honestly downright *weird* criticisms of this game that have little to no grounding in what the game actually is, at least given my experience with it. \n\nStraight out of the box, there seems to be a ton of knee-jerk detraction surrounding the always-online foundation of this game, which I think has been blown entirely out of proportion. I dislike always-online as much as anyone else, I feel like it's almost always a bad decision and there's really very few games that actually necessitate this sort of \"feature.\" That said, when always online IS necessary, and it's done properly, there's literally no issue with it. The game was flagged by my firewall initially, I don't know if all of these people with problems just missed that on their end and they don't know how to remedy the issue once the OS prompt goes away, but I've had zero issues with the connectivity at all. No issues getting in to the game, no laggardly loading screens, hell, I don't even feel any latency. So, from my perspective at least, the extraordinary amount of backlash regarding \"another always online game\" ruining the experience is fundamentally baseless.\n\nSecondly, I've seen a lot of people complaining about...character creation? They say the characters are ugly as sin. I genuinely don't understand this angle at all. This game has an insanely robust character creation system, with you being able to pull genetic traits from your lineage (selected from up to 14 of the preset faces) in order to get a very particular face blend to start working with, BEFORE you begin tinkering with all of the nuanced options they offer. Not to be that guy, but if your character is the ugliest thing you've ever seen in a game then I have to say it's literally a skill issue.\n\nThe world building is lovely. Now, I find \"survival-crafting\" to be an EXTREMELY tired genre, with an absolute deluge of the same game being churned out and completely saturating the market year after year. That's not to say that the genre is devoid of its gems, however, and I think that the key really lies in how a game situates us in order to give us circumstances that would rationally lead to a survival-crafting system. I really appreciate when games give us world building and lore that contextualize and rationalize the building-from-nothing progression, like Valheim or V Rising (each remarkable in their own right), and I find that Nightingale executes on that remarkably. Playing cards at gateways as an in-universe justification for drastically varied procedural generation, portal-hopping through fae worlds and dimensions? Lovely. An absolutely novel concept and it really does just elevate the vibe of the game. \n\nGraphically, the game could use a bit of work, but it's miles above what I've come to expect from any Early Access title, and I'm sure they're going to be improving this as time goes on. The lighting and edge sharpening specifically seem pretty \"graphics engine default\" to me, I'm not sure really how to explain it. The way light plays through grasses and shrubs, for instance, is kind of rough, but overall I find the visuals to be unexpectedly captivating for this type of release. \n\nThere seems to be a great deal of depth in the actual mechanics of the game, that I've not yet scratched the surface of, but my initial thoughts are that it's... good? There's a lot of information and different systems at play, but the developers have given us an extremely robust and intuitive UI that makes parsing all of this information a breeze. I, again, do not understand all of the criticism I've seen leveled at the gathering/building/crafting components of the game.\n\nThe combat, I suppose, is the one area where I'm closest to understanding complaints I've seen about this title; but not nearly to the extent I've seen some individuals caterwauling about. The combat itself is actually quite satisfying from what I've experienced so far, it's behaves quite similarly to Vermintide 2 combat (which, if you've not experienced it for yourself, is the single most satisfying, well-honed combat system I've seen in any game where you're contending with more than one assailant at a time). That said, enemy AI is rudimentary and could use a decent amount of tuning. To which I say: this game is Early Access? This game is, at time of writing, TWO DAYS Early Access and literally everything is going to continue getting touched up on as development continues, and people have been lambasting the game over this. Such complaints don't really hold water in my opinion.\n\nSo, in summary, a vast majority of the criticisms and negativity surrounding this game seem to be really....disingenuous to me? This is an exceptionally solid foundation for the developers to build on, and even this very first build of early access is something quite special that I look forward to sinking my teeth in to further. I'll update this review if my disposition changes, but I don't reckon it will, and I just wanted to put this up so that it might give any undecided buyers pause for thought after seeing so many negative reviews that are in my opinion extremely unfair and bad faith.\n\n((Edited to remove an unintentional link))", "timestamp_created": 1708635705, "timestamp_updated": 1708702965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158982590": {"recommendationid": "158982590", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968127224", "num_games_owned": 934, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1708791708}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty cool game.

Of course, some are spot-on, but a vast amount of them are whining about QoL or Not being Polished.\n\nThis is Early Access.  Or, more realistically, \"You Paid Money to Gamma Test\" (Gamma Testing is after Beta Testing, if you didn't know)\n\nComplaining and giving a negative review because the game isn't \"polished\" or \"Needs QOL Features\" doesn't make a lick of sense.  That is what Early Access is FOR.    Expecting a fully featured, fully functional game with no issues whatsoever is not only unrealistic, it isn't very fair to the developers.\n\nDon't like it?  It's pretty simple:\nDon't buy EA Games, wait until they're released.\n\nAs you will see, there are a lot of problems I've found in a mere 7 hours, and I will be critical of those problems because they were Missed...  I am not going to \"Ding them\" for the problem itself, but some of these shouldn't have been missed.\n\nMoving on - \n\nI have tons of experience in Survival Crafting.  I've beta tested for the big companies for decades - not Inflection, tho... for some reason experience didn't matter much.   I guess social media influencers who would just play the game for advertising profit (and not actually Test much, if at all) are more important than people who would have worked to eliminate simple, menial bugs, duping, and exploits before EA/Gamma Testing, but I digress..  \n\nThus far (7 or so hours in) I can see this whole beta testing thing was a missed opportunity.   There are simply too many things overlooked.   Seems like people were focused on Server Stress Testing, Server Load, and Server Performance..   when the simple stuff was just glanced over.   Its like the Game Itself went straight thru the Beta Stage virtually untouched, and Beta was focused on the Server-Side.\n\nSpeaking of Server Testing;\n\nWhy do I need to connect to a server?   Why is there no Offline Option?    This makes no sense to me.    This isn't a Live Service (Skull-N-Bones) or a MMO (WoW).   Forcing a Server Connection opens up a plethora of issues..   Connectivity, Ping, Server Maintenance, Down-time, exploits, griefing...     I just don't get it.\n\nIf it was meant to be a MMO, then so be it..  but it isn't?   Its more like a \"Forced Co-Op with people you don't know\" - but not... MMO...  weird, but completely unnecessary.   If you're after a MMO, make a MMO.   If you're after Optional Co-Op, then make a Single Player game with a Co-Op Option..  don't make some messy, headache inducing hybrid.\n\nThe Ui needs work, and this is to be expected..  But Simple stuff was overlooked.     \n\nYou Can't easily read the descriptions in boxes due to too much text, and figuring out how to read that information is..  tasking..  if you even can.\n\nYou have \"Options\" under those description boxes, but they're un-clickable since moving the mouse off the item makes the box go away..  So, why is Options even there?\n\nWeight?   Why is it hidden until it becomes a problem?  Can you modify it?  How?  \n\nWho forgot to mention that HOLDING E was Area Loot? \n\nWho missed the re-opening of portals is hit and miss - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work?   (Hint: Relog)\n\nYou can't split stacks, which is mind-boggling, so there must be a way, right?   Well, I sure can't figure it out.\n\nWhy is it when you Place Something, the environment affects (eg. Rain) immediately makes the item \"Soggy\" even tho it isn't \"created\" it is just placed..    Create it, and it has negative environmental attributes instantly.    It \"exists\" to the world, and the world affects the item, but doesn't \"exist\" to the player.\n\nThe \"Teaching of the game mechanics\" needs work, but this is to be expected..\n\nThe Character Creation was..  perplexing.    Why is there Lineage?  (Parents, Grandparents..) - is it to make the already comically ugly choices even... more ugly?  I can't figure out if I made a Male Character or a Female Character...   Did someone there get caught up in this Woke Multi Gender crap?\n\nThe Combat isn't... Fluid.   Of course, this is probably due to being unnecessarily connected to some server somewhere, but whatever...  its \"clunky and choppy\" and most of all, there is no collision, so a mob will walk right \"into you\" and stand there hitting you, and you are unable to hit them until either you or the mob moves...  but the trick here is, you can't see if that happened or not.   Literally.   If a mob comes up behind you, and you don't see it (you're in 1st person) and you start getting smacked, you turn around, and there is nothing there.    Where am I getting smacked from?   Move a little, the mob \"pops out of you\".   Great.  \n\nSpeaking of combat.   I hit something for 40, great..   I crit for 80..  okay.    Oh, I just crit for 1,200.  Insta-kill.  Seems legit.\n\nand I have found a LOT more in this mere 7 or so hours..  \n\nI understand this is the \"Starting point\" - I don't mind the concept of the game, nor the idea/theory behind it.   While it isn't original, It is unique.\n\nHowever, now is the time to make good choices or bad choices.   It will be interesting to see how this game develops.

I know it's early access so you should expect bugs and to run into issues but to have bugs that are so bad they can destroy hours of hard work is so depressing and deflating. \n\nItems will just disappear, they will vanish into thin air especially anything you give your followers. Your followers also will chop down trees that spawn INSIDE your base and I mean inside your actual foundation and building which will destroy everything. Do not let your followers equip axes. The fact that trees are growing through buildings is already awful and if you chop it down it will destroy your building. If you have chests in your base and something happens like a roaming translucent monster walks by and causes trees to start falling down it can break your base and cause your chests to despawn. So you can lose EVERYTHING you have if you dare to put them into chests for safe keeping. This is just ONE of the big issues players are dealing with right now as well.\n\nI honestly cannot even express how disappointed I am by this game and how awful of an experience it has been grinding my teeth and trying to 'push through' the bugs and other janky mechanics.

Place blueprints; friends can haul over materials and add them to complete the build\n-Graphics look great, lighting on ultra is beautiful, sky effects really add a nice level to \"lost in space\" vibes\n-Story driven; this is a huge pro for some people, and it pushes you pretty well **without** the feeling of, \"I need to B-line this story every second of the game or else I'm wrong\" like Baldur's Gate 3 feels like sometimes.\n-Neat grapple-tool climbing system is decently smooth\n-Fishing and other aspects are well done\n\nCons:\n-The portal system suffers from the same issue NMS has, while there are infinite possibilities, it's just the same 3 biomes with different shapes.\n-The interface is god awful. An improvement since some of the alpha tests, but some of the worst I've seen in a long time.  (still not as bad as MKB on vanilla Skyrim) not only is the layout horrible, it's jank; clicks sometimes don't click, fields get highlighted as if you were using HTML; it's bad\n-The companion AI is ... bad.  Just to throw Skyrim under the bus here, it's that bad.  Except, I'd say worse because: they said they can gather for you, they don't... they will cut trees.  -sometimes- pick up loot.  Sometimes.  And when I say cut trees, I mean they will cut trees randomly.  Sometimes run over to one to whack it once, stand there for 3 minutes, then whack it again, other times they'll cut 5 trees back to back; this has zero bearing on if YOU are cutting trees or gathering.  This was tested by me and my friends trying to solve a jump puzzle and talking to a NPC.  The companions, EVEN MID COMBAT, will start cutting trees.  Spoiler: trees hurt when they fall on you.  This is BETTER than Skyrim because: they don't block doorways.  You can walk through them.  Which is cool until you try to build and they just spend most of their time walking in your way so you click and miss place something.  N E A T.\n-Optimization isn't there.  On \"nVidia Performance\" shadows are off and textures look like 2010 era and it sits around 90fps with a 3070ti (albeit a dated CPU), still stutters with loading and moving around, but playable.  Similar to my Enshrouded experience.\n-Grouping really breaks the concept of the portals.  You need cards to visit other realms, then someone can just invite you and you travel instantly from where you are to their realm.  What's the point of portals?  It all feels very rigid and doesn't flow together.  You give estate cards to a player so they can visit your house at anytime, even when you're offline, but they can go and give that card to someone else and ransack your property.  \n-Overall QOL: From what I can tell there is no \"combine inventory with container\" button except \"transfer all\" which obviously isn't great unless the container is full.  There is no crafting from container, labeling from what I've seen, etc... definitely a hot mess if you want to have a 4-6 player world/server style community like ARK/Conan/Valheim.\n\nOverall I'm a diehard fan of the genre, but I'm sad so many obvious things were overlooked (I'm running on zero sleep and forgetting stuff, I know it) People in other regions getting 200+ latency, server issues, the extremely raggedy respite restrictions and such, letting you build in any realm but can only \"save\" the location if it's an Abeyance realm... it's sloppy.  \n\nIn the end if anybody is enjoying this game (or any systems that I may have listed as a con) then that's all that matters.

I think it has great potential, the core feature of procedurally generated biomes based on a combination of cards is a really interesting concept, however much of the game's aesthetics and systems are at odds with its turn of the century \"gaslamp\" fantasy.\n\nI had an initially resistant response based on early crafting systems and menus being unusual and the tutorial/information being very unhelpful, but for a while the more I played the more fun I had. After reaching the end of progression, the more I play the more the game breaks and the more disappointed I become.\n\n[h3]The Good:[/h3]\n[b]The Realm System[/b] -  Really interesting. It harkens back to gaming fantasy like .hack/sign games, which used keywords to create worlds to explore. Nightingale's the only game I've experienced that has touched that concept in any meaningful way. The worlds it generates are interesting and full of discoverability at first glance, but become quite mundane after seeing the same landmarks and resource clusters expressed over and over. The second card played at this time seems to be a story progression card, rather than something that actually influences the biome. I could see this becoming a very dynamic and engaging system in the future, but at this time it's not developed enough.\n\n[h3]The Mixed:[/h3]\n[b]Crafting[/b] - The system is overly complex, every resource you collect and use influences the products it creates, however it also creates unique and distinct items because of this. Even when the stats on an item are lost in refinement, or don't produce any meaningful difference, the item carries forward a unique indicator based on its origin materials. Realm cards, for example, do not carry forward any stats and there doesn't appear to be a difference between crafted cards and found cards, however crafted cards carry (wood) and take up an additional inventory slot.\n\n[b]Crafting Gear[/b] - The materials you use to craft equipment changes the look of the equipment crafted, in addition to modifying the stats the gear has. This is an interesting feature, however without some form of glamour or transmog, I could see this being a pretty big point of contention for players in an online community. I could see aesthetic materials and statistic materials being separated in the future, if the developers don't want to implement a glamour/costume/transmog system.\n\n[b]Gear Score[/b] - As you progress, there's an item level/gear score system that's very ambiguous. When crafting, recipes don't indicate a tier or base item level, materials also don't display a tier, only showing a prospective item level when materials are added, but not indicating tier. Materials affect only the listed stats on a piece of gear, so while lots of materials contain varied stats, you can't add poison resistance to boots, for example, because boots don't have a poison resistance stat. Materials also influence the total item level of a piece of gear, regardless if they influence the stats on that piece of gear, creating a situation where you can have an item with very high item level, and near base stats - or an item with very high stats, but lower item level.\n\n[b]Shared Realms[/b] - There appears to be some ability to share realms, but no clear and stable system to create shared abeyance realms or a \"guild\" type abeyance map for semi-public, semi-private cooperative maps. There's no ability to lock chests or protect your structures, anyone can build and destroy objects you create. While this isn't really a big deal with how private the realms are, there is some opportunity for griefing in the future.\n\n[h3]The Bad:[/h3]\n[b]Building[/b] - It's really basic, for a builder survival game. You have no influence over the environment to clear grass or large non-resource rocks, so you'll likely have grass coming up through your floor or rocks poking through your walls. There's no innovation in this space, you're basically building boxes with a triangle roof, all placed from the player's ground-perspective. The aesthetic choices for the currently available building recipes are uninspired. Materials don't seem to affect the appearance of the structures they create, which is unusual since they impact crafted items. There doesn't appear to be any form of painting or wallpaper, and for being a game with industrial, metal work, and fantasy points of interest... It's very surprising that there's no floor plans or building blocks that represent london architecture in 1905.\n\n[b]Aesthetics and Lore[/b] - The game's look and systems are at odds with it's lore. It's like playing a higher-res Valheim after walking through the barrier into the movie Annihilation. it feels like either the developers were unable to capture the aesthetic essence of the story they had, or they had a game structured around the realms and slapped on the story afterwards.\n\n[b]Exploits and Features[/b] - The interaction of minor realm cards and the crafting system creates the ability to duplicate items. It's unclear if this was intended, but it's surprising that the materials you can duplicate are wood and metal, when the economy on farming, seeds, fabric and food is so poor. At the time of posting there's also methods to mix and compound stats on metal items, which could be an intended feature as there's a visible upper limit, but it's again ambiguous and not how a player might expect the system to work.\n\n[h3]Potential:[/h3]\nI think this game has great potential, and overall has decent value for time invested at the EA price. I could really see it becoming something special and very fun with some adjustments and a lot of work. This build feels like an early alpha test state, so seeing it as an Early Access release is a little concerning as this usually implies significant adjustments aren't expected.

I'll start with the negatives about the game first. \nThe biggest downside is that it's an \"always online\" type game meaning that if you want to play it you MUST have an online connection. As a survival crafting game, to me that is a massive downside. Plenty of other games, even recent ones have shown you can have an online experience with survival craft and not need an always online service i.e. Minecraft, ARK, Sons of the Forest, Terraria, Valheim, Astroneer, Starbound, Palworld, etc can all be played either P2P (Peer to Peer) requiring no server software at all or can have individually hosted servers and all are great games in their own rights. My opinion, but making the game one that requires an online connection limits its lifespan and its playability massively which is not exactly great especially for an indie studio.\nSecond, and far less concerning is the somewhat clunky nature of the UI and crafting system. It's not terrible, just a bit wonky compared to other survival crafting games which all have usually pretty similar systems in place. Once you figure out how to navigate it then it's really not too bad.\n\nNow for the pros.\nIts gorgeous. The game world I have seen so far, which just consists of the three starting biomes (A forest, desert, and marshland), look absolutely stunning. Detail is phenomenal and the lighting is wonderful, built in support for DLSS definitely helps and sitting on Balanced I can hold a decent framerate even without Frame Gen turned on, with it on I sit comfortably at my monitors max refresh rate of 100fps on a 1440 Ultrawide monitor on the Quality (high) settings. Could probably do with some optimization, but its by far not one of the worst offenders of game optimization that ive seen. Havnt seen many enemy types yet really, but of the ones ive seen I would like there to be a bit more variety in their attacks. Some Hippo looking animals are a bit overly aggressive and constantly charge at you and past you making them very annoying to fight if theres more than one of them. The grey goblin-like creatures arnt too bad to manage so far, but really only have two distinct attacks.\n\nOverall, I'd honestly say maybe wait a little to get the game. Its not bad. Crafting isnt too hard to figure out, combat is maybe a little overly simple but I am just in the beginning, and some features are missing in the customization area like tattoos and scars and more fine control over character facial features, unless thats what the ancestry thing was about which seems like a bit too much effort to put in for what should be otherwise simple character customization. It has potential and it certainly looks beautiful. Just be aware that it does have that early access feel and limitation.\n\nMessage to the devs, if they read this: Please, please, please, give this game an offline feature that doesnt require an internet connection and allow for either P2P hosting to third party dedicated servers. To me, and likely to many others who play this genre of game, that is the largest hindrance to the game. The very last thing I and many other want is to have server connection go down in the middle of a major fight or building project. Do remember, this game is currently ENTIRELY dependent on your servers and them remaining active. If they fail, or even if people have a poor connection to your servers it will ruin the experience for many people.

I was surprised at how the visuals received a lot of polish and the optimizations done between the last test and EA release.\n\nI love the way that realm cards work and how you can design a new realm to explore. It's fun to combine major and minor cards to create some realms with unique characteristics. Looking forward to seeing what the developers do moving forward.\n\nI see quite a few negative reviews already being posted. While there are some, very good, constructive negative reviews there are a lot that are written by people that do not understand the game, and the way it is built.\n\nAlways Online - Yes, this game has been designed from the ground up to be always online. This is due to the architecture of the game... each realm exists globally to all players. This allows people to invite others to their realms, or allow others to publicly join their realms based on preferred game settings. This also solves the issue of having a multiplayer group playing on different, interconnected realms, at the same time. There are many other global aspects to the design of this game, it was never marketed as an offline experience and as you progress further into Nightingale, it becomes more apparent why this is an online game.\n\nVarious claims of being broken - This is an early access title, however many of the issues complained about in negative reviews are occurring because of server load. If a portal does not open, the server was unable to complete the operation at the time you attempted to open it. Log off (not to desktop, just to the character select screen) then load up and try again. I've had to do this twice in 2.5 hours... it happens and will smooth out as the developers work on updates and optimizations.\n\nNot understanding the card/realm system - You learn as you play the game, you start with nothing and have to learn a bout portals and cards in order to progress... follow the quests and you will start to understand how it all works (the information is spoon-fed a bit which I don't love, but it will add onto your knowledge as you play).\n\nCannot drop items - You cannot drop items right now, I don't know if that will change. However you can convert them to essence which is used to repair equipment. Is that stack of 1000 rocks weighing you down, convert it to essence (which is 0 weight) and keep moving forward. You will learn how to make simple storage bags very soon after the Tutorial finishes, they are cheap and easy to make and will store a decent amount of materials.\n\nCan't split items - Right click on the stack in your inventory and select split (this is not called out in the game and the Devs should mention it somewhere).\n\nNo servers outside NA - I'm not surprised about the server locations for the initial EA release. It's difficult to understand how the demand will be distributed over the globe, and how the servers will react to players in the EU and Oceanic regions. With the persistence and connected nature of the game, it may take some time for the developers to come up with a solid multi-region solution.

It is by no means a perfect survival game, but what I've played so far, I've enjoyed far more than any of the other survival games recently. The environments, especially the forest biome, are very pretty, and ive had a good time just running around the game in co-op.\n\nSome of the reviews on here are incredibly strange, and I wonder if the people writing them even tried looking things up or just playing the game before writing them.\n\n- Yes, the game is always online. but there are definitely EU servers. I've played for 11 hours and I've not gotten any lag during that time. I've also had a grand total of two connection errors playing in that time. Would I have preferred for the game to be playable offline? yes, but the requirements quite literally state an internet connection is required to play the game. You knew what you were getting into when you bought the game.\n\n- Ive seen complaints that there is no way to organize stuff, and that you always grab full stacks of items when taking them out of inventory. chests can be named, and you an use shift when grabbing to split stacks. That said, I'd LOVE for there to be a way to craft from chests directly and not have to get stuff out before doing so. \n\n- I've seen complaints that crafting is convoluted, and yeah, I can see that it might become so at higher level. but I saw someone make a huge step by step guide to cook berries. It's a truth with modification because while you can go through all those steps, you can also just use the autofill function in a crafting station. Don't care if you are roasting blueberries or raspberries? go into the cooking station, press cooked berries, press autofill, choose the amount of things you want it to cook. Don't care much about what type of fuel you use? go into fuel, press autofill, press ignite. enjoy oodles of berry flowers\n\n- I've seen some complaints about the world being empty from people with very little time played, and I'm kinda wondering if they are mistaking the three small tutorial isles for how the rest of the game is. way it works is in the beginning, you go through three small biomes learning the basics, then the game sends you to the first \"real\" map, where after doing some gearing and setting up a base, you get the means to go to the first tier of more challenging worlds. the three tutorial maps are very small and basic, which I agree can be kinda boring, but they are also done very quickly. the only tip I can give for this is bring lots of fiber from the first forest tutorial area because you'll need it in the other two worlds, and they have a lot less available. \n\nAll in all, I've had a good time so far. Maybe it will get worse as time goes on, but I wanted to give a positive review to reflect how I feel about it, and hopefully dispel some of the weirder complaints I've seen.\n\nTo the devs, should you read this: I think this game has a ton of potential in the card system, more biomes, more types of worlds, and some QOL in terms of building, crafting, and similar, and I think you guys may have a great game on your hands. one thing I want to complain about tho, is you let us pick some gorgeous starting gear just to replace it with horrible scrap gear real quickly. I bought this game in part because of the aesthetics of armor, and I'd like to not be wearing potato sacks if I can avoid it.

However, the way it's put into practice leaves a lot to be desired. The characters are shallow, the gameplay gets repetitive, and the mechanics are clunky, which takes away from the fun. What's more, the lack of clear instructions makes simple tasks like crafting feel unnecessarily complicated and difficult.\n\nThe inventory, crafting, and quest systems are overly complex and confusing, making it hard for players to fully enjoy the game.\n\nAlthough I'm hopeful for improvements in the future, right now, \"Nothingale\" only provides a moderate level of enjoyment at best.\n\nTo sum up, while the game has potential, its execution doesn't live up to creating a truly satisfying experience.

Early Access is just what it says on the tin. Early. If the devs considered the game to be ready for full 1.0 release, it would be fully released rather than early access. Speaking of version numbers, patch 0.2 is slated to come next week with a few welcome changes including build from storage and using the guidebook menu to purchase from traders you've already visited (no more having to run back and forth for separate purchases!) along with some new enemies and new combat behavior of existing enemies.\n\nYes, 0.2 meaning it's a far cry from 1.0 so consider that before you think about purchasing the game. If you expect 1.0-level development completion, don't buy the game yet and wait for full release. If you're intrigued enough by the game to tolerate occasional jankiness as the devs iron things out, and initial fun-but-relatively-shallow (read: placeholder) endgame content as that content is still in development and hasn't been pushed out yet, then by all means buy and join us in the realms.\n\nIs the game good? Absolutely. I'm currently about 130 hours in and still having a blast. Exploring the options of the crafting system is very interesting. Base building isn't super elaborate yet but still presents plenty of options to make something good looking. Combat is smooth. Performance is great (I'm running with all settings maxed on an RTX 3060 and haven't had so much as a stutter).\n\nAre there things that could be better? Again, absolutely. That's the entire point of early access. Points of interest on the maps need some more variety, endgame content needs more depth. I desperately hope we get clothing dye options soon as the current system determines color based on the material types used and those colors range from nice but dull to garishly spotted parody costumes with jarring color combinations.\n\nDo the devs listen to the players? Yes, and this is demonstrably true. That 0.2 patch I mentioned next week re-introduces a game mechanic that they recently disabled that they had initially considered to be unintended. They originally wanted players to have to use several different materials for a spread of benefits for your gears. Players discovered they could stack the same materials to laser-focus specific stats.\nDevs confirmed that wasn't the intended mechanic and removed that ability.\nPlayers spoke up saying they actually preferred it that way.\nNext week's patch re-enables that mechanic, and makes a variety of other changes to the crafting mechanics to take that unplanned feature into account and make using it better.\n\nDo I recommend the game? That depends entirely on you.\nIf you understand what early access actually means, and are OK with that, I definitely recommend it.\nIf you expect 100% completion in a game that hasn't reached 1.0 yet, I recommend actually waiting for 1.0.", "timestamp_created": 1713732603, "timestamp_updated": 1713739735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163070604": {"recommendationid": "163070604", "author": {"steamid": "76561199379007715", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 751, "last_played": 1710396488}, "language": "english", "review": "game is absolutely beautiful but doesn't make up for the lack of interesting gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1713393743, "timestamp_updated": 1713393743, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163070587": {"recommendationid": "163070587", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968809681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 4335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4335, "last_played": 1709594336}, "language": "english", "review": "Passed the time but didn't really live up to the hype.

And when u are done upgrading? start upgrading it again so u can just upgrade it again.... meanwhile the world is one copy of another and does not deliver an world, survival experience.\r\n\r\nThis game has a lot of potential but wait another half year... or don't support it. their are a lot of better survival games on the market at this point that take early access more seriously.", "timestamp_created": 1709324094, "timestamp_updated": 1709324094, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159552349": {"recommendationid": "159552349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010579520", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 852, "last_played": 1710776762}, "language": "english", "review": "Connection error", "timestamp_created": 1709228183, "timestamp_updated": 1709228183, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159418665": {"recommendationid": "159418665", "author": {"steamid": "76561199058878314", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4154, "last_played": 1709928253}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]WHAT IS NIGHTINGALE [/h1]\nNightingale is a survival game set in a Victorian era Gaslamp setting (gaslamp is similar to steampunk but with magic where as steampunk focuses on science). The player travels through portals using dropped and crafted \"Cards\" (as in like playing cards) that take you to different procedural generated realms (based on card type). You can always fast travel back to your base so exploring is encouraged and part of the game play.  As of this writing it's an early access game meaning we have access to play an unfinished product. (Sadly, many seem to not understand this which seem to be reflected in their poorly opinionated reviews).\n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]\nThe game is a survival game so has the typical survival elements of gathering, crafting, base building. and combat. \n\n[h1]CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION[/h1]\nThe character creator allows for a wide variety of faces, skin tones and hair styles. You can make some butt ugly characters (of course beauty is in the eye of the beholder), but if you spend the time (those who moan about \"ugly characters\" clearly do not spend the time) you can make some \"beautiful\" males and females in game. I really like the character creator. I hope we see a barbershop in the futuure.\n\nThere is currently no transmog in game. I hope this changes as a future addition to the game. My wife and I both like to customize our characters. \n\n[h1]GATHERING/CRAFTING[/h1]\nThe gathering is reasonably well done with trees falling after they are cut down, minerals/rocks smashing apart as you mine them. The crafting is layered and fairly deep, but not overly complicated. Different materials will craft better items and there seems to be good ranger of items to collect. I enjoy the crafting and the crafting stations. \n\n[h1]BASE BUILDING[/h1]\nThe base building is nice with a pretty straightforward UI for putting down base \"blocks\". The base parts are a full wall height so they take up a larger space meaning you can make a room with 6 blocks. A floor tile, 4 walls and ceiling. You can navigate in this space, but this is done easier in 1st person. It does not take too many base parts to build a functional and good looking base due to the nice graphics of the game and the textures.\n\nSpeaking of 1st person. The game was originally built for 1st person only, but due to player request 3rd person was implemented. 3rd is not as polished as 1st due to it being a fresher implementation. Its not bad, but it could use work as there is some minor clipping with base parts.\n\nI enjoy 3rd person, but 1st person is really the best option for survival base building games. I wont get into why because this involves game theory regarding how a player navigates inside of a space and that is not the scope of this review, but regardless of how you choose to play, both work well. \n\n[h1]COMBAT[/h1]\nThe combat is ok, its not the best, but its not the worst. I would like to see some work regarding combat, but at the same time it has not stopped me from enjoying playing the game.  I also imagine combat gets better as you unlock some weapons and rifles, shotguns etc. I am using a mining pick mostly to fight right now.\n\nYou can also enchant your gear which can affect how you engage in combat. \n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nI am around 70 hours at the time of this review. I have played most of it with my wife and both of us have really enjoyed our time. We both feel we have our monies worth at this point in time, so I see no reason at all not to give a good review. \n\nIf you enjoy survival and Gaslamp fantasy/Steampunk and or the Victorian era, I think you will definitely enjoy your time in game.

You rush through realms and get to your estate/abeyance realm and then it hits a brick wall.  You have to craft equipment and reach a certain gear score and then kill a boss.  If you were stupid enough to start on extreme like I did, the boss will likely kill you and if you didn't make your estate cairn nearby, you'll have to run a distance to them.  My survivor that I recruited also unequipped their weapon so they didn't help me fight them either.  Overall I got through it but it was an unpleasant start for numerous reasons.\nOnce you get past that, you go to another realm for exploration purposes, get more blueprints and everything and it becomes MUCH better. You start seeing tons of encounters everywhere, puzzles, fae towers, defensive points, building missions, gladiatorial pit kinda things, etc.  After that, you go to a dungeon and get crazy amounts of resources and just really have a lot of great experiences.  Then finally after your first realm, you unlock the ability to build portals.  This is where the game really comes into its own.  You can make a bunch of portals to all your friends estates and help them build up or just hang out there if for some reason you want to.  To me, I personally will visit my friends estate and then take portals from there to other realms I haven't been to yet using their established portals to buy various things for the unique ones.  Overall its a great touch and I really enjoy it.  You also get the ability to make fae portals which are respawn points which are straight up god tier as with proper planning you never have to deal with running across the map again.  Absolutely glorious touch.  I really enjoy the way the crafting and alterations work as well.  They make a huge difference for your experience so actually making an effort to gather the right materials for your objectives is absolutely worth it rather than making things all willy nilly.\nOverall, I really enjoy this game.  It kind of functions like a procedural steampunk faewild ubisoft title with a home base you can build up with periodic gear checks built in.  I thought this looked good initially but first impressions were bad but it actually turned out to be awesome.\nEdit:\nOne thing that is super important to know is you can look at the guidebook to create realms with specific conditions to unlock ores or traders that you want.  It's very detailed and thankfully easy to use.  Once you do so, you can target the specific materials you want, add the realm effects you want to maximize the acquisition and then get whatever you want from there.", "timestamp_created": 1708995063, "timestamp_updated": 1709093429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159338496": {"recommendationid": "159338496", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960484893", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 721, "last_played": 1709056624}, "language": "english", "review": "The pacing in the game is so bad that you wonder if the developers played it themselves. I hope it doesn't stay that way, otherwise it won't really be anything even after the EA phase.\n\n- The weapon behavior in melee and also ranged combat is just not very good, it doesn't feel impactful and that's really one of the main reasons not to play the game.\n\n- Clunky character animations and movements, especially in 3rd person.\n\n- the second time killer is the crafting in the game, here you just have to say that everything takes so long that you don't have the time to continue crafting, especially the long crafting chains are really annoying. This is survival crafting from 15 years ago. Has any developer here ever played a really good crafting game? Nogos and absolute turn-offs are the constant effort to repair things, having to constantly search for materials in chests to craft them. Starting Chests and containers are far too small. Absolutely no feeling progress in the things you craft, even after many hours. You of course you lose all your loot when you die. Not having a good understanding of which enemies will kill you in one hit. etc there are so many things that could have been done so much better, especially now that there are so many successful titles in the genre. \n\n- But what's really annoying here are the repetitive dungeons that always come across the same, there's no real change in the promised innovation with maps and new areas.\n\n\nUnfortunately I have to say the game just feels like work that has no payout in the end, I liked the artstyle and the setting, now that I write this sentence I notice the next point, for example, here you choose a great armor and a really great style at the beginning and then you can throw it away because the best looking armor so far is not as strong as an incredibly ugly armor made of shreds and sheets after the start. \n\nUnfortunately, I can only advise against the game, which is currently just more work than work at a relatively high EA price.\n", "timestamp_created": 1708969666, "timestamp_updated": 1708969666, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159123852": {"recommendationid": "159123852", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999368285", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1708756448}, "language": "english", "review": "Is the game perfect?

But the Devs already took feedback and working on a offline version.\n\nThe Worlds: \nYou only have 3 Biomes to start, a few Major Cards to set the difficulty and the general tone of the worlds.\nAfter you get into that world you have a lot of Modification Cards that mostly change the playe/crafting stats or change the world entirely.\nOnly one of this modification cards can be active at once. This leaves you with around 12ish more or less individual worlds in the early game with some differences in creatures/nature or visual.\n\nWorld activities:\nThese are based on the World you choose with your cards, but agreed are pretty repetitive after a few hours.\nThis consist out of sequence and search puzzles, defense and enemie camp combat activies, rare animal hunts and help on building npc housing. \n\nCreatures:\nAlso based on the choosen world, mostly biome, these are also pretty repetitive.\nOnly real exception are the boss monsters you can find in special hunt worlds, which are a bit more challenging.\nThe same goes for dungeons you can embark later on in the game.\n\nThe Crafting: \nYou have to choose a recipe, then fill it with the ingredients, then click to start crafting.\nSometimes you also need to fuel and light up a fire in addition. This seems tedious until you realize that in the game there are different levels and stats for ingredients. So a Fur from a simple boar is different from a Fur from a rare mythical creature.\nIf you use the rare one in your recipes the result has better stats upon them. In addition crafting tables can be affected by upgrades placed in their vicinity by either unlocking new recipes or improving the outcome.\n\nBuilding:\nThe game has a blueprint system, so you can plan your base completely before starting to build,\nthe choices are very limitied in the early game and more building types and architecture is unlocked at a later part of the game,\ntherefore early bases feel like makeshift block huts not like real homes with more artistic freedom.\nA nice touch here are extensions for crafting tables that sometimes fit the table (like a hanging pan would fit in a kitchen) and do actually have an impact to the crafting and are not just aesthetic.\n\nCombat/Movement:\nThe Movement in the game feels really nice and going to combat, the animations feel nice also the feedback for hits is there but could need some small improvements to just get a little bit more *umph*. You tend to just buttonsmash attacks until you are out of stamina, then notice you are out and go back to regain stamina and repeat. This changes with the first guns and boss monsters where you get more into acutally aiming for headshots.\n\nDungeons:\nLater in the game you can kinda unlock worlds with dungeons or go from a hub world directly into ones, These are definitly more challenging with bigger enemy groups and boss monsters with a loooooot of health. Here again seems to be an opportunity to improve bossmonsters with more complexity like multiple phases in combat.\n\nSince there is no official roadmap and the devs announced they will go for feedback of players, this could go really positive or bad based on what their takes are from that feedback.\nI personally like the looks and the general feel of this game and i'm eager to see not only the full end-game but also having everything base building related unlocked.\nMost of the improvements i could think of for this game are UX related:\nCrafting -> Prefill resources after choosing a recipe, maybe get the closest chest as target/source?\nBuilding -> Easier to find out which extensions benefit which crafting tables.\nQuests and NPC -> If you dont read like reading tons of text, these feel dull and more in the background then they should be. The main quests are what are driving the progress for your character.\nTutorial -> A lot more needs to be explained, starts with certain UI Elements like bottom left (Bars and Buffs) and right (Actions) to general shortcut usage (hold E for Area pickup?). Also things like Extensions for Crafting tables are not really explained.\nSome UI -> Comparing Cards or remembering which are major/minor cards could be improved. \nGenerally to have some sort of notebook you can right your own notes in would be nice and fitting for the setting.\n\nOf course expanding the game in general with more biomes and creatures and activities will be the key for this game to be a success.", "timestamp_created": 1708725454, "timestamp_updated": 1708725454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159087582": {"recommendationid": "159087582", "author": {"steamid": "76561199112400408", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 943, "last_played": 1710016160}, "language": "english", "review": "Its hard not to expect a lot out of Nightingale, with its fantastical art style and unique realm mechanics. For years I was bursting with anticipation for what this game would offer. So what is Nightingale? Its a Open world, fantasy, survival crafting game....simple as that, but Nightingale stands out,  and it does all three of those things really well. An absolutely gorgeous open world. Each biome stands apart from the other and the card modification system allows you to tailor each trip out into the world to your liking. From changing the \nway the environment looks and your characters physical attributes , to enemy damage and loot rarity.  All nicely packaged with a difficulty slider. They really nailed the aesthetic here. The sound design, art style, lore, and dialog all meticulously fit together in a very immersive way,  that the genre seems to lack as a whole. The crafting system is deep and can be complicated at first. At its core, it is familiar, but much more detailed than Im used too. To me, this is where the game really gets its hooks into you. With a variety of benches,  augmentations, and multi-tier resources, (each resource offering different damage types, and crit modifiers, etc.) You'll be spending a fair amount of time in you're workshop. This can make progression seem slow, but its all about the journey, right? The game runs with out issue for me. I play solo on a higher end pc, at native 4k, ultra settings and I maintain 150+fps. I've haven't experienced any disconnects or connection problems with a 500mb connection. If you enjoy survival crafting games, you really shouldn't miss this one. I's a really solid EA release.

Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe problem is that these events in the realm are all the same and with the same enemies, just in a different level, the mobs that change between the realms are the animals (preys and predators). The buildings are also all really similar (although I haven't checked the late game major cards so this could be wrong to an extent).\n\nSo with the main selling point of the game for me not being what I was expecting what we have left? A very basic and lacking survival experience which has way too much item bloat for a game with a very bad inventory management. Items stacks independently from their source so you end up with 3 different meats from the same tier just because one of them is from a prey and another from a predator.

There's almost certainly room for improvement in quality of life but for an EA title there's lots of content to be getting on with.\n\nI love the flexibility the portal system offers us and the different variations that are possible at the EA stage, i can't wait to see what biomes we get in the future and the thrill of exploration is all there. \n\nThe modular nature of the fae ruins the game offers us really shows a lot of promise and you can see the devs have given themselves a lot of leg room in ensuring they can really diversify and expand on these in the future to give us even more interesting content. \n\nAfter playing with a friend I'm really looking forward to exploring together and experiencing the challenges/dungeons that Nightingale offers.\n\nI like that the game doesn't hold my hand (that does come with some slight caveats, see below).\n\nWhile i understand the common complaint around the \"always online\" aspect of the game, this really doesn't bother me personally. \n\nMy main gripes so far are:\n\nStorage doesn't link up to crafting, so you need to pull items out of storage and into your inventory to craft.\n\nUpgrading buildings, having to demolish then rebuild your base is tedious, just give us the ability to upgrade existing structures with new materials/patterns.\n\nFollower AI is frustrating and followers in general at the moment are lifeless automatons for carrying stuff and soaking up enemy blows. Also issuing them orders and telling them NOT to use my stored lumber for \n\nThe UI could do with some significant quality of life upgrades as it's not entirely clear or easy to understand certain aspects of it (for example completing challenges rewards you with essences? who knew!?)\n\nIn general the enchantment, charm, infusion system isn't very well explained so i had to figure a lot of this out via trial and error. \n\nWe are aware of different factions but they feel like placeholders at the moment, i'd hope for the future the devs are looking to expand this area significantly, with faction specific rewards etc to give us a reason to care about/interact with these different groups. \n\nA lack of voice acting, a minor gripe i know but it would just help breathe some life into the different realmwalkers/factions you meet.\n\nInventory management could be significantly improved, there has to be a better way of categorising resources so that different variations of the same type don't take up valuable storage slots.\n\nSpicing up the enemy models also wouldn't go a miss.\n\nAll in these are minor gripes and I'm loving the time i'm spending in Nightingale, i cannot wait to see how this game develops over EA and i would absolutely recommend purchasing especially at its current price point. \n", "timestamp_created": 1708608725, "timestamp_updated": 1708608725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158956644": {"recommendationid": "158956644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011723898", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1708591047}, "language": "english", "review": "The game looks nothing like the videos.\n\n1. The game starts running good, but after a while you get very low FPS (lower settings seem to deteriorate this).

You kill a wolf you get their skin, you craft Leather Level 1 (Predator). You kill a deer, you get their skin, you craft Leather Level 1 (Prey). Not only those need their own space on your inventory or on your storage boxes, but if a recipe needs two leather, you can't use both of those, since they are coming from different sources (Predator, Prey). Now add the multiple levels of those and you get the idea. It's exactly the same with food and almost every item in the game.\n\n3. The off-hand mechanic is frustrating. Another issue that was stated in the beta testing with no changes at all.

So far I am not disappointed! I wish people would keep in mind that this is in fact an EARLY ACCESS game which means it's not going to be fully functioning on day one let alone the first month. If you're someone who can't stand to play an unfinished early access game then don't buy it. Plain and simple. Just don't buy it and complain and expect it to be a smoothly running game when it's early access and still being developed. Everything shown in the trailers is all in the game and no it's not a scam. (Kids should stay off the internet) I personally can't wait to see what they add in next and obviously look forward to them fixing any lag or performance issues if they are able.\n\nFirst playthrough:\nI made it through the tutorial (I personally didn't see any options to skip it) which I recommend doing anyway because you get to keep any materials you find along the way when Puck finally allows you to go to a real realm which most likely will be your home realm and I recommend choosing the Forest biome your first play-through because it will make things a bit easier on you as you continue to learn your way through the game.\n\nCharacter customization thoughts:\nThe character customization is a bit wonky to me, it felt really hard to get a half-decent looking character. I didn't like any of the noses or mouth options and most of the eyes looked the same nationality. I noticed there wasn't an option to widen or squint the eyes in any way so that was a bummer. I also wish there was more things I could change about the nose like make the bridge skinnier or wider. (not just taller or shorter) There really isn't much you can do with the mouth/lips either, they all look to be frowning even when smiling if that makes sense. I also wish there was more hair and eyebrow options, but again, the game is in early access so maybe they will come out with more options for us in the future, otherwise I'll have to mod which I really don't like doing. It took me like over an hour to finally make something I was happy with. ^ ^; I do however LOVE the make-up options and that was really fun to play around with different color combos and the glitter, so that gets an A+.\n\nCombat:\nI also did my first dungeon that the game recommends you do first, I did it solo with the help of the NPC that you can recruit and I almost died a few times so it's definitely somewhat challenging imo. (I'm on Normal difficulty setting) The combat feels pretty good imo and you can choose to try and land head-shots for extra damage so it's fun trying to see how many head-shots I can get in. XD The mummy-looking mobs scare the crap out of me and I hate them. haha There's one that throws bombs/fire at you and I almost died a few times just from that alone so the combat definitely makes you maneuver around and think about which mobs you should prioritize first which is always a fun concept for combat imo.\nThe sling-shot weapon is a bit hard to hit anything with but not impossible, I just wish the hit box on the shot was a bit wider so that so many didn't miss. I know it's probably a skill issue on my part but either way they should make it a bit easier on people like me who don't play FPSs for a living. lol\n\nMy thoughts so far:\nI have yet to even go through a portal to another big biome and I've been having lots of fun gathering materials and crafting and building my first little home and fill it with all the crafting benches and figuring out what I can build/craft next. :)\n\nConnectivity/Performance issues:\nThe whole 11 hours I played, I only disconnected once and it was after I chopped down my first tree, I was able to reconnect right back in pretty fast and I didn't lose any of my items so it wasn't even that big of a deal. (and I was able to chop a bunch of trees later with no issues) I did experience a bit of lag whenever I ran by a couple dungeon areas but I noticed the lag went away pretty quickly and it wasn't even that bad. Overall the game ran super smoothly and my PC isn't even top tier, I don't have the newest/latest graphics cards but I do have a SSD which probably helps and I also updated my drivers like the game recommended so that might have helped also so just make sure to update your drivers before playing because it might help. :p (I also live in Alaska so not sure if my location had anything to do with how well the game was running for me and I also have somewhat decent internet connection but it's not Fiber or anything)\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nOverall I personally recommend this game for people who are into survival/crafting/building games like me. I can't wait to explore more biomes and I have yet to fully explore the Forest biome that I'm in. If you think your PC won't allow you to enjoy this game properly then maybe don't buy it. I've been waiting so long for this game to finally come out so either way I knew I was going to buy it no matter what and I'm glad I did because I've been having a lot of fun on it and I have yet to play it with friends so I'm sure I'll have even more fun with the multiplayer experience. The game is still being worked on so you can expect certain things to get fixed, updated, and added later. You can either choose to wait longer to see if the game looks more to your liking later before you decide to purchase, or you can chance it and truly see just how bad or not bad the lag issues are on your machine. (For me personally they weren't bad at all) I personally think the price isn't bad either. I fully expected to pay $30 for this game only to see that it was on sale on launch so that was a pleasant surprise for me and made it even more worth it. ^ ^", "timestamp_created": 1708537080, "timestamp_updated": 1708537080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158900467": {"recommendationid": "158900467", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976598053", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 9577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 505, "last_played": 1711471458}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting concept based on lore that isn't as well known as some of the other survival games like Valheim. \n\nThe water looks amazing.

There seems to be a misconception that people hate always online and that's the reason for the bad reviews, but it's simply not true. The issue is mainly that the online is just annoying. Loading between realms takes around 2 minutes which isn't game breaking, but it's annoying. I have this game installed on a SSD, but every single time you spend 2-3 minutes waiting on server... While I find the various online issues really annoying, I don't think they warrant a negative review, especially since the devs have announced that they plan to add an offline mode. \n\nTo be clear, I didn't give this game a bad review because of the online, although I think it's a fair reason to give a negative review since it affects people's ability to play the game. \n\nNow, let me explain why I'm giving this game a bad review. But first, let me tell you what's good about the game. \n\nThis game is beautiful and the backstory is really interesting. The creatures are cool and the crafting is extremely indepth. Seriously, the crafting gives you a lot of ways to customize the stats of almost every item. I also like the way the building system works. You can place phantom designs and then fill them with mats when you have them. Also, you can move already built structures, this includes chests with items in them, THANK GOD. I mean this is amazing. Have you ever played a survival game and had to first take out all the items from a chest before moving the chest? It's awful right! Well in this game, you can just move the chest with all the items inside. \n\nSpeaking of good stuff, the survival mechanics are actually pretty good. They're what you'd expect from a survival game, but adds a little depth to them without making them too complicated. \n\nNow, the reason for the bad review....\n\n1) Repetition. Unfortunately, this game is really really repetitive. Survival games tend to have a loop, but this game's loop is unfortunately kind of bland and copy-pasted. Most survival games have you grind materials from biome 1 to go to biome 2. Then you grind upgraded versions of your tools and go to biome 3, then to biome 4, then biome 5, then biome 6 and so on. Each biome is usually different and completely unique to the last. \n\nThis game does the same thing, but it only has 3 biomes, and you see all the different biomes within the tutorial. They try to vary this experience by making biomes randomly procedurally generated so each time is unique, but it just isn't that unique. The forest is still the forest and the desert is still the desert. After tier 1, you're just looping back to forest/desert/swamp over and over again. \n\nSpeaking of repetitiveness, you have to complete point of interests to get currency to buy recipes for the next tier. But the POI's are all basically the same and a lot of them are just kind of meh where you kill 1 wave of braindead AI or press 3 switches sitting next to each other to solve a puzzle. None of them really feel unique to the biomes and after you've done a couple, you've seen it all, even if the format is very slightly changed. \n\n2) Crafting is TEDIOUS. The crafting is really indepth which is cool, but my god is it tedious. You have raw mats which have various different types and tiers for the same basic raw mat. Then you need to craft it into a basic ingredient to craft other stuff, but you have tons of different work benches and everything takes quite a lot of real time to craft. There's not crafting from storage so you're constantly looking through hundreds of different mats to find what you want, and then when you find the raw mat that you want, you need to find all the other raw mats too bc each of the same raw mat gives different attributes. \n\nLike I said, the crafting is really indepth and awesome, but it's just not streamlined and it's a serious pain in the ass at the moment. The crafting and inventory management is such a chore that it often fatigues me while i'm trying to craft stuff and I just take a break from the game for a while. \n\n3) Combat is extremely MEH. The combat is bland. The ai is bad, you don't need to block or dodge, you can simply just strafe and backstep and never get hit. It's also just really simple, you swing until you don't have stamina, and then just strafe/backstep until you have it again. The only time you might die is when there is a swarm of enemies, simply bc you might get hit from the side or something. Combat is a little more fun like this but you rarely run into swarms of enemies. Also, the combat just doesn't feel responsive. The feedback from getting hit just doesn't feel like much and the attack feedback, especially for headshots feels extremely arcadey, it's kind of a weird and out of place.\n\nPeople seem to like the ranged combat, but so far I'v found ranged combat kind of boring. I think the heartshots for animals is extremely awesome, but other than that it's just slow, clunky, and doesn't feel that great.\n\n4) Bugs. I know it's Early access, but there are some gamebreaking bugs that just suck. I almost refunded the game when I first started because I couldn't finish the tutorial due to a glitch where the final portal doesn't work. While I wouldn't really care about that, apparently this bug was fairly well known and common in earlier betas before the game released into Early access and it just wasnt' fixed. \n\nSome of this stuff can be fixed like adding new biomes to the game, but I feel like some things like combat, repetitive point's of interest, and crafting might not really improve that much. \n\nThe game has opened up and become a little more fun after unlocking the first new tier of realms, but also, it kind of sheds like on the repetitiveness of the game. I have high hopes for this game, but I think it's really undercooked. \n\nMy recommendation is wait to buy.

You can tell even from just a few hours that progression will take time. (which is good, me and my playgroup completed Enshrouded in just under two weeks. We felt that was way to fast!)\n\nNegatives:\n\nInventory management needs a couple of quick fixes (like splitting stacks as it creates play-ability issues being unable to pick up stacks of items from chests without becoming over-encumbered).\n\nThe parkour is a bit on the weak side and needs some attention.\n\nThe umbrellas are mandatory. Yeah, seriously... this studio spent like 200 man sprints on character customization and nobody realized that flying around like Marry Poppins might not fit the preferred aesthetic of some of their player base. (this is a personal preference and may not apply to you but I am not the only one in my playgroup that assumed there would be other mobility options for different demographics)\n\nThe combat is the worst attempt at in-game combat I have ever experienced. A lubed up midget tossing competition is more elegant and graceful than this. It is based on some bizarre concept where you run in circles around each other randomly left clicking (yes, the video showing blocking, pushing, timed attacks, parrying, etc was all just a bullshit). Enemies are terribly designed, redundant, and easily defeated using the aforementioned elite \"run in circles, click attack\" maneuver, hitbox's are non-sense, stamina use in combat is laborious, even going to just hunt some deer for food is a deeply frustrating experience that overwhelmingly ruins all the positives this game has. \n\nReleasing the game with so little thought and effort put into the combat system really demonstrates that as a company Inflexion Games have no intention of making this a successful title. No product manager that cares about their project would have approved launching with the combat system and enemies in this state. There are a lot of good survival games released so far this year and more on the horizon.

I have filed 3 \"Respite Realm Restore\" requests and so far I have received exactly       ZERO follow up messages. My issue is still unresolved. I cannot leave the Watch area and cannot play the game at all. $30 VERY WELL SPENT LMAO\n\nAvoid this game. Fucking play Enshrouded instead; at least it has a normal bug report system. I've never seen a less helpful bug system on ANY game let alone one in Early Access. EA is basically beta testing that I am paying for; the least you could do is give a shit about people who are paying your bills. \n\nI love this game. I love the art, the story, the themes. I think the crafting is amazing and the gameplay loop is really fun.  I have almost 300 hours already. I have 14/15 achievements and I was ready to finish the last one when I got locked into one area of the game and could no longer travel, or access my home dimension in the game. This, as you can imagine, breaks the game entirely for me. \n\nThat's when I discovered their \"bug reporting system\". What an absolute joke. In a normal bug report system, your report goes to the dev team/QA whatever you want to call it. For Nightingale, it's a public post on their forums. That public post shares space with their feedback system, so it's just a giant wall of 'I wants' vying for attention with game breaking bugs. I reported a previous issue with chests full of objects disappearing from my Respite Realm days ago and haven't even gotten so much as a robo reply. It's literally the worst customer experience I have ever received in software. These are massive bugs that they claimed were patched a week ago but are still extant and they can't even tell me they're looking into my situation? Even crappy game companies send you a report number and are like ... professional about it?? I've just never seen such a reporting system and I can't imagine why anyone would create this. \n\nwhile I'm mad, I'd like to mention Vaults are bullshit. I've never even seen the Jana at the end of one despite doing dozens because they get cleared in about 30 seconds by vastly overlevelled farmers with speed boosts. Making all loot free for all is such a bone-headed move in instances like these I'm actually taken aback that you would do this. It's 2024, do you not realize how toxic this makes your PVE community? When one person can get basically all the loot in the instance by turbo clearing the puzzles and racing to the end while everyone else fights the mobs? It's really bad user experience and running Vaults is the first thing in the game I straight up didn't enjoy. \n\nMaybe if I ever hear from customer support I'll change this review but man am I disappointed. I love this game, I was so excited to play it, but this is bad even for early access. It would be understandable if this was a complete wipe; that is an unfortunate side effect of EA sometimes. But having known issues that are this bad and the reporting system seems to be a massive comment arena where other users get to determine how important your issue is?? I hope I'm wrong but it really doesn't seem that way. I hate to leave a negative review for a game like this but if I had known I could lose everything and then just be ignored when I report it I 100% never would have bought it and I can't recommend it\n\n\"bUT iT's EA\"\n\nYeah so have a robust and easily used reporting system & experienced team members to process the reports and stay in touch with users", "timestamp_created": 1710359313, "timestamp_updated": 1710548162, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545130312442779541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1710955664, "developer_response": "Hi there.

I like the fact you can build the whole base then get items to after create the game.\n- I appreciate the puzzle, that encounter ideas... but its has its draw backs...\n\nnow to the cons... Ooo boy..\n\n-Keybinding system is completely broken, you either have to play the game on the default settings or your keybindings will break constantly. for example I like swapping strafe keys (a and d) for my q and e buttons. Well everytime I die my e button goes back to interact and I can no longer stafe to the right. I either have to completely log out of the game or die again to reset it. I have sent in a ticket as a major bug, cause honestly its game breaking.\n\n- The crafting system is waaaaay too overcomplicated with way to many materials.. this is made 100x worse cause like 1/2 the materials in the game have literally the same icon or a place holder icon, so it takes forever for you to find what you are looking for in chests.. then you literally in the mid came have to Craft something > to craft something > to craft something > to craft something... to make the item you are trying to get. T2 resources are hard to find consistently and you essentially have to wander around realms until you find what you need and even with realm boost cards up get a fraction of what you need.\n\n- UI - its clunky to use and it feels 1000 times worse when you cannot change key binds cause the binding either doesn't work or will stop working on you. Not having a way to scroll threw your off hand items instead of manually clicking them just seems like a really terrible decision and make me feel like the devs have never play any game at all that has a 1-8 hot bar..\n\n-combat.... I haven't made it to late game, but the early game gun play is terrible... i don't know what would possess the devs to make everything literally hip fire, but it feels terrible.  The melee weapons feel alright, but the the combat is pretty bland and repetitive.  Creature attacks are very choreographed and easy to dodge once you get their pattern down.\n\n- Progression - The game does a pretty bad job at giving you guidance on how to do things in the game. it refers you to the guide book, but its vague and you have to do a ton of searching/reading yourself to remotely find what you are looking for. some pretty critical things that should be blatantly obvious are not\n\nThats my intial feedback. I am trying to press through to see if it gets better, but at the moment I struggle logging on everytime my brother plays.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1709163428, "timestamp_updated": 1709163428, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545051693916320801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158922516": {"recommendationid": "158922516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198436766274", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1711246710}, "language": "english", "review": "This game needs work.

I've waited a long time for this game to come out and it has not disappointed. The realms, the clothes, the building, crafting system, collecting resources and character creation is amazing. My only complaint would be the blue print system. I don't mind the grind or collecting the resources necessary for crafts and While i think its a good idea for some \"rare\" gear, a lot of the good/ interesting gear is offered at the end game (so why would i need it then, the game is pretty much over?) I think a lot of blueprints/recipes should be offered near mid game or the augmentations should unlock much more than they do when you finally achieve crafting them. It should give you the chance to craft the item, then if you want it as a higher tier you can re-craft it with the better resources. I also think all base building styles should be offered much earlier than they are for the same reasons as the gear (end game??). I think making things like building styles and crafts more accessible would keep more people interested and feeling less burnt out. I still have much to do and learn in game so i'm hoping there is a reason for their choices or if it really is something that should be revamped.

As a fan of franchises like The Room and MYST, this was definitely something I figured would be up my alley. New World, but Victorian era Fae antics with 6 player co-op? Sure I'm down!\n\nBut good grief do the graphics hold this game back. I am certain everything you see in the trailers was pre-rendered in engine because my 3090 cannot break 25 FPS to save its life. Something is really wrong with the optimization because this thing runs like a flip book. Brace your eyes. Mining a rock? time to watch it jitter uncontrollably until the game finalizes its resting physics location. Fighting a wolf or boar? You're going to want to learn how to feel more than you watch for the timings because these things will rubber almost as bad as the police cars in DRIV3R. \n\nGameplay-wise as well this game has an uphill battle. The combat is the very definition of hit or miss; ultimately nothing feels satisfying when you do land a hit and when you miss it doesn't make much sense how or why. The first \"Abeyance\" I've completed felt remarkably empty and uninteresting, and the boss you have to beat didn't seem appropriately scaled to what little equipment you have access to. Sure, I geared up to score 20 lickity split through a few exploits I discovered early on, but that implies that the boss should be a moderate challenge when properly equipped, not a nightmare requiring cheese tactics. And this wouldn't be an issue except for that fact that better gear is gatekept behind plot progression. So either you just manage to get good enough or you cheese it with an NPC and some bad pathing. Doesn't help that the lair you fight it in is dark and the game's lighting doesn't offer much. If you were to ask me what the construct looks like with a gun to my head, I could vouch it has a purple core... and after that I'd being offering epitaph suggestions. \n\nI love the premise of getting strung along by Puck and making very thematically appropriate deals with a fairy denizen, I love the prospect of creating my own spectacular oasis in exoctic climes and places.

So many things lacking and potentially game breaking!\n\n* All enemies will hunt you to the ends of the earth. They do not stop chasing! They spawn so frequent you barely get a chance to just look around and admire the view.\n\n* Not to mention in multiplayer the first gate is broken at least it is for my friend and me. For example we got attacked by the wave that came out, however we both died. Upon returning, the gate doesn't activate, and the cards had to be reset and after replacing the cards; the gate would still not activate. We can not advance because of this. Even after my friend left the game, when I was playing by myself I could not open the portal either. I made multiple cards and none of which worked. the combination was a forest card and antiquarian card.\n\n* I hate the hot bar layout, where it is divided into half scroll wheel like the weapons and the other require numbers. \n12345 SCROLL WHEEL 67890 NUMBER PAD\n\n* I also dislike the dodge/block requirements in the game. For instance if you have a dagger you can dodge but if you have nothing you have to block, or if you have an axe you have to block or if you have basically anything two handed you have to block; but if you have a one handed you can dodge. JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A ONE HANDED WEAPON or you can't dodge, only block.\n\n* When building you can't dissemble already built buildings, so make sure what you are building is where you want it to be; otherwise you will be there destroying your own buildings. You can however dissemble blue print buildings. In my play through so far with my friend, our fire place got glitched inside and we had to destroy it and rebuild it. you can double click on the crafting blueprints to put down a 3D blue print that is nice.\n\n* I wish there was a way to Auto sort things in chests. If you want to split items the only way I know how is to drag while shift  clicking to your inventory.\n\n* Also when it came to the starting clothing I LOVED THEM, and was so sad when I could not even have them to wear anymore. Not a fan of the desert look but that is my own personal thing. just wish there was a way I could just wear the starter cloths still and have my armour underneath.\n\n* It would be nice to add some VA to the other NPC's in the game that you run across. I was just kind of disappointed where you have Puck with his great VA but then nothing with the others at the start but maybe there is more if I can just get past this portal. Gonna be restarting the game to find out if I can to be honest.\n\n* Kind of sad I can't seem to find or maybe it is not some where in the game menu; the HOPE  you collect with the letters would love to reread it aka the LORE!\n\n* I do have an issue with the very start of the game but this is my own personal issue. At the start of the game I had no idea I would die lol. Puck said go in the portal and I was like \"ok\" when I am done looking around and the music never changed or anything but [BAM] died LOL. I was like ok then xD. I guess usually you get some sort of something other than a hey get in the portal, with that voice being so chill I thought I was fine lol.\n\n* I tried to change my key binds to a run toggle but no matter what I did would not work. SOMTHING ELSE TO keep in mind that is broken on my end at least.\n\n* Having the game only be for connection is such a bummer YOU HAVE NO IDEA! I would love to be able to just, if the internet was out be able to continue in the fae wilds but that is such a game killer! hopefully this can be changed. Otherwise this is on me and I will never buy a game like this again! connection only feels really bad.\n\nso far that is what I have encountered in the game and I just know this game has a lot of potential but for me personally It is not done and needs a lot more cooking.

I'd like to address this briefly because the developer has already responded to this concern. They've announced their commitment to delivering an offline option as quickly as possible. You can read their statement here: https://playnightingale.com/news/offline-play .This proactive response within just two days of early access demonstrates their receptiveness to feedback and their dedication to resolving issues promptly.\n\nNow, onto my review, which will also include a couple of suggestions. I'm thoroughly enjoying the game and eagerly anticipate the improvements that will come during early access!\n\nTutorial: The tutorial is decent, although not exceptional. While it succeeds in teaching the basics, it could benefit from tweaks to enhance the overall experience. For instance, having Puck move with you while explaining concepts would be more engaging. His interesting dialogue could be better utilized if he led players to relevant locations rather than delivering information in one spot. Additionally, implementing a system where quest objectives are automatically checked off upon completion would streamline gameplay.\n\nCombat: I haven't played enough to form a definitive opinion, but the combat seems promising based on the limited encounters I've had.\n\nUmbrella Mechanics: The concept of how the umbrellas work is intriguing. Despite initial skepticism about the \"Mary Poppins\" aspect, using the umbrellas proved to be enjoyable and added depth to gameplay. The idea of them assisting players in various weather conditions and then floating around adds an innovative mechanic to the game.\n\nServer and Graphical Performance: I've experienced no server or graphical issues, which is a relief in 2024, considering many new games have been plagued by such problems, often due to unexpectedly high player counts.\n\nCharacter Creator: Personally, I'm not deeply invested in creating characters. Typically, I'll lightly craft a character resembling myself, then dive into the game. However, I must say there's certainly room for improvement with the current character creator. I'm honestly not the person to give advice when it comes to character but id probably start with the lineage part being described better so i understand that i will be using my parents likeness to craft my characters.\n\nPrice: At $35 for an early access game, it's honestly pretty standard these days. However, considering the potential of this game and my confidence in the studio to see it through, I personally consider it a steal of a deal.\n\nBuilding: I'm absolutely loving the crafting and building mechanics! Planning out the floor plan before construction and the smooth snapping of pieces are fantastic features. I'm eagerly anticipating the opportunity to construct even larger structures soon!\n\nIn summary, I genuinely enjoy the game and plan to continue playing it extensively. It's a great early access title, and I believe the developers are moving in the right direction, especially demonstrated by their responsiveness to offline mode.", "timestamp_created": 1708537214, "timestamp_updated": 1708644673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158877623": {"recommendationid": "158877623", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975413834", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 649, "last_played": 1709777542}, "language": "english", "review": "It sucks that this game is getting bad reviews due to people not reading the system requirements.

Whilst I haven't played much of it so far, I would say the game is just.. okay. I can see what the devs were going for and later down the line, I can see this being a really good game, providing it gets the love and support it needs, but in it's current state, as I said, it's just okay. \n\nSo, you might be asking, What are the pro's and cons of the game? Well, we will start with the pro's I guess..\n\n+ Beautiful design, The style of the game is actually the main thing that drew me in.\n+ Potential for the game is extremely high.\n+ The music is quite fitting and relaxing, I've just stood there and watched time pass, whilst listening to the music. It's so chill.\n\nYeah, sadly so far from my experience, that is where the pro's end and the con's begin.\n\n- Animations don't seem to be a thing when it comes to doors, again, another small thing.\n- Map sizes are really small, It takes a few minutes to get from one side to the other, at least from what I have seen so far. I was expecting to do a lot of exploring of vast expanses, But all I have been able to do is scale a somewhat small mountain.\n- No Biome diversity, I was kind of expecting loads of different biomes like snow, etc.. from what I can gather at the moment, we only have forest, swamp and desert? Also, why is it that we can't mix biomes? I would one day love to have an icy forest with a mountain region.. or a swamp with forest nearby.. \n- Online at all times? Really? As someone with not so stable internet, that's kind of a off putting factor for me. \n- There doesn't seem to be much separating it from other survival/craft games.. Even the realm travelling doesn't really capture me as it's just a loading screen, I could go back to ARK for kind of the same experience but much better time.\n- The UI is all over the place and quite a pain to find stuff, when it comes to building.. I enjoy that I can add stuff to the entire build but storage is a nightmare.\n\n\nI know that I haven't played much yet, and I do intend to play more with friends because maybe that's where this game shines, but so far its rather underwhelming sadly, I know that, as of writing this review, it's a day one release of early access, and everything is subject to change, but I don't think I can recommend this game just yet", "timestamp_created": 1708461077, "timestamp_updated": 1708553789, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543452560901641846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158832680": {"recommendationid": "158832680", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998249933", "num_games_owned": 493, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1708629065}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want keybindings buy a Steam Deck or wait for an early access game to add them.

From the moment you step into its beautifully crafted environments, you're greeted with stunning visuals and atmospheric music that immerse you in a captivating fantasy realm. However, beneath its picturesque surface lies a game still in its infancy, grappling with numerous shortcomings that prevent it from reaching its full potential.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues with Nightingale is its early stage of development, evident in the myriad of missing quality of life features. Players will find themselves yearning for basic conveniences that are standard in most modern games. The absence of these features disrupts the flow of gameplay and detracts from the overall experience.\n\nCombat in Nightingale feels clunky and unrefined, lacking the fluidity and responsiveness expected in action-oriented games. Engaging in battles often feels like a chore rather than an exhilarating experience, dampening the excitement of exploration and progression.\n\nThe building mode, touted as a cornerstone of the gameplay experience, falls disappointingly short of expectations. Its simplicity limits creativity and fails to offer the depth and complexity necessary to engage players for extended periods.\n\nCharacter animations are another area where Nightingale falters. Characters move stiffly and lack the lifelike fluidity that breathes personality and charm into their actions. Instead, they stand static, devoid of the soul and expression that would otherwise bring them to life.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Nightingale lacks essential features such as an offline mode and servers in all regions. Players from South America are forced to connect to North American servers, resulting in frustratingly high ping and subpar gameplay experiences.\nEDIT: They've added South America and Oceania servers a couple days after the early access was released. \n\nDespite its myriad flaws, Nightingale shows promise. There's ample room for improvement, and with dedicated effort from the development team, it has the potential to evolve into a truly exceptional game. As it stands, however, Nightingale falls short of its lofty ambitions, leaving players longing for the polish and refinement needed to fulfill its promise. If you're willing to overlook its current shortcomings and hopeful for future updates, Nightingale may yet prove to be a diamond in the rough.\n\nRating: 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1708640755, "timestamp_updated": 1709795766, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543307125568389893", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158939457": {"recommendationid": "158939457", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967618350", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1713729018}, "language": "english", "review": "Lag in a single-player game -> No.", "timestamp_created": 1708569286, "timestamp_updated": 1708569286, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543130993843078613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159022283": {"recommendationid": "159022283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089002649", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1168, "last_played": 1708656140}, "language": "english", "review": "Too many crafting stations.

The game can be fun with other people for sure! It is $40NZD. NOTE: The gameplay trailer shows no combat other then the player jumping at a tree with an axe.\n\nCombat feels..janky - Haven't tried the dodge system, didn't know there was one until I googled it?!? more info or more obvious combat keys need to be given on that one for sure. You run out of stamina(an essential thing) way to often in the middle of combat, with bosses and normal world creatures. Combat is a somewhat significant part of the game..so combat being so janky isn't good.\n\nStamina - I understand the game needs a stamina bar, and for the most part it sorta works. But i'm sure the beta testers would have noticed how the stamina bar isn't enough. The amount of time you spend standing around having to wait for it to rebuild and in the middle of being attacked is ridiculous(if it weren't for me and my sister playing multi wolves would have eaten her so dang much). It does detract from the over all gameplay and enjoyment gotten from the game. And it is most likely a large feature that would put people off. Not the fact that the stamina bar is there..but definitely the fact it isn't enough.\n\nWorld feels dead - This world is a fae realm, it shouldn't feel so dead. I understand the game story and I hope that they plan to add more animals.\n\nSingle vs Multiplayer - So I love multiplayer games, however i'd like the option to play single and in offline mode. I have seen that they are currently working on a single offline mode from what I was reading on their website. \n\nFinal thoughts - $40 is alot of money for an early access game. I love to build but combat is also a important feature in all games that allow combat. I find in this game it feels awkward and not well thought out. So far i've only done one boss but it felt disappointing. They either need to increase the amount of stamina you have or decrease the amount of stamina stuff uses...eg climbing.

After that period, there was literally nothing new. Realms keep being the same, just different level of difficulty. So u got 3 different bioms so far. each of them feel extreamly empty, hollow and lifeless.\n\nGrafics:\nThings like the umbrella and victorianien artstyle is somthing fresh and fun.\nIn general it seems to me like a lot of UE5 standard stuff, that could be created after watching a few Tutorials on YT. and it seems that there where 3 different dev-departments. one for chars, one for environment, one for stuff, and so far, they didn't manage to fit everything together in a fluid way. a lot of things seems always a way off and very very clunky and slow. Animations, interacting, KI ...really nothing special.\n\nWhen i compare it with Enshrouded (because also a new game and EA), it felt totally different to me. Enshrouded seemd everything out of one hand, no flaws, no clunkyness in terms of game flow.\n\nA big dissapointment are (in special) the characters. you start with a really detailed char designer. i had a lot of fun creating mine. and ingame everything is gone. your char looks like made of dough, most of the details are not gone or not shown.\nTextures missing depth and character. a lot of times the game seems like a low poly testrun without colours and structure, even on highest settings.\n\nYou get some kinda storyteller at your fingertips called Puck. THIS char i totally enjoyed! the voiceacting was insanly good and graphicaly I think it looks outstanding. But thats totally different from the rest of the game. like you would see a piece of gold in a pile of coal.\n\nUI:\nSeems the Devs never heared about how to do a proper fluent game menu.... cluttered, different artstyles, different fonts ....\n\nGame mechanics:\nI was very curious about that card-travelling mechanic. and i really liked it for the first 10 times. after that it is just tough and time consuming. because of the server related technic in the background, sometimes you have to wait liturally minutes until a portal opens up. so if u just want to go to a realm for a quest or some farming, most of that time you're kept waiting.\n\nall different improvements you could have in the game (minor cards, inffusion etc.) seemd not really benificial. yeah you could get a bit more farming, different colour schemas, more essences, more stats, but it felt like not missing much if i didn't use this stuff. improving your gear was okay.\n\nBuildingsystem:\nAgain nothing special, just boring stuff so far. Standard UE5 pieces, not much freedom, not much detail.\n\nQuesting, Puzzles, Challenges, Story:\nEven here... plain standard. There are a handful of Puzzels which are a nice change of pace, but just about 10 different ones, after that they did just copy & paste. I played on standard difficulty and nothing was any problem or tricky or somthing to really have to analyse or think about it. no challenges at all. on harder settings, no change, but npcs hit a bit harder.\n\nWill i keep playing?\nActually I don't know. there is absolutly NOTHING that makes me curious or pickes my interest for more. From the midgame on it's just boring farming and grinding and waiting, if u want to see other clothing, building pieces, gear.\n\nI am curious about coming patches and updates.\n\nWhat are my recommendations?\nWell for about 25-26 Bugs you get the some fun and content, as going to the movies for 2h and watching a mediocre movie...\n\nIf you that kinda type of player whose main thing is to build, go for Enshrouded (yeah not really a survival game), if you like the grind, go for Palworld. if you like a new setting go for Nightingale.\nAll of those games are Early Access right now, so don't expact a polished product.\n\nThanks for reading and have fun playing games you like :-)", "timestamp_created": 1708941429, "timestamp_updated": 1708941429, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539907872676849365", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159233987": {"recommendationid": "159233987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082288955", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1896, "last_played": 1709417236}, "language": "english", "review": "It is not often that I leave reviews on games, however on this occasion I thought that I would, given the amount of negative reviews I have seen on this.

Yeah I have no idea where that game is, because I've played almost 20 hours and that game is nowhere in sight. I'm still playing a generic survival game that doesn't have any of this \"Gaslamp Fantasy\" aesthetic. \n\nBasically, it starts out as a generic survival game, but there's some quests that guide you through the experience. Unfortunately, after 18 hours I'm still doing these god-awful quests. I can't progress and unlock the cool new gear, or buildings, or any of the fun stuff you see in the trailer until I go to Generic NPC # 27 and do some random nonsense that requires me to revisit a bunch of places I've already been. \n\nAnd what happens when I complete that quest? I unlock the ability to level up my gear score so that I can finally reach Generic NPC # 28, who will send me to another place I've already been so that I can finally be \"allowed\" to do the second tier of items, which can then be upgraded, which then artificially unlocks the zone that allows me to reach Generic NPC #29.\n\nWhen I say \"artificially,\" I mean the game WILL NOT LET YOU PROGRESS until you've checked the appropriate boxes. Imagine that you're playing Minecraft and you start with the ability to make wood tools, but the game won't let you make stone tools. Doesn't matter that you have the necessary materials, you just can't make stone tools... until you do favors for NPCs for 4 hours and then suddenly you can make those stone tools. Then once you have those stone tools, a barrier that prevents you from accessing the only cave that contains copper vanishes and you can finally mine copper, but before you can turn it into copper tools you need to spend another 4 hours doing NPC favors, then you unlock the recipe.\n\nThat's Nightingale, but for literally every aspect of the game.\n\nUpdate: You see how it says I've added an extra 8 hours since my initial review?

That's because the writing in this game is great but core gameplay is a letdown. In practice, I've spent 90% of my playtime time grinding stingy resources to overcome arbitrary progress gates; rather than fighting, exploring, talking to cool fey, or having fun.\n\nThe failure of this game's design is simple - when I find some cool new rock to smash and I get that lovely new unobtainium in my inventory.... NOTHING HAPPENS.\n\nNightingale's mechanics are not actually about discovery and exploration. They're about buying unlocks from the vendor to use that cool rock. Then grinding resources to craft the stuff. Then grinding essence to go back to the vendor to buy the next tool I need.\n\nThis means that, when I explore, I mostly find things I can't access or utilize. Its a perpetual train of disappointments. For, to enjoy these discoveries, I have to buy the right whatever from a vendor, farm the reagents, and craft whatever is needed. Repeat a lot just to get to the fun part of the game... which I've yet to find because I gave up after the 3rd loop to the vendor for like 5 more crafting tables.\n\nHow'd someone make getting a new crafting table feel like acquiring a second job? IDK but Nightingale achieved this.\n\nThe shoe is on the wrong foot here. Exploration requires supplies and risk, so it should have rewards. Picking up that new rock should open possibilities for me. Not just be some dead weight in my inventory and a \"come back to work in these mines later\" pin later on my map.\n\nThere's a lot of potential in this game from the writing to the story and the solid combat. Graphics are good. Animations are good too. Environmental considerations like water, sun, and cold are well-done touches on the survival genre. But the core design decisions here make me question if the devs known what fun is. Someone is too into crafting simulators and not enough into filching power from the realms of infinite imagination. \n\nWhich is why I don't recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1713103975, "timestamp_updated": 1713103999, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538662850856781006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158838740": {"recommendationid": "158838740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387583931", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1709785537}, "language": "english", "review": "People talking about this game in a bad light are delusional.

They hyped it as if it was going to be fully released and not Early Access, not complaining but a bit disappointed. IMO, it was overly hyped. That being said, as I was very excited for Nightingale, has it delivered? I can't say for sure, but to me I'm neutral about the game. Why? The screenshots and trailers make it out to be so much more than meets the eye. The things you see in the screenshots and trailer are to attract you; however, you will not see that type of gameplay for a LONG TIME. The grind would be so much better if there was more going on in between the game to make it more enjoyable.\n\nI'm 10 hours in and I feel like I haven't progressed at all, still chopping away with simple weapons & armor.\n\n[h1] TL;DR [/h1]\nNightingale is in horrible need of a QOL update and lacks a lot of BASIC mechanics with Building, Follower AI, storage, crafting, etc. You're going to spend a large amount of time grinding through a beautiful world with linear quests, and those quests are the only way to progress, instead of progressing freely like in most survival crafting games. I'd only recommend if you enjoy a huge, easy and long grind.\n\n[h1] EDIT [/h1]\nAlmost 20 hours in and I'm seeing some difficulty increase. This feels like an MMO, holy. At least I'm losing health and fights are starting to pick up. Enemy AI is still bad though. I ended up removing the AI follower since I don't need 'em anymore. I'm at gear score 87 and finally got to the point where item Tier is changing and higher level materials are useful. I was stuck for a very long time due to a progression quest that wants you to shoot animals in the heart (heartshot) and it took so long. I eventually went back to my realm after an hour of trying and got a heartshot on a boar and a wolf. I had to stealth to do it too. Very redundant quest. Anyway, I'll update as I go.\n\n[h1] Review [/h1]\nI have an open mind when it comes to Early Access. I haven't come across anything besides one crash and some minor lag spikes here and there. No issues with coop, servers, etc. Although, I really feel some of the things added within the game was not thoroughly created very well. For example, a lot of things are missing more (refer to Building and Follower AI). I also see almost everything shown about the game having third person, there's even a third person fov slider but yet no key-binding for third person.\n\n[h2] Major Complaint [/h2]\n\"Waiting for server\" takes forever between realm load times. Not sure why this game needs a game server when it's online coop, not an Online MMO.\nThe Quest System. As you know in most Survival Crafting games you have freedom to do what you will. In Nightingale the Questing is basically your progression. I want to be thrown into an open world survival crafting experience to do what I want, not what the quests want me to do when it comes to progression. I want to explore, unlock progression materials or items by myself -- not through a game's questing system. You have the freedom to do a lot, but you're limited on progression until you follow the questline. Big disappointment from me as I don't feel the freedom like I do in most open world survival crafting games.\n\nHUGE Bug when going to or from realms: I lost all of my items (not gear) when going through a portal to another realm. I lost a lot of time in progression because of this. Not sure how such an important feature like going to other realms has this major bug with losing items.\n\nRunning/Walking Simulator: You will be running a LOT. Realms aren't too big but they can become big when you're going from one POI to another.\n\n[h2] World [/h2]\nThe world is beautiful. Atmosphere is most definitely there. Gathering, chopping, crafting and mining is very satisfying.\n\n[h2] Difficulty [/h2]\nSo far I'm not seeing any challenge to the game. Enemies are easy and their behavior is very dumb.\n\n[h2] Building [/h2]\nVery basic. There's also no \"destroy\" button after placing an object down. Only thing good about building is the mass \"add resources\" to build everything at once.\n\n[h2] POIs and Events [/h2]\nEach POI is the same in every realm. Nothing really special except the chests. Honestly, it seems added as a filler to unlock certain things like POT PLANT or CANDLE for your house. They aren't too worth doing unless you think you're going to get a card from one.\n\n[h2] Combat & Enemies [/h2]\nCombat is pretty basic from what I've seen. Nothing that stands out. Hit enemy, block their attack, eliminate, done. There's quite a lot of different types of enemies, but they aren't all that hyped up to be anything majorly different. Early bosses and AI are underwhelming.\n\n[h2] Realms / Cards [/h2]\nYou can create realms, explore and do random POI events. I'm not seeing too many BIG things going to different realms. I'm only 10 hours in so I'm hoping I unlock newer things that spices up realms. \n\nCards seem cool. Some cards you can add buffs to realms to make something spawn more, etc. Neat idea.\n\n[h2] Item System [/h2]\nI'm not really understanding the item system. When you, for example, kill an animal and the fur has \"Maximum Stamina: +10%\" and to craft an item with it, it doesn't apply the stamina. I did it with fur that had Health and it actually worked, but it was only 3 HP so it wasn't at all worth it. I feel early game you skip literally trying to gear out how you want and just progress. I'm honestly not a fan of the different types of Tier items. The main issue with this system is you cannot combine two different furs to craft an item, when you need that item now -- have to go out and farm more.\n\n[h2] Stats, Food and Sleep [/h2]\nThe worst thing you're going to run into is Stamina issues right away. Lack of sleep or no appropriate food to keep your max stamina up. Food system is basically Valheim's food system. Eat certain foods they give you HP or Stamina. It becomes a nuisance after awhile having to constantly keep the food buffs going.\n\n[h2] Follower AI [/h2]\nThere's no way to change the behavior of your recruits or \"followers\". They'll chop trees everywhere for no reason so watch out if your base is surrounded by trees. They'll pick items up but it seems no limit to their encumberment. The only thing they're good for is to be bait when killing enemies or bosses. To be fair, they make it too easy because their AI is so dumb. If they go down it takes one click to revive them with full HP (which to me is very cheaty).\n\n[h2] Vendors [/h2]\nThere's vendors across the world so you can purchase upgrades from them. The main issue with the merchants is everything is too damn cheap. We're grinding hard in this game and I feel the merchants were added as a weird filler to have in the game.\n\n[h2] Crafting [/h2]\nCrafting is there. You don't unlock things fast so you normally look at the same stuff for awhile until you progress. I feel as if they could've handled managing everything better. Like, there's no quick buttons for adding fuel to anything, quick crafting, etc.\n\nThe thing I dislike the most is the storage doesn't show resources you can craft. You need the items in your inventory to craft them. This won't make much sense if you aren't at your base, but if I'm at my base at least show items I can craft with that's in storage.\n\n[h2] Armor, Buffs, etc [/h2]\nNot fully understanding this system. Infusion, armor enchantments/enhancements seems REALLY pointless in the early game. The stats are minimal from these items. I guess I'll wait til I'm at guns and stuff before writing more about this.\n\n[h2] Conclusion [/h2]\nOverly hyped. It's not a \"too early for Early Access\", it's right at \"if they gave it another year the game would probably be ready\". I /like/ the game, but I feel like I only enjoy it because I want to reach end-game so badly. The grind is ridiculous. Feels like I'm playing Project Zomboid or 7 days to die when it comes to grind, but I feel like I can progress in those games faster.", "timestamp_created": 1708581155, "timestamp_updated": 1708664494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538285970687866211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158895323": {"recommendationid": "158895323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102311202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 454, "last_played": 1708526913}, "language": "english", "review": "its hard to recommend this at this stage.

I hopped in and worked my way through the tutorial and some early game, but let me start at the beginning.\n\n1. The character creation (though still in early access version) is really cool. You can use a genealogy tree to create a grid of facial features to \"inherit\" characteristics from and then further tweak the player design. Some might say the faces are a bit weird, but I can't help but get a very nostalgic Fable (Lionhead Studios) vibe from it and I can't overstate how nice it is to see a character creation that \"feels different\" given the amount of copy-paste creators there are out there (Palworld anyone?). This already told me the folks at Inflexion want to stand out from the first minute you get in.\n\n2. Holy moly, creepy Fae contract feels in the tutorial. How cool is it I'm being riddle speaked by a Fae representative as I jump through gorgeous portal landscapes?! I usually hate tutorial sections, but this one totally caught me by surprise. I mean, yes, I was doing the usual \"and now we craft a knife\" but the way the game isn't holding my hand and my goodness the voice acting is Shakespearean intense! I did some googling and \"Puck\" (your Fae guardian) is voiced by Marc Warren from Johnathan Strange & Mr. Norrell who played the fae villain in that TV series (awesome show btw, if you haven't seen it, go do yourself a favour and watch it). Anyways, the narration for the tutorial is amazing, you'll know what I mean when you hear it.\n\nIn other respects, the tutorial also refreshingly doesn't treat you like a child. If you're well versed in survival games, it's nice to not feel like you're being baby-stepped through everything, there are clear \"todos\" and you can rapidly skip dialogue if you get bored with the progress rate. The enemies you get introduced to learn combat on are no slouch, but are still easy, you figure out the basic side step dodging and slashing mechanics and see a few different enemy movement patterns. The fact there are evil things that come out of the portals and attack you as you traverse is cool and keeps the tension up.\n\n3. Random worlds with actual locations of interest. This was seriously the main attraction even just in the tutorial areas. There are cool things to go explore and look at. You're going to want to climb on everything and make a torch pronto. The points of interest are a lot more than the usual \"Minecraft mod inserts a pre-made dungeon\" thing or a Valheim \"troll cave\". They feel way more organic, like a tower in the swamp with remnants of human inhabitants that once lived there, supplies and other items withering to the sands of time waiting for someone like you to come upon. The lore just seeps out of these locations and surrounding areas, I haven't felt this excited to explore since Valheim came out. Honestly, also, this game has Valheim beat in the \"prettiness\" category, this game is frigging gorgeous.\n\n4. NPCs and spawns interacting with the world. First thing I saw when I got into the desert was that a tree spriggan creature was walking around and it would make treant groans and plop out some sticks and branches onto the ground. The creatures were literally doing things to change the world. Later on, there is literally a forest spirit that goes full on Princess Mononoke and \"summons\" life out of the ground, bushes and other growth spawns as it travels around. How frigging cool is that for a terrain respawn mechanic?!\n\n5. Finding merchants to unlock new recipes. This is a neat mechanic where you trade essences you get while gathering, crafting, building that forces builders to get out and explore to find traders to unlock new blueprints. I like that this adds a bit of interaction and changes it up for builder focused players who can get caught up in the \"harvest and design\" grind. Good excuse to leave the camp and go try to unlock new things. Reminds me of trying to find the two dwarves in Valheim, but with more variety at play here.\n\n6. Ease of getting into the game and joining others. I know a lot of folks would prefer private servers and don't get me wrong, I'm a software engineer and have run more than my fair share of private game servers in my day, but I do really think that overall, Inflexion has made the right call here. For every full fledged private Minecraft server, there are countless \"on demand\" (Realms) servers made for instant play between \"Mom/Dad and the kids + friends\". It's seamless and gets you and friends together in a world quickly. That's no easy feat and props to Inflexion for having all that infra up from day 1 of early access. I'm sure there will be other modes in future, but for now, the fact it exists at all, to this level is impressive to say the least.\n\nEither way, I'm thoroughly enjoying my first few hours and I have to say, they really found a way to hook you into this game. The lore, the vibe, it all feels really unique and I'm getting that \"the devs really care a lot about this art piece of a project\" feel. It's the same way I felt when I jumped into Valheim or Baldur's Gate 3. There is just a feeling you get when you can tell the people making it really care.\n\nWay to go Inflexion, excited to see how this all pans out, I'm in.", "timestamp_created": 1708501205, "timestamp_updated": 1708501205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536784708499908447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158912353": {"recommendationid": "158912353", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984119806", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1708660577}, "language": "english", "review": "Maybe after it's been complete.\n\nGiant turn off that it's always online, you play on hosted servers controlled by Inflexion.

Also i have to add that i am not married to or related to a dev of this game in any way.\n\nFor starters i have to say that i am a Relic of a time where a game worth 30 bucks offered a campaign that lasted 25 hours and then just was over and the only thing you could do was to play it again. 10-15 years ago we considered this fine because 25 hours of entertainment were worth 30 bucks, when you go to the cinema you get 2 hours for 10 bucks and you would not complain about the value you get right there.\n\nToday's Generation views things a lot different, i unfortunetaly read too many steam reviews recently and too often came over the fact that people nowadays play videogames for 50+ hours and then give them a thumbs down complaining about systems that are not convenient enough, the amount of content being limited and the pace of the game being to slow/ not rewarding fast enough. I am not very conform with this Culture.\n\nFor Nightingale special i really wanted to address this, because somewhere inside of me i knew this is exactly the type of game i would enjoy right now, while the reviews held me from buying it on release day. \n\nAnd thats exactly the first point i will address: why do people bother to make a rant in a steam review of a game which is obviously not the type of game they are looking for/ enjoy playing as their comfort game if their opinion is not product of false expectations or even meant in a destructive rather than constructive way? \n\nAnd then there is those who repeatedly start their arguments by saying something like ,,i know that this is a early access, but\u00b4\u00b4, and then in the rest of the argument completely ignore the fact that this is a early access...? Again i sort this a similar way as the first point, this type of argumentation seems not to meet realistic expectations of the product nor being meant constructive and only constructive.\n\nFortunately i am here to tell you what type of game this is, so you can build an idea if this is for you or not, and summarize some of the usefull criticisms to give you a realistic expectation of the product in its current state.\n\nPlease when considering to play this game note the fact that this is graphically a very advanced game and you will need to have a decent PC to get a smooth performance out of it. That said the graphics of this Game are stunning and the different seeds that are generated through cards you combine freely are stunning as well. The only thing i would critic about its visual immersion right now is that the creatures filling this world often move a bit clunky or even stutter through the world breaking the immersion of your surroundings a decent bit, This is something the devs can improve in the future.\nStill the world and its immersion are beautiful.\n\nThis is a slow paced soft-core survival game centered around a crafting system with its strength being its complexity, while its weakness right now being its inconvenience in some points due to missing systems as well as a sometimes unhandy User Interface. Still the foundations of it being complex in a good way if you like and enjoy complex crafting systems.\nYou have to manage quiet a big amount of resources and different crafting recipes, this is something you need to be liking to be able to enjoy the fundamental part of Nightingale, i consider this a strength if you do so. \n\nIn its current state you have to open different menus sometimes a bit often too look after things you need to have in mind for one single recipe which can be addressed by the devs in upcoming patches to make the crafting experience a bit more convenient, as well as this game needs a system that draws items automaticly out of chests in the area from any crafting station for any recipe. I see these as the easier points to address for the devs in the future.\n\nThe amount of Content of this game is quiet surprising and a big pro for a game being in early access still testing its foundations. You come to the point where you build a portal into your base if you want so and freely explore worlds that are based on the cards you combine creating them, and there are a lot of combinations possible. You can sink a ton of hours of your lifetime in this game if you want so, on that front the 30 bucks pricing is easily justified.\n\nAll in all i can say if you like slow paced exploring and progressing through a game, this might be for you.\nIf you like complex crafting systems always taking you to read through a lot of stuff and hunting for specific resources then this might be for you.\nIf you are immersed by graphically stunning and and creative world building and enjoy even just walking around finding places that let you forget reality then this might just be for you.\nAnd if none of that describes the type of game you enjoy playing then why in the world would i recommend this to you? Well i cant answer that...\n\nYes, this is a early access and there are things the devs can improve on almost every front, but that does not make it a bad game in general, at this point i have to contradict the reviews picturing this as a disappointing product in general.\n\nHaving an average score of 6 on steam right now i dont feel like the product is in the position it deserves, considering the argumentation against the review culture i just submitted. Still this is subjective in many ways.\n\nI personally would give it a solid 7,5 out of 10, with the potential to climb to an even higher rating with small improvements on its Systems and UI, as well as through adding content in the future. \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1709625494, "timestamp_updated": 1709625494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535452306270599365", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159859746": {"recommendationid": "159859746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835972184", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5552, "last_played": 1709787434}, "language": "english", "review": "This game still needs work, but they state that when you open the game and they are wanting feedback to make it perfect.

Yes it is complex but it is a crafting game, ofc there is crafting\n- the game looks beautiful and the setting is just so different from others - in a good way. Many games in this genre are free or almost free of NPCs and you are the only living human in there. This world feels much more alive. You find people all over the world(s) which makes the setting more reliable\n- server structure in multiplayer is a great idea. Yes if you play in single player, it is annoying that you must be online and can experience lags but if you play in multiplayer you get your own server which is online by default so that your team mates are able to play when you are offline. Other games need a dedicated server which you have to pay for for this feature and here it's just a part of it - I really like that feature\n\nCon:\n- char movement: in general feels like you are a heavy bean sack. The char even stops while running when there is a tiny log on the ground and in worst case, you get a climbing animation on a tiny stairs step like stone on a path. Climbing and jumping is a pain and results in spaming your space bar, hoping to make it somehow. If you see a trap on the ground, you may be able to jump over it... well or not. It just doesn't feel natural at all but heavy and clanky.\n- crafting system: you almost (yes there is a handbook) get no guidance on how to craft or build something. Additionally you get no info about the building system or building menus. I had to check on their discord server that you are able to move items (press X and you are in the menu btw). This again feels clanky and not natural, for example items like wall lights have one spot in which they fit and you cannot move it on the wall. Plus we didn't figure out yet why there are walls missing when we return to our base... it is weird\n- item icons! There are so many icons missing and replaced with the same placeholder icon, even in early game. It is so annoying that you must hover over all those placeholder items to find the item you need for crafting and it is not just items, it is crafting stations too, which makes the already complex crafting system even more complex, in a bad way\n- handling items needs work as well. You can't split stacks in your inventory. That combined with a backpack-weight-system is annoying because if your inventory is overweight and you are outside exploring, you have to decide which full stack of items to get rid of.\n\nNeutral (for me a con but this is a personal pref):\n- puzzles are boring and all the same. There are puzzle cores which either initiate a fight or you got to touch several things in a specific order and there are some you just need to reach while climbing/ jumping which is ok but it is just nothing new after you did it like 10 times. \n- it is _not_ open world. You must have a specific gear score to enter areas in which you unlock new cards for new and or harder worlds to progress. This is bound to a story line and your gear. If you don't have the needed gear score, you just can't enter the building. You have to grind every time before you are allowed to progress which is fine but it should be my decision when I want to grind... like learning by how painful and strong the new enemies are\n- fights are boring, you have an attack and a block and that's it. If you use a knife, there is a weird jump as well which is unpredictable and therefore more dangerous than the thing you are fighting.

I've played it a fair amount. I enjoy it as well. The game is early access at the initial time of review.  The game is a PVE survival game, sort of open wold.  The game does require online play, so if you are stuck in a snowstorm and your Fiber optic ATT service is down, or your cable company internet is down, you just don't get to play. \r\n\r\nI play with my wife and daughter, and it was bought for that purpose, primarily. The game is visually good, though graphically a little bit taxing on the systems.  Audio seems to be good. Game play gets a little rougher.  Combat is okay, nothing has stood out as spectacularly good or bad for combat.\r\n\r\nCrafting system can be easy or complex depending on how min/max you are. That leaves going back to previously visited realms to gather resources, or to gather them as you go. If you go back to previously visited realms (note the game says you might not be able to go back when you leave, however, we have only been able to go back to the same realms we visited before, all of the realms seem to be instanced). If you gather them as you go you need to save them somewhere and that gets into the building system. You can only have 100 buildings, that isn't bad. Each building can only have 300 pieces. Every foundation, storage box, light, crafting bench and augmentation counts against that and you need different augmentations to be able to build different items.  I did not look it up for the review however, there are about 8-10 crafting and refining benches, and it looked like a number of them have 5 to 9 augmentation slots. so just for the crafting benches you are looking at  40-90 pieces just for crafting. It looks like you can't get all the augmentations onto a bench so you might be building multiple benches or playing whack-a-mole to move the right combinations of augmentations around to get things set up correctly and then move them around again for the next build.  The game is dark, so you are going to need 1-2 lights be foundation block size. Taking a reasonably sized 3x3 house so you can build a second story in the future if you want to, you are looking at a building with 9 foundations 9 ceiling tiles, 11 walls and 1 door.  30 pieces, plus crafting stations and augmentations and lights. add in storage and you'll easily get to 250 to 300 units for your structure.   Not a problem you are allowed 300, drawback, is the realm itself will only allow 350 units for the total realm. if we split them evenly we are looking at a central larger building that will have 200-300 units leaving each of us to build a house our of 50 units, maybe.  The building system needs to be fixed on that before I would recommend it for anyone other than a solo player.\r\n\r\nThere is a recruit NPC system, someone to help you. they can't help you with ranged combat, they can sort of help you with melee combat. They will attack the bad guys, often by jumping in front of your ranged attack, or melee swing preventing you from attacking the baddies. They will help you gather resources, like chopping down trees that will land on the structure you built or the Aid mission you need to complete.  If you are trying to gather resources and are weighed down, they will happily run away from you, leaving you to crawl at a snails pace while you try to catch up to their random movements.  Back to the Aid mission, they will take the high end materials that you are saving to build the better tools or weapons and give it away to other NPCs instead, or burn it for no extra benefit. Overall the best use of them is teleport into a realm, do the Aids and Defense missions, then recruit an npc, gather your resources now that they can't give them away, when you teleport back to your realm, ditch everything into chests and then dismiss them, so you don't have to deal with them again.\r\n\r\nI do want to recommend this game, I just can't yet. I think it needs a few updates to the NPCs and the structures limits system before I would recommend it to anyone interested in anything other than solo play, and you have to play online so why bother with solo play. I look forward to those updates, and hope I can change the review to reflect a more finished product.", "timestamp_created": 1712068926, "timestamp_updated": 1712068926, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534883737564086914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158882493": {"recommendationid": "158882493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148381693", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1708826222}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is decent, it has kept me engaged 15 hours in, however, it does have certain caveats that must be fixed in the future.

You go from no challenge and being able to use your combat skills to two shot deaths where you just have to circle pillars and no real readable complexity to the fight. I can't tell you how boring the robots are, they suck the combat sucks and they aren't interesting, but look forward to having them be your main bad guys for a while.\n3) Feels procedural: Yes the worlds are procedural generated but there are good ways to break up monotony by having crafted experiences. Maybe this gets better later but I didn't see anything that felt like compelling gameplay.\n4) locked off encounters: You run into a lot of locked off in your home world with no indicator on what will help you unlock them later.

I am writing to provide critical feedback on my experience with Nightingale. As an invested player who was genuinely excited about the prospect of exploring the Fae Realms, I find it necessary to highlight some significant issues that, in my opinion, hinder the game's potential.\n\nPoor Optimization:\nThe game currently suffers from severe optimization issues that impact overall performance. Frame rate drops, loading times, and stability concerns significantly hinder the immersive experience. Addressing these optimization issues should be a priority to ensure a smoother and more enjoyable gameplay experience for all players.\n\nCrafting System Concerns:\nThe crafting system in Nightingale is, unfortunately, far from intuitive. It comes across as overly complicated and convoluted, making the process of crafting items more frustrating than enjoyable. Simplifying and streamlining the crafting mechanics would enhance the overall player experience.\n\nOverly Grindy Gameplay:\nThe level of grind required to progress in Nightingale is excessive. It detracts from the enjoyment of exploration and adventure, turning the experience into a repetitive and monotonous task. Balancing the progression system to make it more rewarding and less time-consuming would greatly benefit player engagement.\n\nLimited Enemy Variety:\nThe repeated encounter with the same three enemies throughout the game diminishes the sense of excitement and challenge. Introducing a more diverse range of adversaries would not only keep the gameplay fresh but also add depth to the overall experience.\n\nI understand that game development is a complex and ongoing process, and I appreciate the effort that goes into creating a unique gaming experience. My intention is to provide constructive feedback to contribute to the game's improvement. I believe that with the necessary adjustments, Nightingale has the potential to become the captivating and immersive experience that was initially envisioned.\n\nI look forward to witnessing positive changes in future updates and appreciate your dedication to enhancing Nightingale.", "timestamp_created": 1709534087, "timestamp_updated": 1709534087, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534201920032501221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158855850": {"recommendationid": "158855850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803674141", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1709159245}, "language": "english", "review": "it's good so far.

I think Combat is interesting and on par or better than most other survival games.  I also like how the building/crafting system has traits and enhancements that really flush out those systems.  The realm cards are also really nice and a very unique system that seems well thought out.\n\nAll of that said this game is not very well put together.   Each system itself is fairly well designed but the glue that puts all these systems together is slapped together in a very rough manner.  The Realms are nicely generated but resource nodes are pasted on with \"Rocks\" being a specific shape and any other rock looking scenery is not a rock.   Due to this issue Rock is only a little more common than most Ore and Crystals and to get any amount of any resource that is not wood requires a lot of running around.  The lack of destructible and mine-able terrain really comes out and is a major backslide from games like Valheim and Enshourded.  \n\nThe 'tech tree' is mostly on a purchased bases.  With all the crafting focused around the types of resources this feels like it doesn't really fit.  I feel like the Valheim tree flow (find components and you can make it) would work better, though I think a research table version (like in Raft) would smooth this out nicly.  \n\nOn top of all these design choices this game has a heavy online requirement.   Even the Tutorial levels take time to communicate online to change realms.   There is almost no reason for this to be online (other than anti-cheat).  I could somewhat ignore the online problem if I though this game was solid in its design.  However without an offline option I worry this game will not make enough money long term and one day will be the next news article about an online game closing and leaving its fans abandoned.  \n\nThere is a lot to like about Nightingale but at this time I don't think the overall design is going in a direction that will bring these awesome systems in a cohesive game that will entice people to keep playing and if people don't play then the game will not gain enough money to stay open and anyone backing this game will likely end up with a dead game that will not be usable in a few years.  I hope some of these core issues will get addressed in EA.  However these seem to be core and not unfinished options.

The inventory system is annoying with the different tiers of the exact same items with the same pictures but different names and for some reason stats. The fact that you have a million different things that are essentially the same that you pile into numerous chest is annoying. maybe thats on me or maybe thats on the game not having an auto sort button. If there was a way to mark chests that you could just dump the same type of inventory into said chest that would make the game much more enjoyable. Could say the disorganization is on me, or the fact that I have 10 different kinds of Fibre that essentially do the same thing. I'm the farmer of my group in games but this is annoying. This game needs to stream line the items and cleanup everything. so lets say a desert fibre adds crit damage, forest adds stamina and swamp does wahetever. thats already 3 with the same picture. than in the map there are the basic versions. Like numerous crude tier 1 and numerous kinds of tier 2. its annoying and redundant.\n\nProgression system is not really there. Game needs a better player progression system all the way through. Example for quests you will see. It's like 'reach armor level 60' or whatever it says. When you get to that armor level it now says 'get a gloom card' like I'm supposed to know where and how. There are the red barriers I know in structures and thats where you get all that stuff but my God give a waypoint/location. Being non descriptive in a grinding game just homework on top of homework\n\nI got a portal open because of a quest that said to go to this region. I went in the portal when I was 30 and everything else was 70. It was rough but doable so I grinded my way through and got to 60 after exploring everything. But the next desert area that the game said to go via a quest is horrible. I was level 60 and all the mobs are 80. Only 20 levels above me but my God the difficulty spike. 40 levels was easier to deal with than 20. I have refined stuff and tailored Gear. The armor above simple because i dont know how to make more and the game doesnt tell you. It tells you that you should go to said portals but thats it. The game does not hold your hand which is fine but it doesnt have fluid progression. A lot of other games have fluid progression but with the portal system it overcomplicates and distracts.\n\nAnd you know how in these games, sometimes you get an item that augments a specific workbench? Well this one, being only about 30 hours of real playtime, i have like 20 different workbench augmentations that you have to build. You know where i built them? ALL piled up in one big Akira mass, in the middle of the room with all the different workbenches built around the pile of trash. It works but WAY TO MANY workbench augments. And some augments are attached to more than one thing so either build multiple augments for different dedicated workbench rooms and farm more OR make the akira nightmare monster like what i did.This game needs some serious streamlining on everything. I think they should just make augments for one workshop thing at a time with no overlap with other ones. Also reduce amount of augments in total and just make other augments unlock more things. \n\nGame should be called quantum leap: the grind for home. You are hoping the next portal gives you something you need in the area to make the next equipment upgrades so you can keep going. I know that is most games but a lot of other games do it significantly better. \n\nSo in the desert area, after chopping plants and easy mobs forever to get enough essence to buy something from the shop i bought a lvl 2 smelter thing. So with that upgraded smelter I unlocked the axe head and i was excited because i figured i would be able to take on the difficult spike area. So i make the axe heads.......and no what? what do I make the axe heads? I don't know and neither does the game. Hope you find out because the game doesnt tell you where to look to find teh recipes. Its like in an mmo where you have to find the recipe somewhere so you can learn how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\n\nGames needs an essence upgrader too so we can convert essence. It would be a quality of life change for the better. Btw my favorite survival games of recent years are valheim, the forest, grounded and v rising. If you like those games too than trust me on my opinion. \n\nI also don't want to look up streamlined guises because that is not fun to do but neither is this game. I wanted to like it, and I did for awhile. While grinding I put on some music, movie or someting else and do my thing. Once the novelty has worn off  in Nightingale and I see the game for what it i, its a bland game. Imagine if ESO was more generic and a survival craft game. Thats the best way i can describe it. I didn't even mention the always online but that is the smallest problem of the game. \n\nI hope they bring some quality of life changes to this game in the future but for now, stay far away from this early access game.", "timestamp_created": 1708975278, "timestamp_updated": 1709138196, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533494770526885986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159327626": {"recommendationid": "159327626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024629743", "num_games_owned": 1406, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1708654294}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel bad refunding it, and I'm looking forward to playing it again.

Combat is fairly standard in that you have damage types which are more or less effective based on your enemies. From hunting deer to chopping down living trees, there is a large spread of enemy variety. There is a hint of eldritch horror with many enemies as well which I hope they expand upon in the future.\n\nThe setting is quite unique. Historical figures like Bass Reeves and Nellie Blythe guide you through your travels of the fae realms. An apocalyptic event has severed the connection with Earth, and your mission is to find a way back. You'll use portals to teleport to new planes of existence, some of which are vibrantly beautiful. Each realm offering different challenges and resources for your character to collect.\n\nThis brings me to crafting, my personal favorite part of the game. While it currently has quite a bit of a work to be done regarding the UI and general ease of use, it is very deep. Each item is unlocked via a blueprint found or purchased from traders, and rather than being singular items, they are completely modular in stats and appearance. You can make a woodaxe out of trees and iron, or maybe you'd rather salvage the corpses of automatons and living trees. This changes both the appearance and statistics of the item. That depth applies not only to each piece of gear you use, but the clothes on your back, potions you drink, and food you eat.\n\nAn interesting story, solid gameplay, and in depth systems leads me to be quite excited about the future of this game. However, there is quite a bit of work to be done. There are confirmed issues of losing items, network instability, quests breaking, and over all general jank with the game. The main story is yet to be fully implemented, and it's unclear exactly how much is left to put in. If you're expecting a smooth and finished product, I don't recommend the game at the moment.

The customization, visual presentation and setting is 11 out of 10. I can't remember being this excited about a game in the first hours since... well, Baldur's Gate III. My heart and mind were blown the first night I spent maybe 6 hours straight in Nightingale, without sleeping, just being mind blown.\n\nNow, with this said -- after about 50 hours, this game is a rough gem. The potential is above great, but there are a lot of tough obstacles in the way.\n\nSetting and visuals - This is what this game does best. Everything from environments to creatures is just fantastic.\nSound design - Very, very good. The music is fantastic. The sound effects are impactful, eerie and beautiful.\nCombat - Stable and functional but basic. The weapons and tools (yes, tools are as viable as weapons for combat) have a good FEEL to them. Hitting something with a maul feels bombastic. Slashing a crit is fun. Dodging is impactful and fast. However, there's a lot here that oculd be improved. Better enemy AI, more weapon types and moves, more magick.\nStory - The main mission and storyline is, apart from the grinding, interesting and fun. Puck as a character is fantastic. Still, they could make mission points and info on what to do more clear. It starts out well, but eventually you will find yourself confused at certain stages. The other quests are lackluster. However, if they can pick up the other quests and NPC dialogues in the same voiced sense as Puck... then this could be great overall.\nCrafting - Great potential. Rewarding, but clunky. There are a lot of quality of life things that could be improved here - especially a more traditional crafting journey (instead of essence traders being vital, and certain soft locks in the loop). Still, being able to plan out your constructions in blueprints is neat, and the stuff you craft in themselves are fun, visually striking and nice overall. This - along with combat and quests - are what I think needs most attention in the next steps.\nWorlds: The realm system is creative and works really well so far. Being able to customize and change realms is fun and keeps things fresh. The realms themselves are GORGEOUS and full of... well, very interesting things that could be so much more.\n\nI feel this is one of the strongest launches in terms of what this game could be, in years. The world carries so much feels and settings, but it's still so early that after a certain amount of time you run out of content. The worlds are amazing at first, but in \"late game\" (30/40+ hrs or so I reckon) you start to see how empty many things are. A lack fo NPC:s, quests, a fully realized crafting system and basic combat keeps Nightingale from being truly, truly great.\n\nIt's on its way, hopefully. WIth polish and much more content, this could seriously be the new Skyrim. That's how strong I think the foundation is.

Yes, but it's early access. Just like Enshrouded is having the co-op issue of people progressing a server when others are not logged in, and then come back to find huge sections of the map unlocked, and have no idea what happened in the story progression and learning progression. Both are great games, both are early access, I own both, I enjoy both, both have their own issues to iron out. \n\nOne thing I like about Nightingalw is its procedurally generated realms, compared to a world that is pre-built and always the same.Pre built can be a good thing, as every part of the map has had attention paid to it during development, but proceduraly generated also eliminates the ability to Google or watch YouTube videos on how to find anything you want. So for those people playing on your server who just watch YouTube videos of how to obtain \"this\" or \"that\" and want to progress as fast as possible without actually working or figuring things out, this is where I enjoy the nightingale's replayability. Get both games, play both games, let the devs do their job and see how their early access pans out. It's definitely worth the money.  Make your own decision and don't miss out on a game because of other negative reviews. If you don't want an early access game, don't get either. Until then, have fun and enjoy the amount of work that has been put into the game. I find both games to be different from each other; I have a hard time calling Enshrouded a survival game when there is no need for food, sleep, water, etc. To me, it's more of an RPG like Diablo but in first person. Nightngale's weather, sleep, food, water all affect you, so to me it's more of a survival game. \n\n Be your own judge, don't be a sheep. Don't even follow what I say lol.

Moreover you need to create an account on Nightingale's website to report them, which sucks.

Then followers cuting the trees and breaking your buildings at the same time -_-\"\n-> Some tree trunks and trees become randomly invincible and can't be cut anymore. If that happens in the middle of your base, you are screwed.\n-> Escape key sometimes stop working. Then you need to either restart the game or manually click everytime you need to close a window in game\n-> Day/night change makes the world go full dark for a few seconds. And torch make the world less visible during night time than not using a torch :'(\n-> Some companions won't do anything. I had a guy who, from time to time helped me chop wood or do other task. Now I have a woman (I gave her the exact same tools), but she does nothing. She chopped ONE tree in 3 hours :'(\n\nQoL / Stupid game design:\n- Small trees give 2-4 wood, biggest trees take a long time to chop but only give 5-6 wood\n- Plant pots give back LESS plants what you sow... so you LOSE plants when farming\n- Can't build from containers\n- Can't move \"same kind of items\" into existing containers\n- Climbing mountains is awful (you slide on the slopes like in old games, instead of climbing like in Palworld and other games). Even with mountain picks, it sucks.\n- Can't upgrade walls/floors/etc., you need to break them and then create new ones\n- Umbrella allows you to fall slowly, but if you touch something while falling (such as a wall) it will deactivate your umbrella and you fall to your death\n- Need to spam \"E\" to grab sticks/fiber/etc., holding \"E\" only works for wood and stone\n- Maybe that exists, but I couldn't find grid snap while building. Also, impossible to rotate buildings only by a few degrees (for example, if you want to align your building with existing world structures).\n- Need to hover shrines and objectives on map to see if they were completed or not. Why not put the icons in red or something?\n- Can't see encumbrance on HUD without opening inventory\n- Enemies kill you while you read NPC dialogs... wtf. I had to quit an important dialog with no way to know what the NPC said, just to avoid dying.\n- ground gets through your floors (if the ground is not flat and you don't build high enough). Building foundations should prevent any ground texture from passing through\n- couldn't find how to put roofs and floors more than 2 tiles away from walls. So you end up with very small 4x4 or 5x4 building... Why not use a system such as Valheim?\n- Using offhand tools is a pain in the ass. Make it possible to either shift+scroll to choose right hand tools and/or double tap the key to quick use.\n- skinning doesn't always work in 3rd person. You just stab your knife in the corpse and no skinning happens. You need to try a few time before it actually \"hits\" the corpse and not air.\n- No leveling / no skill tree / no way to clearly see what you unlock (please, again, take note of what other games such as Palworld and Enshrouded do)\n- Lots of other questionnable game design decision.\n\nBasically, the game had a great idea, a great art team, but they probably had no more money and used a poor intern for the game design itself.", "timestamp_created": 1708986695, "timestamp_updated": 1708986695, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529780566692352295", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158897283": {"recommendationid": "158897283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039495575", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1708528780}, "language": "english", "review": "Apart from beeing unplayable \"waiting for server\" part, that will probably get fixed, there are things that will probably not:\nthe character in 3rd person moves and behaves sluggishly, jumping is worse, combat in 3rd person is BAD.

The game trailers looked more promising than the actual game itself. However, this game is still early access so by no means does this review solidify anything until it is fully released. I may change my opinion after but that depends.\nSo really this game atm just weighs out in pros and cons so\u2026\n\nPros:\n\nThe game is beautiful. The graphics looked pretty solid and the realms were very detailed even down to the very sound of the environment. Honestly that transition from day to night is outstanding; the night sky is beautifully surreal. The swamp area was swampy: you could hear the mosquitoes and you could feel the stickiness of the muddy waters. The forest was relaxing: you could hear the wisps of the trees and really embrace nature especially when you\u2019re surrounded by soothing bodies of water. The desert was dry and unforgiving. I could feel the draining heat of the hot sun and the sands were it\u2019s only ocean with the actual oasis being the only form of relief. You can definitely see the life between the trees and water vs. how dead and empty the desert really was.\n\nI appreciate that the only thing your character needs to worry about in terms of survival is sleep and hunger. Which can easily be done. \n\nBuilding was easy, hunting was easy and even farming for stuff was pretty easy. \nTo me it was a relaxing game and if I wanted more of a challenge, I was allowed to change the difficulty upon opening a portal to get to a different realm.\n\nThe character design as far as the enemies go were pretty good. The creatures that would spawn were terrifying especially at night. They kind of gave a silent hill vibe (I\u2019m thinking pyramid head and the undead/warped nurses).\n\nBoss challenges were pretty difficult, as it should be, and for the most part their mechanics were pretty simple to learn.\n\nI didn\u2019t mind the grind for building materials or other items. \n\nI enjoyed reading all the lore that I got to find throughout doing the runs to farm. You also get to find recipes to craft new materials doing so.\n\nThe main story was interesting and the concept was definitely there.\n\nI also really like that you can have some buddies to play in your realm. It makes farming and combat much smoother to navigate.\n\nCons:\n\nAlthough I do enjoy a chance to create my own character in detail, I feel like the character design was just not it for me. I\u2019ve never seen anything more embarrassing lmao. When it comes to create your own character I am a definition of snob. I appreciate you can choose your own face, skin, hair and control how and where you place things (eyes, nose,etc) but overall it just made my character look really weird. The hair design was so unsatisfying. I hated it. It could be because I was so spoiled being super detailed like in Baulder\u2019s gate or Wild Hearts\u2026hell in the Sims but I guess this isn\u2019t those type of games. So really I feel like character customization was so unnecessary. There are no cut scenes to even see your design. This whole game is in first person by default. The only time you can see your character is when you set it to third person or when you get into your inventory but even then the details in the design look distorted. \n\nThe story itself seemed a little hard to grasp at first if you\u2019re not actually reading anything.\n\nThe whole portal system was so confusing to me at first. At some point I wasn\u2019t sure how to get back to my original base. I thought wherever you place a respite in whatever realm you go to, you can fast travel by selecting it in the map but instead it takes you back where the game first starts you. The frustration to get back to the point where you wanted to be\u2026jfc. \n\nIn general I didn\u2019t like the travel concept. Opening a portal took 10 years to load and imagine having to go back in forth between realms..\nI wish there was fast travel within each realm site at least from mid map to main portal. I get that the point of no fast travel is to get the player to explore but a lot of exploration was met by empty space and rewards in random spots were pretty unsatisfactory.\n\nPuzzles and occupation sites were pretty repetitive and nothing really changed other than the puzzles seemingly being a little longer but again repetitive. \n\nBuilding/crafting\u2026I don\u2019t even know where to start. I LOVE building. I love having the free range to do whatever I want. This game just barely made that exceptional. There are certain things I can\u2019t do to build and overall had me have to redesign how I wanted it to be. Like walls and stairs were a hot mess to connect sometimes. Crafting was just annoying. I guess I can admit that I was spoiled from previously playing palworld and creating a base allowed me to use all my items without having to actually have said items in my inventory. So i know I\u2019ve read that it\u2019s a possibility to introduce that but man is it a pain at this moment. \n\nI hate that I can\u2019t even organize my chest inventory in a certain order. It just places the item in whatever spot is available. Same goes for my character inventory or whatever is in my backpack, I can't organize it a certain way that I want. I have OCD about that kind of stuff. Nothing has made my brain more itchy than that lol.\n\nCombat was so clunky. It felt so chaotic and inaccurate. I could be right in front of an enemy and I would still miss a hit or a shot. The magic definitely helps with crowd control but when you\u2019re first starting, it\u2019s honestly a nightmare.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain point in the game where you get to play with other players online and although it\u2019s easier to go through portal runs and boss fights, it\u2019s still pretty bizarre that there is absolutely no way to communicate with them. Not even a chat bar to let anyone know where to go or what needs to be done. I literally had to do a crouch motion to thank a person for helping me get back up and staying with me after being taken down and breaking a limb lmao (thank you Cara99 or whoever you are!)\n\nOverall I think this game had a good concept and I appreciate the design of it all. There\u2019s just a few things I wish I could change. The server lag is frustrating but I do enjoy playing with friends. Survival crafting has always been one of my favorite types of games and for the most part this game did it\u2019s thing. However, at this moment I don\u2019t think this game is ready to be played thoroughly and I don\u2019t recommend it. I\u2019d definitely wait until it is fully released and updated.

No purpose at all. My husband and I have played for just shy of 30 hours and I can safely say- The characters are flat and uninteresting: No real story or purpose other than to give you fetch quests or grind material for them.  The combat is a joke: you can stand in the middle of a mob of monsters and swing a lumber ax around and be just fine. The realms are all the same: Each feel empty and meaningless. going to another version of a biome slightly changes the color scheme and there maybe a new monster if your lucky. 3ish monsters per realm and the reoccurring main bad guys in the dungeons which are also the same. Every dungeon is the same: no point in doing them other than to grind essences which is money to buy recipes. some of them have a bit of a Mario element but the movement is not precise or fluid enough to aim or jump correctly. The ONLY thing that was kind of neat about this game was the crafting system.

It's beautiful, and building works relatively well, if a bit bland and ugly. I haven't had the estate reset, nor the disconnects, so I count myself as lucky so far. My biggest gripe is the crafting system. Out of all crafting systems I have encountered, this one makes the least sense. The over use of augments for crafting stations (more than 40, I think), the limit on the number of augments that you can have per station, and then a building/object limit makes no sense. I get a building limit. It helps keep shards smaller, BUT, when you need multiple of each crafting station in order to get all the benefits (items are locked based on the available augments), then something is not right.\n\nMy advice to any dev that reads this: dump the augment system in favor of upgrading crafting stations instead. Simplify the absolute mess of a crafting system. \n\nAnother thing is that realms, puzzles, map locations start to look the same.

The ability to open a portal to a map you cook up yourself is both interesting and a huge QoL improvement over crawling an entire planet. Further, the roads it leaves open for the devs to expand the system will allow them to keep growing the game organically for as long as we keep playing it. The game has a great vibe, and the pure adventure feel might even transcend Valheim because there are so many things to *find* in the world. The sound is ok, the graphics are pretty good, but more than anything, the world and the game's concept are, for me anyway, enough to hold my interest through the Early Access issues.\n\nWhat's not so great at the moment are combat, movement, and the ui. Combat is better than enshrouded but not as good as Valheim. Movement is almost fine, it's just a bit clunky and floaty and there is no proper roll maneuver. The UI and the build UI could use some more love. The lack of any sort of skill system, be it a live skill system or some sort of tree, is a very noticeable void. The servers aren't super stable for a permanently online game, but it's more annoying than problematic. A few crashes over several hours and you log in where the crash happened. \n\nThere are rough spots to be sure, and Nightingale's success will depend on the devs ability to juggle adding new stuff with improving existing issues.

For any survival or fantasy fan, this title is a must have, even at this stage. For my almost 30h playthrough I didn't encounter any gamebreaking bugs, so it's really not bad. That said, servers still need some work to speed up the loadings between realms.\n\nSo on to the game review.\n\nYou have survival aspects like hunger, sleep, weather conditions that actually have a meaning, temperature and building small cities. You have magic, you have guns and a whole lot of melee weapons from small knifes to katanas, spears or huge axes. Is it all? Of course not ... this game features something I didn't see anywhere else - a realm mechanic, or you could say parallel dimension system that is generated randomly. Your first realm, when you start up is your home realm, after that you will traverse through various worlds, looking for a way home, to Earth. All this, while gathering resources, fighting for survival and meeting new people.\n\nI could even name this game Skyrim 2024, because the combat mechanics and the whole fantasy world are very similar (just the combination of those aspects, the universe is of course totally different). So, do I recommend it? Yes, but only if you have a modern, medium class PC ... the optimization still needs a lot of work and on my 4k screen with 3080, 64GB of ram and a bit older CPU it can hiccup here and there. It's not bad, but it's not perfect either.\n\nIt's an early access game, yes, it still needs a lot of work like optimization, combat rebalancing (maybe total overhaul of combat mechanics). But for this kind of money, it's a steal. Plus side of this is the fact that the dev team consists of people who made Bioshock and it's really showing, the backround is very similar AND I LOVE IT!\n\n[b]\nScores:\nGraphics - 10/10\nSound - 8/10\nGameplay - 10/10 (aside combat mechanic)\nCombat mechanics - 6/10\nOverall - 8/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1708861949, "timestamp_updated": 1708861996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527621567249298096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159074719": {"recommendationid": "159074719", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983105642", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1016, "last_played": 1712166306}, "language": "english", "review": "Wait a year and come back to check on this one. Currently its a rough mess of ideas that are barely implemented. The combat is really terrible because creatures aren't where they look like they are meaning you will swing right through them only to have them attack you from behind or to the side where they were actually standing. Combat is also so basic it just attack, move to the left, attack, repeat forever. Its online nature makes disconnects nearly constant. Portal can literally take 10 minutes to open (I know this because I threw some chicken nuggets in the oven for 10 minutes just after clicking reopen portal, and they finished before the portal opened). Followers have nightmare levels of AI, don't actually follow you, teleport into walls, or inaccessible areas, and die in places they cannot be revived. \n\nI don't want to say its all bad because its not. It has a really robust crafting system, and the realm hopping to find specific resources is a great idea. But for now its just a good foundation for what COULD be a great game.

Combat is sluggish and blocking doesn\u2019t function well due to server spikes so enemies pierce right through hit boxes. You will have multiple enemies spawn from thin air at night and drop frames to a crawl. This just leads to multiple instant death situations while just walking 2 meters from your house. The poor stability also causes piles of bugs, including freezing to death in the build menu even with a torch out, because it will not register a heat source or anything around the player while the menu is up.

The game has a good foundation, but there are a lot of things that missing ( Yes I know it is early access).

A skill system  for the character to complement the gear climb, Standard controls for the Companion, Follow/Wait/Attack etc. Also it might be a good thing to set up a better Companion control when it comes to house tasks or gathering. and it would be nice to set  with material they are gathering, lumber/wood being one, where they will go around and make sure all the fires are lit, down side, they will burn through wood bundles when one wood has been used for the fires. It would be nice to down the line see anything that uses fuel for any crafting (campfires, forges, etc) that when done making the item, they should shut off the flame, to help with conservation of materials that has been gathered. this one is a big ask, ( because it's a great QOL) but a way for work stations that are close enough to a chest, to pull from the chest.

(Damage types between axe / pickax / maul / ranged)\n- Night time is aids, but cool.\n- Difficulty actually matters in the game, Easy is run around and solve puzzles one shotting everything, extreme is suffer alone and die any time a mob hits you \nExtreme is Built for groups.\nEasy is Solo play.\n(I Played on Extreme for 24 hours, and 21 hours of hard - Hard is perfect for solo play, anything under and its too easy.)\n\nIcons for materials / goods.\nThis has to be a joke from the devs. Your going to have a bunch of items/buildables that have icons and a bunch that just don't. Sulfur and Coal don't have icons outside of a generic N icon. Gunpowder has an icon but the items to make it doesn't? \nTo add on to this note - Too many icons are shared between items.\nFor example - Hide is split into two categories. Predator / Prey. \n- These icons are shared. So its the same tuft of fur. \n- There is also Tiers to this lovely system. so predator goes into T1 to T3. That's 6 items all sharing the same icon.\n- This extrapolates on itself the moment you bring in meat, bones, plant fiber, and other drops. \n\nThen there is the named mobs - They drop unique tiers of the same crap, but the difference between predator T2 hide and the special predator hide a little crown on the icon. Stat wise? Almost no difference. .5% resistance between the two parts is a joke.\nStats on these crafting materials is a mess. Predator gear is health based and prey is stamina based - That's fine and gives you something to understand. But bloats crafting due to all these little augments that are needed on your bench as-well. More small clutter around your building makes it look lived in sure, but build mode only lets you place 300 items. Each bench can only have X amount of modifiers. Lights to make crafting faster, a hat rack so you can craft a specific hat, a coat rack to make a coat, it gets cluttered quick.\nYou now have incorporated micromanaging augments for your crafting system. Hurrah!\nNot to mention the not being able to pull from local storage does really hurt. \n\nNo animation for opening doors. Its either open or closed. and when you hit it to open it, its suddenly the other state. Pretty jarring experience.\n\nAI will attack mobs that hit you, that's fine. However their weapon will damage your building. So if you have a shelf with all your crafting augments on it as they have short range, and you are afk and a wolf runs in and hits you, your ai follower may break that shelf with everything on it. They may even break a foundation and really rip stuff up.\n\n- Follower AI - This is something that people are overlooking. As more people get on the servers, ai goes from being useful to just standing in place and swinging their weapon in place and missing everything. They also have unlimited weight, so you can dump whatever you want on them if its too heavy, its just limited by space. BUT WAIT. There's these little aid quests that pop up where you need to build on a building for an NPC to hire them as a recruit. You can only have one. So if your companion has a bunch of your wood and there's a wooden house that needs to be built, suddenly your wood goes into this building that cant be taken apart. The last 20 mins you just spent farming? Gone.\n\n- AI Cant use long range, is stuck swinging tools as weapons because there are no other melee weapons. Maul is useless against any kind of wild animal that has skin.\n\n- Debuffs. Not having an explanation on these or even having nothing to show up when you get one outside of a little red indicator that ticks down, you cant do anything to clear them short of dying. Only way you CAN get a description - Open inventory and hover mouse over it. Two debuffs that sucked the most was broken arm and broken leg.\n- Broken arm - you cant block and lose out on damage in melee.\n- Broken leg - Cant evade or jump.\n\n- Sleep - Cant swing a weapon/tool when your character is tired. The moment you hit 25-30% or so on the sleep bar, your stamina hits down to 1-8 so you cant run anymore and need to put down a bed to rest. You will need plant fiber and sticks with you all the time. 6/6. Thankfully when you deconstruct you can pickup your materials again. Just plop it down, hit e a few times and your fully rested. there's no animation here, so long as you have it plopped down on a rock, your good! Oh wait, there's another problem. \nIf its night time, mobs will spawn on you constantly, which will prevent you from sleeping. So either you take the death or you try and run with very little stamina in hopes you can slap your little roll out and get some rest in so you can kill the mobs.\n\n- Picking up your stuff after you die. This shouldn't even be an issue. yet it is. Because you open the whole inventory and you have to hit move to inventory. Should just be hold e -> loot. Instead current system you stand there and hope what killed you doesn't hit you again while your trying to find that button.\n\n- In their defense on the storage is a system they are supposedly working on, however, if its not in the first or second major patch, expect it not to come. \n\nMe and my sister got tired of the same three biomes, same copy pasted puzzles in each one. Maybe one new enemy type as we progressed into the harder difficulties, which was cool to see, but got bland quick.\n\nTo give an example as to how little faith I have in this company, and I'm glad to be proven wrong at a later date - \nMultiplayer - When inviting someone to your realm. The accept button is on the right. Not the left. Its common sense to place it on the left. Why is deny on the left?\n\nI've seen alot of empty promises from other companies, and this is one that seems loaded with excuses, especially when acknowledging it always being online. I don't know how they couldn't see the same exact issue with H1Z1 survivors and expect it not to meet the same backlash.\n\nAs someone who's been in a lot of EA titles, including on the development side, some of this is fine. I can excuse some stuff, but there are glaring issues that should not have cleared internal QA, like the placement of buttons on UI, or the lack of icons both are stupidly simple to correct and would have taken little less than a common work day to correct and get right. Missing a few icons is fine, missing half of your game as icons is not. Instead they overlooked it and shipped it on out. My hope that this company isn't acting out of malice is pretty much shot at this point.\n\nI will not recommend this as there's too little your getting back for what they are asking price wise.\nGame itself - 5/10.

If you enjoy survival crafting like Conan Exiles, this'll be right up your alley.\n\nIt isn't perfect, but has been incredibly good for just launching in early access.  I have had minimal crashes and the core gameplay loop is fun and engaging.  Definitely needs QoL improvements and balancing.\n\nThere is a main story quest to follow, but outside of those objectives, the core gameplay loop is:\n\n1.  Open a portal to a new realm.  This is done by combining 2 tarot cards and picking a difficulty.  Usually you'll either be target farming some sort of resource or going somewhere for a quest.\n\n2.  Once inside the realm, you are free to run around doing whatever, but each realm has a fae tower.  This is the common open world mechanic of climbing the tower to reveal points of interests (POIs), etc.  So optimal gameplay is gunning it straight for that tower.  The towers themselves are composed of several points of interest and are great sources of the game's main currency, essence.\n\n3.  You then run from POI to POI completing them.  These range from pattern-copying simon-says puzzles, hidden object game, building structures, and platforming to a few types of combat encounters.  These POIs make up a good chunk of the gameplay loop and are the main source of the main currency, essence.  They are really going to need to polish and expand these.  Currently, some are quite tedious and either need better rewards for the amount of time they need (aid POI, lookin at you) or need to be less time consuming.  I just skip the ones I don't feel like doing because you can always make a new realm.\n\n4.  While running from POI to POI, you will come across the various resources scattered around as well as wildlife, monsters, etc.  This is when most of the gathering occurs for me.  Fairly standard chopping trees, hitting rocks.  The wildlife and wandering monsters generally aren't much of a challenge.  There are named animals/monsters you can hunt (and they appear on your map), but they also aren't much of a challenge.\n\n5.  Return to your home realm and do all your base stuff.  Sorting inventory, crafting, etc.  This aspect def needs some QoL improvements.  I spend a lot of time putting stuff away when I get home, it is very time consuming, increasing the time between realm runs.  I would love to see something like a \"move items to stack\" button.  Terraria has a \"move items to stack in any chest near you\" button that absolutely ruined other survival games for me.  Every game with box based inventory management needs this.  Farming is also pretty lackluster right now (i believe I read it is not working as intended currently).\n\nOutside of this core gameplay loop, you eventually unlock dungeons.  These are usually 3 POIs in a trenchcoat with a boss at the end.  They're fine.  You can also randomly encounter a portal to one of these dungeons as a POI, but I haven't encountered one of these as a POI with a boss at the end (that would be cool, though).\n\nProgression is based strongly on recipe unlocks.  You unlock recipes by buying them with essence from vendors called essence traders.  Each combination of tarot cards has their own set of recipes that have a chance to appear on these vendors.  You also unlock these recipes as rewards for completing POIs.", "timestamp_created": 1709573192, "timestamp_updated": 1709584438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526627242565155029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158831951": {"recommendationid": "158831951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003998162", "num_games_owned": 529, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 148, "last_played": 1709165041}, "language": "english", "review": "WARNING : This game is in \"early access\", apparently, this needs to be stated : you might encounter unfinished content, bugs and other problems.\nThis said, nightingale is a nice survival craft, with the twist of having a nice system of worlds accessed through portals, allowing you to visit different places with modifiers determined by the cards you played when creating it.

First of all, I want to write that the game is playable, it has some bugs, it's clearly in Early Access and it's a work in progress, but if you really want to test something new, you can buy it and if none of the major problems put you off, you'll definitely manage and enjoy yourself, but that's a truism (if you grit your teeth, you'll succeed).\n\n[h2]Therefore, at this moment, I do not recommend purchasing if you're counting on a full experience game.[/h2]\n\nNow, I'll describe the biggest problem, which is the grind. Bugs can be understood because they are surely being fixed in EA. Elements that are work in progress are also understandable, but the grind is dumb:\n- T0, T1, T2, T3 essence tiers make no sense. They could as well combine them together, eventually instead of grinding T0 essence you grind higher tier essences and extract them to T0. But you cannot change T0 -> T1/T2/etc. And to upgrade items to T3 you need first to upgrade them to T1, then to T2, then to T3 so you will need to backtrack and grind again lower tier essences (T1 and T2). \n- The T0 essence grind is simply stupid. you mindlessly gather everything around (spamming E) and extract it. Then you can extract higher tier essences (maybe not T1 because it's not worth much and probably better to do T0 grind) and you get more of them at higher difficulties and from dungeons, but you still don't want to lose too many of them because then you'll have to go back and farm more T1 and T2 essences again. Only at T3 the extraction ratio so high that it's no longer a problem.\n- The T2 gear level doesn't make any sense at all. T1 allows you to unlock dungeons (you need a certain amount of power to enter them) unlocking basic cards and allowing you to collect tiered (T1) materials. T2 theoretically allows you to further upgrade gear, but you feel like you're playing PoE or Diablo 4 and about to unlock the highest tier of maps and items, so you don't want to waste T2 essences, especially since you need them to upgrade items to T3. I completely skipped it except for upgrading the backpack.\n- Similarly, the game allows you to create T1, T2, and T3 infuses , but it's never worth it to do T1 or T2 because it's a waste, and T3 gives better bonuses anyway. I only used them to quickly make 230 power tools, but now I know it would have been better to finish quests, and with resources from public bosses, I could easily make better items (better schematics and better materials from public Apex Vaults bosses) later, and I needed to replace them at that point anyway\n- The wood farming is the worst early game base material grind. So, trees are divided into chunks, and each chunk has HP. To cut a tree, you need to deal the chunk the appropriate damage. And in the early game, it's a tragedy because you hit it several times to get only few pieces of wood while you need hundreds. Since you unlock T3 essences and gear upgrades to T3, you can easily craft axes or pickaxes dealing 1-2k damage per hit and destory ore/wood in one hit. It's completely dumb to make it difficult until then.\n- In the mid game, you can learn some special enchant spell, which allows you to destroy ore or wood in one hit without the necessary damage. This helps with ore farming. However, it doesn't work on trees because each tree has hundreds if not thousands of chunks, and casting the spell (attacking a tree with that spell casted) causes lag as you destroy every chunk... Even if you have an endgame axe and destroy a tree in one hit, you can't just run and hit multiple trees along the way because the calculations of damage (single chunk per tree) and multiple falling trees also cause lag. But still, it's somehow bearable at that point.\n- I guess the most basic mistake is the conversion ratio in crafting, like 2 -> 1 (or 3:1, etc.). The most ridiculous example is with Animal Fibers, where you can create fiber from animal meat, because meat has different modifiers than plant fibers, and even if the conversion were 1:1, it would take much longer to gather the meat than gathering plant fiber in the same amount. And with a 2:1 conversion, the grind is enormous. In such cases, I feel like none of the developers ever played through the full gameplay because this is the most obvious and basic conclusion in such situations.\n- In general, this conversion is a problem. Another moment where it stands out strongly is with buildings (walls, floors, roofs, etc.). I don't understand why the developers made building so much more difficult, especially using these bad conversion rates, because so many things there are needed only for construction, like bricks, beams. And yet they decided to increase the grind so much and make it annoying for players. Similarly, I don't understand why the best building blueprints are locked in Ascended Realms. They could move them to T2, at least there would be something to do.\n\n[h3]If I were to start playing again with a new character, I would speedrun the game from T1 to T3, as these are the only significant moments of the gameplay. T1 unlocks tiered resources and dungeons, while T3 unlocks proper gameplay.\n\nAnd it's not about having to invest time into something. In games like PoE, I play on SSF, so I put in extra time to obtain many things. In games like Tarkov or Dark and Darker, I dream about SSF. It's just about avoiding meaningless grind.[/h3]", "timestamp_created": 1709889277, "timestamp_updated": 1709889277, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526445269584655762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158865253": {"recommendationid": "158865253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048484074", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1709841886}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't know about Nightingale until a couple of weeks ago.

I also find that our narrative companion Puck is well thought out with a voice that resembles that old guy from back in the 90s narrating fairy tale episodes of that tv show I can't remember.... anyways :D\n\nThe style is very unique, and the idea that you can shape your encounters has been taken a step further than what others have previously done.\n\nIronically, this being an Early access game, it completely shames Starfield by lifting the Early Access level up to their height.\n\nI have no doubt that I will be spending a lot of time in this game while waiting for Light No Fire!", "timestamp_created": 1708491549, "timestamp_updated": 1708491549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526445269584655762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159217401": {"recommendationid": "159217401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214692063", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1115, "playtime_at_review": 927, "last_played": 1713067638}, "language": "english", "review": "So flat out in love with this game. Was everything I hoped for it so far. Been having a lot of fun exploring with my friends. The bad reviews spooked me, but I'll try to address some things that have been said:\n\nBase building: You don't have to make a new base every where you go. You can if you want, but the first world you're in is safer and you can build there, and as you do the first few story missions it will unlock a portal you can build at your base to go to other realms quick and easy from your base. So think of the first world as a hub you can always return to.\n\nHolding the gather button will draw all loose material near by to you. You don't have to click on each piece. \n\nAbuse the teleport to respite option on your map. Load up, get encumbered and just warp back to your building. Makes early building before you get good backpacks so much easier. \n\nMission wise if you get confused, check your journal it can say more than the HUD info does. The first mission is basically go to the Trader, get a sewing table, and make better gear, then it opens up a certain ruin on the map. You get a new card, go to the new realm, meet a new NPC that gives you a quest to further the story. \n\nBuilding was fun to me. You can lay out the items you want to build into one big build and then throw mats at it to just make it all at once, like the Forest. I had a blast making my base look nice, it was a fun cozy experience, but that's subjective. \n\nThe survival aspects aren't obtrusive. If you starve or don't rest you can die, but food items and animals are everywhere, and you can make a campfire and bedroll from the easiest and most abundant materials you can pick by hand. You really have to ignore them to die by them. \n\nThe realms are gorgeous and my friends and I were just constantly wandering off to see what that thing in the distance was. Lot of the puzzles I've seen so far are stupid easy, so I agree that area could use some polish and variety.\n\nI really look forward to the game expanding and getting more and more pieces in place, but even as it is it feels pretty deep and I'm excited to play more with my friends and get further into it.", "timestamp_created": 1708842823, "timestamp_updated": 1708842823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52644038200378418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159262558": {"recommendationid": "159262558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034665267", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1708470954}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to give this game a chance, but ultimately the always online aspect completely and utterly soured any chance I had to actually enjoy even a sliver of the game. Let me explain how this one aspect did so:\n\nSo after buying and going through the customization area. (I did enjoy this, and as a Valheim player I like the idea of progression being linked to a character and not to a world as it means I could have taken a character with better gear in to help someone who is struggling, or just be ready to go fight something with a challenge.) And entered the tutorial.\n\nWhile knowing exactly what the tutorial was about and it being mostly basic aspects of any survival game. At least the first two realms, I have to take some points away due to how a bit too obtuse the instructions are in the third realm. Especially in regards to the fact that when it asks you to get medicine it was not clear on if you had to make or actually find it. (I actually got a bit fearful that I had somehow soft locked myself in the literal tutorial when I used one and it counted against me and it was only by luck that making more also counted towards the quest and not just the ones found in the chests in the two towers.) Everything was going smoothly and I excitedly walked into what I was hoping was going to be my new home for the next few weeks.\n\nThat didn't happen as I was literally rubber banding so badly I was being pushed back three steps for every one I took and could barely even open the menus. At first I was like, okay let me fiddle with settings and just tune them down. (Which was already a worry as I have an RTX 3060 graphics card and very few games have needed me to tune the graphics down from the initial setting.) Still stuttering and rubberbanding as if I was playing on an mmo server halfway across the globe. Checked my internet, it was strong and stable and no connection issue in any other game that connected online.\n\nI spent two hours trying to find someway to fix this and being frustrated at the stuttering mess that was me barely being able to even explore what should have been my home realm. \n\nThen I pulled up Task Manager in a desperate bid to maybe see if I needed to close down anything to help. Since sometimes I know firefox and chrome can become greedy with memory. Only to see that this game was using 90% of my cpu and having it open for more then forty mins spike my PC's temperature to the point I could feel it through the casing. The only time I had that issue before was when I didn't realize Helldivers2 defaults to uncapped fps and thus didn't throttle it down to 60fps. So I went looking for that, but still had this issue. Talking to others the only thing we can think of is that somehow I was getting the short end of the stick in regards to server communication. Aka my ping was being red lined and since it needs that stable connection just to be open it was just not having it.\n\nThe final straw was the fact that since I could barely do anything and was trying to figure out a fix I was also constantly being kicked out for \"inactivity\" when I was literally in menus or googling something to try and find a fix. \n\nI took this as a sign of defeat, uninstalled, and asked for a refund.\n\nWhile the game has promise and I know there are people out there having fun. With this being early access at the time of this review being written I can't recommend this game in the event others also suffer from this problem and thus go through the cycle of frustration I did. Especially if they have a less then stellar internet connection.\n\nBecause at the end of the day the need to be online even if you only want to play solo is going to cause a lot of tears and turn a lot of people away who do not like or can't afford to always be online to play. I am lucky I realized this early on as a problem that I and maybe others will have and thus had not invested  enough time to feel cheated. Especially if this ping issue had started to occur when attempting to explore or fight any of the more challenging areas. I don't want to think about what would happen if this ping issue had hit me opening a chest and losing a card I worked hard to get because the server didn't register it due to this issue.\n\n\nI will most likely come back to look at this game again once it either decides to allow solo playing to be offline, or allows people to make their own dedicated servers in hopes that will allow me to do more then become motion sick from the rubber banding.", "timestamp_created": 1708882925, "timestamp_updated": 1708882925, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526434957981109619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159948042": {"recommendationid": "159948042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085184984", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2352, "last_played": 1709698660}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not having fun", "timestamp_created": 1709700040, "timestamp_updated": 1709700040, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52639538049697876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160001511": {"recommendationid": "160001511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056808379", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 586, "last_played": 1709764627}, "language": "english", "review": "It is MMO ?

Theirs also magic you earn later in the game that enhances these tools to do even more stuff.(i haven't got this far yet)Also well aimed head shot will you get a critical strike that staggers the enemies and ever cancels out some attacks like leaps or charges. I find it fun and challenging for the combat, But i won't deny its has its faults.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nOverall the graphics are beautiful, the visuals are great and it just feels good to look around the world. There are some great moments, where my jaw dropped from the sheer beauty of it. But there do seem to be some optimizations issues but this games not finished, and this will likely be fixed before release, so I have a open mind!\n\nCO-OP\n\nBeing able to drop in and out with your friends at any time honestly is a great feeling, also teleporting from realm to realm seeing the different realm combinations, and helping each other clear small arenas full of monsters or even wracking each others brains trying to solve a puzzle. Even fight bosses, that I've honestly been getting wrecked by. \n\nCHARACTER CREATION\n\nIts good enough for now, there are some more sliders they need to add in, But i do find its completely possible to make a character you'll like, i do think more sliders for the eyes, and mouth and jawline, would be a good addition, but you can get around this currently by using their inheritance system.

It's actually an MMO Lite. The core game loop is: grind gear up to max available \"Power Level\", kill boss who is above your \"Power Level\", unlock next zone, farm new gear up to new max \"Power Level\", rinse and repeat. They literally copied the Destiny game loop. And for end-game you get: RAIDS! YAY! (Seriously, I'm not joking the end-game is literally just grinding the same 3 lack-luster raids on repeat.)\n\nSo how about the in-between, the farming resources to get better gear. Well, it would be fun except this game is was CLEARLY made by artists who don't really play that many games. The world is FULL of points of interest. But 80% of them are just random art pieces with literally no game function. Some of them have a single food item placed on the ground in front of them, but THAT'S IT. Why is there an abandoned train car in the middle of the forest? There's no reason other than because it's a Steam Punk train. It has zero story or plot threads tied to it, and serves zero game mechanic function. It's literally just there to break up the monotonous scenery.\n\nAnd worse yet the game looks really average. It's horribly optimized, so good luck running on max graphics and still being able to fight, but even on max graphics it looks 5 years out of date. It's not even a stylized art that can get away with not being realistic. Ark: Survival Evolved (the one that released in 2015) looks better than this game, and runs better too.\n\nCombat... yeah it sucks. They (like everyone else) wanted hard core, Dark Souls style dodging and blocking. However I don't think anyone on the design team ever so much as watched game play of Dark Souls. The dodge is REALLY bad. If you dodge into a small raised portion of ground it fails to move you. The block barely blocks anything. Enemies are CONSTANTLY clipping into you forcing you to always be backing up just to see where they are. And the \"bosses\" are just health sponges that can kill you in a couple hits (I am playing on difficulty 3 / 4). They can be beaten, but not by blocking or dodging. And as icing on this cake, bosses have a resistance - weakness mechanic. They're resistant to some weapons and weak to others. To the point that if you use the wrong weapon type you're just going to loose. However the game only mentions this briefly 4 hours before it's relevant buried among one of their DOZENS of forced (sometimes mid-combat) pop-up text boxes. That is fundamentally bad game design on so many levels. I only found out after going to Reddit to figure out why the boss wasn't taking any damage.\n\nThis game has a repetitiveness and lack of clever design issue. The only puzzle is literally baby's first Simon Says. It just repeats the same sequence of 1, 2, 3, at you endlessly until you repeat it back. And then they make you do it dozens of times because they couldn't be bothered to invent a 2nd puzzle. The trailers show you ALL of the cool enemies. And I mean ALL. There are more but they are: blue wolf, green bear, giant grasshopper, giant lady bug, giant spider, rabbit, you get the idea. It's like they ran out of creative juice 2 years ago and forgot to stop by the grocery store to buy more.\n\nThe always online server even in multiplayer is complete BS. With it being an MMO lite I understand the desire, but if No Man's Sky can do let players switch back and forth then so can you. And any claims it's to prevent cheating are now proven false because the game has balance is already ruined from exploits that the devs still haven't dealt with.\n\nOkay the good: this game has literally the best character creator I've ever seen. I get really annoyed that 90% of games only offer straight white people hair. This game doesn't just offer curly hair. It has FANTASY CURLY HAIR STYLES. The concept of taking a non-white hair and extrapolating it into a never before seen fantasy style is AMAZING. The depth on this character creator is insane. I could literally spend an entire day just playing with all the details.\n\nIf you like steam punk this game has lots of it, and it looks fantastic.\n\nThe game is mostly bug free. Mostly.\n\nThe sound design is... okay. I don't think the game has music. If it does it's so forgettable I literally can't remember if it exists or not.\n\nComplex Crafting is really where this game shines. I LOVE the crafting in this game. The fact that different resources give different stats is AMAZING. I Just wish the auto-add would stop depositing my valuable resources into building walls for my house instead of taking the low level ones I don't care about. I know some people think it's a bit much, but honestly once they fix the abysmal inventory management (it takes SOOOOO many click to do anything), and the ability to craft without having the resources in your inventory then crafting won't be a chore. I would go so far as to say this is one of the best crafting games I've ever played.\n\nI like how the weather effects impact game-play. The first time it hailed I was happy. The second time I didn't have my umbrella out and started taking damage and I was surprised. It honestly is nice to have actually survival style mechanics like that.\n\nI will change my review to positive in a few months once the game is made less of a chore to play.", "timestamp_created": 1710654300, "timestamp_updated": 1710654300, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160697535": {"recommendationid": "160697535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030319890", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 89, "playtime_at_review": 2702, "last_played": 1712695673}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game so far, it has good DEV'S", "timestamp_created": 1710618824, "timestamp_updated": 1710618824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160085070": {"recommendationid": "160085070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006675793", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 8413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2220, "playtime_at_review": 1721, "last_played": 1713766946}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm playing it in EA ATM.

It should be given a chance to become something great and it at least in my opinion has the building blocks to get there but needs some input from the community. \n\nThe crafting system requires a slightly higher education then what I feel most people would like to deal with. For instance to craft the first gun not only do you need to upgrade the workbench that is found by exploring at talking to merchants found throughout the realms and also the blueprint to make the gun and the \"Augment\" placed within view of said workbench to even see it, then you find out you need parts that you may have or have not depending on if you found the blacksmith blueprints to make said parts. But I will admit when I finally finished crafting the gun and started using it, I found it quite satisfying to use and worth the effort...\n\nThe portal system on paper sounds awesome and conveys a sense of infinite realms. But in reality there are 3 maps to visit repeated about 4 times. You also have transverse them multiple times in short duration requiring you to load each time and wait several minutes to load back and forth. To be honest I forgot where some of the NPCs were and I found it SUPER FREAKING ANNOYING to find them again to turn in the quest... There is a thing in Fallout 76 where you can build a ally item in your base and the NPC tied to it would make there way to your base, I wish the NPCs you encountered had that ability.\n\nBut I remind you this is early access which is to do community review and hopefully fix the game so that you can enjoy it down the road.

The game features an interesting visual style and numerous possibilities, but most importantly, it's never boring to play due to the abundance of biomes and maps. The developers have managed to naturally justify the variety of maps within the storyline and connect them in such a way that player progression is maintained while traveling between worlds.\n\nThe game does have two drawbacks, both of which are solvable. \n1. Optimization. This is a common issue for games in early access, and it's optimistic to say that there's time to address the problem.\n2. The tutorial is absolutely terrible and underdeveloped. The problem lies in the fact that the tutorial and story are presented through quests. This becomes an issue because the tutorial seems like an unnecessary step. As a result, players don't obtain umbrellas, run around worlds with low health, and lack abilities. People generally don't like reading, so they tend to skip the tutorial. The solution is obvious - simplify the tutorial text and highlight interface elements that need to be activated.\n\nA debatable aspect in Nightingale is the balance. If players don't go through the tutorial, it can be extremely challenging to survive and build. However, after completing the tutorial, backpacks and chests will be overflowing with resources, and local dungeon bosses will be quickly and easily destroyed. Still, even with these advantages, hostile NPCs seem to undergo some sort of auto-leveling during the night, and a single hostile creature can send the player to their doom with just a couple of hits. To add to this, the NPC AI isn't well-designed - enemies simply run towards the player and may even pursue them throughout an entire map. However, these balance issues can be easily fixed, and I'm confident that developers will find a reasonable compromise between enjoyment and difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1708595752, "timestamp_updated": 1708595752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158958427": {"recommendationid": "158958427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029161317", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1708456079}, "language": "english", "review": "Played not so much, but had enough to make my opinion.\nCharacters are really ugly.

Let's talk about that.\n \nWell, when you first look at the characters they look hideous. But it is not because of appeasing \"modern audiences\". I think it is an old art style they chose to go with. Remember who these developers are. Some have been in the business for decades.\n\nSome have complained about the ugly characters. If you don't want the default look then you can customize them first by using ancestry. Pick your parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc. Then you can morph your character with the various traits of those parents using a easy slider. \n\nSecond, after you do that, you can further refine your character with many more adjustments and sliders. You can make a character that is not old style hideous. You just have to use the whole system to do so. It takes more time but I like the system. No other game has it as far as I know.\nBut let me know if other games use the same system that is in Nightingale. \n\nThe portal gimmick is cool. You can change things about your realm and also move to other realms using a card system. I think the number of realms are limited right now but I am still in the first realm. I'll get back on that.\n\nThere are places to access in each realm where you fight boss like entities. There is special loot you can get in those places.\n\nCrafting is crafting. Everything works well as far as I can tell.\n\nBut, in the end of the day basically, this is a survival game with a bit more nuance to it. It is nice to see a developer add some intrigue to a pretty much saturated game genre now.\n\nCoop works. I have been playing with someone with no game breaking issues.\n\nI was/am having crashing issues frequently. Sometimes my game runs fine then another day it will crash often. This mainly happens with my RTX 4090/13700k system. My other systems seem to run fine with the game. But again some days it is fine and others not. I am not sure what is going on there. But things have been improving.\n\nThe developers seem to be hard at work fixing these issues.\n\nFor the price, I think Nightingale is a good investment. If this were a $60 game I don't think I would have bought in. But I have to buy 4 copies of each coop game I have since I play with all my kids. It gets very expensive. \n\nPalworld, Enshrouded, Nightingale and some other games all have made a good choice thinking about gamers rather than raking in lots of cash. Times are hard right now for everyone. $60-$70 a game just isn't that desirable to many anymore. And games are not living up to that investment as far as quality goes.\n\n $30 is very reasonable to support this game. Buy it and give constructive feedback. I think out of many games this one has a lot of potential to being something completely different to many other survival/rpg/coop games.\n\nThe future I do not know but I am putting my faith in this one.

Just utterly boring. I have no incentive to play because the story is not compelling, the characters aren't interesting and just lore dump you constantly. Combat is acceptable but not challenging at all. The game is padded with dozens of worktables and random objects to craft and craft with just like every other survival game. It simply fails to be anything unique. Those things would be understandable if the game was in anyway challenging as A SURVIVAL GAME but it's not.

The graphics in the game are wonderful, I really enjoyed running through the different environments and exploring.  I also enjoyed the music which highlighted different situations in the game wonderfully but that is about where it began to lose me.\n\nThe building system is nothing to write home about, if you enjoy building then this game is not the one for you.  I found the building to be simple and easy but expect to build your box and dare not try to deviate from that.  At least it was easy to understand unlike this next part.\n\nCrafting in the game is an over bloated, overly complicated mess of crafting stations, augments and materials.  Trying to understand this system on your own will likely end in frustration which is what happened to me.  I resorted to watching videos to understand what I was doing and just watching the videos annoyed me.  Why make the crafting so complicated?  I just did not find this fun in the slightest.\n\nAdding to the above is the inventory and encumbrance system.  I found myself easily over weighted trying to gather the resources necessary to craft.  This got slightly better as I upgraded my backpack but its very limiting.  Using your companion is another helpful work around but again, why have this in the game?  Just an annoyance which doesn't add anything fun to the game and is just frustrating as you find yourself very often over weighted.  Inventory management was also not fun for me as I like to organize to my liking which you cant do in this game.  There are preset ways to have the game sort your inventory including chests at your home base none of which allows you to put things as you like in them.  Its nice for the people that don't care about that sort of thing but I do and I found this an annoyance.\n\nExploring at first was fun but it quickly got boring as things started looking familiar...seemed to me like I was exploring the same places with slight variances over and over again.  This lost my interest quickly.\n\nFirst few days running around and fighting I found repairing my gear to be fine, having no issues.  Then a patch happened and come today I cant keep my gear in tip top shape because I cant gather enough essence to keep it fixed up!  What happened here?  Maybe a bug?  I am not sure but yet another feather in the cap of this game becoming more of a chore then a fun game to play.\n\nLast part I reserved for the character graphics and clothing.  I find it lacking in this department.  I think I understand what they were going for here but its not my cup of tea.  The character graphics I can over look but the clothing is just terrible!  How about some more choice in this department?  More styles would be great here.\n\nIn the end I found the game to be frustrating at times and down right boring at others...The story is interesting and I think that is what kept me in the game for as long as I have been but its time for me to hang up my hat on this one.  I hope things down the line get better but for now I choose not to be frustrated and bored when I play a game.", "timestamp_created": 1709888231, "timestamp_updated": 1709888231, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525472462177276611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162951999": {"recommendationid": "162951999", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966004171", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2441, "playtime_at_review": 4132, "last_played": 1713796730}, "language": "english", "review": "Nightingale capitalizes the \"Crafting\" in the \"Survival Crafting\" genre. Many contemporaries of the genre take the foundations laid by Minecraft and improved upon by Valheim to build upon it in their own style, resulting in a wide variety of takes on the genre. Inflexion takes those sound foundations and builds something more akin to an intricate, filligree clockwork.\n\nThe depth of crafting is on a whole different level. Want to craft a simple hammer? Well you'll need a hammer-head, a handle, and some cloth wrapping. These components all require materials refined from raw materials. It is what raw materials, and how they are refined, that will determine the specific characteristics of the hammer. Want a heavy, durable hammer? Iron hammerhead. How about one that is lightweight and accurate? Maybe crafting it from Tin to reduce it's weight. How about one that massively increases magical power? Make one from Silver.\n\nThis same calculus goes into almost every item in the game, and these effects stack, allowing the player to truly express themselves (or min-max) their gear to their heart's content.\n\nThis even extends to the realms themselves, which can be augmented and customized through a system of tarot-like cards. Opening gateways to new worlds tailored to certain tasks, even setting up permanent bases to optimize certain tasks or seek out specific resources. \n\nThe game is early access, and it has some problems. I have run into issues with the lighting engine which seems to cause strange grainy shadow effects during long play sessions. The systems are fairly opaque from the start and require a lot of experimentation, and some people may not enjoy the \"gear score\" like system tied to the crafting. \n\nThat said, the foundation laid here for Nightingale may be the best iteration of a crafting system ever produced in a video game, and I am eager to see how the game develops.", "timestamp_created": 1713215987, "timestamp_updated": 1713215987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525452971458435059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162911558": {"recommendationid": "162911558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148254443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 579, "playtime_at_review": 2246, "last_played": 1713684137}, "language": "english", "review": "An enjoyable take on survival.

Realm creation was marred by excessive loading times, eventually halting progress and forcing me to forfeit realms along with all my gathered resources, leading to lost progression.\n\nAfter an exasperating 11+ hours, reflecting on recent titles like Palworld and Enshrouded, I can't help but feel this game suffers by comparison. Would my criticisms be as harsh without their context?

The core gameplay loop is exactly what I hoped it'd be - namely, it provides you ample reason to want to go out and explore, gather, and hunt so you can build, craft, and ultimately progress once you get back to your home realm.  I've played a lot of games where it didn't feel like there was a lot of point to what I was doing, but Nightingale keeps you moving through it with a great progression system.  I compare this aspect pretty favorably to a game like Enshrouded, which felt more like two different (but excellent) games of combat and building without a lot of connection between the two.\n\n2. The graphics and art direction are top notch.  You can get a pretty good idea from the trailers but it really made me go \"holy shit\" numerous times at a vista or encounter.  Just oozing flavor and a unique feel.\n\n3. The crafting system's concept is great and has the kind of depth I love to sink my teeth into and discover.  There's a lot to understand about it and aspects are very poorly explained (will get to that later), but it's still an area that Nightingale stands above any other survival crafting game I've played, with the fact that you can so deeply customize the stats and relative power of everything you craft by selecting a mix of different materials.  You really will want to go out to hunt down one specific thing because it will give you that exact stat boost that you're after.\n\nThe Mixed:\n\n1. The combat is functional and can be very satisfying at times, particularly with the weak points system where you are rewarded with an automatic critical hit when you hit a specific spot on an enemy.  However, I don't think it's perfect yet as the enemies tend to ping-pong around to an almost absurd degree at times which can be frustrating at times.  And I know they're the primary enemy but I am already really sick of fighting The Bound - hopefully there is more enemy variety on the way!\n\n2.  The building is decent, but not a differentiator like Enshrouded's is.  It's pretty similar to ARK and would definitely benefit from some expansion in the base pieces like triangle foundations and half-walls.  The biggest issue right now is that there's a  pretty stingy build limit that's limiting your options if you want to play as a group and build a big base.  I hope they can address that soon since there's a lot of potential with the building system.\n\n3.  Exploration is fun and the realms are a really cool idea... but they end up feeling a bit same-y with a pretty limited and formulaic set of POIs to find in each realm.  There's only about 5 of them and while they get harder as you level up the structure doesn't change.  Additionally, you spend a lot of time just running around between them in realms, so while the umbrella floating is a lot of fun I'd really love to see a mount or something to earn that speeds up the process a bit.\n\n4.  Online-Only.  Yeah this is mixed for me, because while I do enjoy hosting my own servers for other similar games to play with friends, in theory there are some advantages to the MMO type of atmosphere they're going for here.  It was cool to drop in and play with multiple groups of friends in a way that wouldn't have been possible with the fractured nature of private servers.  It was also cool to have a hub area later in the game that supported some challenging group content that is a rarity in this sort of game.  The issue is - as has been discussed to death already - mainly that the servers aren't always reliable and there's no way to adjust settings or manage your own experience, not to mention losing out on mods which is a shame because the modding potential for this game is huge.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1. The UI has been improved by all accounts but it's still not great.  It's pretty to look at but there's a lot of fairly baffling decisions (like why would you denote something that you've unlocked the ability to craft by shading it red???) and a lot of very complex systems that are not really explained at all.  This is compounded by the fact that, at this time, there are a lot of placeholder icons for important items that add to the general confusion.  The Augment system drives me absolutely mad because half of it doesn't make a lot of sense and the other half is so poorly explained by the UI that I tend to just give up in annoyance.\n\n2.  There are definitely some bugs and issues to deal with.  My follower annoys the crap out of me constantly by trying to \"help\" by feeding my forge's flames with my highest quality wood, or by dumping all the materials I've painstakingly gathered into an Aid POI (where you're supposed to finish a building to help an NPC).  Trees you cut will sometimes fall through the map and you'll lose out on the wood.  Multiple times my respite point (home spot that you can port back to from anywhere) randomly decided to unset itself so I got to enjoy a pointless run across the length of my home realm while loaded down with materials.  I'm sure these will be cleaned up pretty quickly, and it's nothing like some of the more notorious bad releases (No Man's Sky this ain't) but certainly can be frustrating.\n\nAll in all, I still recommend this game as I've consistently had fun with it playing solo, with my wife, and with a larger group of friends in the current (release) build, despite some of the issues.

The game also forces you to constantly engage in some of the most boring combat i have seen to date in order for a small chance to get better quality resources to craft better quality gear.\n\nIt requires a lot of patience to figure things out because you get almost no explanation on the mechanics of the game.\n\nI'm hoping the delay between firing the sling bow and actually hitting something can be explained because of the weapon type and that delay won't exist with proper firearms later in the game otherwise that is just horrible to use.\n\nRemember when everyone was making jokes about how expressionless the NPCs were in starfield? I've seen more emotion on bare drywall than the NPCs in this game.\n\nFYI since i opened up a portal with the astrolabe/forest card combo i have killed all the enemies that spawned, harvested every single resource in the area around the portal sat there watching the portal for about 5 mins and written this review and the portal still has not finished opening. the game has literally completed a full night cycle and i still cant go anywhere else.\n\nEdit: so it turns out that portal is problem is actually a glitch, so resetting it and putting the cards back in fixes that, annoying but not the end of the world.\n\nSome other things to be aware of though the astrolabe/forest biome seems to be exactly the same as the previous forest combo just harder enemies so I'm now having doubts about interesting the exploration is going to be if there is only 3 biomes available just in different configurations for each person.\n\nThe repetitiveness of this game is no joke you are going to continually do 1 of 4 things to progress. attack the same boring enemies with a combat system which is as exciting as just side stepping and swinging your weapon of choice. \nDefending some NPCs while a machine does something which is the same as the previous task but with the added annoyance of defending a weak machine that the enemies just charge at and destroy before you even realise they have spawned. \nBuilding a random structure for an NPC so just farm resources and just give them to the NPC and finally repeatedly just watch some pyramids play a note and then repeat that note back in a specific order to unlock another recipe... that's it that is the entire game.\n\nEdit 2: oh i missed one. One other task is looking for hidden glyphs and clicking on them to unlock your reward... \n\nTo summerise its a poorly assembled collection of the basic bones of every other survival RPG which admitadly has some very minor interesting changes to the crafting system but the flesh around the bones is nothing more than a rinse and repeat cycle of bland simple tasks that are honestly far more annoying than challenging in an environment that looks good in the pictures but you will never find anything new if you continue to explore. if you have seen it ounce you have seen it a million times.", "timestamp_created": 1709667058, "timestamp_updated": 1709675570, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524312913417816162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159118831": {"recommendationid": "159118831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209442688", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "playtime_at_review": 571, "last_played": 1712803308}, "language": "english", "review": "waiting for server................\nwaiting for server................\nwaiting for server................\nTravel error............\nwaiting for server................\nwaiting for server................\nCrash.\n\nHonesty, despite the pretty graphics, the laborious crafting and insane lag when fighting makes this 2024's worst release so far.

Incredible work went into the sky boxes and so much attention to detail, including the haze of the desert heat, or a rainbow appearing in a waterfall. It's a fantastic game to view. \n\nSounds? Turn your sound up. Satisfying, enchanting music, crafting stations, and combat sounds.\n\nCombat? Standard for a survival game, with the addition of enchantments(magick) and unique weapon styles to give it its own place among survival games. A fair amount of customization is possible, and fun. \n\nProgression? Expertly done. With a nice mix of incorporating quests, objectives, gathering and crafting, and standard exploration, the pace at which you become increasingly powerful takes effort and feels rewarding. \n\nInventories? Decent functionality, with plenty of room for improvement. I'd give its current design a 7/10.\n\nBuilding? Comes with some poor limitations, but still impressed with the variety of building styles available. The 300 limit per structure needs changed ASAP.\n\nSurvival game genre? The biggest selling point for me is the design they've given this game. It allows you to progress without the standard fear of losing all your hard work if you need to take a break.

Nightingale has many different features that I haven't seen before in similar styled games, while other features left me confused as to why they are part of the game.  \n\nFirst off, fighting with an umbrella.  Being able to strafe with it during combat like a really buff Mary Poppins is really enjoyable!  I've had quite a lot of fun using that same umbrella to gently glide down cliffs, survive both sun damage in the desert and prevent hailstones from injuring my character.  The only thing it hasn't prevented is healing swamp water diseases.  \n\nI've also enjoyed building my home area.  The building and moving components appears easy, but it still feels \"clunky\".  I couldn't figure out how to move the pieces up or down, and resorted to online help from other players.  If they had a tutorial mode or some other feature to clue the clueless in on how to build correctly, it would be appreciated.\n\nThat leads me to the next topic, feeling lost or confused.  This game starts off in a survival mode, where you must craft your basic tools and clothing from components that you hunt or gather.  I wanted to learn how to play the game before adding another layer of difficulty, so I chose \"easy\" mode when making my character.  Even on easy mode I felt like my character was about to die.  I quickly gathered leaves, sticks and rocks, only to try to figure out what button to select to start crafting the fire that I desperately needed so my character wouldn't freeze to death.  Later I learned that their stats would just decrease and not regenerate as much, but right at the start I thought they were about to die.  \n\nThere are three status bars.  Health, stamina and hunger.  When your character eats, you then get a little food buff icon by that hunger bar.  What I didn't know was you need to fill the green bar up, to stop from having to eat every 3-5 minutes.  I played this game for 45 hours and only just realized you need to just keep eating until it fills, and don't worry about whether or not you have the food picture showing by it.  I kept running around with 1/8 of the bar filled and my character would get hungry right away.  As mentioned before, I thought they were going to die (instead of a stat reduction) so I scrambled to find something.  The starting zone area had berries, mushrooms and deer (meat).  The raw plant options didn't seem to stave off my character's hunger.  So I chased down deer (without a weapon) and punched them to death.  Once it was dead I realized I had to use a dagger to cut up the carcass.\n\nIt is here at this point, I should mention that if you absolutely don't want to hunt animals, this game isn't for you.  It has fishing and using meat, and tanning hides is a normal progression step.  Yes, you can harvest and grow vegetables, you mostly will find that you will need to craft over half of everything using some sort of animal product.  Alternatively you may be able to purchase all the required animal components with essences from an essence trader, but I think that would be extremely tedious and quite pricey.  There is also a quest early on that has you make a certain number of head and heart shots.  I didn't try it on the humanoid monster things, so I don't know if you can use that to fulfill the quest objectives.  \n\nI enjoy playing other hunting and fishing games, so I was able to gather meat and hides without much of an issue once I figured out how to craft a knife.  Once I obtained meat I could craft longer lasting meals, but I still felt as if my character eats way too frequently for \"easy\" mode.  This insatiable appetite has led me to skip reading most of the pages, cards and other things I have stumbled upon in my travels. My character moaning from hunger pains just had me skipping most of the found story pages and card text.  Because of this, I am still unsure as to what exactly is going on in the story line.  \n\nMost games I try to pay attention to the plot.  In this game I have been afraid to just stand and idle around, from the incorrect assumption that they were going to starve to death.  I know some event happened, my character can open realms and travel within them, and play cards to influence those same realms.  If they could make it so you don't have to eat while standing at home by the hearthstone thing we craft, it would be game-changing for me.  I could actually read my journal entry more, and figure out what I need to be doing without the anxiety of near-death pulling me from enjoying any story line.\n\nI received my personal copy of the game for free from a promotion event and I then bought a copy for a friend.  I found exploring the world with a friend is really enjoyable, and we've been playing often.

I posted my initial thoughts (10 hours in) via Steam but it feels like a fun time sink. Truly interactive and engaging.

And they can quickly become overwhelming.\r\n\r\nOn that note, some of you know my new disabilities after I survived traumatic brain injury. There is a host of lore involved which does require good memory to gain good advantage from discovering and learning it.

Not on a PTSD level mind you, but just on that level of I need to do this more so I can really learn how to dance to this groove. And there is in all combat a rhythm that one can flow into and thrive.\r\n\r\nBut please always remember about \"early access\" programs. They are beta and you are a beta tester who paid to be there.

Just ask me to put 16 ingots and call it a day, wow. Then each material gives completely different stats and there are also tiers of these materials. You can understand now just how complex it was already getting. The mobs also don't drop the base materials, they drop all sorts of intermediate items (like mechanical gears instead of ore or ingots). Which used to be annoying but still useful. HOWEVER, because they are incapable of thinking of more elegant solutions, they have now completely removed the ability to reclaim base materials from any of the intermediary items in order to stop an exploit (but they left the exploiters with their OP items!). So now you have to be paranoid crafting exactly X amount of each dumb intermediary step and cannot recover base materials from all those mobs that drop the intermediary steps! \r\nGee, thanx! There's EA and then there's bad decisions.\r\nAnd the icing on the cake??? You have to go and grab each of the materials you need from your 15+ containers because it can't possibly see what the heck you have in the containers!

The game has DYES that are used just to make realm cards and buildings. LOL what??? \r\nThe game has a ton of crafting benches and augmentations that are capped so good luck figuring out how to make sure you can craft everything...

I'm at 200 just with storage and crafting needs.\r\nThe crafting is tedious and also nonsensical. 30s per ingot and lumber and you have to craft so many of them, but everything else takes just 3 seconds? Somehow turning an ingot into a complex filigree or ornamental barrel takes 3 seconds but making a basic ingot is 30s? \r\n\r\nUGH. Such disappointment.

I loved the game's crafting and building system. For example, to produce a rifle, you need to produce materials in three or four different stations. Of course, in order to produce these materials, you need to collect different resources beforehand. And with these materials you can produce the rifle. Honestly, I really liked this detailed production phase. For Building, you need to learn recipes and you find or buy these recipes in different realms. The building models are very detailed and nice. I hope the crafting and building system will not be changed.\r\n\r\nLet's talk about the realm system... You travel to different realms with the combination of biome and major cards and you do this through portals. With minor cards, you can change the properties of the realm you are in (such as production advantages, strength bonus, food consumption) and when you do this, the environmental conditions (such as colors, weather conditions) also change. In short, you create alternate realms in the game through portals.\r\n\r\nAll this process of traveling, crafting and building between realms serves a purpose. You are trying to find Nightingale City, which is very important for humanity. You try to do this by constantly following quests, rumors and glimmers of hope.\r\n\r\nIn short, I loved the game.

It took me about 280 hours to complete everything defeat all bosses, including open world bosses, and get all achievements. \r\n\r\nI took my time with the game because the world was a consistent creation, I enjoyed adding new things to build with, and getting through the \"ladder\" of realms until I reached the very last ones. \r\n\r\nThe difficulty is not bad, but varies. overall game play can be customised between \"wuss\" and \"not bad\". I played mostly on hard, with the last few ascended realms pushed up to Extreme. Extreme difficulty turned out to be the proper one for me. it was challenging enough. The only place I saw the balance broken was in the Solo vaults where I was dying and chipping away on a boss 1 bullet at a time, it took me 2+ hours to get through a solo vault. the public ones are set to easy I think, because with other players, it's laughably easy, \r\n\r\nAnother point that I didn't like were the entirety of the vault system. It was the same as the realm vaults just 3 times longer I understand the system but found it really really boring. You are basically either piss blood in solo vaults, or breeze through them in a group without the need to shoot a single shot.. \r\n\r\nI really liked the skyboxes, I wish the game would have more variety in that regard. \r\n\r\nThe building was a bit awkward at first, but it worked. The only thing bad about it was that the pacing in which the building pieces were distributed across the realms was way off.. I expected a new building set after my 2nd portal but I had to wait waaaaaay longer, to the point that I was borderline bored with the game.. I liked building and make an interesting house that I upgrade over time, so the lack of building pieces was frustrating. The devs confirmed to be working on the \"replace\" function for the building elements so I'm not giving them flack for it.\r\n\r\nOne system I found greatly confusing was the crafting one. I see that it's robust, but it's very convoluted. You need to unlock the station, the augment and the recipe separately.. Why? Why can't the augments just unlock the recipe?This needs to be 1 step shorter or better organised since this was one of the things I was considering giving the game a not recommended for, even though it's a brilliant system. In my opinion, the augments should unlock the new recipes. There are 2 ways to go at it. 1: the augments are cosmetic only, they are the \"decoration\" category, and you unlock stations and recipes from the realms. The other, perhaps better version is when you build an augment, they give the \"exrta\" recipes, and the workstation can build any item you unlocked without augments. \r\nThe problem is the workstation / augment attachments. one augment can enhance more than 1 station, and 1 station can get limited augments in range This leads to me loose track of what workstation is effected by what augment, and missing out of recipes, because there are no more augment slots on the station. Then I look up what is needed and I see that workstation and augments are next to each other yet I still cannot build something. I have to offload the table for example, them move it to an empty area, then move that specific augment in range to unlock crafting of what I need, then put everything back after done.. This is tedious and confusing.\r\n\r\nI want to mention a thing I really liked, but was probably not intended: Hunting for companions. I really liked the idea that there can be randomly named people out there that you can recruit (although a bit awkwardly). A significant portion of my gametime was devoted to always looking at the NPC PIOs in a realms to see if I can find one that looked better or called better. Most of the NPCs were ugly a bit, and I knew I wanted a female companion. It didn't help that my companions kept disappearing between travels with all the high level gear I gave to them.. But regardless, it was a good minigame to find one that I liked. I eventually settled on one that was called Alice and looked like the youtuber ShoeOnHead. A bit.\r\n\r\nGetting NPCs in realms was interesting, and good idea but some parts are very bad. For example, 50%of the time, you need to help them build something before you can recruit them. WHY? Now we built a house halfway in water  with crafting stations, that nobody will use, because I took the NPC,, I think they should have a way to offer 2 things when you approach an NPC builder site: a quest to protect them while they pack and a quest to help them build, if you don't want to recruit them. That way you can decide based on name and look if you want to take them or help them settle. Much better system.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer was more or less working, but it was a bit awkward to experiment with what was their loot and what was mine, what we could loot both and what we couldn't. It shouldn't have to be an experiment.. \r\n\r\nBuilding limits are assss.. Especially if you want to build on the same realm.. The reason me and my friends were not building on the same realm was that we all wanted our own house but kept hitting the build limit which was quite bad. \r\n\r\nThe story of the game was quite good, and void of all agenda, which I've not expected just by looking at the gamedevs. Thinking about the game overall ,the largest contributor for why I recommend it it's because it's focusing on the game and the world, and not on agendas and quotas. It just want to tell a good an interesting story. I'm recommending it because it's a game / fun first, and not a MTS / agenda first game. \r\n\r\nAn additional thing I wanted to mention was the voice acting. The voice actor for Pluck was extraordinary, I hope that the rest of the dialogues and notes will also be narrated with this quality in the future.

It's boring.  The pacing is terrible.  The first realms have very little interesting content.  They are there for forced farming to unlock the next realm of forced farming.  It does pick up a bit when you hit the Herbarium realm, but I doubt most folks will really make it that far before getting bored.  Even then, it's still a lot of lather, rinse, repeat.  The puzzles are the same, the realm cards are the same (forest, desert, swamp), and the enemies are really nothing you haven't seen done before.  You'd expect more from fae realms, but nope.\n2.  The AI is terrible.  Mobs and bosses do the same thing...they rush directly at you at top speed.  You can get a NPC helper who will assist you in battle, just be sure not to give them any high-end crafting materials or they will gladly chuck them into any random campfire or forge you walk by.  Learning that part was fun.  The rest of the NPCs, like quest givers and essence traders, are just placeholders standing there.  \n3.  Speaking of quest-givers...I'm not sure why they have them.  I've encountered 4 in 80 odd hours of gameplay that are just there to make unlocking something a bit more difficult and time wasting.  The reward is something that you've previously unlocked through normal play, like a realm card or weapon, that has extra hoops to jump through to get just the next one in line.  \n4.  Building.  I think they took the basic UE5 system and just threw it in.  It's just sad by today's standards.  Do not buy this game if you enjoy building nice places.  You'll be very disappointed.  Due to the way the crafting system works, decorating is not gonna be fun either,  Why do you have a wheelbarrow in the middle of the room?  Because crafting.  Why is there a frying and and a pot over here instead of in the kitchen?  Because crafting.  \nWhen you realize Bethesda has better building than a game built on UE5...you get sad.  \n5.  Crafting.  Probably the best part of the game, and the most confusing.  Get out your Excel so you can start making spreadsheets of what each station does, what items enhance which stations, which ones cancel out other enhancements, which components do what, what color they produce (yeah, no dye station here), and a host of other things...all pretty poorly explained in a barely usable menu system.  It's like alien technology.  It's probably awesome if you can figure it all out.  \n\nYou likely already know about server issues, slow loading and realm changing, disconnects, falling through places forever (luckily, never encountered this one), and a host of more issues,  \nIt's going to take a lot of work to fix this.  I'm hopeful that I can change my review in the future as it really is a cool concept, and there are glimmers of a good game peeking out from what is currently a bit of a mess.\nBut right now, it's a nope for me.\n", "timestamp_created": 1710193391, "timestamp_updated": 1710193391, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160349841": {"recommendationid": "160349841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052311674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2700, "last_played": 1710976622}, "language": "english", "review": "It has some elements that bring me back to Conan Exiles, the exploring in different realms keeps you on your toes and keeps you captivated in the game, i have been enjoying every minute of it .

Here's why.\nI haven't had any expectations before buying the game. I just hopped in and boarded the for now not-so-well-rated hype train.\nThe game is well playable, no major bugs discovered, just minor ones. No crashes in 50+ hours, no server connection issues. \nGraphic looks beautiful, the stiff NPC not so much. Faces are hideous but you can create something nice if you give it some time. \nRealm card combinations are decent but I hope more different biomes will be added with different topology as the realms are pretty generic. I think more creatures and tweaked AI will be also needed.\nThe game mechanics. I can see the frustration some people might have here. In pursuit for original content, this game has introduced some design and UI/UX decisions that can be a real unintuitive pain. Please don't. It's really bad. Like divided action/tool bar that makes no sense and consuming food by pressing F instead of LMB or no info showing on realm address cards when I want to use them to open portal (need to drop them on ground). Or so many crafting station additions I don't even remember which goes where and why my workbench doesn't let make me ammo when the saddle is right next to it. I can't even store realm cards properly, they're taking significant amount of inventory slots now. Why? And there's more, things that need to be explained more clearly.\nBugs. There are some. As for now, crops are buggy, sunflower grows on, then it doesn't at all, the whole planter gets stuck... constructions and items have all mats needed but they still show blueprint...\nBuilding is decent but I think some things need to be re-considered like how some blocks fit together. And maybe more building blocks as the current set is very basic and thus limiting. The building blocks and decorations are very nice looking.\nQuests are basic and the whole progress is slow-paced thanks to the crafting system which someone might not like but I personally don't mind. I like to know there's still content ahead of me. There are puzzles and they're quite repetitive but... ok. Early access.\nAlso the most peculiar seems the language choice here. Puck's voice acting is amazing. But the dialogues or lore are written to mimic historical language to fit the era. Which can be quite an issue for non-native speakers.\ntl;dr\nMany people complain about state of this early access game. However there's no clear definition of how such early access game title should look like and so I'm not going to judge from this point of view. Yes, yes, yes, Enshrouded is in better state and ASA seems like it's a forever early acces thanks to its bugs... maybe some of you also remember No Man's Sky and it's very bad beginnings and look where it's now.\nI will keep an eye on the game as for me it's still a way to relax after a long day and hope the Inflexion team will keep up the good work. I want to believe this will be really good one day, it's not THAT bad but I can see a looong way ahead.\nSoo... if you don't mind the challenge of discovering and slow progress, it's ok, yes. If you're just looking a place to chill and build, I'd say it's ok.

The hireling system reminds me of Dragon's Dogma 1's. The NPC follows me around, likes to chop trees and attacks things that attack you. Odd that my most recent anti-tree, anti-wolf psychopath NPC was labeled as a \"Druid\". I've been sadly misinformed about them.\r\nThere are rough edges, sure, UI problems and performance issues, but those are all more than expected for an Early Access Title. Nothing to complain of there.\r\nThe framework also allows the ability to introduce new stories and quests with special cards that can be used to unlock handcrafted content. That would be nice.\r\n\r\nIDEA: They could even have something nice like a monthly randomization of pathways to Nightingale that must be followed to make it there.\r\n\r\nIDEA: From Nightingale, you could theoretically have further branching out once you reach there and it could become a new quest hub... all in all the base is a fine stage to build your own story.\r\n\r\nIt just needs more compelling content, but I'm certain that's coming.

If you wish to read that scroll down and have a look. Otherwise, I would not recommend this game to anyone in its current state.  Overall the main idea behind the game is fairly decent. However, the implementation is poor.  Poor is an understatement.    This game is touted as a survival game but, it does not have the proper feel for progression that makes survival games resonate with the player.  PROGRESSION is CRITICAL in a survival game; especially the feel of said progression.  This game does not have it.  Progression feels random and gifted rather than planned for and earned.  It feels like spinning wheels and getting nowhere.  I'm sure it's all tied up in the essence system and a plan for selling progress (high level - essence) to frustrated players who like the aesthetics of the game.  Check my profile if you like.  I have thousands of hours racked up in survival titles.  Not this one. \n Survival gamers go elsewhere, there's nothing here for us.  Ill check back in down the road and see if they change course.\n\nIt's a bit sad but, let's be honest, the problem is that the 'game' completely lacks compelling game play.  I spent all my game time working to get the portal going with the hope that the game would suddenly open up and show me something.  Sadly, the next world was basically a cut and paste of the previous world with a new color pallet.  There are no survival systems in place.  The creatures were all basically the same creatures in both worlds.  You walk far enough away for a long enough time and the very same creatures spawn back into the very same location in the very same configuration.  \n\nAnd, when I say survival systems, I mean survival systems that build upon each other that progress you towards a better situation.  In other words, you depend on yourself to create your way out of starvation or exposure, etc.  In this 'game' the work you are doing is to create a bigger number on a stat card.  It completely lacks the survival feel.  The only way to get new stuff is to purchase it from a vendor or maybe get a lucky reward.  Its gated progression controlled completely by the developer rather than an interconnected system influenced by character build and player agency.  \n\nI imagine they are going to argue that there is agency but there is not. Every single player has to do the exact same things in nearly the exact same order to achieve the exact same result.  Gear score 20.  Then, build some portal cards.  There are no choices.  The game even tells you the portal card you are going to build.  It's all so very boring.  They couldn't even be bothered to put some effort into the games beginning and engineer a system that would have you choosing from three tasks that would lead to the portal card you wanted to start with.  Or, create a system that had you crafting your way to the portal card you wanted. Either way, they choose it all for you then feed you more of the same.\n\nIt's just a bad game.  Maybe they'll fix it but, I think their foundational system is junk.  It's going to take a complete overhaul to turn it into a worthy survival game.  I'm not sure that they know what a survival game is.\n\n\nPs. Did I mention that the maps are tinie tiny things you can run across in about 60 seconds? ..2 minutes tops if the generator dumps impassable cliffs in your way.   I think the word vast was used in connection with the word realms.. must have been marketing buzz ( aka, lies ).

It is indeed complex and can be overwhelming, but I'd rather have that than a shallow system that feels unrewarding.\n\nI've completed the majority of what the game has to offer currently at around 65 hours, but plan to stick around much longer to build in my home realm and then start a second character and do it all again.\n\nThe only thing I want from this game is more. More biomes, more vaults for end game, more weapons and armor to unlock, more story content.\n\nThe only real complaints I have is server related crashing. Some days it feels common, other days it never happens.\n\nCan't wait to see what the future looks like for this game. My only hope is that this one can see the same kind of future content releases as a game like Icarus. I want to see this game supported for years to come and it'll continue to be my go-to survival crafting game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1709728089, "timestamp_updated": 1709728089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159955904": {"recommendationid": "159955904", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970949006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 14714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8287, "playtime_at_review": 943, "last_played": 1713799752}, "language": "english", "review": "Deep crafting systems, interesting puzzles, and so many arcane and beautiful environments to explore.

And with about 60 hours in, I must say I'm thrilled with my experience of it. Is it perfect? No, it has several things to be desired and some necessary fixes to be made. However, I do not see the \"redundancy\" that many here complain of. Yes, you grind, you take on higher level encounters, you upgrade your gear, and you carry on to greater heights. I see no difference in many other crafting/survival games. Certainly some allow you to jump right in and bite off way more than you can chew from the start, and maybe those who are disgruntled would be happier if Nightingale allowed that as well, but it is far from tedious to get there. \n\nThe worlds are phenomenal and fascinating. The Minor Realm cards that can be utilized in any realm allow for personal preferences to prevail in the realms. You want more of a challenge? Blood Moon card; you cannot walk 5 feet without encountering a new horde of monsters, both Bound and realm-specific. You want something to make travel and exploration easier? Thinly-veiled card; something to allow you to defy the laws of gravity, without suffering fall damage! And all of them result in stunning visual changes as well! My only wish here is that I do yearn for a greater variation of Major Realm card combinations, and hope to see that in future updates. \n\nAdditionally, and perhaps my FAVORITE thing thus far, is the nuance of crafting! You do not simply upgrade your weapons/tools from stone to copper, then iron, etc. No, all the different ores have different characteristics and statistics to them, so you can choose what to use to create your weapons/tools based on what you are looking for. Better ranged damage? There's a certain ore for that! Better durability or melee damage? There's one for that! And this extends into clothing crafting as well! It is remarkably nuanced and the limits to what you can do in personalizing and optimizing your gear seems excitingly endless to me. \n\nIf you do not have the patience, wait for some of the updates, because this game has much more in store for us all and I cannot wait to see it. Some of the communities biggest grievances are already in the devs sights and are being worked on presently.

While overwrought too early, the complexity of the crafting system is chewy and interesting. \n\nIn short however, this game takes some bad ideas from both survival games and MMORPGs and makes them the core pillars of gameplay.

Dreary, chaotic combat. \nIn its current state, most of the gameplay gets in the way of the harsh whimsical survival-adventure I think this game wants to be.\n\nIf I could change one thing right now to improve that experience? Remove the gearscore gating to content, possibly remove gearscores altogether. Find a more interesting approach to gating content, and balancing combat. The robust itemization on resources and gear are wasted because of it, especially early on. You've got the realm card system, I think that's all you need. Lean much, much heavier into that.

This is a grind game. The core gameplay loop is optimization. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, or you play survival games for different reasons, then its probably not for you.\n\nA lot of people are complaining about the amount of augmentations or how the crafting system works. I think the real problem is just a lack of QoL features that ultimately make things take more time than they need too. All parts of a production chain need to be done manually, can\u2019t be queued, and take time to complete. While this is somewhat necessary, as different items affect the output item, the system can be tedious since it requires constant attention. Its not as simple as queuing up the end product you want and then doing something else. Ultimately that amounts to a lot of time staring at workbenches. I like the complex crafting system but as mentioned earlier if you dont, then this isnt going to be the game for you.\n\nCombat is fine. I don\u2019t really understand why people say its bad. Its meaty and satisfying. Not perfect but light years ahead of many popular games in the survival genre. You can reset realms and make them more or less difficult as you please. There's good skill expression through headshots/heartshots. I really don\u2019t see a problem here.\n\nOutside of the other problems, the last problem is repetition. There\u2019s not a whole lot of content atm and whats there is stretched pretty severely. There\u2019s a lot of the same enemies, the same biomes, the same quests. Minor cards help with this, but there needs to be more. Either the grinding and min maxing gets its hooks into you or you\u2019ll probably find it tedious. For me I loved it, and Im glad its not yet another survival game doing the exact same thing as the last popular survival game. \n\nUltimately its a solid game, and for me even if its never updated ever again, I feel like whats already here is worth a look imho. It looks great, and has a very detailed crafting system that Im really into.

Does it need work? Absolutely. Is it a great game for early access? Absolutely. But, it's well worth the $30 it costs.\n\nMany people have issues with the crafting system. I totally disagree because the complication is kind of what makes it good. You don't level up in the traditional sense, you do so by advancing your gear. HOWEVER, I will admit there should be a much better tutorial system that describes the attributes materials give and what portion of those attributes are applied to what armor pieces and weapons. It takes a keen eye to spot that some of the attributes just don't apply to some pieces when it comes to the end craft. This would also be useful for infusions labeling what items they can be applied to, especially since you need infusions on almost every item to even make it to certain unlocks without using the Twitch Prime gear.\n\nI also agree with other reviews that there needs to be triangle foundation and ceiling support. I'm assuming this has to come with time because without it you're just stuck building many designs you simply abhor. I do find myself wondering how they are going to monetize things in the long run since it is a live service game. Working in IT it's quite easy to tell that your specific abeyance realm and all others outside of The Watch are on-demand which is awesome, but it's still gotta be hell on the server costs.\n\nOverall, as long as the developers don't quit on us and keep providing new content and biomes, I'll continue to play. I do think we need animal taming/raising/ranching eventually, and much better procedural generation when it comes to dungeons and islands, the more you visit the more you realize many are the same as others.

Huge potential for growth. \nThis is one of the first Early Access games I can actually recommend playing.\n\nI've been looking forward to this game for 3+ years now and I was worried about it after trying the stress test, but I still wanted to try the game and support the devs regardless just because of the theme and their new concept on survival games as a whole. I am glad I did! Yes, the start of the game is slow and needs a bit of work, but once you get the hang of it and unlock more carry capacity (craft a backpack) and you start discovering all the amazing things that are in the game it really starts to shine. \n\nI love the way my character looks, it's such a unique art style.  I get why some people might think the character models are ugly, but just play around in the settings and I am sure you will find something you love!  I really enjoyed customizing my character. They said they'll be adding more ways to customize your character as time goes on. \n\nI am not saying the combat is perfect, it does need some work but I find it rewarding. Switching weapons and enchantments, and just finding out the best combo that you enjoy is a lot of fun. I cannot wait until they add more down the road. \n\nThe crafting has to be one of the most interesting, complicated (in a good way), and the most satisfying I have seen in a game.  It has a high learning curve and you need to do some research or just try things and figure it out as you go. Example: It really matters what materials you use when crafting, not only does it change the appearance of your items you craft but also every material has different stats. Figure out what works the best for you! \n\nThe portal system is such a great idea lore-wise and gameplay wise. You will have endless possibilities with your biome, major, and minor cards, especially as they add more over time. There is a unique feeling of immersion and excitement when opening a new realm, exploring and discovering it with my friends. \n\nThe graphics are beautiful! I haven't played a game this pretty in a long time. I actually stop and take screenshots constantly and I am not even on max graphics. \n\nI really enjoyed building a huge Tudor mansion with my friend and we already have ideas for another base in a different biome. The building does need some QOL updates and a few changes but that's what EA is for. \n\nI had a good time doing the main story(that's available so far) and learning more about the lore from the NPCS I have encountered. Obviously it's not RPG level of story, but the writing is very well done and if you like reading lore there's a lot out there to discover via the \"echoes\" you find randomly throughout the realms. \n\nLastly having a hub, like the Watch, where you can see and meet other players is what other survival games are missing: a sense of community through survival and working together.", "timestamp_created": 1709563555, "timestamp_updated": 1709563795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159820192": {"recommendationid": "159820192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198786415", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3786, "last_played": 1709905763}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to start out by saying I really enjoy the base concept of the game.

As of right now there has not been any bug fixes; even if they did a release of minor fixes just to show that they are in fact working on them. Instead they are focused on releasing more servers instead of patching the game.\n\nThe housing realm is supposed to be able to host 6 people who can all live together on that realm but I have been playing on it with 2 other people and we are struggling with the limitations. I can only imagine how much more limiting it would be with the full 6. Your item limit is almost reached with just the crafting equipment and all the augmentations you need for the equipment as well as by the POI's in the game, and the items that they have inside of them. It makes it a nightmare for builders to even enjoy building let alone setting up a decent base. \n\nAlso be careful gearing up your helper that you recruit because they might just vanish on you along with all the equipment and items you gave them. \n\nI will change my review if I see some actual progress on the developers fixing the game but as it stands it's just too incomplete even for an early access. It feels as though no testing was done and they just released a half finished game to get as much money as they can from everyone.

Even though it's in early access this game feels more fleshed out that other full fledge games I've played. Yes, there are still bugs (though not nearly as many as skyrim STILL) and there are still some collision issues that need to be smoothed out. However, that just takes time and people finding those generated issues. Also, there are some elements/items that still have placeholder images for the artwork. Artwork assets are time consuming and honestly the lest bang for the buck when it comes to game develop. You interact with the code which is pretty darn smooth. \n\nHowever, YOU WILL NEED DECENT INTERNET. (not fiber or anything but steady at least 5-6 GB internet). Your machine will also need the specs they provide and lastly be up-to-date in your windows updates. I swear that most of the problems people are having with this game can be contributed to these two things. You can expect a standard computer to run an online, heavy graphic game. \n\nThe game play reminds me of Valhiem but a lot more quest structured and steampunk magic (where Valhiem is all Norse). It also reminds me of Ark in it's crafting system and how things function. Again, this game is in development but so far it has blown my expectations out of the water and the fact that they are continuing to work on it only makes me  more excited.

After logging 135 hours of play, I think it offers great value for its price point. And the game will only get more content as time goes on.\n\nVisual Appeal: Obviously the game shines with its beautiful graphics, which is likely a major draw for many players. The procedural generated landscapes in sprawling worlds are eye candy. If you\u2019re someone who enjoys exploring visually stunning worlds and building a home with epic backdrops, Nightingale will not disappoint.\n\nCombat System: Combat is straightforward yet satisfying. It rewards skilled players who leverage the mechanics more than those who simply button mash. The variety of interesting creatures, each with unique behaviours and weaknesses that adds to the combat experience.  Some of the bosses are quite strong, with challenging mechanics.\n\nResource Harvesting and Building: The core game play loop of resource harvesting, crafting, and building is addictive. The need to acquire specific resources from different realms keeps the game engaging. The building system is really user-friendly. It has no issues with 'clipping', so you won't see that annoying red outline when trying to drop the last piece of your epic mansion because it's an inch too close to something else. \n\nWorld Manipulation: You can influence realms on a global scale, altering their look and mechanics. This adds depth to the game play, allowing for varied experiences in different realms.  That has huge potential, but I'd like to see them do much more with this mechanic in the future.  Pro tip: This ability allows you to tailor your home world. If you plan to harvest a lot of lumber for a building project, modify your realm to increase lumber production. There's a lot of power there if you leverage it.\n\nChallenges and Areas for Improvement:\n\nThe game is not hand-holding, requiring players to figure out some aspects of the game. The crafting system, particularly the use of 'augments,' could be explained better. Being unfinished, some icons are placeholders, which can be a nuisance.  And the UI could use a quality of life rework.  A lot of bad reviews I'm seeing are that the game requires an online connection, but the developers are already working on an offline mode. The devs responsiveness to community feedback is a promising sign for the future development of the game. Also, the game needs the ability to craft from chest inventory, which the devs are working on as well. \n\nConclusion:\nIn its current state, I'd recommend Nightingale - it's more than worth the investment for those who enjoy crafting, building, and exploring beautiful and dangerous landscapes.", "timestamp_created": 1709484180, "timestamp_updated": 1709484180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159767851": {"recommendationid": "159767851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331514808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2072, "last_played": 1709473760}, "language": "english", "review": "Forrest Gump Simulator, run Forrest,runnnnnnn! ffs", "timestamp_created": 1709469902, "timestamp_updated": 1709469902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159745059": {"recommendationid": "159745059", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970626416", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 9551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3808, "last_played": 1710454047}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun.

The world and monsters are very lovely to look at and it feels amazing exploring it all and I look forward to new Biomes being released, I especially love the night time sky in different realms.\n2. Love being able to pick things up by holding down E, saves time in the long run.\n3. I really like being able to recruit a helper and they don't get encumbered like I can.\n4. Building is nice when your recruit can add mats to whatever you're building.\n\nCons:\n1. Tutorial is to long to keep most players interest, i didn't mind it but to keep the typical players interest I feel condensing \nit would help in the long run with getting more people into the game. \n2. Character creation is hit or miss after 3hrs of playing around with making a male and a female character they came out somewhat decent but other then that many of the preset faces are less then charming, I feel you need to add more options for eye shape, nose size, ears pointy and fangs so maybe you can RP as a human/fey hybrid, Hair types, textures, and clothing i feel need a bit more refinement lastly color sliders would be way better then preset color options because it give the player more range if they want to RP.\n3. Building is fun but the limited rotation is not, I find not being able to rotate 360 degrees smoothly a hassle considering most of the time things just wont line up nicely, placing storage bins/chests on shelves is a bit buggy and needs a bit of adjustment to fit nicely without clipping through.\n4. Crafting stations and augments can get very cluttered and I think if you just have them go into a upgrade slot might be a nicer option then having a canon inside the room.\n5. Monster AI some monsters just don't move at all and are looking into the distance contemplating their life choices.\n\n1. Suggestion that could be fun to play around with, the ability to make your recruit look however you want in character creation but you have to find them in the realms you explore at a rarer rate, it goes along with the lore too because it's like a companion you got separated from and are trying to find.\n\nAfter saying all that, I do enjoy the game with my friends these are just some things we all thought of to write to the devs and look forward to future updates.

Yes there are bugs, there are glitches, etc etc. But the devs are super responsive and quick when you report them. This game is clearly made with a lot of love, and I believe they deserve the chance to thrive. This is their first game as a team together and I personally have been having a ton of fun.\n\nSo let's start with the cons. \n\n- As mentioned above, bugs. Yeah there's a lot of them unfortunately. I think I've been a lot luckier than others I know for the most part. I think the worst bug I have encountered is dying in a loading screen, and that happened once. Otherwise it's only been minor stuff for me (trees taking a second to give wood, loading the environment taking longer than it should, etc).\n\n- The arachnophobia mode. If you are super afraid of spiders, based on my own assessment and those of my friends who are, the mode to \"fix\" them isn't great. It removes their legs and turns them into wings, but keeps their face. Which in some ways kind of makes it more terrifying?\n\n- Estate Address Cards. When you can teleport to your friends estates with this card, I dislike that it puts you at the portal on the map rather than where your friend's respite is.\n\nNow that's really all the cons I can think of for me personally. Let's move on to the pros.\n\n- Beautiful video game. I have been taking screenshots of the scenery since day one and it's genuinely breathtaking.\n\n- Satisfying crafts/building. I have seen some people complain about it, but this is the most fun I've ever had with a crafting survival game personally, and I think this is a big reason why. The structures you can build are great, and I feel accomplished as I complete harder and harder recipes. \n\n- You can pet the dog. I don't know if there's other pets, but the Twitch drop dog can be pet, even if it's just the grab animation. He does a little spin for you when you pet him.\n\n- Fun puzzles/trials. I enjoy the various things you have to do to complete the structures across the maps. From music notes, to runes, to jumping, to defending the area, and just killing. I've been enjoying all of it.\n\n- You can play with 6 people in a party. This makes me so happy.\n\n- End game is honestly fun to me. It makes me excited to see what else the devs come out with as time goes on too!\n\nOverall, Nightingale has been a blast for me. At the time of writing this I have 116 hours, and I have been having so much fun!

Nightingale is a faithful attempt to drag the crafting/survival genre back to a more serious, adult, and \"crunchy\" vibe. But, it is very bare-bones (IE. Absolutely early access) in its current state. Just for context, 7 Days and The Long Dark are my two gold standards of the genre - both games that involve a good deal of searching/improving your recipes, but ALSO makes room for an actual game while you climb the crafting ladder. Unfortunately, I feel No Man's Sky really broke the genre by turning the ladder into the game itself, but I digress. \n\nNightingale runs on Unreal Engine 5, which is absolutely gorgeous. The atmospherics are top-notch, which is a large part of why I love these games, but some of the models are a bit iffy. NPCs are stiff and awkward, lots of potato faces to go around, and the fur on those wolves looks like it never properly rendered. The core loop is (yet another) ladder climb, unfortunately, with little actual \"game\"... You jump through (very slow loading) portals into various procedurally generated realms in order to buy recipes to get you into the next tier of realms, etc. \n\nThe procedural generation, like NMS, really just noodles around the edges making most realms of a given type feel very same-y, and a single pass through all of the POIs in a realm is a fairly simple affair. Like Enshrouded, these POIs dot the map, and involve relatively little more than a simple puzzle or to kill a few mobs. Even the few-and-far-between dungeon delves seem mostly empty and hollow. However, the combat feels really great. \n\nCrafting is where this game shines, with an endless level of detail paid to material stats, levels of materials (tiers), enchantments, charms, etc. It's almost too much crunchy, to be honest, once you realize that there's a bazillion \"augments\" you need to keep around just to craft one or two items. Augments are similar to what we had in Valheim, where you put down an anvil within range of your smelter to buff the stats; except in Nightingale, you use augments to grant the ability to craft items you've unlocked (that wouldn't normally be available in the workbench without it). I personally LOVE the crunchiness of the crafting system, but I hope they streamline the management of all of it... because it's a lot. \n\nMy final comment here is the building system, which is awful. They clearly left this system for last. Whereas Enshrouded has a beautiful, deep building system that not only allows you to place prefabs that \"stitch\" neatly at the seams but also grants the ability to add/remove bits to your liking... Enshrouded is prefabs only. And not very many. There's also no way to upgrade/replace prefabs, sending everything attached and above the object you're removing crashing down to the ground. It's a crazy amount of unnecessary rework whenever you want to replace a foundation block, for example, as all attached walls, roofs, and crafting stations need to be manually moved first. Total pain. \n\nWhat's worse is, relocating to a new realm involves breaking everything down into components, shuttling those components through a portal (capped by weight limit) over the span of a dozen trips, rebuilding at the new location, and then cleaning up after yourself. Awful. \n\nThat all being said, the game in its current state sets a solid foundation for tons of content and improvements. I hope they stick with it and make the actual \"game\" part of the game more interesting. As it stands right now, I'm still enjoying the crafting and upgrading, but it's getting stale fast.", "timestamp_created": 1709400800, "timestamp_updated": 1709411419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159701454": {"recommendationid": "159701454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003974233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3049, "last_played": 1709397690}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot, right now, recommend this game. I have played it, walked away from it, come back to it, and left it just as fast.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n* Artwork is nice, the world is pretty.\r\n* Followers seem to follow you without too many problems (pathing-wise), they fight, and are easy to resurrect and get back to battle.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n* World travel is briefly explained, but you definitely feel like you have been thrown in the middle of a book  without much knowledge of anything before hand.\r\n\r\n* Without going online and searching how the cards work, how to get them, or what you need to get them, you are basically running around a farming treadmill until you figure out what you need to do. By that, I mean that the quest in the top right corner tells you what you have to do (most of the time) to progress the game, but it doesn't really tell you specifically you need a gear score of 30 to be able to enter this building. The building just has a force-field and no way to get into it, while your active quest says \"Get Gear Score 30\" - the link between the two is missing. Some people do not like it spelled out, but if you are trying to play the game without spoilers, it doesn't hurt to connect the dots in the beginning of the game.\r\n\r\n* Difficulty of cards - most of them are so non-descript in what they do, you don't really understand what you are doing. They have base descriptions, but you don't know the fine details. Which is worse, the Antiquarian cards versus the Astrolabe card? Middling danger or Moderate? Probably Moderate, but you have to guess which one it is by engaging a monster and seeing the level. if you die, it is a corpse run, and you better hope you did not end up in the path of a roaming group of monsters.\r\n\r\n*Small cards are realm cards that can change how the world works, and it is a cool take on changing your environment to suit your needs. A lot of them have a negative, or too negative of a, consequence to deal with it regularly, so you really only use it when you are farming something specific.\r\n\r\n* As has been said, the crafting is terrible. They need to overhaul the entire system and give the player more information about what each unit does, how to upgrade it, and why certain upgrades you build for the machines do not actually upgrade them. LIke adding bellows to the starter forge does not do anything. When you get the upgraded forge, it unlocks one recipe. The description says it adds about 10 items, but it doesn't. You have to unlock those recipes and then they can be used at the forge. It is the same for all equipment you have to build, and there is a lot. The game never tells you this though, so it looks like it should unlock everything.\r\n\r\n* The constant need to farm pelts gets old after the 3rd Fae Tower.  No way to store wood or grass, no way to store ores or rock in their own pallets. So you have to build an enormous amount of bags and place them all over your house, with limited inventory space, just to hold the extra starter items you are always going to need going forward. Always. You never stop needing animal hide, wood, grass, and stone. When I stopped playing I had over 15 bags in my house, that was crammed full of begging and upgraded machines, complete with the one-off items you build to enhance them.\r\n\r\n* repetitive monsters -  - in the beginning world, it was wolves and pigs. In the next world it was hippos and something else. In the desert it was scarabs and another monster. Then you had the regular monsters in the Fae towers for each world. All of them feel the same no matter the zones you go into, just different skins. Hippos, pigs, and scarabs will charge you and a simple side-step negates all advantage they had and you can kill them easily.  Fae die fairly quickly, but in numbers can overwhelm you.\r\n\r\n* Clothes - you stay in your starter clothes WAY TOO LONG. There is no progression until you upgrade like 3 or 4 machines to the advanced level, and farm all the materials for that, which is fairly far, play-time-wise, in the game.  Then you have to go farm another load of materials just to get new pants and a shirt. You keep the turban for the entire time (at least I did, I am sure there are other hats out there you can get), but I didn't find any unless I stole them from a follower.\r\n\r\nSummary: The game right now is just not very good. It has some great pieces to it, but it needs a lot more clarity in the tool-tips, more ways to store items, better clothing system, and new monsters with varying attacks/skills.\r\n\r\nMaybe give it another 6 months to a year and see if they can salvage it.\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1709399284, "timestamp_updated": 1709399284, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159686037": {"recommendationid": "159686037", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999712752", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2891, "last_played": 1711181900}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game already even though it has a lot of bugs atm.

PREPARED! You will probably die many times, and it is to be expected, so be sure to have your right gear, potions, charms and consumables in check.\n+ Exploration : Super fun! It feels like there's always something to do in the different realms. Sometimes you stumble upon something you didn't expect, or find the material you've been searching like a madman for. Take your time to enjoy the diversity of the various realms and have fun!\n+ Visuals : Gorgeous visuals, but with a few FPS drops here and there, and some stuttering from time to time. Could perhaps be a little more optimized. However, in general, I love the visuals and the various designs.\n+ Audio : Wonderful audio, tho sometimes it feels a little off. It can happen in small spaces where the sounds get a little hollow and metallic sounding.\n\n-CONS-\n- Combat : Repetitive, and can sometimes also be frustrating as hell, especially when it comes to bosses and some automatons. It can feel a little heavy and unresponsive.\n- Progression : As mentioned before, it's a grind fest. Be prepared to grind for the materials you need, and to go visit essence traders and sites all over the various reals to unlock the different weapons, outfits, augmentations and upgrades.\n- Animation: truth be told, the animation seems a little lacking to me. I often find that both myself and NPCs around the world just look like dead husks standing around, with the bare minimum of animation. Blinking, what is that? Just the smallest animations on items, props and NPC/PCs would make a whole lot of difference!\n- Still Early Release: I do feel it could have been far more polished. While I have enjoyed my time in the game so far, I am frustrated over the lack of icons, which are either replaced by a seal or a card with the game logo. I feel this is something that should have been done from the start, so the game at least felt a little more put together.\n- Survivors: You will end up getting frustrated with them. They tend to be everywhere where they shouldn't be, and when you need to talk to them they walk away, while in other cases, they're standing uncomfortably close to you. You can't do much with them, except give them a tool and they'll just start doing tasks automatically. You can't command them in any way and there doesn't seem to be any benefit to which type of survivor you take with you. They're good as pack-mules as they don't suffer from the same disadvantages as you do when over-cumbered.\n- Building is a bit wonky. I know we've been told why this is, but I still think it's idiotic. You can only place a chandelier if the roof above you is a roof and not a second floor. Plus, it's not too easy to build with the Tudor set. I have several roof edges sticking through the ceiling on my top floor because roofing with the Tudor set doesn't seem to be fully optimized. Hopefully, it will change in the future. Also, when you build things and want to undo what you just placed, it's not enough to just point the curser at the object and then press V. If you're not close enough, it will (for some stupid reason) delete the foundation/floor underneath you instead.\n- Cursor placement: You can't always count on the cursor placement. I you chop down logs on the ground, I have found that sometimes you need to focus on where your character is chopping, rather than where the cursor is. It means you sometimes have to dance around a log to find the spot where your axe will actually hit the damn thing.", "timestamp_created": 1709302640, "timestamp_updated": 1709302640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159603010": {"recommendationid": "159603010", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997537145", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3544, "last_played": 1710694665}, "language": "english", "review": "So far I really do like the game, but as is to be expected in early access there are also problems. \n\nTldr/c. : It's an EA for <30\u20ac with all the perks and flaws you'd expect.\nIf you want a finished Survival hit - wait for the full release. \nIf you don't like survival - this game propably won't win you over either.\nIf you really like survival and want something new that is rather good looking - go get it. \nThe Devs and Company are very active on the Discord server and pretty transparent regarding a lot of topics.  \n\nLet's start with the positives : \n- The art and style of the Game is suprep. I love the design ideas for the different build pallets and crafting stations. The enemies and creatures are interesting takes. The world and skybox are beautiful.\n\n- for Buildings so far there are seven different pallets, each with their own charm and unique style compared to the others. \n- The crafting is no new invention of the wheel, different materials with diffrent stats that you can mix and match to your needs or liking. So even if two people wear the same set of tools or armor. They could have 'wildly' differing stats depending on the materials used.\n\n- for now the story is not finished but the ideas presented are intriguing. The VO for Puck, a fae NPC, is very well done. \n- the progression, with the major and minor cards is a good idea with promising potential.\n\nNow for the negatives :\n\n- Loading times ... for a game that is centred around moving through portals into other worlds and stuff, having to wait  minutes every time you switch realms makes it kind of a slug. So far there seems to be no differenc between having the game on a SSD or a HDD, so gonna have to wait on optimization from the devs there. \n\n- Combat is okay-ish, some enemies have very wierd movments and at least for now some varaites go for quantity over quality.

As of the time of this review... there is no surprise or major awe.\n\nI want to explore lots of *unique* (\"infinite\") REALMS!  -- Right now, each \"Realm\" just feel like a set \"biome\" that is generated slightly differently each time. Therefore, this does not lead to that feeling of wanting to explore each nook-&-cranny of every new realm I enter, because there just isn't enough difference and variety (per biome) to make me feel like I'm seeing things I haven't seen before. \n\nThat said... \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 The overall *look* (or \"vibe\") of the environments, as well as the music, are both stunning and quite enjoyable! No complaints. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 The crafting system is amazing! It's one of the best crafting systems I've seen (recently) in a survival game. And other than not being able to craft items from the resources in our chests, I have no other major gripes about the crafting system! \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 The building system is serviceable, and can allow for some really neat looking structures, but ultimately could be better. We need to be able to build at angles, and not be so locked into the cookie-cutter boxes and placement locations -- especially for the decorations! We need more building pieces and decorations. But I do love that you can pre-plan your buildings (and can get 100% resources back when removing things)! If they can improve these things, I'll be quite happy! \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 The combat system is also serviceable, and is decently engaging, but it could also be better. We need more enemy types (always!), and I feel like the combat mechanics could be tightened up a bit -- especially in terms of enemy AI! But I don't hate the combat outright... there is a decent tactile feeling to swinging and landing melee hits (or firing weapons and landing shots) -- this is a definite plus! So, if they can improve some of the combat, in certain ways, it will be amazing! \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Finally, the Realm system is such an amazing concept, but, as stated above, is only *barely* serviceable as of the time of this review. We need at *least* 3 more biome cards -- ASAP! And, if you ask me, the game could uses a system for the POI's, where the procedural AI, that generates each realm, would pull from a pool of hand-crafted POI's and other realm-specific landmarks, etc. -- and would not just use the same POI's again and again. Because, as it stands, once you've seen each biome (Forest, Desert, Swamp), you've basically seen them all. And the major & minor cards just aren't making me feel like I'm witnessing the possibility of \"infinite realms!\" \u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u25ab The Major cards just feel like a linear story-progression / gear-score check type of system -- with some NPC/narrative elements (and blueprints) locked behind each tier of major card. Thus far, I haven't seen any Major card *radically* change any of the biomes to the point of being surprised by an \"infinite\" possibilities of unique realms. \n\n \u25ab And the minor cards are merely for a realm-wide buff / de-buff system, that usually comes with a change in the environment's color pallet and other minor effects. \n\n\ud83d\udccc In summary... \nI'm 60 hrs in (and I'm only Gear Score 70 -- out of 200+)! I definitely do plan to keep playing, because I'm a sucker for a good crafting system!  Averaging my star ratings, for the 5 categories above, I would give the game = 3.6 / 5 stars.\n\nAt this time though, the gameplay-loop (and realm system) does feel a bit stale to me -- the game needs even more \"shock & awe\" added in (new enemies, new biomes, etc etc etc). I want to explore \"infinite realms\" of \"infinite possibilities!\" \n\nHowever, I can see the *vast* potential this game has, and I'm totally here for it, because there is enough that I do like, that I can overlook the things I don't love just yet. \n\nSo, the reason I'm recommending the game, is because I do believe there are individuals who will love this type of game, and should definitely try it out, especially while it's cheaper (during Early Access). It's not a perfect game (yet), but it has so much going for it, and has a stellar team of devs working on it -- and they appear (so far) to be quite responsive to their community! So, I feel like that should be praised. \n\nThat said... this game, in its current state, will not be for everyone. Some people hate the always-online element. I personally don't, but its an understandable gripe. Some may find the game boring, because some elements of it are! But the Devs have already shown they have every intention of fixing a lot of these issues, and adding more content....

I have been very pleasantly surprised. Especially for a sub-$30 early access game.\n\nPros:\nThe game is absolutely gorgeous from the mini icons to the giant multi-moon skies. Hell, even the placeholder icon for items looks amazing. This includes the MANY different style options for housing and what I think is, at minimum, a very unique clothing and weapon style.\n\nThe combat feels good. The thunk sound of a maul accompanied with the enemy being knocked down is extremely satisfying as well as the gold letters and \"dink\" noise of landing a crit. I also like the noticeable difference in damage you get by making a weapon with crude t1 mats vs min-maxed t2/t3 mats. Also very much enjoy the visuals and feel of the Enchantment spells. Watching someone gather up a bunch of bound and then everyone aoe-ing them down with quake and a maul is hilariously fun.\n\nWhile a bit confusing at first (and admittedly even now a little), the realm system is very cool. My current situation is my friends and I have one persons world where we go and contribute most of the mats to have sort of a 'hub' to go and craft anything we want but also have our own home worlds to go and build if/when we want. And the idea that if this person quits, I still have a portal to go and make things whenever I want is very nice. \n\nI also think the system at The Watch with being able to just do basically 'open' dungeons with other people is cool, most of the time.\n\nOh, and Puck. More Puck please.\n\nCons:\nSeveral things in the game take a long time. If you have 100 ore to smelt I think it takes something like over an hour real-time to smelt and portals take a long time to open. That being said, if you throw on 1000 ore before long-resting it will instantly complete so that's nice. Would be great to also see a queue in the crafting  stations to craft multiple things at once.\n\nThe followers are a bit robotic and often very frustrating. I have found that they sometimes vanish and that I very often have to check their inventory lest I want them to help use mats to randomly help build something out in the world. \n\nHaving to go back and farm t1/t2 essence kinda sucks. I get that it makes an incentive to go back to lower realms but it would be nice to have a way to convert t3 essence into the lower ones. (This one may just be a me problem, and there could be some recipe or method I'm just unaware of but I haven't seen anything yet).\n\nAll that being said, I have had a blast playing this game and can't wait to see what the future holds as the devs seem VERY responsive to what the players want.", "timestamp_created": 1708919879, "timestamp_updated": 1708919879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159299510": {"recommendationid": "159299510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024480670", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 616, "last_played": 1709620378}, "language": "english", "review": "If one thing is clear about Nightingale, it's that the devs want their game to succeed and thrive. \nI haven't gotten far into the game due to waiting on the now released Oceanic servers. \nThe game world is stunning when it comes to sound and graphics.

Most of the negative reviews I've seen here can be refuted with the following questions: have you ever played a survival game? Have you ever played an early access game? Have you ever heard of fae as a concept?\nThe game is clean, it's significantly more polished than most early access games, and it's genuinely been fun. Several aspects could use a little more work, yes, but very little even warrants mentioning: there are many missing icons, some portals take a little too long to open (when there are no encounters attached to the opening), the UI could do with another QOL pass and takes some getting used to, probably some more work on optimization - even so, my GPU is min specs and I'm playing really smoothly on performance mode with very few fps dips. There was one instance of crafted items mysteriously disappearing when my partner and I tried to use a crafting station at the same time, but it was a low-level healing item and it hasn't happened again. If so many people are complaining about connection issues, there must be something to it, but I haven't faced any, and my partner and I are playing from different continents. There are some quirks with the crafting that can also be improved - for example, being unable to turn two different, but same-tier pelts into leather, as well as the crafting queue either not functioning properly or being a mystery to work out. \nAll of this, in my eyes, is within the realm of expected and acceptable for an early access title. If this stuff is not addressed soon, sure, we can get annoyed. But seriously, it's early access. It's right there on the store page. We know what we're getting into.\nI'm early on in the game, so my thoughts may yet change; maybe the building will eventually feel limiting or late-game crafting may take too long, I may encounter more bugs, it can just abruptly turn boring, I don't know yet.

Apart from bugs and no offline mode that a lot of people complained about already I feel like the crafting system is way too complicated and progression is too slow.\n\nHere are some issues I encountered: \n-Crafting time for most items is way too long. It takes 30 mins to smelt 30 ingots of the lowest tier.\n-I seem to never have enough wood (or any other material tbh), the forest near my base is non existent at this point. I have a life, I don't want to gather materials in a game for 4 hours.\n-Decorative items that unlock recipies are getting blocked by walls, stairs and beams so i HAVE to put them near the bench so they would connect, I also have to put any other bench that connects to the item closer. Decorative items should stay only decorative, this system is very limiting.\n-The tier system is so confusing, materials need to be color coded or the whole tier system reworked.\n-I hate the fact that we can't put respite in any other realm other than starter ones. In a trailer it was said that we can build anywhere.\n-When I put my second respite down the previous one didn't get destroyed and fast travel sends me to my spawn point. ( had to make a new character)\n-We can't dye clothes. There are paints and pigment though so maybe they will add it in the future.\n-UI needs a lot of work, for starters i feel like hp bar, rest and hunger need to be in the upper left corner. Would've been nice if I could see my gear score there too. The inventory UI is too big and clunky.\n-Locking players out of dungeons cuz of their gear score is not a good idea, would've been more fun if we could take on a challenge or die trying.\n-Dungeon gates don't have any difficulty indicators.\n-You can put a waypoint but can't track a point of interest, not a big deal but would've been nice if we could track them.\n-Having limited space in inventory AND having a weight capacity is too much, pick one.\n-Followers should have a bit more space in their inventory. If the gear is applied, why is it still in the inventory taking up space?\n-Benches don't pull items from containers.\n-Climing is very clunky, there is no point of having climing picks cuz they eat up all the stamina and u won't even climb half a meter. \n-Regular climbing doesn't work half the time and animation is too slow and feels like I'm a toddler climbing a chair.\n-Make rest and hunger go down slower when idle.\n-No crafting queue.", "timestamp_created": 1708912652, "timestamp_updated": 1708912915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159289175": {"recommendationid": "159289175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302574356", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1253, "last_played": 1709513895}, "language": "english", "review": "Issa nice =]", "timestamp_created": 1708905725, "timestamp_updated": 1708905725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159286568": {"recommendationid": "159286568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048582536", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 94, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1713047280}, "language": "english", "review": "Great start to the story and introduction to the plot and various crafting mechanics.

FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. This is one of the most impressive looking games i have seen in ages, just the look and feel as im wandering around my little starter island scrabbling for junk to survive. You can see a good range into the distance and spot points of interest from a good high point. Lore items you find through the area are interesting and well written. The game is just fun and i am greatly enjoying myself in it.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, Devs Listen!!!! BE AMAZED!!!! As the game was set as \"always online\" which is kinda.. Meh..? in a single player game, a couple times i had horrible issues with lag that ended up with me dying, but only realizing so after i had reconnected. Offline will save some time for those weird reclusive solo players. Like myself. But online option is great as i have several friends interested in playing and this will make a great group game as well.\r\n\r\nCompanions are a bit.. eh? You cant really order them as far as i can tell. they just follow you around and stare blankly into the distance, join fights against enemies a bit late (but still nice having extra hand to help fight, or at least draw attacks while i heal), and occasionally do collection stuff like smashing rocks and all if you give them the tools. Sadly you cant really direct them to do things, and they get a wild hare up their ass on occasion, like when my companion carrying all my lumber, wood, and other things of the like decided to feed them all right into my furnace.. I... Was sorely tempted to see how \"friendly\" fire worked there.\r\n\r\nBUT maybe that will come in the future!

This is helpful when you plan the layout of your buildings. Doesn't give you too much creative freedom very early on in the game. \n\nThere are 10,000 crafting tables to make. I am a survivalcraft player and I like this. The Augment system is really nice and makes you think about how you will arrange your furniture/crafting tables inside your base. \n\nCombat is fked up in 3rd person, your crosshairs doesn't seem to aim where it is supposed to. Your ranged weapons(GUNS) aren't significantly stronger than your stupid pocket knife. Combat in 1st person is horrible bec. melee fighting means i will be up close and personal with the enemies' ugly disgusting faces. Moreover, I hate first person perspective. I like being able to see the back of my characters when playing games like these. They did add the 3rd person feature but it is not playable in that state, my damn person would be looking down on the floor 90% of the time when in 3rd person. \n\nThe procedurally generated worlds seem nice at first but, having gone thru all 3 flavors (forest, desert and swamp) of each item level, its basically the same worlds with the same enemies and resources.\n\nThe tutorial in this game is not great, just bombards you with a wall of text.

The game is currently in Early Access, so it is constantly evolving and improving. Despite some technical and gameplay issues, it also offers some interesting and original aspects, that make it worth attention.\n\nAmong the strengths of Nightingale, we can mention:\n\n- The unique and fascinating artistic style, that mixes steampunk and fantasy elements, creating various and suggestive environments.\n- The intriguing and mysterious story, that leads you to explore the different realms of the Fae, mythical beings drawn from European folklore, in search of the magical city of Nightingale, the last refuge of humanity.\n- The well-made building mechanics, that allow you to create your base and customize it with various objects and structures, using materials and resources that you find in the world.\n- The possibility to play cooperatively with other players, sharing resources, challenges and discoveries.\n- The card dynamics, that allow you to create the realms randomly, using cards that you obtain by exploring or completing missions. These cards have different characteristics, such as climate, vegetation, fauna, dangers, resources, etc. By combining the cards, you can create unique and different realms, that offer new challenges and opportunities.\n\nAmong the points to improve of Nightingale, instead, we can point out:\n\n- The challenging and complex gameplay, that requires a lot of patience and dedication to progress, without offering much guidance or explanation.\n- The simple and little varied combat, especially in the first part of the game, where you use primitive weapons and face uninteresting enemies.\n- The performance and stability issues, that cause lag, FPS drops and various bugs, especially when playing online.\n\nIn conclusion, Nightingale is a game that has potential, but that is still in development. If you like survival and crafting games, and you are willing to tolerate some flaws, you might find it fun and original. Otherwise, you might wait for the game to be further developed and improved, before trying it.\n\n------------------------\n\nNightingale \u00e8 un gioco di sopravvivenza e crafting ambientato in un\u2019epoca vittoriana alternativa, dove la magia \u00e8 presente e viaggiare tra i regni \u00e8 possibile. Il gioco \u00e8 attualmente in Early Access, quindi \u00e8 in continua evoluzione e miglioramento. Nonostante alcuni problemi tecnici e di gameplay, offre anche alcuni aspetti interessanti e originali, che lo rendono degno di attenzione.\n\nTra i punti di forza di Nightingale, possiamo citare:\n\n- Lo stile artistico unico e affascinante, che mescola elementi steampunk e fantasy, creando ambienti vari e suggestivi.\n- La storia intrigante e misteriosa, che ti porta a esplorare i diversi regni della Fae, esseri mitici tratti dal folklore europeo, alla ricerca della citt\u00e0 magica di Nightingale, l\u2019ultimo rifugio dell\u2019umanit\u00e0.\n- Le meccaniche di costruzione ben fatte, che ti permettono di creare la tua base e personalizzarla con vari oggetti e strutture, usando materiali e risorse che trovi nel mondo.\n- La possibilit\u00e0 di giocare in cooperativa con altri giocatori, condividendo le risorse, le sfide e le scoperte.\n- La dinamica delle carte, che permette di creare i reami in modo casuale, usando delle carte che si ottengono esplorando o completando missioni. Queste carte hanno diverse caratteristiche, come il clima, la vegetazione, la fauna, i pericoli, le risorse, ecc. Combinando le carte, si possono creare reami unici e diversi tra loro, che offrono nuove sfide e opportunit\u00e0.\n\nTra i punti da migliorare di Nightingale, invece, possiamo segnalare:\n\n- Il gameplay impegnativo e complesso, che richiede molta pazienza e dedizione per progredire, senza offrire molta guida o spiegazione.\n- Il combattimento semplice e poco vario, soprattutto nella prima parte del gioco, dove si usano armi primitive e si affrontano nemici poco interessanti.\n- I problemi di performance e stabilit\u00e0, che causano lag, cali di FPS e bug vari, soprattutto quando si gioca online.\n\nIn conclusione, Nightingale \u00e8 un gioco che ha delle potenzialit\u00e0, ma che al momento \u00e8 ancora in fase di sviluppo. Se ti piacciono i giochi di sopravvivenza e crafting, e sei disposto a sopportare alcuni difetti, potresti trovarlo divertente e originale. Altrimenti, potresti aspettare che il gioco venga sviluppato ulteriormente e migliorato, prima di provarlo.", "timestamp_created": 1708844785, "timestamp_updated": 1708886430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159205770": {"recommendationid": "159205770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044724860", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 631, "last_played": 1709333535}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is beautiful, creative, and balances survival, crafting, and combat well.

Really enjoying the game so far and excited to see where it goes.  The realm card system is unique and gives a lot of variety to play.  Love the ability to have some control over difficulty.  My family plays and our youngest player has struggled with other survival games when difficulty increases.  I have played other early access games, and want to give a shout out to the Dev team for releasing a product that is remarkably bug free when compared to other early access games.  So far we have run into a couple of lag spikes with enemies spawning into encounters and with transport between realms (literally only a couple in almost 20 hrs of play).  Solid and great looking game.  Enjoying the Victorian/Fae theme.  Have not yet found the lack an off line option to be much of a hindrance, though I do understand how this may impact some.  Would love a bit more variety in early game weapons (such as crude clubs and/or spears), would love a bit of early customization on clothing/\"armor.\"  Maybe a dye bench as there are already similar style (saw, sewing bench, etc) crafting benches in the game.  The character creation is very individualized, would be a nice bonus to carry this over into the game.    My family and I are very much enjoying this game so far and look forward to continuing to play.\n\nUpdate at nearly 200 hrs played: \nI still enjoy this game.  Love the Minor Card system and the unique opportunities it allows in the realms to tailor the play experience.  Grinding for building materials? Play a card to increase the yield of stone.  How about farming for better food items?  There is a card for this too as well as charm to increase yield and augmentations to increase grow speed.  \nThis game is still beautiful to see.  It has a decent start for a story line with lots of room to grow.  \n\nThings I have learned: \nColor of clothing/items is determined by the materials used to craft them.\nThere are placeholders in the recipes for items that are intended in the game, but not yet available in early access (This is expected/anticipated in early access.  Not all content is yet available.)\n\nHelper NPC's are a blessing and a curse.  They have no weight limit which is amazing when gathering resources.  They tend to stroll off when you are trying to give them heavy items, leaving you chasing them at a crawl.  Their is also no way to control how they help.  What I mean by this is some very high end wood can get shoved into a fireplace as they restock fuel or used to assist with building.  It is a great concept that they can help with these things, but the execution isn't totally in place and will need more work before this is truly functional.  Lesion learned- check every fire place before igniting.   Don't set down a new item to build until their inventory is completely empty.  Keep their access shut off for all chests.  \n\nThere are some bugs.  I will still say that I have experienced fewer of these with this others (here's looking at you ARK).  Hot bar items can appear as shovels on log in or just after portal to a new realm.  This is very easily fixed by opening inventory and running your mouse over the icons.  Trees will sometimes fall through the world when you cut them down instead of dropping logs.  You can lose server connection on transition through a new portal and/or time needed to do this can be a bit long (3 min-ish).  This is a moderate frequency issue happening about every 3rd (ish) realm transition in my experience.  I know some players get a lot more of this happening.  Recruited Helper NPC's can suddenly disappear on log in to a realm (has happened twice to me in nearly 200 hrs of play).  Any upgraded gear that was on them is just gone.  You cannot recover them and will need to recruit again and upgrade yet more gear.  I anticipate these being further addressed through Bug fixes and as the game progresses through early access. \n\nThings that I think could be better addressed: \nItem limit cap per realm.  Currently set to 350.  I love to build, love to decorate, and want very much to be able to do this in my Abeyance Realm.  This is independent of the structure limit (currently 100 structures per realm) or the build limit (300 walls/foundations/ceilings/etc) per building.  Honestly the 100 structures and 300 build are things that can be worked with.  The 350 items is profoundly limiting.  It is per realm- not per person.  If you partner up and share an Abeyance Realm with another individual or group, even sharing a central crafting area you will quickly run through this limit with augmentations, storage, and lighting.  Forget decorating.  I LOVE the complexity of the crafting system.  I like working through the best set up to make the benches efficient, finding the best augments for the recipes I want.....I hate not being able to organize and create something visually pleasing because cosmetic considerations need to be removed in order to stay under this limit.  \nReclaimed Ingots/Folding: (Please realize that I am not a game developer or coding expert.  I do not know how difficult it may be to \"fix\" a system in this manor).   The combination of various materials to affect color and attributes of items/weapons/clothing is awesome.  It is creative and fun.  It can allow for some exploits.  There has been back/forth in maintenance updates to address this.  Rather than take a very nice, creative feature out of the game, would suggest capping items.  If you never intended a riffle to be able to reach a million damage- that is fine.  Cap the damage.  Players can combine anything they wish, but once the max damage is reached, that is it.  It continues to allow for the creativity but limits the game breaking possibilities.

Crafting is involved and intricate (though that's not obvious in the first dozen or so hours).\n\nIt's not all roses.

As a reader of Susanna Clarke, I 'got it' right away. As I am playing, I am excited, not only in the world itself, but the graphics, and the entirely novel and deep systems it brings to the table. Everything about the game both surprised and enchanted me. \n\nThen I look on Steam and see reviews are mixed. How so? Fortunately, most of these are of the 'mummy, I've peed my pants' school of criticism. However, there are some genuine observations too - should you have the will to dig for them. Yes I would like to play offline (but guess what? This is being implemented.). Yes the menus are a bit clunky - I cannot tell you how many times I have fought an enemy holding just an umbrella! I think the menus will have some reaching for the refund button, but as soon as you become used to them - they are just fine. Yes the crafting takes time - but as a veteran of crafting games, I have played a lot worse. I remember one game where you had to craft individual bricks to make a house! Now, I would not go that far, but (for me) it reduces the immersion if crafting is too simple. *Understand the systems* before complaining. Just load up your crafting stations and set them running, go to bed  - hey ho, everything is ready when you wake up. Combat *is* a little clunky at the moment, but if I wanted it harder, I would up the difficulty - seems easy to me. \n\nHere is a thought - the game is clearly defined as being in Early Access. By now, we should all know what that means. If you don't here goes: You have bought the game with the full knowledge that it is not a finished product (moan at yourself, rather than the devs if you did not understand this). Then, the whole point of early access is for the devs to get feedback from the community, and to use this feedback to develop the game to be the game that the community wants to play. May I humbly suggest that positive feed back is more effective than 'boy have I had a bad day at work' style griping.\n\nI cannot imagine the amount of resources, time and hard-won skill went into this game. For my part, I always feel the urge to celebrate such things. I feel this adds more niceness than squirting out a dribble of bile. I want to acknowledge any achievements made, thank those that provide me with pleasure, and encourage those that do to continue working. \nHere is the thing - I am glad this was an instant purchase for me, and that I did not look at the overall score of 'mixed', as this is a signal to me that perhaps I should pass. I am not the only one that make decisions on this premise - in an increasingly toxic world, perhaps I need to review my stance? The obvious result of 'mixed' is that less people buy the game - That the devs get less funding and eventually get into financial difficulties and stop work on the game - or, as we have seen far too many times in the past year - have to close the studio and seek other work. So, if you hate the game (or your life) so much, this is certainly an effective tool to consider in that act of killing it. \n\nThat out of the way - I thank the devs for providing me we an immersive and  unique experience, and give me an alternative world to counteract the terrible one I find myself in. It is the most excited I have been in a game for a long, long time, and a game I see myself getting lost in for years. \n\nMixed yes - but a mix of pleasure and appreciation.", "timestamp_created": 1708784743, "timestamp_updated": 1708785031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159137354": {"recommendationid": "159137354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006935974", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1808, "last_played": 1711146240}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm having a great time.

At the time of review i have played 16 hrs.\nAt this time i cannot recommend buying Nightingale.\n\nPros\n- Nightingale is a survival craft game, you collect materials, you craft things and you build a base. These things are fun in Nightingale.\n- You can play solo or coop (up to 6 players). All players can quest together and access chests, this works pretty well.\n- Random worlds can be created via portals, if you like exploring you will always have a new world at hand.\n- The graphics are good (in my opinion).\n- You can switch between mouse & keyboard and a gamepad. This works well. Personally i use gamepad for movement and combat. For crafting, building and sorting my inventory i prefer using mouse and keyboard.\n\nCons\n- Animations are bad. The way the character moves etc. looks unnatural.\n- The hit boxes are terrible. You never know where your hit will land. Hitting a moving enemy with a bow is a game of luck. But even if i stand face to face to an enemy hitting him with a melee weapon i miss a lot. Even gutting corpses with a hunting knife will only work after some fruitless attempts. Or hitting a tree, it sometimes just does not work correctly. This problem is always there no matter if you use mouse&keyboard or a controller.\n- Materials: if you collect meat, hide, fibers etc. you will get variations of that material depending on the source. In my opinion this is unnecessary and makes crafting more complicated than it has to be. For example you need 2 hides but you only have 2 different hides than you can not put them into the crafting slot. You need 2 identical hides. And your chests will fill quickly with all the variations of meat, hide, fibers etc. Everything starts a new stack. If a developer should read this: why not just 1 sort of meat, hide, bone etc?\n- Long loading screens: everytime you log into the game or use the portal to a different world, you will have to wait appr. 3 minutes \u2026\n- Nightingale is in EA, but in my opinion it was released at least 6 months too early. Comparing Enshrouded and Nightingale i have to say that Enshrouded is a lot more polished and nearly bug free. The things that are implemented work fine in Enshrouded. Not so in Nightingale: The stone pile which is your binding point will randomly stop working, then you will enter the map at the default position (in my case at the other side of the island \u2026 1000m to walk \u2026 every time this happens). Some items don\u2018t have icons. Sometimes your character cannot sprint anymore, if you are using a keyboard and have connected a controller.

But this game is all i had hoped for. been waiting for a very long time for this to come out. I am not disappointed.  That being said it is early access but seems very polished for that. lots more content to come I am sure. I still have a lot to see for now anyway, so I am very happy to see this title. I am disappointed to see all the complaints on this game. It is early access and there are risks to getting into early access. You are paying to kind of be a play tester and to provide feedback to a developer so they can polish their game and when they are a legit dev they are getting funded to help them continue development. in this case I believe in this developer as they have provided a polished early access game. it shows their vision and that vision is absolutely amazing. I've not even unlocked any other realms than forest at this point and I'm excited to see more. \n\nIs it perfect? no its not as there are some confusing thing's but Iv'e been able to figure them all out so they are not game breaking just a little annoying and maybe not intuitive for me. But if I will do my part and note these things and report them to the Dev's it might spark them to think, hey you know what we didn't see that, and they fix it or improve it.  I have never done game development before but I've done some creative things and sometimes in the middle of my creativity I am blinded to certain things because I don't see it and that's because i know it and it makes perfect sense to me. so Dev's keep up the work and keep listening to your community you got a banger on your hands. Love what you are doing and am enjoying the adventure. \n\nTo anyone thinking about this game. Again its early access so its not finished. you may have to play through many different times thanks to you getting to an end point in the early access and not having more to do yet and when they do add new content your like I don't remember all the details of what I went though or you might just need to start over to catch some new things. who knows? its the risk you take to get in and play a work in progress. \n\nTo all the complainers about network issues. ITS EARLY ACCESS and not all early access is a cash grab. some are yes they exist but some are not. I believe these Dev's really have passion. if you look at what is actually in this game right now they didn't do no copy pasta that I can see. maybe there are some asset flips I don't know. a lot of games have stuff in them that look like stuff in another game but sometimes I've go to a friends house they have the same TV I do or something else so i don't normally notice the sameness of a desk or a wall from one game to another unless I've seen it a lot. and yes I've seen same assets in many different games plenty of times. so far the assets in this game look as unique as they can I mean a table is a table after all. but so far all the placeables I've seen look unique to me. creature design looks to be crafted with love and care. I mean a boar is boar right? but at least its not the same boar I've seen in 900 other early access  games I've played.  and as for the aforementioned network issues I bought this game day one. i got in a couple hours late and have had very few network issues. have I had 0 no not 0 but less than 10 or so. \n\nFor all the people with network issues I'm sorry you had them. Wish they hadn't happened as this game deserves High praises and Maybe I'm wrong could this be all we ever see from the dev's? I don't think so but anything is possible these are the risks of buying anything that's not finished. I am counting on the dev's to finish it and I'm sure they will but I guess time will tell. I'm hoping to put in my entire weekend off on this game and get past the 30 hour mark and hope there will still be more to do or a patch gets released with new content before I exhaust what is available in the game now.  and if exhaust the content tonight I will still be satisfied with my purchase as I'm sure more is coming and TBH I've almost got my moneys worth already and I'm sure I'll get a lot more of my monies worth out of this title. \n\nsorry for ramblings but I had to say the above and probably have a lot more i need to say but you get the point and I apologize for the poor grammar and sentence structure I was never good at all that and I just vomit out my thoughts. \n\nAnyway I wrote the above for 3 reasons.\nA) For people trying to figure out if the reviews are correct. Go watch some good streamers play this and see if you like what you see. if this type of game is something you like then I think you will love this one. \nB) To encourage the Dev's as I believe in their vision or at least what I see of their vision so far.  :-)\nC) All the bad reviews about networking issues and if there are any people that gave it a negative because it has bugs. this game is early access if you don't understand what that is go get educated and if you cant then please stop buying early access games. They are probably not for you!!!!\n\nHope this helps someone and please just get educated before you buy a game so you know what your getting yourself into. I've bought games I didn't like but I could see that they were probably good games just not my type of game. so if I reviewed I would not say this game sucks (At least I hope I didn't or wouldn't) I Might say hey not my kind of game so see if it's yours before you buy it. NO need to thumbs down a game just because it isn't my style of game and I thought it was going to be.

I will list a few things below that you should know before picking this one up. I have had only 1 time I got booted from a world due to connectivity of the servers. It being online all the time does not bother me as we don't play games forever despite what some people seem to think. Also this does limit the audience a bit. But this is an Early access game and the Devs addressed that yesterday. \nThings to know. \n1. This is a marathon not a sprint. There is a little bit of grind to the game. After 12 hrs of play I have yet to find a gun and am still using the simple tools you craft early on. So dont expect to be lighting fae up with a shotty in the first few hrs. \n2. Character creator is rough. While you have freedom I feel this and the models needs some work. They are just ugly and rough. It is better than some games in the genre but I feel like making a character is like a who is the least ugly contest. \n3. World is gorgeous and i could see this becoming a relaxing game for some people. The customization of the world is amazing. Love everything about the realm game play. \n4. Probably by design you can only have 1 follower. Aid quests seem a bit pointless to complete when you cant have more than 1 follower. \n5. \"What is this similar to?\" It takes from a few different games. Its survival crafting but I like the fact that their is a story line and a clear goal. Open ended is great but its refreshing to have something specific to do and work on. Makes it feel like skyrim with crafting survival elements. \n\nOverall the game is fun. As a solo player I enjoy it a lot. I know the Devs had a big focus on multiplayer which is why we have the online only mode. I just dont see a ton of people in the genre playing this multiplayer. Most of us play solo and then move on to another game until updates come to the old one. \n\nIf I had to rate it I'd give it a 7/10. It is an acquired taste and I am one who was really excited for this one.

Upgrade and customize your structures, and form communities to safely live off the land. You can even recruit NPC workers to help harvest resources as you work to expand your property.\"  \n\nI took this to mean that you could build buildings for different harvesting and crafting purposes and hire NPCs to work for you.  You can only hire one NPC and they basically follow you around to help fight things and they will randomly harvest resources if you equip them with a harvesting tool.  That was pretty misleading.  The \"management\" aspect doesn't exist.\n\nOtherwise the game has been okay but a little boring.  Other games have done the initial survival loop a lot better and made it more interesting.  I understand the early game hand holding to teach you the mechanics of the card system but most survival games just drop you into a new world with no explanation and want you to figure out what you are supposed to do on your own.

Now that it's out, I bought it immediately and I've already put more time into it than I really should. It's not a perfect game by any means and it's definitely early access and therefore unfinished. However it's got some really cool stuff. I'm editing my review to give some more details on the cool stuff in the hope that it convinces more people to buy this amazing game. The TLDR is that I love the crafting system, I love the realm system, and combat turns out to be more deep than I first thought too. Added bonus, building buildings has a few nice features that I really enjoy. Extra extra bonus is some suggestions/advice.\n\nGood thing number 1: The crafting system\nThe crafting system seems kind of basic and confusing at first. Unfortunately one of the biggest weakpoints of this game is that the new player experience is rough and unfinished. It took me a lot of experimentation to discover all the cool things that the crafting system can do.\n1. Some of the minor realm cards can give boosts to crafted items. I've got one currently up that boosts the durability of the clothes and tools I build. I have another minor realm card that increases how much ammo is crafted at a time letting me save materials. There are a ton of these minor realm cards and although not all of them affect the crafting system, some of them do.\n2. Each crafted tool/clothes has some attributes on it. Each crafting material above the crude level has some attribute modifiers on it. If the modifier on a material matches the attribute of the tool, then using that material will boost the relevant stat. This lets you customize your tools and clothes to some degree. For example, my knife is focused heavily on boosting crit damage and since it attacks faster than the mining pick, if I get crits on a regular basis then it can out damage the two handed mining pick made with melee damage boosting materials.\n3. Each piece of gear that is uncommon (green) or better can have infusions applied to them. Only 1 infusion for green gear but more for higher levels. These infusions offer extra attribute modifiers.\n4. Each piece of gear can be updated for just some essences at the upgrade station. So even the simple gear set can be upgraded to green and gain infusions, enchantments, and charms.\n5. Enchantments are spells that can be put on the tools. Putting it on your tool increases it's gear score and boosts it but it also lets you cast the relevant spell. This could be a recovery spell for healing yourself. It could be a spell to boost your harvesting/mining. I've only got a few spells unlocked but I look forward to seeing what other spells are in the game.\n6. Every piece of clothing can have a charm put on it. These offer bonuses of varying sorts. My favorite is the Charm of Bounty that boosts how many resources are harvested at a time. It makes it so that a single swing of a sickle gives a lot more than just 1 or 2 plant fibre. Another charm boosts speed after getting a crit. Another boosts damage after using an emote. These also seem to boost the gear score and possibly other attributes on the item too.\n7. You don't need special tools, items, or benches to repair your gear if it breaks. You just right click on the item in your inventory and click repair. It will cost some essence but essence is easy to get. Just go swing the sickle around a bit to collect some crude plant fiber (you do have the charm of bounty right?) and then right click on it and extract it. Now you've got the essence to repair your gear.\n\nGood thing number 2: The realm system\n1. The realms are gorgeous.\n2. Some minor realm cards can change the way the realms look. One of them makes the stars visible even during the day. This is super cool and looks gorgeous.\n3. The different biomes have different challenges, creature types, and resources. It makes it fun to explore new realms and collect new resources.\n4. The more advanced realms offer more interesting things to see/do.\n5. You can go to a private realm and basically play solo (even though yes it is always online) or pick a public realm if you don't mind potentially running into people.\n6. You can choose your difficulty when you open the portal. If you find the swamps to be challenging, maybe you want to play those realms on a lower difficulty but the forests are too easy so you want them to be more difficult.\n7. The abeyance realm is your hub/estate/respite and you can always return to it by clicking \"travel to respite\" on your map. Don't bother building big bases on other realms.\n\nGood thing number 3: The combat system is deeper than I first thought.\n1. At first the combat system seems simplistic. Swing your tools at enemies to do damage and sometimes get a satisfying sound effect and golden damage numbers for doing a crit. Then I realized that the crits aren't chance based. Hit a creature in it's weakpoint and it gives you a crit.\n2. Each creature has it's own weakpoint. For most, it's the head but automaton bishops are too tall to reach their heads and some creatures don't have \"heads\". However they still have weakpoints to hit and once you learn them, combat becomes more interesting.\n3. Heartshots. Everybody knows what a headshot is. It's standard in first person games and this one is no different, except that melee weapons can also get headshots. However this game adds the concept of heartshots too. It only seems to work for ranged weapons but if you can get a shot in the right spot it's an instant kill. In the heat of combat, this is very difficult to pull off. But if you can do it, it's very very satisfying. And the heartshot locations (at least the ones I've found) all seem to be semi realistic and consistent.\n5. Each creature is strong and/or weak to different kinds of damage. So far as I can tell there are 4: slashing, bludgeoning, piercing, and missile. There may be more I haven't found yet. This means that different tools/weapons are more or less effective against different enemies.\n6. Most tools have strength values. Higher strength means you are more likely to knock them down or knock them back when hitting them. Combine that with the crafting system and if you want to have a weapon that knocks enemies down really easily, then you can make one.\n7. Blocking lets you prevent damage from an enemy hit. However, depending on how hard they hit it will fill up a bar. If that bar fills partially, it breaks your hand and you do less damage when attacking. Block until the bar fills and it breaks your arm. I think that's a cool system that logically makes sense. And if you want to block more easily, stack lots of block efficiency modifier materials when crafting your tool. Not every tool can block though and those that don't have blocking get dodging instead so most tools have some form of damage avoidance or mitigation.\n\nAdded bonus: when building buildings, you can put together the whole building in ghost form all at once. And if the pieces are connected then you can add the materials to build the building from any other piece of the building. Want to build a roof? You don't need to climb up there or build weird scaffolding, just place the ghost and then interact with the nearest floor/wall to add the materials. So much easier than some other games.\n\nSome final suggestions/advice:\n\n1. The flowers in the desert and spinach in the swamp give more essence when extracted than plant fibre does. In the early game, harvest a ton of those just for extraction and you'll never run out of essence dust.\n2. Completing the different event locations (bastilles and aid/defense) give essences and sometimes new recipes. It's always worth doing those. T2 essences are especially important for making charms, infusions, enchantments, and upgrading tools/clothing at the upgrade bench.", "timestamp_created": 1708630518, "timestamp_updated": 1709128567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158994260": {"recommendationid": "158994260", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982931370", "num_games_owned": 795, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1022, "last_played": 1711305461}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a well worth the cheap price point if you want to play a crafting game with friends.

There is a lot of criticism about how this game is just not ready compared to XYZ game, but since I've not played the more recent ones, I can't compare. All I know is that I've been waiting for a survival game with this kind of vibe for a long time.\n\nI love the story, the lore, the magic, and the environment. The realms are so whimsical; they make you want to settle in under cozy blankets and just spend the afternoon exploring. It's clear the developers have put in a lot of time writing out each of the pieces of lore, crafting out a magical Victorian-era background of characters and places. Who doesn't want to float down a tall cliff like Mary Poppins? \n\nI'm still early in my game play, but I can't wait to explore other biomes. There's only three right now \u2013 forest, desert, swamp \u2013 but I'd imagine the developers will be adding even more down the road. Snowy biome, maybe? Either way, I love the card-playing mechanic and I can't wait to try out all the different combos.\n\nI can confirm that there are a few glitches in the game, but considering this is Early Access, that's to be expected. I'm running on a GeForce 3070 graphics card with a Ryzen 7 5800X processor. Settings are mostly set to \"Quality\", and I haven't seen any graphic issues. Connectivity has been fine too. I am not bothered by the \"always online\" game play requirement either; I'm usually playing with Discord opened on my second monitor anyway. I've also not encountered any game-breaking bugs that would make the game crash; most bugs look like minor glitches on my end.\n\nHowever, I can confirm that the user interface does take getting used to; though I kind of like it. I'd rather not see the same ol' user interface across various survival games. If the developers are considering changing it due to player feedback, I hope the changes are minor, as I like that it's different. It follows the current Victorian vibe really well.\n\nAnyway, I'm loving the magical whimsical feel of this game so far.

The tutorial needs a little help as well. Which has been mentioned a lot. Also being a massive theater, mythology lore geek I personally do not mind the way Puck talks to interacts but I know a lot of people are going to struggle to understand him or listen to his rhyming and Shakespearean type talk constantly.  A little more personality to him wouldn't hurt either as Puck was a fae of mischief. \n\nI definitely think some balancing of the enemies would help as the normal enemies are a bit easy.

Realm cards giving players the freedom to choose a biome to go to and select modifiers (difficulty, creatures present, or even just never having night time) really opens up possibilities when exploring, especially since each new realm is randomly generated.\n\nCrafting is pretty neat, with work stations getting buffs depending on what other work stations are near by. However, they can only get so many different buffs, so needing multiple work stations to craft everything will likely be necessary. Different materials will also grant different types of stat bonuses and resistances, which I feel could give players a lot of options when it comes to making their gear fit their play style or helping to beat a specific boss.\n\nCombat, however, is pretty average. Third person animations are kind of jank (though the option for third person was added late, as the game was initially going to be first person only). The UI also needs a lot of work. They also have some serious bugs that need to be fixed (like people getting softlocked in the tutorial stages of the game and having to reroll a new character).\n\nThere's a lot of complaints about always needing an internet connection when playing solo as a single player, but that was advertised from the start. What was never mentioned I take issue with is that there's no pausing. Dogs want out? Kid needs something? Hope you're in a safe place, and won't be afk too long before you die.

To increase your skills, building, power, etc., requires running back and forth constantly over teeny, tiny realms. These things are 4X5 squares in size and you can cross one in a couple minutes. Sure, there are a bunch of them, but it gets very repetitive pretty fast. The biggest downside is the essence mechanic. You can't just upgrade once you have most essences. It requires traveling to certain spots and interacting with special devices. It's just a tedious task. Another tedium is that you'll need to climb or float almost everywhere important. This is fun about 5 times before it just gets monotonous. \n\nMy advice, is to wait and see if they streamline this system. As it stands, you waste too much time standing around waiting for crafting, climbing vertical surfaces and/or floating around on a umbrella.

You saw the ratings on steam and immediately checked the negative reviews\n2.) You're looking at buying an Early Access survival game so I'm going to assume you've played a few before and are looking for something new\n\nLet me start off by saying what this game isn't.\n\nIt is not an offline game.  If you are looking for a game that you can alter server settings and mod like crazy, this is not it.\nIt is not a finished product that is being billed out as a AAA game that is feature complete.\nIt is not $60\n\nIf any of those things are a deal breaker for you then you should consider delaying your purchase until whichever of those things that is bothering you changes.\n\nOn to what the game is.\n\nIt is a UE5 game, so it is gorgeous with the right rig.  I have basically played every survival crafting game I can find and this one is right up there with Icarus as being absolutely beautiful.\nIt is in a much better state than any other survival crafting game I have played at Early Access.  I would go so far as to say it is probably better than most games in the genre after months of updates.  Which isn't to say it is perfect but ultimately if you told me it was a finished product that was getting some tweaks I would believe you.\n\nIn the 11.1 hrs that I played since launch I have not had a single issue with performance, crashes, or networking.  I am sure that under certain hardware configurations it is buggy since I also read a lot of the reviews but since I never found any of those problems I can't tell you if you're going to have such a smooth ride.\n\nCombat is better than almost every game in the genre with perhaps the exception of Valheim but its a close second.  NPCs move around and actually make the fights a little interesting rather than just going face all the time.  AI pathing will get stuck on things and get confused but the core idea is solid.\n\nBuilding is of The Forest variety so if you don't like that style its going to be a rough start.  I have some issues with the way it works but I've been playing a lot of 7 days recently and its pretty much the opposite of that.  Ultimately I built the base I wanted and it wasn't painful so take that for what its worth.\n\nResource gathering is pretty intuitive but the animations for trees falling makes me upset most of the time.  Honestly the biggest issue with it is that everything else in the game looks so good that when something isn't quite right it sticks out and I am excited for the day the trees fall over like they should.\n\nExploration is 100% best in the business right now.  Only game I have played where the exploration feels this rewarding and interesting is The Forest but since that is a linear game, the fact that they pulled off this much engagement in an open world scenario is pretty great.\n\nCharacter customization is...well its a lot.  For a game without a skill system like Valheim, or a level up system like Ark/7 Days, it has a surprising amount of choices that you make about how you navigate the world.  It is an overwhelming start when you start looking in depth at the amount of item optimization you can do.  With that said, I am having a great time with it.  While the system has a lot of options, actually getting what I want is pretty straight forward its the selection that is a bit overwhelming.\n\nFinally, I played for 11.1 hours and never had to google anything.  That is absurd in today's game market and I actually can't think of the last time I was able to find all the information I wanted without ever alt+tabing to a new window to look it up.  It's actually sad that I'm impressed by that because it really should be standard.  I shouldn't have to look at a 3rd party site to know how to play the game but it's the norm these days.  Out of everything this game does well I think that for me was the most impressive part.\n\nYou're looking at new survival/crafting games and you're looking at Early Access.  I do not think you're going to find anything that meets that description for the price tag.

Occasional crashes, not being optimised, quirky NPC behaviour or game mechanics, clipping issues, misspellings in menus or subtitles, missing customisation or cosmetics, etc, are expected and forgiven. \n\n*** PROS ***\n- It is a stunning game and the concept is very cool.\n\n- Building feels very smooth.\n\n- The NPC guide is very cryptic and mysterious.\n\n- Soundtrack is simple but decent.\n\n*** CONS ***\n- The user experience is very lacking. Some examples being: no reload button, you just press mouse 1 to reload when empty, which feels horrible. Not being able to easily compare equipped items to ones in the craft menu. Not seeing craft items stats without putting at least one ingredient in. Having to press E on EVERY resource you harvest, rather than it automatically going into your inventory - This would have made more sense if you were actually carrying the resource but you aren't. \n\n- The UI feels a bit janky. Also I don't feel like it explains anything well. It would feel a lot better if they used visuals (like highlight the food and sleep bars with a short note coming off them) rather than a big walls of text. This may change since it's in early access though.\n\n- The puzzles are not challenging, but again this may change since it's in early access. \n\n- For a survival game it feels like there's very little threat. The vibe feels very relaxed, which I wouldn't expect from this genre. \n\n- (Going on from the above point) Strangely, the crafting/base building aspect doesn't feel like it adds much substance to the game. They could outright remove it and just making it an Open World RPG, with unlocks/a progression system, and I don't feel it would be missed.\n\n*** CONCLUSION ***\nIt has great potential and you can kind of see what they're trying to achieve.

Been just enjoying the game and I finally got to The Watch. Now the game actually beings. It's very serene for me and I look forward to playing it when I need to relax. Great stuff. \n\n\nWow, significantly better than I was expecting in just about every way, and especially in the key areas of gameplay. I'm VERY picky about these types of games and most don't do it for me. So many are just tedious maintenance chores. Some work for me to various levels (like The Forest) but most others just feel like a waste of my time. I tried Enshrouded earlier this week and it was definitely too....childish (?) for me. This feels way more polished and less aimed at kids than things like Enshrouded and Craftopia.\n\n[b]What I like[/b]: \n- Crafting is a simple process. THANK GOD. Place the blueprint where you want, rotate it with the wheel mouse. Add the items to it through quick add. Crafting complete. I don't have tons of menus to slog through or ingredients to manually select and add. It's just very straightforward and I'm so happy about that.\n- The realm card system is pretty damn clever. Collect cards and pair them together to make a new biome to adventure to, with new resources and stuff to explore. Someone will do a way better job of explaining it in detail but I think it's one of the more clever things I've seen in games in quite some time. \n- I don't need to constantly be eating food to avoid hunger. In the tutorial you do but beyond that it's not this nagging thing to deal with like many other games. Shelter is important but you can make a tent and sleeping bag to protect you from hail/rail in about 10 seconds with nothing more than sicks and leaves. Again, making things simple and accessible is a huge positive for me. \n\n[b]What I don't like:[/b]\n- There isn't much I outright dislike in the game but I will say that the performance is really rough. With a 3080ti amd 32gb of ram I can barely crack 60fps at 4k resolution and DLSS at Performance. None of the settings make more than a 1 FPS difference when I change them with the exception of DLSS and/or the Raytraced lighting. If I take off the lighting I get a pretty solid 20 FPS boot up to about 86 FPS but the game looks *significantly* less impressive at that point. My point in mentioning this is that mid/lower end cards will probably struggle mightily here unless you are running at like 1080p or something. \n\nI've seen a few complaints about the combat and so far I don't really have any issues with it. I'm just mainly fighting off boars, wolves, and some undead guys but it's completely serviceable combat. Nothing really wrong with it in my estimation, just mainly unremarkable.\n\nSo as someone who usually sees these type of open-world crafting games as nothing more than \"chores,\" I can say that this is something much more enjoyable and I'm just really excited to sit down and EXPLORE. Already doing just a tiny bit of it in a forest biome I found run-down and destroyed altars that have rare items and new blueprints, unlocking new items and weapons to make. I wanted a game that makes me feel like I'm on a type of adventure and uncovering secrets as I go and so far this absolutely does that.", "timestamp_created": 1708504015, "timestamp_updated": 1710422074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158873548": {"recommendationid": "158873548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272406958", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 401, "last_played": 1709346153}, "language": "english", "review": "game is still in EA at time of review.\n\nNightingale has some of the best building systems I've seen in an open world survival game in a long time.

Some clunkiness in trees not registering contact with axes, accidentally being able to destroy things that are 2pxs into the way of your tools, and the load times are not great between realms but the general core base of this game? It looks very promising and it feels it. The character creator was surprisingly robust in a way that felt very Dragon Age: Inquisition vs traditional sliders. \n\nPersonally, I'm hoping for offline mode capabilities. I wish there were crude stairs that could slot into a corner so there isn't a weird gap in my builds but maybe I'll find that schematic later. Trading with party members would also be nice so I don't throw them at them and have my recruited follower pick them back up. Minor complaints.\n\nThat said. This IS an Unreal Engine 5 game and it does require a bit of a higher specs than that. Read the min vs recommended specs before you buy.

This game is fascinating, intelligent, and unique. For those \"gamers\" who can't determine a good game apart from what mainstream says, this game actually has a lot to offer, The survival mechanics are smart and forgiving, but what wins here is its realm system, the crafting and upgrading system, and the card mechanics. Exploration isn't a bore as you are practically given a new map to explore every realm you land on - and you even get to specify/customize where to go as well. There is a very unique class system as well, where your class is dependent on what you choose to wield, and the upgrade path you're going to take. It is also challenging, and playing with friends is definitely a plus as you will need to take on raid type bosses. I have enjoyed it so far, and looking for more hours to discover what else is in store, which I think will at least be a good 40 hours or more.\n\nEDIT: 60+ hours in, and haven't changed my mind. Tho, I would say, that this game is a bit of an acquired taste. The Mixed reviews says it all. I guess the line here is if you have the patience and time to see the game through, because its beauty isn't immediately shown.

Crafting anything is a tedious task and needs to be simplified significantly. When you go to \"collect\" any item in the world, you don't have any text prompt showing you what item you are collecting. \n\nEvery single item has a weight. If you like games where you can be encumbered by carrying too many items then you will love this game. Survival games that restrict carrying by slots instead of weight are much better. In addition I can already see that there are multiple fun-sucking elements to this game; namely food. You have to eat to not starve, which is realistic except in real life you don't have to eat every five minutes to not starve. Games food enhances your stats instead of being required is a much more fun mechanic. Not to mention, when you cook something as simple as \"meat\" it takes way too long. like 30 seconds. Just let me sit in front of a fire and cook it in 5 seconds so I can get on with my adventure. \n\nThe building feels clunky and unintuitive.\n\nI want to like this game.

The game being online only, even if you want to play singleplayer. \n2. The servers only being NA causing alot of players to have high ping. Some experience rubber banding, connection issues. \n3. People who do not understand some of the machanisms in the game, like the effect crafting with different ore types has on the gear you create. I.E. one reviewer said \"why have different ore types if you can use all types to craft the same item?\" The person clearly has not understood the concept. \n4. The Enemy AI being bad compared to other games. \n\nMy thoughts are on the positive side: \n1. Game is fun, runs smooth for me here in Norway. \n2. Crafting and figuring out what effects different resources produce is fun. \n3. Exploring the realms and finding hidden blueprints and other stuff is fun. \n4. Combat and Enemy AI is no worse than it is in other similar games, like Enshrouded. Alot complain and refer to Enshrouded as being better. But in Enshrouded all you need to do is stand on a slightly elevated rock and spam with you wand and the AI can't figure out how to attack you. simply attacks the rock or wall with no effect. No different. \n5. Augmenting the realms with the cards to see the effects is fun. As time progresses they will add more cards with more variety. \n6. The fact that you can customise the difficulty level of the realm you create is nice. \n7. Playing with a friend is fun. And I like the fact that progression isn't shared. I like to get and figure out things on my own, rather than gain everything as soon as a friend has unlocked it. \n\nIt's fun so far, and promising. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1708470504, "timestamp_updated": 1708509525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158842710": {"recommendationid": "158842710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276571662", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1708542314}, "language": "english", "review": "If thou seeketh dialogue that confuses and language that mimics the murmurings of a stumbling fool thou hast found it.", "timestamp_created": 1708469258, "timestamp_updated": 1708469258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158842492": {"recommendationid": "158842492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054295464", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1780, "last_played": 1710168140}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost 30 hours on the full release and 40 more on the preview builds I've seen a great deal of unique gameplay mechanics introduced to the survival genre.\nNightingale is very fun but takes time to get familiar with because the game doesnt hold your hand.

Tutorial puts you in a desert where you must wait in the shade for your heating bar to go down, else you will be overheating, which reduces your max stamina. Is it realistic? No, because you can just hold an umbrella and stripping down does not help you cool down. Combined with a stamina system that is more consuming than Valheim's (and God knows how many mods there are for stamina in that game), you know that the consequences of weather will be modded out as quickly as there will be mods for stamina management.\n\nCombat is, at least of now, a total joke. It seems, or feels, that the stamina system is also applied to the monsters, where they dash really quickly out of your way, probably as some sort of attack that would suggest that it will damage you, and sometimes it connects, but mostly, they are just flying everywhere like a poor bee. You must then either chase them to land a hit, or just wait for them to come at you at some point, because of course, running, attacking, and dodging all consumes stamina. The stamina regen is slow, so it is somewhat a good strategy to just sit there, wait for the speedy hippo to slam towards you, and stab it.\n\nCombat also suffers from a lack of responsiveness. Generally, you can see some sort of element through gameplay that will show you that you landed a hit or received one. A knockback, a flash on the screen, a good audio cue. Most of the times, you barely know if you hit, or if you got hit. You can see your HP going down, or you can see a discreet dark circle when you're hit, but it's barely there, it's just not enough. And attacking monsters have even less responsiveness.\n\nTutorial is very long for no legitimate reason. It is dragging, it does not put you into the core of the action until over an hour. It teaches you the idea of going through different realms, which is a fair idea per say for a game like that, it wasn't a terribly bad idea from Craftopia (even though they scratched that idea...) but it teaches you how to build stuff in different realms before putting you in your \"estate\" realm, and then you don't travel because you're busy building a lot, and it will not happen fast. I'd rather build then explore than the opposite.\n\nResources aren't that easy to gather, especially for building your house. There are a lot of rocks assets that aren't rocks, and you need a lot of stone to build a 4x4. Those same resources are needed for tools, and are very heavy. Being over weight stops you from sprinting and dodging, but not attacking, nor teleporting to your base, so honestly, I don't really see the point of that mechanic when the consequences are pretty low. \n\nIt also doesn't help that you can recruit NPC to help you, but you can't give them orders like Kelvin in Sons of the Forest. That's right, there are NPCs that are less helpful than Kelvin! They always stick around you, and you can't tell them to help you with a specific resource. Instead, they will use the tools they got in their inventory and clear what's around you, so if you're looking for some stone, you gotta get there by yourself, and then they might help you out with that. Considering that you gotta manage their equipment too (all armours + tools), I question their utility and my willingness to bother with them.\n\nOh, and sprinting sometimes just doesn't work because why not. You know, the kind of bug you'd expect to be cleared before EA release.\n\nThe game is pretty, but once you reach your estate realm, it feels boring because it's not leading to anywhere. All you can see is boring puzzles, boring places, boring combat, trivial mechanics, and slow early progression. Hopefully, in future patches, the progression pacing will feel better, but do not expect guns and magic within the few hours; they will be spent trying to learn the game and dealing with mechanics that are not fun. I suggest to skip this game until a few patches, as the quality is far lower than games such as V Rising or Enshrouded, which show their fun gimmicks faster and with more consequences.", "timestamp_created": 1708472931, "timestamp_updated": 1708472931, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522727251052856445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160541526": {"recommendationid": "160541526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023853306", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 206, "playtime_at_review": 4559, "last_played": 1713476823}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game in early access.

It's an incredibly aesthetically pleasing game. The initial wonder of the whole setting is fantastic and the narrative and environmental storytelling is incredible.\n\nOnce that initial wonder and fantasy wears off, the game fails to keep pulling you in. Perhaps there's plans in the future to change this, but higher levels of similar realms just have different monsters.

I hope they patch it out! She was obsessed with the aesthetics.\n\nThe game's initial experience feels like that Willy Wonka AI art attraction. It pulls you in with incredible covers and with shock & awe at the very beginning and turns into a huge let-down as you realize that your initial experience is basically all you get with small variations for the entire experience..

You don't spend hours skilling and leveling up.  \n\nSo now the bad:\n- So there are really only 3 realms at the moment:  Forest, Desert and Swamp.   You pair one of those with a card that changes the level of the realm, but really you're just doing the same 3 realms over and over as you build up your gear score.\n- Housing has a lot of types of light, but they all produce a similar level of light.  There is NO way to increase the level of light something puts out, you just have to build more lights.\n- Similar to above, you can build a lantern to walk around in the dark with.  But really unless it's night out, you may as well be walking around with your umbrella out for all the good the lantern will do for you.

For an early access game, the amount of content is amazing. As expected, it has some bugs, but I haven't encountered anything game-breaking, just minor inconveniences or things that make me go \"oh haha that's janky.\" \r\n\r\nEarly game gave me the same feeling of being vulnerable but not helpless in a huge threatening world as when I first played Valheim. There is so much to explore and experiment with between building, crafting gear, trying out different playstyles and builds, and just exploring the realms. \r\n\r\nPlaying with friends is great, as you can pool resources and build a shared base, but since I'm the only one in my group thoroughly obsessed with this game, I've spent about half the time playing solo and there are few downsides. Some puzzles are easier with friends, and some bosses are extra scary when you know you're on your own, but you have an NPC buddy who can help you up if you get yeeted to your death. \r\n\r\nI love the lore we've gotten so far and I'm excited for more. I think it suits the game perfectly that the story isn't really the focus but is intertwined with the game, so you're drip-fed bits of lore as you progress, rather than having quests specifically built around getting to the next section of a linear story, aside from the goal of eventually reaching Nightingale City. More side quests would be a great way to add more content and lore. I really enjoyed the incorporation of real historical figures like Bass Reeves and would like to see more of that.\r\n\r\nI farted around exploring every combination of realm, hoarding a ridiculous amount of materials to share with friends who haven't progressed as far, finding all the different seeds I could and building up a new realm just for farming, making stockpiles of food with different stats, building a village, etc for about 90 hours before I started actively pursuing the quest to reach the Watch, and never got bored or felt pressured to get on with it. Now that I've been to the Watch, I get to explore all those realms again as ascended realms, and it doesn't feel repetitive. I'm excited to unlock new recipes and face stronger versions of the fabled beasts I've already encountered, although more unique mobs exclusive to ascended realms would be a welcome addition.\r\n\r\nThe creature designs are fantastic, even if I do end up screaming when I get swarmed by a dozen 8-foot locusts. (The sound of their wings, god why?) The automaton enemies are so unique and I'd love to see more varieties of them and learn more lore about them in the future. Harpies still give me the chills every time I see them sneaking down a mountainside at me like a group of eldritch nuns.\r\n\r\nI adore Puck, and not knowing if he's secretly plotting something terrible for you makes him even better. More voice acting would be great, but if you had to have only one voiced character, Marc Warren as Puck was the perfect choice, especially as a fan of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. I really hope we'll get to meet more fae, even if that's unlikely to be a friendly meeting.\r\n\r\nThe crafting system is a little convoluted to the point I and many others are using spreadsheets to keep track of materials, but I actually love that. I'd rather spend a few minutes and take some notes when deciding how to craft the next tier of gear than be able to simply click a button and have something more powerful. That being said, some minor improvements would go a long way. I'd like to be able to lock items in my inventory from being used by default when depositing materials at an aid POI or even building my own structures. Running around for 30min harvesting T4 fiber and accidentally dropping it into an NPC's blueprints with no way to retrieve it feels bad. Easier storage and organization of mats would be appreciated too. It's very fiddly right now to even place chests on shelves to save space.\r\n\r\nI would love to see improvements to the building system (diagonal walls, triangular blocks, the ability to place items like candles or plant pots on windowsills or wall shelves, functional chairs) and more versatility in weapons, as the current state of combat kind of shoehorns everyone into using guns. I'd like more types of bastilles and improvements to the current ones. Bastilles of insight are a cool idea, but I'd prefer if they felt more like a puzzle (maybe involving the wisps or with more audio clues) rather than running around blindly looking for a glowing thing that might be barely visible.\r\n\r\nOverall, Nightingale has tons of potential and I can't wait to see what they have planned for future content.", "timestamp_created": 1711058272, "timestamp_updated": 1711058272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160750573": {"recommendationid": "160750573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014196104", "num_games_owned": 880, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 15679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 78, "playtime_at_review": 10250, "last_played": 1712694590}, "language": "english", "review": "Whenever you can get 100+ hours out of an early access game for \u00a320 you can hardly down vote it!

They might farm but they dont pick up anything they farm that system is broken.  I have to run behind this heffer nonstop and pick up what shes farming.  \nIf you had your survivor an axe near your base they will cut down trees that will surely land on your structure and BREAK the damn thing.  \nI had to take away access from the storage (might be why they dont pick up anything) BECAUSE this dumb chick keeps on putting high end matts into the damn fire as fuel.  i had over 50 carved wood which is a longish grind to get and what does she do puts it in the fire thank god i noticed.  The NPC survivors need a full look by the DEVs. \n\nClimbing with the climbing picks SUCKS i have spent literal hours trying to use these things and i cant climb up a 5 foot wall without running out of stamina in 3 seconds.  This needs a rework. \n\nNow performance this is my biggest problem with this game.  It is not optimized AT ALL.  I have a 13900k, lowish latency DDr5 6400mhz memory, gen 5 SSD 10,000 read/write and a 4090, I have to put everything on balanced at 4k with DLSS on performance to get more than 70 FPS.  and even then its still stuttering nonstop.  No other game i have plays like this, first game ive played since the 4090 came out that is this bad with performance.  They HAVE to optimize the game better.  Now when i put everything on ultra quality the highest setting i get around 50-60 frames but fights are impossible i lag wayy to much and stutter.  \n\nOverall I am really loving the game i hope they can fix the few things that i am not a fan of.

Whats great is since we have been progressing the entire time together, we can hop on separate and add to our base, gather things to store, and its all saved on the same realm kind of like a private shared server.

You're gonna spend [b]a lot of time[/b] running from chest to chest, as crafting stations (which are plentiful) don't automatically pull items from them, to craft useless ingredients just to make the item you actually want.\nOn the positive side, you can mix and match different variants of mats within a category to customize the end product to your liking. You can, for example, make an axe that'll deal more damage, be more stamina efficient or add some sort of magical element to it. This part of the crafting mechanic is actually pretty nice. Again, it'd be nice to know the stats of the base item without prepping any mats, but [i]eh[/i].\n\n[b]Exploration[/b] is very mid. Enviroments are indeed very good looking, but as the game has you traveling between alternative, randomly generated Realms, early on you're going to start seeing the same things over and over again. As you go to a higher tier Realm, you will mostly meet new enemy types and MIGHT find something interesting if you're lucky. Then again, after about a mid-point, you visit realms just to find a trader, get all the stuff you need to progress and bail.\nAs much as the game's trying to sell itself on exploration, I never felt so uninterested to see what's new in the 5th almost identical Swamp I'm going to visit. Travelling between Realms is something I'll get back to later.\n\n[b]Progression[/b] is weird. Instead of unlocking crafting recipes by picking things up, defeating bosses or making higher thier crafting stations, you have to hop from realm to realm and either buy stuff you want or complete points of interests to unlock a random item from this realm's pool.\nSome recipes require augmentations, that you also need to unlock and may or may not connect to multiple crafting stations at once, which results in you moving them around in or outside reach of a crafting station so you can free up a slot so you can place another augmentation you need to craft this one very specific item. [i]Why?[/i]\n\n[b]Resource gathering[/b], despite the aforementioned apparent focus on crafting, can be significantly sped up with Minor cards. I never found a need to use those, but they're there if you plan on building something bigger than a bare-minimum box. That is, assuming the building limit will allow you to build what you want.\nOne thing I have to highlight is the fact that the game features a built-on \"wiki\" that tells you where you can find every item in the game. You don't have to google where the hell is this ore you're missing. This is a very good feature more games should implement.\n\n[b]Combat[/b] is a mixed bag. The feedback from using your weapons/guns and how enemies respond to getting hit is actually very respectable for a survival game. But the engagements usually boil down to running in circles and chipping away the health from enemies that just blob up and run in your general direction. And oh, you'll be stuck with the same three basic guns for the majority of the game. The [i]cool[/i] guns you see in the trailers are locked behind end-game grinding. And the basic pistol's particle effects block the middle of the screen as you fire, so I hope you like not seeing what you're aiming at.\n\n[b]UI[/b] is a little bit on the \"form over function\" side. It's gonna take some time to get used to navigating various menus that might not want to cooperate at times, or lack key shortcuts. Apparently the UI is complex enough that it filtered a decent amount of players.\n\n[b]Base building[/b] is another mixed bag. On the one hand, you don't need any dedicated building tool, you place walls, foundations and pretty much everything else as a ghost and the game (very conveniently I might add) displays a total amount of mats you need to complete the entire build. You can either put the mats in gradually, or you can grab everything you need and finish the entire build with a single tap of the USE key, which is [b]very nice[/b]. It'd be nice if I could pin this requirement to HUD, like I can during crafting tho.\nAnyway, once you built the basic stuff like foundations, walls and roofs, there's no snapping to grid for most buildables. The collision during placement is very generous, allowing you to clip stuff into other stuff. For whatever reason, all the stuff you can hang on the walls has limited predefined snapping points.\n\nOne more thing worth mentioning is that the game is (for now) [b]always online[/b]. I've lost progress a few times because the realm I was in decided to die and kick me back to the main menu. I don't know if the game decided to put my worlds/saves outside of my region, but the entire time I played it felt like I was playing on high ping. Walk into water, the slow down kicked in a second too late. Hit an enemy and they react with a delay. [i]Incredible.[/i]\nBe prepaired for a lot of waiting and staring at loading screens. As I've mentioned before, portals take about a minute to open and they close themselves after some time, seemingly for no reason. After you go through a portal, you're rewarded with more waiting, as the game does something in the background and this something may take from 20 seconds to multiple minutes, depending on [i]something[/i]. All this waiting is probably tied to their server infrastructure prepairing assets or something, hard to tell.\nAnother \"benefit\" of the game being always online is The Watch, the game's online social hub that allows players to enter late game dungeons and craft late game gear. These dungeons are designed around having multiple people in them, cooperating to complete challenges and eventually defeat the area's boss, so if you've been playing solo up to that point, have fun relying on other players to progress further at a reasonable pace.\n\nOther noteworthy stuff:\n- Performance is all over the place. If you get stable 60 fps in the open world, you're very likely to drop during combat, especially against larger groups of enemies. With my rig that exceeds recommended specs, I almost always dropped to low-mid 40s in these scenarios, no matter what graphics settings I used.\n- Hotbar is split into 5 slots for mainhand tools and 5 slots for offhand tools. Why do we need 5 offhand slots? I'd like to know myself. What I do know however, is that these 5 main hand slots, considering the amount of tools and weapons in the game, aren't enough. I had to constantly swap tools on my hotbar, while only two of my off hand slots were used.\n- There's no quick stacking to chests or quick restocking from chests. More running from box to box to store the crap you brought and restock on items you need to not die. Even with the chest inventory opened, there's no quick stacking/restocking option.\n- Achievements are a bit buggy. I've got an achievement for entering the post-tutorial realm like 30 hrs in and I did not get the achievement for reaching The Watch, despite being there multiple times.\n- Maybe I'm just bad at navigating, but a minimap would be nice.", "timestamp_created": 1709341105, "timestamp_updated": 1709422027, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159473833": {"recommendationid": "159473833", "author": {"steamid": "76561199174528027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2365, "last_played": 1710350849}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't normally write reviews, so that is a testament to the game in itself.

Allows for amazing macro-level exploration, especially when you start crafting some of the more obscure card combinations.\n- The Crafting System. Incredible, probably my favorite part of the game so far.\n- The Building System. Could use a bit more QoL but currently has plenty of options, ghost blueprints are great.\n- The Gathering System. Seems to be a wide variety of resources to discover, can hold F to pick up all after mining/chopping. Fishing exists and feels great.\n- The Lore. Puck's VA is great and the NPCs/lore notes are all very well-written.\n- Character Creation. People will complain about this one because they don't like the character models, but the character creator itself is amazing for this genre.\n- The Small Details - The music and ambient audio are lovely, melee headshots feel oddly satisfying, AI predators hunt prey in the wild, fun sound effects on the crafting benches, the way the sun streams through the windows, etc.\n\n[b]Things People Are Complaining About: [/b]\n[hr][/hr]\n- Repetitive POIs. This is the biggest one for me. I foresee many people getting bored at around the 20 hour mark if micro-exploration is their main thing. I find that it's decent enough when padded with other things like crafting, questing, and building.\n- Always Online Model. I personally love the asynchronous multiplayer. If they add the option for local hosting in the future then it will be a win-win for everyone.\n- Connectivity Issues. I'm in the US with a wired connection and have only had one disconnect.\n- Performance Problems. Running on ultra and have noticed some frame drops at times but nowhere near unplayable. Much better than expected.\n- Unintuitive UI. Again, not as bad as I thought it'd be. Could use some work but overall functional and fits the aesthetic nicely.\n- Bad Inventory Management. I agree on this, inventory management needs a lot of help. However they have stated they're actively working on connected storage and other inventory QoL.\n- Character Aesthetics. Plenty of people hate them, I find them quite charming.\n- Dumb Enemy AI. Could definitely use some work, but about standard for the genre.\n- Janky Animations. Not as bad as I thought they'd be, but some things need polishing.\n- Combat Depth. Again, about standard for the genre, I don't really know what people are expecting. Ranged needs some work, but I find melee quite satisfying, especially the dashing around with dagger/climbing picks.\n\nKeep in mind that this game has some depth to it and hasn't been out long enough for people to fully explore all of its systems.

I deeply enjoy survival games. At this point in my life, they are my favorite genre. Jank, less than stellar combat, missing QOL; these are all standard for the genre, unfortunately. As gamers, we call these things \"quirks\" and we persist. \n\nA lot of people have been waiting for this game for a few years. Upon first seeing the game a while back, I wrote it off because of the card/world system. One of the reasons I enjoy these games is because of large, persistent worlds, and I figured Nightingale would have small world after small world. So I quickly moved on and stopped paying attention.\n\nUntil January 2024. As the game neared its release, I decided to pay attention again, to see if my initial reaction was haste. Maybe I was being harsh. To my surprise, I liked what I saw. I joined the Discord and followed the game and it's previews for the last month and change. It felt like each day, I grew more and more excited. \n\nI was working when the game released this morning, so I bought it on the app, and went right back to work. I took a lunch break, and looked at YouTube reviews for the game. Reception wasn't the greatest. I listened to the complaints, and figured the judgement was unwarranted. I like survival games, after all, and jank/poorly implemented gameplay mechanics is something I expect. \n\nStill working, I'm not checking Steam reviews. \"Oh boy. This isn't looking too good,\" I thought. I figured people were jumping on a trend of hating on the game. This happens quite a bit in this community, especially to crafting games, as well as open world games. I also saw lots of complaints about the \"always online\" component, and while I don't like the requirements, I accepted it as a staple of the times we are currently in. \n\nI get off work. Reviews keep coming in. Very mixed. Steam seems to be the only place where I see level headed people recommending the game, but with some heavy caveats. I convince myself they must somehow be wrong. \n\nSo I finally boot the game up.\n\nOn paper, the game sounds like a winner. It's also unique in this space, which goes a long way toward giving us a reason to play this game, instead of others in the genre. The amount of thought that went into crafting, and the tier system is actually great imo. It goes right in line with how, ON PAPER, this game is a winner. It's well thought out. The world building and semblance of a story was even something I found myself ok with. \n\nBut then you play the video game. And this is where they messed up.\n\nIt's almost as though they forgot that video games are supposed to feel good to play. The forest world is designed to provide you with plenty of resources to get you up and going. That's fine, but what that means is the world is cluttered. As I darted across the map to prove to myself how small the game world was, I'm constantly receiving prompts to tap \"E\" like nobody's business. I wish I was exaggerating. It honestly felt like the worse parts of Ark. It was unsettling.\n\nThird person is absolutely not worth it atm. Wait for later down the line when they have less critical issues to fix and can work on third person. It's uncomfortable to witness. It was however, the easiest way to perform during combat, because enemies are jumping about and popping up behind you constantly. I like that the enemy is flanking me, don't get me wrong. But as so many others have pointed out, the AI is absolutely atrocious. \n\nI didn't believe it as I read through/watched reviews. But the moment I entered the first world of the tutorial, a family of five deer spawned right in front of Puck and I. They panicked, and began to run circles around me. I started punching the doe, and after the second punch, she stood still and let me punch her to death. That was the first of three deer that let me do this before I shut the game down for good. \n\nBlocking is too powerful atm. You have a ton of stamina, and it regenerates far too fast. This makes combat, on top of the silly AI, brain dead. I mash LMB and side step any time an enemy shows their tell. They attack and miss. I kill. Occasionally I block when all enemy attacks sync up, and I can't dodge them all at once. Then I mash LMB. It's not good. \n\nContrary to what some others are saying, I like how combat feels. There is something deep in the combat system that they got right. But as it stands right now, it is not good. This is due, in large part, to the lag experienced by the always online component. It didn't bother me much when watching preview/review videos, but upon playing it, you can feel it. It doesn't necessarily throw the timing off. It just makes the weight of combat feel unresponsive. There is something solid in there that can be improved, however.\n\nAnd, to my initial reaction upon learning about the game, the worlds are small. Exploration is sort of pointless. POI's are meaningless. There isn't really a substantial way to interact with the environment atm. It took me a minute to realize some of the larger stones weren't breakable (yet?). The UI, which was revamped right before launch, feels cumbersome. The tutorial prompts in the upper right hand of the screen go on for a long while, and don't give a good first impression. \n\nWhy did I spend that time talking about my reactions leading up to playing the game? To illustrate that I was a skeptic. Then I was a supporter. Then I was a defender. Now I'm offended. I think my review hinges on my experience with the game pre-release and post EA release. \n\nA lot of time was put into the wrong aspects of this game. A game has to either feel good to play, or be rewarding to play. This game has neither. It hurts me, because the preview footage looks great. And the team seems very excited and passionate. But the in depth systems can't make up for the fact that the game doesn't feel good. And it's boring. It feels like gameplay and player engagement was the last thing addressed during development. \n\nThe biggest sin here is why play this over any other survival/crafting game? The question every designer and developer must ask. Enshrouded has a great building system. Palworld has Pals. Valheim has it's building system, as well as its sense of adventure (I also appreciate the exp/leveling in the game). Sons Of The Forest has great production value that is felt through all of that game's gameplay systems. Grounded has good combat, and its setting is very refreshing. I could obviously go on. I would recommend anyone play any of those games before this one. \n\nAll of this can be boiled down to how this game feels. It doesn't feel good. It doesn't play well. It has some graphical issues that pop up, especially when using an upscaler, which is part of why they removed FSR3 right before launch. \n\nThe game is in Early Access, so a lot of this stuff comes with the territory. But it doesn't change the fact that money is being spent on the product, and I felt compelled enough to not only refund, but review it. \n\nOh. And bad enemy AI also extends to companions. Whew. Do they need work.\n\nOk. That was a lot. Now, for the \n\n\n\nTLDR\n\n\nThe game isn't ready. The systems and mechanics are great on paper, but implementation feels half baked. The game feels like gameplay and user experience was an afterthought. The always online component create an undesirable combat experience. Combat was already lacking due to CPU AI and frantic feeling player attacks. The game feels like Ark and its forgotten younger sibling Atlas.

But this also has unique concepts to it, such as people having the ability to change aspects of their environment, to being able to jump to other people's servers (realms) without having to make a brand new character like you'd have to do in other games (and even live with them in that realm, if you so choose). \n\nThis also has strong RPG elements, so if you're one who's been wanting a survival game with an actual story and voice acted NPCs in them, then I feel that Nightingale actually delivers on this pretty well. I've enjoyed exploring and finding little notes left by travelers, or points of interests with a variety in style ranging from radio towers to pirate shipwrecks, to floating cubes. And this is just from me exploring the tutorial areas and a very limited part of my starting biome. \n\nLastly, I find it both exciting and relaxing. The music helps with that latter part, and probably aided by the fact I had a forest spirit that wanders around my home, regrowing any plants and trees that have been cut down. And it's exciting because there's real dangers around. My partner who started in a different realm, is consistently hearing screams and whispers whenever nightfall comes lol So there's mystery, there's a story to follow, and the survival-craft aspects are pretty solid.\n\nImprovements: \n-Third Person is an added feature, and it does show it being experimental. I'd definitely like to see them continue to improve on this, and it looks like they will, so that's that.\n-I think tooltips (or more of them?) would be helpful. For instance, I see that I need to craft some materials in order to build a thing. It would help if those materials had tooltips when you hovered over them that gave information on where to get them, how to craft them (which skills/benches they're associated with), etc. Nothing too fancy, just basic info.\n-Combat is a bit clunky, but still better than others. Still though, it does need improvement, which will probably come alongside the work they're doing for third person.\n-Our faces look like wet clay.\n\nI'll most likely add to this review as I continue on. For an EA game, my gameplay has been smooth, probably only hitched twice when I had loaded something in my 4 hours of playing. I joined my partner's game in a quick and simple manner (party up, invite to realm/accept invite). The story and world has been intriguing. The building has been nice. It's in a pretty good state, in my opinion. \n*Quick note: to people confused as to why it says \"waiting for server\" as you wait to load... have you ever played any online game?

I love survival games. But survival lover, don't get fooled: this game is not good or ready yet to be enjoyable.\nI have been trying hard to play this game, about 35 hours on log, and my comments:\n\nPROS\n- A really unique setting and a wonderful artwork;\n- Guns are awesome for survival games;\n- Interesting concepts such as interchangeable realm cards.\n\nCONS\n- While the concept of realm cards for opening portals is great, waiting 2 to 4 minutes just to open a portal to gather some materials is horrible. Don't forget you have to come back to your \"base realm\" so add another 2 - 4 minutes of waiting! \n- Also, because of the card system, you think there will be a lot of variations, but sooner than later it starts to feel extremely repetitive - open the portal to the \"more difficult realm\", gather similar resources, do the same easy puzzles over and over again.\n- Combat feels like this game is really from the 1800s; is poor executed, dull, especially on melee.\n- When enemies appear, your FPS will drop dramatically, making the combat even worse;\n- Poor implemented combat and gravity effects: I fly away from the Gloom tower every time the maul monster hits me;\n- Crafting system concept is interesting, but at the current state badly executed and overly complex: too many augments with too many outcomes makes you lost about what can be crafted or not and where to craft; also, the concept that you can use any ingot to build but the outcome on items will be different base on source material is interesting, but at the current state too complex and a drag to manage so many items made from so many variants.\n- Mining and lumbering effects are weird and dull.\n\nSo, at the current state, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game.

I could just as easily give it a thumbs up. But I cant... But! I'm very willing to change the review as the game progresses. I also play on the hardest difficulty. I also played 'stress test' too.\n\nEvErYtHiNg is mid but two things which make it a soft thumbs down. \n\n-> Combat is bad... <-\n\n1) There are no dodge rolls or shields. No stealth. So there are exceedingly limited 'out plays'. 2) Mobs come in packs of 5+ and just bum rush mob you. So there is no strategy to combat. 3) As of yet, there are NO combat weapons. You have to fight with your 'gathering tools'. Being said, axe is best hands down and if you dont use an axe its bad. Skinning knife deals no damage and has no range. Pick axe has a chopping motion and since monsters bum rush 'rag doll' all over the place its hard to hit. 4) So there is no combat diversity. 5) There is supposed to be magic... but... I havent found it yet. \n\n-> I'm six hours in and *still* on neo-lithic stone tools... <-\n\n...even though I have all the base (~8) crafting stations unlocked. After you unlock the basic set up progression essentially stops. I have a feeling I will be in the stone age until I get off the first map. And since I'm playing on super hard mode this could easily be 10+ hours into the game. Since combat is linear and nonstrategic there are very few ways -if any- to outplay, out grind, out exp, out craft, out combat, out cheeze... monsters and the boss. \n\nThese can be easy fixes and expect it to change in pre release\n\nMinor gripes:\n\nNo mounts so travel/exploration can be a bit tedious.\nNo convenient storage organizational system. \nNo real monster animal diversity per map. I hear there is overall, though.\nNo challenge to 'puzzles'. Essentially just click a crystal.\nNo exciting dungeons or temples. Just another place to fight monsters in tight quarters *bleh*\nNo real reward to 'wandering exploration'. Just a ham-sandwitch every so often. \nYour companion's ai cant keep up with you so it will just teleport around. Doesnt bother me too too much. \n\nBut! On positive notes!\n\n-> The card system is kinda cool and can be really powerful. It will change the color palate of your terrain, the sky (which can be very beautiful), and glow/particle effects. The bonuses and penalties can be significant enough to change gameplay a lot! I've got one which tripples my food buff timers and adds a slow regen to health. Once, I had one which made me float which, in combination to my dagger's dash, essentially made exploration and travel super fast. Theres another which absolutely tanks your hp but gives monsters a chance to drop special loot. \n\n-> It *seems* as though getting into higher tiers of crafting can be very complex and rewarding - based on the complexity of the crafting stations. There are tons of 'enchantments' that have a wide variety of effects. So it seems like there may be combat diversity later. \n\n-> Building buildings is easy. Its kinda cool! You can completely build your 'ghost' house and it will compile all the building materials for the entire house all in one 'click'. \n\nAll in all. \n\nLet it cook!", "timestamp_created": 1708485410, "timestamp_updated": 1708485410, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521578848361968994", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159366905": {"recommendationid": "159366905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144883952", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 583, "last_played": 1708674333}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot recommend this game in the current state.

Loading up can take well over 5 minutes and sometimes longer than 10. Loading between realms can take 1-13 minutes (so far). You're just playing and enjoying yourself? Nope, connection issues. No internet? In a storm? Bad connection, none for you. The recipes aren't offered as well as they should be, the grinding for materials can be absurd, the community, when you talk about it on the discord, are a bunch of toxic CODGamers who tell you to get over it and, \"That's what video games are these days.\" They don't even have basic inventory icons for all of the items so you get a ridiculous number of items that are all these big stupid \"N\" stamps. A lot of the items are super heavy and the packs do allow for a fair bit after you get through the majority of the released game but you still end up in this 0.05 mile per hour walk anytime you have to move a lot of things around or, god forbid, you'd like to move. Speaking of moving... What to build a nice big home with decorations? Better give up on that, the build limits are so low that you'll run out 1/2 way to 3/4s the way through. There's also item limits. Placing items to beautify little corners and dress things up? Better watch out. This is to say nothing of the foliage growing up through the foundations of your home, the fog filling it up so even with tons of lights you still can't see anything, there's no paint or dye so no house or outfit beauty. Want to just chill in your favorite casual wear and have a friend over? Too bad, the enemies laser-lock onto you and destroy your home from underneath you while you lose all of your strength because for some reason this game went with the severely outdated gear score \"leveling,\" and let's also be clear that having someone else in your realm tends to leave the little mini sever unstable. Let's also take a moment to remember that if you take your time farming movement speed materials for your backpack that you won't gain any benefit from it because for some stupid reason, even though we're in a game of magic and gear score leveling, all of the equipment only allows for certain attributes to apply to certain pieces, so F*** your farming and care that you put into that jacket, you can't have a strength buff on it! Your shoes? No! No weight benefit for you even though nothing tell you that, you just have to waste your materials which you cannot get back! Also, let's SPECIFICALLY leave out the base gear score for all of the new recipes you get so you could just be making something worthless because you have no guidance. \r\n\r\n\r\nNot everything is bad. The story is pretty good and then exploration is fun (until you realize they are remixes of the same zones over and over), some of the puzzles can be fun, and even though the gear system went with micromanaging inventory items to build your equipment out of things with multipliers that may or may not matter it can make for magical moments when you get it right. You can press E to pick up individual pieces of loot or hold E to pick up all loose items in a radius around you! That's honestly amazing. \r\n\r\nThe game has potential but I am officially done making excuses for it. They've done about 90% of this game wrong, 7% of it standard and unremarkable, and 3% truly awesome innovations. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion, in this state, it'll be a complete waste of time and energy to play this game.

Warnings about the use of noting early access. (I know some people feel it's a cop out)\n\nThis game hits all the right spots for me. The in-depth lore is wonderful, the characters being based on real and fiction characters is a lovely twist, and the fact there's not a ton of games out there that delve into this side of Fae mythos (with a twist) is just wonderful to me. \nWhile I understand people might have issues with some of the complex crafting systems put into place, I can't stress how much I LOVE this system. The fact I can pretty much fully customize anything, from clothes, to realms, to weapons speaks volume on the system at play here.\nI play on a 3070, and although I struggle with other UE5 games, I didn't struggle nearly at all in my 15 hours. Small hiccups of DCing from server, but it was back up almost immediately, which leads me to believe it was a me issue.\nWhile I believe there will be much more coming to Nightingale, I can't wait to see what the future holds!\n\nSlight complaints:\nI do think there's a bit of polish that could be done to the game, as I know it's early access, I for sure look forward to watching the game grow, and seeing if those boxes get checked off my list.\n - Combat at times can seem a bit hack and slashy, which is fine if you like those games, I just would like to see a little more to it.\n - Portal's and their ramp up time, I'm unsure if it's day 1 jitters, but sometimes loading a portal would take a good couple minutes, I assume it's due to day one overload, but I'm sure it will get worked out.\n - I personally do not like the new UI look, sure I've gotten used to it, but there's times I feel it's a little wonky. I really hope the devs add a toggle to the game to use the old bubbles or the new bars.\n - My 2 biggest bugs I ran into was tabbing out of the game. When I'd tab back in I couldn't run. Though easily fixed by opening my inventory.\nThe second was randomly losing the ability to close inventory/hope echoes/chests with the escape key. Not either are game breaking but it was still annoying IMO to deal with.  I have seen posts about these issues on their bugs site though, with lots of upvotes, so I'm sure it's on their radar.\n\nOverall this game is a 10/10 for me and I'd love to say my group. The fact 15 hours went by and none of us batted an eye says a lot. We haven't spent that much time in a single play-through in anything I think?\nWill for sure continue to get my numbers up, and can for sure see this as a game I never uninstall to make space on my harddrive.\n\nI leave with my normal note on these kid of games:\nI know early access is hard, but if you're not having fun, ran into issues, etc. it's never a bad thing to wait and come back in a few months, like most early access games, once things get a chance to get fleshed out, some hotfixes, and more balancing.\n\u2764\ufe0f", "timestamp_created": 1708536890, "timestamp_updated": 1708592588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521200358867645264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158965691": {"recommendationid": "158965691", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972155027", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1709038909}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played nearly over 24hrs of gameplay so far and I feel I can give some feedback even though I've barely scratched the surface of the game.\n\nI see a lot of complaining about the game always being online, I feel these review are barking at the moon. Let me explain why with me trying to keep spoilers to a min.\n\nWhen you first complete the tutorial you end up in a realm that is meant and only for you. So being always online is only an issue unless you make it an issue. For example, when you do go to traverse other realms, you are met with options either too remain in a private realm or a public realm. I feel folks have been going into public realms without realising it, so take it from me if you want to remain solo, look in the bottom left corner for options, I recommend using them. Your making an issue out of something that is not really an issue unless you choose to make it an issue by inviting friends on steam. Alright that is it from me, Rant over.\n\nOnto the lore.\nBeing a person from one of the celtic countries who got some understanding of Celtic folklore, I'm really enjoy the mixing of steam punk with the mixing the Fae and creatures of Celtic folklore. Iiked seeing the spirit animal of the large Elf like beast travel the forest and even made himself a guest for a time. \n\nThe graphics give me a certain Bioshock feel and I'm here for it. \n\nThe survival elements, the real thing that impressed me is the weather element. Whilst I was building the estate, A storm rolled in with thunder and lightning also hailstones which caused damage unless I found a way to mitigate the environment.\n\nThe AI companion, I hope we can get a variation of companions in the future. The companion can do silly things but that be AI for you. I like that your not handcuffed to the estate when your AI is giving you a hand, this worked in Sons of the forest and recently Palworld.\n\nI'm really enjoy Nightingale and looking forward to see the game progress into Early Access.", "timestamp_created": 1708603292, "timestamp_updated": 1708603292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521197021007537842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158853552": {"recommendationid": "158853552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012852351", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1708784112}, "language": "english", "review": "PROS:\nInteresting characters with compelling voice acting, sharp UI\n\nCONS:\nlots of DC'ing when transitioning realms , constant need to rebind keys, 3rd person-prospective doesn't feel great", "timestamp_created": 1708479780, "timestamp_updated": 1708479780, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52112889289855957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160289662": {"recommendationid": "160289662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026255985", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 924, "last_played": 1710098967}, "language": "english", "review": "After trying my best to get into Nightingale multiple times. I'd like to share my experience as someone who really wants to like this game. Before sharing though, this does not help the current \"mixed\" status and I do want to emphasize that I think the game has great potential and like a lot of other reviewers mentioned, a great bunch of unique ideas.\n\n[b] Introduction: [/b]\nDespite the first few reviews I read before buying the game, I actually think the introduction is great. You receive both appropriate gameplay and lore progression alike. It is clear you get through a couple of portals in the sake of progression but I think Puck (your guide) is a great character that really reminds me of Fromsoftware characters in its own unique way. I'm a huge Survival game fan and the mechanics were all there. Enough to sink my teeth in, or so I thought.\n\n[b] Gameplay: [/b]\nThis is basically where everything collapsed for me. For all the rough unpolished systems I can get through, what I can't look past is gameplay and progression systems. In my 15 hours or so of gameplay I have been on an never ending linear quest hunt. Clear this dungeon, get this Gearscore, go to a realm which uses this card. The sad thing is, I actually am a sucker for grinding and questing like this. But combined with a Survival game, this rips all the player agency and exploration right out of it. I don't get to explore the game my way, I have to follow a questline. \n\n[b] Progression: [/b]\nThe progression comes down to a few things. Hope, Gearscore and Cards. Now I like this idea, but I just loath the implementation. \nHope: is a horizontal progression which is gained by a combination of what you wear, how much you have built, and I think what you have accomplished. \nGearscore: Pretty straightforward, quality of your gear\nCards: How difficult the realm is you can create.\n[u] The big problem with these: [/u] Hope makes me want to build a bunch of random stone to improve it. Gearscore comes down to spamming re-used  puzzles and fights, Cards gets down to clearing a re-used dungeon. Everything is intertwined so it might as well have been one system instead.\n\n[b] Examples: [/b] \nI want to emphasize a few examples of why this game does not work in its current state. I do have to add I have not reached end-game or probably even mid-game, but to be fair I don't think this game can surprise me looking at how stale the systems got so quickly.\n\n- Valheim: One of my favorite survival games. It brings mystery and player agency. You as a player are there to explore the world. If you don't get into the Black Forest for 20 hours it doesn't matter. No one or nothing is urging you otherwise. This feeling is great and really should have been focussed on in Nightingale as well. \n* In Nightingale: You are doing a linear boring quest. The world has nothing to explore besides chests around sites of interest. For a game with such an interesting theme it is really sad to see that the world feels so lifeless. \n\n- Grounded: A much more linear story with a similar fetch quest type of progression. Grounded, as all Survival games should focus on, has a lot of mystery. I can't stress enough how important this is as a player. I don't want to know what an enemy is going to do, whether it is passive or aggressive, if I can tame it or not, etc. I am new to a world, and it should surprise me. Grounded does this incredibly with bugs fighting each other, unique sets of behaviors and fighting styles, unique weaknesses and unique rewards. \n* In Nightingale: everything I've seen felt like a different model with the same behavior and move set as the guy before.\n\n- Enshrouded: A game which to me has the same flaws as Nightingale and I'm no fan that the Steam reviews deem that game very positive and this one mixed. Enshrouded knows what it is and you can tell very quickly. A voxel survival game. The voxel part is used for an amazing building system, it has fun class/character progression and skills. The combat and survival aspect however I found to be very bad.\nIn Nightingale: Its linear quest progression takes away player agency. Building is alright. Combat is pretty bad, but it works I guess. No character progression and skills besides the items you craft. \n\n- Palworld: Very flawed but the focus is the pocket monster catching and the monsters helping in the base. Amazing feeling. \n* In Nightingale: Your companions feel as unique and interesting as the enemy swines and wolfs are predictable. There is just nothing there. No interaction, no dialogue, no unique behavior, no customization except what you give them to wear. If you recruit someone else, the previous companion dissapears and leaves a chest with its items. \n\n[b] Verdict: [/b]\nNightingale feels like a game with so many awesome ideas that I wish I could support, but a game that does not know what it wants to be, and thus does everything either mediocre or underwhelming. If you've done one mandatory tower, you've done all the mandatory towers. If you've talked to one NPC you've experienced them all, if you've recruited one companion, you've recruited them all.\n\n[b] My Player Feedback: [/b]\nIf the developers were to look for a list of issues from a player's POV to improve on, mine would be this:\n- The progression is too repetitive. I felt like I knew what was going on within the first 2 hours. A survival game's power is in the player experiencing the world for the first time and slowly working themselves up towards the next progression, which could be anything from a different ore resulting in different materials to a different card resulting in different materials. It would have been so satisfying to make a portal on my own and finding the next quest giver NPC. But since there is a questline I'm following finding an NPC in a new realm did nothing for me. \n- Drop the hand holding questline. The magic and beauty is in players just trying out cards they found or crafted without knowing what to do or where to go. It really should not come down to following a quest for progression. If I can't experiment, I don't want to play. Same goes with basic storytelling, if everything is being explained but a listener/reader is not invested in the overall story, then why tell the details in the first place. It just doesn't work like this.\n- The reused assets and AI are very obvious for me as a player, and it takes away from any urge I feel to explore. If you're a procedural survival game, please adjust the way the assets work. Instead of a whole premade building and puzzels, try to go for biomes/areas with smaller premade assets. Minecraft's biomes/villages/towns are a good example of how every part of the map feels unique. Nightingale totally misses the mark and instead feels predictable and boring. \n- As a player I noticed very quickly that everything in the wild came in packs of 3. Another way for me to feel like I totally knew what was going on in the game's systems without even trying to figure it out. \n- Combat is just not there, but it feels like the base is solid. \n- Character uniqueness. I really liked the ideas of the family trees but nothing was done with it afterwards. Why not use a system like that and implement it partly into the story. Why can't I go for a certain theme. I didn't get far enough but it seems like I was just going to get a gun and a melee weapon. Terrraria is a great example of being able to wield and use everything but still building towards a specific theme or build.\n\n[b] Positives/Conclusion: [/b]\nAs you might be able to tell from the length of this review, I'm very invested into Nightingale as a concept.

There's little to no story or end goal to give all the things you do purpose and after a short time you realize the only game progression is the next tier of materials, tools, and weapons. You can build sprawling large buildings and furnish them, and in some of these games even entire villages, which would be a lot of fun if there were people living in them, but there really aren't and even if you do get a few, they rarely have their own needs or objectives so its like, why bother?

The game looks beautiful, with it's rolling waves and amazing trees and landscape, but the UI is absolutely terrible. For instance, whenever you want to build anything, you firstly have to place the item (which looks like a blueprint) onto the landscape. Then you have to open up the blueprint to add the resources to build it. Why can't I simply place the blueprint and it instantly builds if I have the required items in my inventory? That's how 99% of the survival/building games work and it's a no brainer. If it ain't broke why fix it? The word 'clunky' definitely comes to mind.\n\nYou start the game in a forest setting where you quickly meet Puck, who gives you some brief chores to do, such as collect sticks and rocks. There is no doubt that the graphics look amazing, and this game probably has the best looking sea I have seen in a game, with its rolling waves etc. But unfortunately, great graphics do not necessarily make a great game. \n\nSo I gather the resources, thinking that I am going to start some mad adventure, exploring the beautiful environment, only for Puck to quickly appear again to advise me to travel through to the next portal. The creatures and enemies that I encountered presented no difficulty whatsoever. I travelled through to a desert biome, and that's exactly what it was - barren! \n\nI don't understand why the game was trying to rush me from the first area I arrived in so quickly?

The way, the realms of the fae wilds progress and also can be changed by the player reminded me of walking through the shadows of Amber in Roger Zelazny's books.\n\nMy experience started with only minor if any preconceptions, as I had only seen a few trailers in the past years and a glimpse into the gameplay watching streams during the stress test. But I did not follow its development or learned about its premises and setting.\n\nStarting my foray into the faewilds with just my underwear, as I had caroused the night before the calamity, I soon found myself gathering and crafting the necessities of life while establishing a little place to call home. If you choose to prep for the end-times ahead, you will start your adventure quite better geared.\n\nDifficulty is entirely in your own hands, as you can at any given time tune the challenge of your environment to a level you are comfortable with.\n\nThe gathering systems are engaging, if occasionally a little janky (I am looking at you, tree of frame stutter). With lots of different stats on basic resources, the final product of a crafting process can vary greatly depending on the input. Depending on the difficulty you play at, you find yourself really looking into the depths of the crafting systems or you can pretty much ignore it on easier modes.\n\nYour gear can be buffed through various means, fully under your control.\n*) starting with the components you use in the process of creating it\n*) followed by increases in selected stats through infusions\n*) adding charms for additional mechanics (additional gathering, movement increases on certain conditions, short term damage buffs and more)\n*) enchanting your weapons to add a wide range of active abilities (healing, damage, weak-point information, boss-tracking, ease of gathering and more)\n\nAll this allows you to tailor your gear to your preferred playstyle, or change your rhythm by using something completely different.\n\nUsing the mechanic of minor realm cards, you can influence the mechanics of your current realm in various degrees, enhancing movement, changing weather, food mechanics, gathering and crafting multipliers and other aspects of the game.\n\nThe combat system starts out with a heavy focus on melee and it takes a while until you get good options for ranged or magic combat. Combat feels a bit janky at times, but I have the impression this may be due to connectivity-issues/server response times. \n\nOverall, you will need some patience, as various crafting options for weapons/items improvements/spells take a few hours of gameplay to become available.\n\nInventory management and item input for crafting is currently in need of improvement. The systems are perfectly workable, but are a few years behind what you would nowadays expect as quality of life. The team is aware of this and actively working on it as short term points on their roadmap.\n\nYou will experience a progressing story, which seems only a fraction of the final experience, but again, its early access and not a final product. In my opinion, the english voice acting of the prime narrator is quite good.\n\nFor me, the game was very engaging on my first playthrough of the currently available story on hard difficulty realms only and after that a short foray into the current endgame. I did not rush, used the available information in-game only, learned the various complex systems currently in place and finished after about 70 hours.\n\nI was intrigued enough to start a second run on extreme difficulty only, just to see how the scaling works and if I could actually make it. I found it necessary to engage with a lot more systems the game currently provides to overcome that challenge, but I finished it after about 50 more hours.\n\nOverall, I am looking forward to the future development and will revisit this game in a few months.", "timestamp_created": 1710718705, "timestamp_updated": 1710719709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160423001": {"recommendationid": "160423001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085821920", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 171, "last_played": 1710291329}, "language": "english", "review": "I just can't recommend this game in its current state.  There isn't a single thing this game does that isn't done way better in another survival game.  The maps are boring and uninteresting, the combat is awful, the crafting is abysmal.  It looks pretty though even as un-optimized as it is.  The early game is such a slog with all the different material types (There are like 4 or 5 types of leather that are not interchangeable with each other.) Breakdown with my issue with the game:\n\nMaps:\nThere is nothing to do the map that I was on was relatively devoid of enemies so all I had to do was mine several type of rocks and chop down trees.  Speaking of mining and chopping trees who thought it was a good idea to not auto loot what you chop down?  Nothing like shopping down a tree then chasing a bunch of rolling logs.  The weather mechanics were a nice touch I like that you need to take shelter from the hail or you take damage.\n\nCombat: \nYou basically just mash the attack button no real strategy and the enemy AI is terrible.  There are stealth mechanics that I am going to guess get better at higher levels.  I fought some goblin type guys, some wolves, some boar and I manged to snipe a baby dear.  You need to attack the enemies corpse in order to get the mats from them which I find annoying.  On top of needing to attack the corpses they will drop different types of materials so you need to just keep wandering around until you stumble upon some animals.  But wait after killing them you may not get the hide you need because it may be a pelt or a skin and if it comes from a predator or prey (the different animal classifications) they wont stack.\n\nCrafting:\nThere are too many materials.  There are at least 4 different types of leather that I have found and they are not interchangeable so anything you craft needs the same type.  This would be fine if the animals were always around but you need to wander to find them.  Also why are there so many different rock types I already have several chests filled with rocks/mats that have no purpose.  The crafting menus are super click heavy, you need to click to add each material separately having it in your inventory won't do it (bonus points though for the autofil materials option), and the benches have no storage and are not linked to your storage bins.\n\nOverall there really isn't anything that this game does good it is a neat idea and the visuals are great but there just ins't anything that makes me want to play the game.

There are some comically bad design choices as far as UI and how things are presented to the player. Things that shouldnt be hard are incredibly convoluted like building a campfire your first time lol. Progression/ unlocking recipes sucks, its terrible, I hate the way they did it. You have to buy every blueprint from a trader and you dont unlock any new tools, weapons, armor, ect until way way late in the game. I am almost 20 hours in now and still using the simple versions of everything and can only build the basic crude walls and floors. If your expecting to go in guns blazing think again, you wont see a gun until decent ways into the game, your gonna be slingshot blazing for the first 20 hours in hide clothes looking nothing like the industrial age explorer you thought youd be. \n\nAside from these comically bad design choices the actual game itself is beautiful. The environment, monsters, lore, and gameplay are awesome. Combat is oddly satisfying for what looks like a button mash. Heavy weapons make enemies recoil in the direction the weapon was swinging making heavy weapons like the maul incredibly fun to use. Headshots and backstabs have a nice critical effect and feel substantial. Despite any variety in the grear you can make the actual status effects and damage types do have a nice complexity that requires some thought instead of just equipping the one with the biggest number. \n\nForcing online play is a stupid decision, no way around that. That alone is going to make the game laggy and difficult to play for a lot of people right off the bat. That being said the way they have done things actually allows you to play in the same worlds as your friends without needing a dedicated host or server. You can actually even connect your game with multiple different friends games and even hop between their games all while they are offline. It even ties into the lore of the game with this portal/ realm system they have.

(EDITED AFTER PLAYING MORE)\n\nTLDR: If you want the best possible experience out of this game RIGHT NOW, don\u2019t get it. If you\u2019re down to explore a great game with a cool concept, and you\u2019re interested in seeing how it grows OR helping it grow, get it.\n\nThe portal/realm system is revolutionary. I love that you can affect how a realm\u2019s general atmosphere is going to be with various cards. There are only three biomes you can explore for now, but I\u2019m certain this will expand in the future.\n\nAfter playing more hours:\n1. Upgrading your gear is pretty sick. The buffs you can give each piece of equipment make it fun to craft stuff. Just got my first gun, and I added a charm that will increase its damage with each shot until I miss. SICK.\n\n2. I didn't realize that I had to add augmentations to unlock the other craftables. It makes it an interesting challenge to make sure your augmentations are connected to your crafting stations.\n\n3. Lots of QoL stuff should be implemented in inventory management, but it's not a deterrent in any way. (Needs quick stack, sorting, filtering)\n\n4. Fighting with a ranged weapon is fun. If you're expecting souls-like type of fights, this isn't the game for you. The mobs are just like other survival games. Some will charge at you, some will try to bite you, some will use projectile attacks. Bosses are fun to fight with friends, but again, it's not gonna require any sort of strategy to beat them.\n\n5. Exploration is no longer tedious thanks to the minor realm cards, which allow you to apply slow-falling and stamina buffs. Add to that the ability to jump-dash with your weapon out, it's pretty quick and satisfying to get around.\n\n6, Building is fun, but you need to progress a lot more to unlock more structure types. Don't expect to have the nicest walls/foundations/etc available early on.\n\nI think the fact that I'm playing with friends also adds to the fun in this game.

If you have good internet and live in the US, you'll be fine though. If you live elsewhere or have bad internet see other reviews.\n\nCharacter Creation: Not pretty, but adequate and above average for a $30.00 early access game.\n\nCombat: Don't presume to know for more advanced enemies. Thus far no challenge but some enemy diversity. Doesn't seem to be the focus.\n\nPros:\n\nSurvival: This game doesnt seem tedious in my opinion in its survival mechanics but early on shows more diversity than many other games. Environments that expect you to shield yourself from the sun, avoiding hailstorms by taking cover, a valheim like food and stamina system, equipment repair that is relevant but not tedious since its exported to a universal material that can be extracted from any resource, swamps that give diseases if you wade through the water too long, wetness that effects gear and stamina and health long term. I like this, if you don't actually like survival, put this in the con category. We'll see if they front loaded mechanics or if there are more in a followup review.\n\nWorld/Atmosphere: Very pretty worlds, and extremely relaxing which is what I like from my survival crafting games. I've seen a few reviews complaining about world diversity, I noted their time in game, and that they complained the tutorial took them nearly an hour, I would take those reviews with a grain of salt. Anyone who says \"there are only three maps\" is talking about starting areas, the whole idea being you collect cards thay allow you to unlock new realms. Now, I'm not to the realms extending outside the starting area but these ones are gorgeous thus far, and it seems to me that to be at the same point I'm at like most of these people are and claim there's only three maps likely requires braindead comprehension of the mechanics the game painstakingly tried to teach you during the \"long tutorial\" that clearly didn't sink in...\n\nTutorial: I feel its the right mix of freedom and explanation for me personally, but, can understand how those who just dont understand exploring buttons, finding menus, picking up objecfs, or basic survival craft mechanics could be confused. If this is your first ever video game period, the tutorial will leave much to be desired, if you enjoy the survival craft genre, you'll find nothing unintuitive about the tutorial.\n\nCrafting/Building: Complex and layered mechanics for considering effects augmentations and synergies that make the game more interesting then many. Inspired by the upgrade system of adding elements from Valheim, but extending it to universals like all objects benefitting from warmth and cover and being on a foundation early on, but with far more indications of modifiers from the practical to the mystic as you progress (Seemingly more universal and less item by item niche).

I hope the developers will listen to player's feedbacks and do what's necessary. \nIf you were thinking of buying it, wait a few months to see how things goes. But if a single-player mode isn't implemented in the future, move on.\n\n\n\n\nA l'heure actuel, je ne peux pas recommander ce jeux. Le fait de devoir \u00eatre tout le temps connect\u00e9 \u00e0 internet et de d\u00e9pendre des serveurs impacte grandement les performances. m\u00eame avec une connexion robuste, vous n'\u00eates pas \u00e0 l'abri d'une coupure. \nJe pense qu'il faudrait que Nightingale s'inspire du syst\u00e8me de Conan Exiles, qui donne la possibilit\u00e9 de jouer en local et \u00e9galement en multijoueur.\nEn attendant, ce probl\u00e8me est trop impactant. j'esp\u00e8re que les d\u00e9veloppeurs \u00e9couteront les feedback des joueurs et feront le n\u00e9cessaire. Si vous pensiez l'acheter, attendez plusieurs mois pour voir comment les choses \u00e9volueront. Mais si un mode solo n'est pas impl\u00e9menter dans le futur, passez votre chemin.", "timestamp_created": 1708466724, "timestamp_updated": 1708466927, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519072294235229492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160365836": {"recommendationid": "160365836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083228463", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128, "last_played": 1711000893}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\nI will leave the cat here, so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\uff0f\uff1e\u3000\u3000\u30d5\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000| \u3000_\u3000 _ l\n\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\uff0f` \u30df\uff3fx\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 /\u3000 \u30fd\u3000\u3000 \uff89\n\u3000 \u3000 \u2502\u3000\u3000|\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000\uff0f\uffe3|\u3000\u3000 |\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000| (\uffe3\u30fd\uff3f_\u30fd_)__)\n\u3000\uff3c\u4e8c\u3064\n\n\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\n\nthis game looks SO good-", "timestamp_created": 1710212339, "timestamp_updated": 1710212339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518930971622467041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158832924": {"recommendationid": "158832924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198890424683", "num_games_owned": 800, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1708460859}, "language": "english", "review": "Nope, refunded.", "timestamp_created": 1708461004, "timestamp_updated": 1708461004, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518867909908294678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161313049": {"recommendationid": "161313049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262009923", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 521, "playtime_at_review": 1983, "last_played": 1712633272}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly wasn't sure if I would like this game since it had mixed reviews.

We've played a lot of survival games in the past and out of all of them this is one of the only few that stand out.\n\nIts theme and setting is awesome, victorian steampunk era delving through the infinite faewild realms, the concepts are there and the execution is good, not fantastic or anything but still commendable.\nThis game is still early access but compared to many other games that release in early access (or full releases in recent times) it still feels like a full game that is in the stage of ironing out bugs and implementations. There are rough spots but the devs have good credibility with me that they will be fixed in the future.\n\nMusic, atmosphere and visuals are all pretty good and immersive, the gameplay has some kinks to work out but its passable for me. The survival aspect is easier than other games which helps me enjoy it more as a casual gamer, it can be challenging but honestly I enjoy it more not being difficult with making you die a hundred times.\n\nThere are some aspects I find lacking however, being set inside the faewilds I would expect more strangeness and unique setting but so far the main difference between realms is different colour swatches for plants and animals and a rotation of types of ruins based on what realm is activated.\n\nThe crafting system is a bit too complex to get my head around as every material gives different stat bonuses and there's little to figure out what does what, theres also different colour swatches for outfits based on what materials you use with zero preview or indication what it will be which I find annoying. Additionally an annoying aspect of the game is the augmentation system which requires certain items of furniture to be placed in proximity of workbenches in order to craft certain things, this creates cluttered areas quickly which gets complicated by the small build limits and the fact that theres a maximum number that you can have.\n\nAll in all this game has rough edges but it doesn't impact the game enough for me not to recommend it, I do wish for several things to be fixed and more content added but it is only a month after than release and the devs have given a schedule for planned updates so I'm fine to give it time.\nI'm still playing and still having fun.", "timestamp_created": 1711264120, "timestamp_updated": 1711264120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518733322620391846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158994655": {"recommendationid": "158994655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198802611346", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 881, "last_played": 1709822668}, "language": "english", "review": "Until they solved their connection issue.\n", "timestamp_created": 1708627940, "timestamp_updated": 1708770557, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518712639808654785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158965432": {"recommendationid": "158965432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020982406", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1708813222}, "language": "english", "review": "best game i've ever played currently and my PC might be on fire but its a really nice game", "timestamp_created": 1708603076, "timestamp_updated": 1708681621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518662929534912109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158878757": {"recommendationid": "158878757", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985410929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1708508339}, "language": "english", "review": "To the devs. I hope you read this.

Every character looks like they have gigantism or some type of FAS. Huge noses, knobby bones, teeny eyes, they look...creepy. \n- Extremely convoluted and complex crafting and build system. There are just too many stations that exist, arent explained, can utilize any combination of resources, and don't give any sense of 'X leads to Y leads to Z'. The whole system pulls you out of the game to interact with clunky menus.\n- Granted im only about 10hours in but the worlds seem very small. Like, every resource you need is within eyeshot for the most part. This makes the game feel more grindy and less exploring based which is part of the fun of a survival game. Traverse dangerous conditions and elite mobs to find key resources you need to progress. Here? Just run 45 seconds over to that hill, boom. You can easily traverse the entire map in like 5-10 minutes. \n- The game needs more hand-holding. In the 3rd world I found some underground lair that had a portal. Obviously, I cleared the area and took the portal. When I was done, I used the 'Return Home' button on the map to fast travel. It took me back to my house from 2 previous worlds ago and I have no way to get back to the world that I was on and where my main questline was. \n- My last gripe is a general gripe to basically every survival game out there. This includes Valheim, Enshrouded, Nightingale, etc. Please, please put some actual voice characters and narration into the game. Im so burnt out with the 'random note found in a cave' or the absolutely mission critical NPC who doesnt ever speak. I want to HEAR the characters, I want to feel a part of the story, not a footnote of a long dead unnamed explorer who left his journal on a dead bear. \n\nOverall I would let this EA bake a little longer. I think it has promise and I intend on coming back to it but right now there are just so many other survival games out right now that do this formula better and more enjoyably than Nightingale. Which is, to be honest, a huge disappointment for me as I've been following the game for well over a year.

Do I recommend this game? Yes and No. It's VERY aesthetically pleasing. I am super into the story and want to know where it goes.

Combat is SUPER clunky no matter what you use for a weapon. The AI you fight jump around a ton and I have missed so many point blank shots it's not even funny.  Building is not the best, especially for roof pieces you want to remove. You have to jump up to damage them to remove them....which eats your stamina. I chose the Forest as my starting realm. I had to travel all the way across the map to get to the trader (which I didn't mind because I wanted to explore). What I didn't like is that the trader and other npc's were on a small beach at the bottom of cliffs. After shimming my way down to them....I had no way of getting back up. The little climbing axes didn't even work and just ate my stamina until I fell back to the beach taking fall damage. I had to skirt my way around the cliffs and water, half way around the island, before I found a climbable path. It was a severe waste of time and I didn't enjoy it at all. Please make the tools you give players work properly. I also feel like the menu system is way over cluttered. There's to many menus to dig through for a survival game. I know this is early access. If quality of life changes are made, tools work properly and combat gets a little better...I would definitely recommend this game. Will I stop playing it?

Much of what can set it apart isn't apparent right away but needs a few hours to unlock and experience. It isn't Valheim, nor is it Enshrouded, and it isn't trying to be. I played in 2 closed alpha tests and have been further than the 7.3hrs I have as of this review.\n\nA lot of what will set Nightingale apart from others in the genre is aesthetic - the Victorian, gaslamp-punk theme - but a few mechanics are a welcome addition. It is online-only with company-hosted servers (at least during Early Access) which is something to keep in mind. Nightingale is it's own thing - but there are enough similarities between it and other heavy hitters in the genre that you may find yourself comparing it to them. If you've played a lot of crafting-survival games, you know what you're in for. It's Crafting-heavy, Survival-lite. \n\nFor me, it's some of the best elements in the genre. Here are some key differences and points to consider:\n\n[h1]Survival[/h1]\n[*] Food - You can have 3 different foods active at a time, a la Valheim or Enshrouded. They provide various buffs\n[*] There is no detrimental hunger or thirst to worry about, other than not having their associated buffs\n[*] Every single food provides different buffs - even \"mixed vegetables\" can stack differently depending on which vegetables you mixed, so inventory management is a thing with foods (even if there is only one icon for mixed vegetables, they may not be the same combo and are thus different stacks)\n[*] If you die, you keep what is in your hotbar, but you drop what is in your inventory. You will respawn at your Estate cairn or the nearest Faerie Ring, and can retrieve your dropped items where you died.\n[*] 1-5 are your main hand and mousewheel will scroll between them. 6-0 are your offhand, and whatever you have equipped there can be used with 'F' (such as your umbrella, or food). Q is reserved for health potions in addition to the offhand.\n\n[h1]Crafting[/h1]\n[*] You right-click anything in your inventory and have the option to \"Extract\" it into Essence. Essence is both the currency of the game, as well as what you use to repair items. It is important to always have essence on hand for these reasons.\n[*] Once you progress a bit into the story, crafting stations can be augmented with additional, non-functional items (Examples include a coat rack, glass jug, training dummy, teapot, etc). These affect what recipes can be made at various crafting benches. It is important to note that you may need more than 1 of a certain crafting bench as each kind has a maximum number of augments. There are a lot of augment recipes available as you play. This, imo, adds to the pleasure of base-building and managing the look, rather than purely the functionality, of it all.\n[*] Benches and Augments are \"unlocked\" by purchasing them from vendors in exchange for essence. This means you will need to visit a variety of Realms in order to find different vendors from different factions to buy different crafting stations and augments. Augments unlock the ability for the bench to craft certain items, but does not unlock those items themselves\n[*] You purchase Recipes for items to craft from merchants, so again, traveling to other Realms is very important\n[*] You can blueprint out entire buildings at a time. They will remain like holographic representations of the floors, walls, etc. Then you can add materials as you acquire them, and it will build-out in the order of the pieces you laid. This makes planning out a building quite enjoyable. \n[*] Much like with food, every material used in crafting imparts it's own stats to gear. This means the type of leather depends on the beast it was harvested from, different metals have different effects, etc. This makes the crafting system quite deep once you're further in to the game and have access to more materials - I enjoy this, some may find it cumbersome, but it really lends to being able to tweak the gear to what you want it to be. This applies to just about everything you craft - even bullets. \n\n[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]\n[*] You play through a required single-player tutorial to learn the basics, then start your own Private realm to place your Estate cairn (Estate cairns will only work correctly in realms with the Abeyance card played, which you do as the last part of the tutorial).\n[*] From there, you can hit P, create a Party with friends on Steam and invite them to your realm. If they place THEIR Estate carins there, then any of you can log in and access that realm at any time. If they don't, they will only be able to access your realm if you invite them, each play session that you're online.\n[*] Players in your Realm can build, destroy, etc\n[*] When you use cards to create NEW realms, you can set them to Private (Party-only), or Public. Keep in mind the construction/demolition capabilities of all players if you set it to Public\n[*] You can only fast-travel to your 1 Estate Cairn stone, so be sure to put it in the same realm as a friend if you want to share a base and be able to play without the other online\n\n[h1]Gripes/Negatives[/h1]\n[*] While melee combat feels decent, it isn't good enough to hold this game on its own. It's okay as a part of the bigger picture, but some evolution in combat capabilities would be nice to see through Early Access.\n[*] Rest - Your Rested stat plays a big role in your maximum stamina, and the duration before your stamina drops noticeably is a bit short. Not game breaking, but I have to be cognizant of it a bit more than I want to be.\n[*] Some game-play elements, such as figuring out how Augments work and how to get them, aren't incredibly clear in-game. Googling or official-discord-visits may be necessary.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's Early Access. If this period continues with updates and they listen to the community, I think this is a really solid foundation to build out a game that stands among the heavy hitters of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1708527755, "timestamp_updated": 1708528809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158832464": {"recommendationid": "158832464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121461088", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 123, "last_played": 1710008095}, "language": "english", "review": "Had been waiting for this game a long time, so I had to buy it at launch. \nAfter a couple of play hours: I wish the game was more polished - Probably best to wait until the game and its mechanics are developed further.", "timestamp_created": 1708460628, "timestamp_updated": 1708460710, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159476973": {"recommendationid": "159476973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001715557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 12831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 910, "playtime_at_review": 4100, "last_played": 1713658045}, "language": "english", "review": "One week after release and I see mixed reviews, so hear are my two cents.

[/h2]\n\nI don't usually write reviews, but honestly, Nightingale deserves it.\nI am a fanatic when it comes to Open World Survival Craft, and Nightingale brings to the table a much-needed refreshing touch to the genre. Some may argue that the crafting system isn't for them, and that is okay, but having the same old copypasta system where all the work is done for you is.\n\nWhen crafting, for example, weapons, you require certain generic components such as metal ingots, but depending on which type, such as copper, tin, etc. it not only changes its attributes but also its LOOKS! A fantastic addition to detail, making things feel unique, and finally a game that I can play knowing for certain that the best gear available is the one I myself craft!\n\nI believe this game is meant to be taken slowly, the amount of times where I simply stop in my tracks when visiting a random realm and just stare at the scenery is a constant reminder of how beautiful this game is. The pure curiosity that makes me wonder about and simply forget about objectives or quests, a sense of rekindled sense of wonder.\n\nThe theme of Victorian-Style mixed with Fae Realms is amazing, the concept of using portals with combinations of cards and difficulty to tweak exactly what type of world you want, after which you can alter it even more, by giving the world a magical alteration, such as gravity, loot chance, increased resource gathering, stronger attacks.\n\nThe building system is amazing, with certain things being a little iffy, that I am sure are going to be fixed, but nothing that makes me want to stop playing immediately, I am always excited to build more and more and expand my homestead.\n\nNow onto the iffy parts of the game... The combat is a little lackluster, at times it starts to become very repetitive, with only a handful of enemy types, with very similar attack patterns. Occasionally there are a few bugs, some of them worse than others, and certain things such as images for some resources, quest dialog, and voice acting, haven't been implemented yet.\nGeneral complaints have been about for example: \n\"Oh you cannot craft from containers, you need to have it in your inventory\" - This is easily fixed for the game simple to add that in the near future, it is not game breaking, and just requires you to be a little more organized in your storage spaces, BUT... the devs are working on implementing it :D\n\"Oh, the game is always online, Why if I'm playing alone?\" - Due to how the game is built it is required, and I am almost certain that most people here do not have a super NASA computer to run multiple instances of realms and maps as they are all connected. simultaneously. BUT... yet again, the devs are working on an offline mode, so all is good :D.\n\nBut that is the thing, we have to remember, this game is in Early Access at a very reasonable price, things are bound not to work, and a lot of stuff needs to be fixed, altered, and added, this is by no means a perfect game, but the hours I've sunk, and intend to sink even more, are proof that this game has an incredible foundation already, I urge you if you can afford the price of perhaps 1-2 takeout meals, that would disappear in like 30 minutes of eating, to try out this game, and see for yourself, without the negativity ruling your life. You yourself determine whether this game is for you or not.\n\nIf you choose to come join in on the adventure, well then, I hope to see you out there Realmwalker.\n\nTL;DR - The game is awesome with a lot of unique systems in play, worth the price, expect some bugs, it's early access after all, and the Devs are listening, and working on it! give them some time, all good things come to those who wait <3", "timestamp_created": 1709581927, "timestamp_updated": 1709581927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518038332462310791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162733466": {"recommendationid": "162733466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085922694", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3811, "playtime_at_review": 5196, "last_played": 1713768967}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game!

But that's how this game is:  you have to pay attention to figure out how to go about and do things.  That may be a bit too much for a subset of gamers who see something shiny, want to jump in and expect a straightforward approach they've seen everywhere else.  I don't think it's bad design, as I personally \n like taking my time and figuring stuff out myself.  Maybe others crash too much and stop playing (Became an issue after recent patch.  I could see how annoying that could be especially if you don't have a high speed SSD and system to boot)\n\nDon't misunderstand:  this game holds your hand and guides you through a lot of the major mechanics and it's great that they do because I have not come across some of the novel realm-building and micro-managing crafting mechanics they're introducing here - but there are still a lot you can miss if you don't take your time to read through what is given to you in your menus.\n\nIt can be simple enough to just plow through, and you'll survive, but if you want to make the best gear (without using the purple grape Twitch drops) then it becomes necessary to plan your approach.\n\nNow it begs: do we need the best-in-slot for this game?  I do not know yet.  I play solo and most things have been relatively easy to figure out and kill, but I just got whacked by some Remnant type mega-ent  that surrounded me with brambles under the blood moon and I it got me wishing I had some fire-type axe of sort - and that's what got me digging into how I could go about and crafting such a thing.\n\nSo if you enjoy great writing and losing yourself in the realms of the Fae, and having the means to customize how you craft, you should check it out.  For an Early Access game, this feels pretty polished and AAA.  That is saying a lot considering how many \"Finished\" games are coming out nowadays that are regretfully sub-par.\n\nOther points:\n[+++] I absolutely love that you craft your augmentations and actually have them make sense and need to populate your workshop with it.  I usually role-play and add tables and knick-knacks in other games to make the workshop feel like it is a workshop - but in this game, you actually will want to craft a little tool box or sawhorse and put it beside your crafting table, for example, and it will provide augmentations and/or recipes  to those tools.  Wonderful mechanic that will also make your place feel immersive and alive.\n\n[+-] Give Melvin an axe and he will gather wood for you, but may also destroy your newly built tent when you're trying to build shelter in the wild Fae realms.\n\n[+]  Companion NPC AI is not the best but they've put focus on how they can be helpful:  If you make a chest and designate it for your companion (Again, it's a little tick-box that is easily missed) they will automatically drop their stuff there and also grab materials and help you finish up your blueprint creations around the base.  They'll also keep the fires going if there's wood in there.  If not, they've been known to stand in the fire and BE the kindling themselves.  Such dedication.  They'll also revive your sorry butt almost instantaneously when an overgrown tree steps on you.\n\n[+]  It's really easy to play with friends.  I also found the little tick box that allows you to set a Realm to public when you learn how to create your own portals.  Easy to miss, being such a major thing. \n\n[-] UI player interaction may need to get some more work.  Portal information (realm type, difficulty, public/private) disappears after first use.  It'd be nice to always see that but I think they're working on it.\n\n[++]  The devs seem to be actively listening on their site and are addressing the key issues.\n\n[+++]  blueprint method mechanic of crafting is really handy, especially if working with other players.  You place your thing down, and it remains a \"ghost\" blueprint of what it will be, with prominent  display of what it needs to get built and you or others, including your npc companion, can just gather and drop the items on it until it gets built.\n\n\nThere's a lot more to say, I'm sure, but I'm only 40 hours in, but I am having a good time.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1708964701, "timestamp_updated": 1708964701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517740726470947266", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159405159": {"recommendationid": "159405159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011833666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1708478336}, "language": "english", "review": "if you look at the intro of this game and feel like this is a world you'd like to live in, and relax and craft an make a home in then this might be a game for you, however, if you're more interested in having a more minecraft balance of building and \"fighting\" then maybe not.

The resource graphics are just copy and pasted stones sticks and bushes and they dont look good at all, the game lacks so much.\r\n\r\nI will come back and check in 6 months to a year and see if the game has improved, no mans sky did something similar to this game so hopefully this game sorts itself out so i will come back and check it later\r\nBut as it stands i cant recommend it, ive asked for a refund too which is taking ages, they can take your money instantly but a refund can take up to 2 weeks...", "timestamp_created": 1710084781, "timestamp_updated": 1710084781, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516643047332763672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158922481": {"recommendationid": "158922481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842997432", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1708495965}, "language": "english", "review": "has potential but wasn't ready\ngg go next", "timestamp_created": 1708550981, "timestamp_updated": 1708550981, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516638398170471191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158890460": {"recommendationid": "158890460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007341960", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1708712261}, "language": "english", "review": "Preparing realm...\n                             All is ready...\n________________________________\n|                         NETWORK ERROR                      \n|               A network error has occurred.              \n|                                                                             \n|                                    [OK]                                  \n|                                                        ID <dratted> \n|_______________________________", "timestamp_created": 1708522920, "timestamp_updated": 1708523054, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516636490821838379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159622419": {"recommendationid": "159622419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164945603", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 418, "last_played": 1709309801}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't typically leave comments on games because I either enjoy them or I don't.

Regrettably, there are numerous shortcomings and errors present in the game that could fill a novel.\n\nThe most glaring flaw is the lack of substantial content. While it boasts a \"quest\" system, it does little to enhance the overall gameplay and often becomes more of a nuisance than a feature.

The mechanics currently in the start are solid. The tutorial makes it obvious what needs doing and how, at least for myself but I've played many survival games so perhaps I am just more accustomed to it. There are some rough patches like graphical issues with shadows that I and a friend had but nothing too major that i wouldn't expect from an early access game. After around 10 hours of play between two people we ran into only two bugs ourselves. One where my friend would teleport on the other side of the map in our respite realm when using the teleport function and one time I crashed when going through a portal. Said crash happened once out of like maybe 20+ different uses of the portal function between the two of us. Overall the game is rough around the edges, but it has good bones. The survival mechanics are good, standard but good, and the upgrading and enchanting system in the early game feels fun too. We spent a couple hours trying to figure some things out that were not obvious to us with how enchanting works, but it ended up we were just being dumb so it was more of us being the issue rather than the game. The thing that really makes this game is the realm card system. It's great. Being able to alter the place you are going to meet certain needs is loads of fun. And going and altering the  realm you already are in with a minor card that changes the world and how it functions is great. We played a card that ended up turning our world purple, all the grass and trees suddenly went from green to shades of purple and pink. Or one that made it so we could see up into space at all times. Cool stuff that while wasn't a huge thing in our gameplay, added that little extra something that made us go \"oooh, aaahh\" when we did it. Overall I would say the game is in a good place to start with and I hope to see more good content for it in the future.

It's not an issue for me because I rarely play games for longer than 2 years unless I love them but most games like this do not shell out additional money to transform online only into local before dying, so be warned.\n\nWith that out of the way, overall Nightinggale is a charming survival crafting game with a (seemingly) deep crafting system. I'm not extremely far in the game yet as I haven't figured out a good cadence to progression (like, do I build new buildings in every realm or keep going back, how do I get back to where I was before, etc). The different realms so far haven't been \"wow amazing exploration\" but they're neat. I have no idea how multiplayer works yet.\n\nThe combat is \"fine\". It's a little more complex than unmodded vanilla skyrim. However, hitting enemies with melee weapons results in a visible impact and a nice crack that feels pretty good.\n\nThe soundtrack is the weakest part of the game. It's neither charming nor interesting, and it's very mutable. The music you hear in the trailer is pretty much the entire game's soundtrack so far as far as I can tell.\n\nBuilding is fun for me. I haven't unlocked many decorative parts but the crafting system is nice and encourages building homes for a purpose rather than purely decoration (different stations affect other stations, lighting has a purpose, et cetera).", "timestamp_created": 1708521137, "timestamp_updated": 1708521232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516040384769439697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158854831": {"recommendationid": "158854831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198438103822", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1709771606}, "language": "english", "review": "its imaginative, fresh, and alive with personality. the characters are kinda laughably ugly when you select your presets but the editing already is pretty deep and the menus explicitly state what features they plan to add later. i look  forward to many many many hours of enjoyment here.\n\nHowever, i may now doubt that since the devs caved to the pressure of an unintelligent screeching minority that the game didn't affect.", "timestamp_created": 1708481003, "timestamp_updated": 1708642803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515999972820281982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158854803": {"recommendationid": "158854803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131679225", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1708477314}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\nAbsolutely beautiful game\nSolid combat system\nSolid building design\nTrue to the survival/crafting genre\nRealm Transmutations are so fun\nSurprisingly optimized (for me and my low budget PC)\nVery unique character creation \nLOVE the Realm Generating\n10/10 voice acting \n\nCons:\nNavigating the hot bar is slow and inefficient, here I would like to see it be just 1 singular hot bar with faster mouse wheel scrolling. The mouse wheel scrolls way too slow and only works for half of the hot bar anyways (by design). Hot bars are fairly standard across all survival games, why complicate it?\nThe day to night transition is very sudden.\nGame progress is very slow and boring, progression is based on your gear level, which on paper seems fine, but the only way to get gear is from looting/traders/crafting/stealing from recruits and the game has very little anything to loot. It feels like the game should be designed to be a looter but there\u2019s nothing to really loot. Whereas resource gathering just takes too long to even get your average power to its requirement to even progress in the game. I understand the game is meant to be dependent on crafting to progress but the effort to put into that is so slow. Needs to be a healthy balance here.\nThere is no sense of reward from any task in the game. Being able to unlock and grind (heavily) for the next goal at hand leaves you feeling more burnt out than driven for what\u2019s next.\n\nOverall I think this game has SO MUCH potential, especially if you can play with others.

Here are my gripes:\n\n(20 Hour Update in comments.\n tldr; synopsis: Hard Pass. \nThis game hates you and wants to waste as much of your time as possible for some reason.)\n\n-When any weather event occurs, you lag. And by lag, I mean it stutters like crazy, and actually doing anything becomes problematic. Feels bad man. \n\n-Encumbrance is a mystery. Getting the backpack doubled my weight limit, but it seems that all the crap I have to carry around to function weighs 40 pounds anyway... so that sucks. The fistfuls of berries and meat you shove in your face all weigh about a pound a piece and if you don't have several of each, you have no health or stamina. See below for more info on Food Buffs.\n\n-The Survival mechanics are the same essential \"Sleep and Eat or Suck\" nonsense. Apparently you can die from not sleeping in this, but you'll die from nine other things first, when low energy fatigue sets your stamina at 4 points, which is barely enough to swing a weapon once before a long recharge. So any enemy will wreck you in a matter of mere hours while you try kill it and it ineffectively mauls you over and over. OR you may just get caught in a hailstorm, and die from rocks falling on your stupid, tired face. \n\n-The progression system is built around a Destiny-esque Gear-Score system. All of your progress in this game is tied to gear. You do not gain levels, you don't get abilities, and there is no \"experience\".\n\n-The primary currency in the game is \"Essence\". This is gained from breaking down objects of various tiers into the constituent \"being-ness\". It also occasionally drops when you gather any kind of resource in a world of that tier. \nOnce you start needing higher tier essences, the game grinds to a halt, and it becomes a repetitive and unrewarding process of trying to find that ever more valuable \"stuffiness\" of the stuff you are smashing. \n\n-Progress is also tied to crafting \"Realm Cards\" that let you do one of two things: Select the type and level of the world you are trying to go to... or Alter the world you are already in, often with dramatic downsides. For instance, one such Card I got thrust the realm into permanent darkness, and perpetually hurt me, all for a slight increase in loot from the \"Bound\", the zombie like denizens of the realms you traverse. It sucked and I immediately had to craft a \"Cleanse\" card to undo my horrific mistake. In the dark. While I got pinged by the existential nothingness of the realm I had wrought... or some shit. \n\n-There does not seem to be any real use for the metal ore I gathered and refined. I have progressed up to the next tier, and still am locked out of crafting anything more interesting than a stone axe or a leather drape for my butt. 8 hours in, and I'm still stuck in noobie rags that I have to spend resources upgrading. Usually you at least have a vision of when you can get alloyed armor or tools, but I see no such indication that I will be unlocking that any time soon. Perhaps the very next thing I do will unlock it, but I don't really care anymore. \n\n-You cannot move crafting stations, containers, or anything once it is built, and the only way to remove it, is to smash it with your stone shit-weapons. You lose resources in this process. And sometimes hit the floor or wall behind the thing you are trying to smash. \n\n-8 hours in and the only ranged weapon available to me is a \"Sling Bow\" that shoots marbles. It sucks, and cannot take down a deer without four or five very precise, and lucky crit-hits. \nThis means your only solution to getting their skin and meat is to chase them. \n\n-Running, fighting, or chasing sucks. Everything costs stamina, and you only get a little bit without using expensive, time-consuming, and heavy food buffs. I found that you can stack these pretty deep, since it tracks every food buff based on the item it grants, and if the items don't stack, the buffs do, so you can do some neat things, but the buffs only last about 12 minutes, (Without the corresponding realm card that increases buff length, \"Feast\"). So actually fighting becomes a chore of juggling buffs and food items in your inventory. \n\nIf you have enough of the food buffs, thought, combat becomes trivial, and the only real problem is how much hammer the enemies' faces can actually sponge up before getting crushed. Holy crap... I just smashed an overgrown Fae-Goblin in the face with a stone maul, and he took 26 damage. Cool. Lets do it five more times. \n\n-Building is okay, but as stated before, there are no happy accidents in Nightingale. You will be smashing walls to expand or fix errors. On top of that, everything is too expensive, and materials are heavy and sparse. It takes far too long to gather wood and stone, and you will be sick of it in a matter of minutes. \n\nOverall, its not great. It is a generic Survival-Craft game with the same uninspired \"Eat and sleep or suck\" mechanics, with a slightly worse progression system and a sortof \"Steam-punk/Victorian Cave-man feel\" to it. \nAlso, the goat man's magic words do not make me feel good. He sounds like a more condescending mixture of V for vendetta and Edgar Allen Poe. Ick. \nThe trailer had guns in it, but you will smashing rocks with a stone pick for nineteen (edit: No... more like forty) hours before you see your first musket.", "timestamp_created": 1709161350, "timestamp_updated": 1709448144, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515828251838684082", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158840772": {"recommendationid": "158840772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182365235", "num_games_owned": 929, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1708566071}, "language": "english", "review": "No mans sky situation, over promised, over hyped, hopefully a few updates will help", "timestamp_created": 1708467534, "timestamp_updated": 1708467534, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515804708003997803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159909640": {"recommendationid": "159909640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086834723", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 9004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4010, "last_played": 1710778071}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

The base gameplay loop for upgrading your gear and finding higher tier materials to craft higher tier gear totally sucked me in.

I personally think it's at a fine pace. The crafting system is intuitive with being able to make better quality base materials, and it's similar to Valheim where you need to put add-ons near your benches to be able to craft something new.

Stranded beyond our world, players are tasked with becoming skilled Realmwalkers to navigate a web of transdimensional portals to eventually discover the magical city of Nightingale. The game's promise of venturing through mystical portals into a variety of fantastical realms, crafting tools and weapons, and exploring stunning Gaslamp Fantasy landscapes is undeniably captivating.\n\nHowever, the game's execution falls short of its promising premise. The characters are disappointingly shallow, failing to engage players in the immersive world of Fae realms. The gameplay quickly becomes repetitive, and the mechanics are notably clunky, detracting from the overall enjoyment. Moreover, the absence of clear instructions results in simple tasks like crafting feeling unnecessarily complicated and frustrating.\n\nThe inventory, crafting, and quest systems are overly complex and confusing, making it challenging for players to fully immerse themselves in the game and enjoy the experience.\n\nOne significant issue that stands out is the lack of motivation to progress once you reach the Watch. After reaching this point, there's nothing compelling players to craft new and better gear or continue exploring the mystical realms, which significantly diminishes the game's replay value and long-term engagement.\n\nDespite its flaws, Nightingale still manages to offer a moderate level of enjoyment, especially when played with friends in the shared-world realmscape. Working together to build communal estates, uncover the mysteries of the realms, and face the challenges of the Fae can be genuinely engaging and fun.\n\nIn conclusion, while Nightingale has considerable potential with its captivating concept and enchanting Gaslamp Fantasy world, its current execution fails to deliver a truly satisfying and immersive experience. I sincerely hope the developers address the game's issues in future updates to unleash its full potential and provide players with a more enjoyable and engaging survival crafting adventure.

I like this game. I really, really do. I would *love* to be able to recommend this game. However, my policy is to judge a game not based on its potential but if I think, as it is, the game is worth it.\n\nI also ran into a bug during the tutorial that forced me to delete my character and start over after like 30 minutes in the character creator. This bug has not yet been patched.\n\nIt is also always online. This causes further issues I'll get into later.\n\nIn short, the game doesn't have enough content for what it is. Only three major biomes (Desert, Swamp, Forest, swamp and forest being very similar) with difficulty modifiers means that while yes, every zone can be different, they start to feel the same. \n\nVarious points of interest on the map don't have nearly enough variety. Depth of content is vital for a game like this. I'm not asking for every new POI to be new to me, but I also shouldn't be going \"ah, this one again\". There are maybe 4 defense POI layouts. Maybe 3-4 agility POI layouts. The same applies to most POIs. \n\nCombat also tends to be wonky. Everything is server side, which means I had enemies hitting me through my block because the server registered the hit before it registered me blocking. Enemies tend to be very jerky and hard to hit, and not in a skilled way, but in a \"these hippos are charging through me at mach 1, going straight up this sheer cliff, and then charging me again.\n\nThe biggest issue, though, is probably the loading times. Building in a zone is limited. Each zone can only have one minor card (basically a zone modifier) applied to it at a time. If you want to, say, stack both the card for more ammo and metal production with the farming card, you can get lost because those will be different realms. The process of moving between realms is that of waiting several minutes while the gate charges up and then opens (I believe this is the server assembling the zone), then waiting several *more* minutes in a loading screen to actually get to the zone, where you will then need to spend considerable time walking to the Fae Tower to clear it and get the POIs added to your map. Deserts in particular can be bad because terrain there is either sheer, nightmarishly difficult cliff to climb or flat open sands with nothing of interest.\n\nItems are also buggy. Sometimes putting something in your inventory will cause it to vanish. Sometimes mission critical interactables at POIs won't render. \n\nThe hotbar has room for 5 \"main\" items and 5 offhand items, but you have more than 5 main items you'll need regularly, which means a lot of shuffling items around.\n\nThe game is neat. There's a lot of potential here. I'm probably going to continue playing it, but that doesn't mean I *recommend* it. The current product is woefully unfinished and unpolished, however.\n\nCome back in six months to a year and it might be great. If it doesn't get abandoned by the devs, it has real potential.\n\nEDIT: Coming back to say my opinion hasn't changed, and additionally the devs annoy me because the only communication I've seen was a youtube video. \n\nI can't CTL-F a youtube video. I can't quickly reference a video. I can't skim through the whole thing to get an idea if they're saying anything relevant, where that is, etc. Always online issues still haven't been fixed either, and I suspect they're going to keep neglecting that hoping the review rating recovers.

It's early access, the game reflects that, but Devs are upfront about it. It's not one of those EA titles where they're trying to pretend it isn't.\n\nIn some aspects there's a great foundation in Nightingale. But raw content aside, there's a lot more work to go.\n\nCombat has potential to be really quite fun and engaging. But it will depend solely on improvements to AI. The tools you have at your disposal are already really quite fun and varied. But what you fight against is currently a bit dull, and a bit dumb.\n\nCrafting will be absolutely fine, and serve the vision of the game once the Devs implement some QoL features, and overhaul/update parts of the UI. There are too many different stations in the game to not have the option to craft from nearby storage (and build, but more on that later). Even if it has to be an object you build, or when you upgrade your crafting stations to the next level - it NEEDS to be added. \n\nAlso you can't currently split and merge stacks of items without first transferring them to a different container, or dropping them and picking them back up. That needs to change. \n\nA quick stack into an open storage (all of same type) is desperately needed. And quick stack to all nearby storage on top of that would be greatly welcomed. \n\nBeing able to type to input the amount to craft also needs to be added. \n\nAnd finally we need to be able to access fuel (for stations that require them) easier. There's literally a radial options menu, add it to that.\n\nThe environments feel very samey. I've been to a few 'major' different versions of the forest biome, and all are very similar aside from a few minor variations in the structures that spawn. I really hope I'm either missing some later game changes, or that way more variance is added as new content down the line. Otherwise Inflexion are definitely falling short of what they intended with the exploration part of the game.\n\nToo early to tell how good/expressive the building system is. It's definitely functional. But unless some fundamentals are changed, then how enjoyable it is, and how unique you can build your structures is going to depend entirely on how many pieces (and variants) are available. It's far more like static building blocks and far less 'physical' and free than say, Sons of the Forest or Valheim (where your only real limit is game physics and your imagination). As previously mentioned. It would also help the feel of the game massively if you could use the radial menu to add materials from nearby storage. And while I'm not expecting the voxel editing of enshrouded, some kind of terrain deformation (or at least letting us remove non-mineable rocks etc.) would benefit the system greatly.\n\nPuck's VA is great. So great that it's jarring that no other named NPCs talk.\n\nGraphics/Visuals are weird. Hopefully they can be addressed in a major way, otherwise it's always going to fail in comparison to everything else in the genre that has recently released. Having foliage react to weather and fixing the many lighting issues will go a long way.\n\nPerformance is also really, shockingly bad. The game is very unoptimised right now. 3rd person inexplicably runs better than first. As soon as a few enemies (but not neutral creatures) spawn nearby it tanks the framerate. If you were to compare Nightingale to Sons of the Forest (even when that first entered Early Access) it's not even close. Nightingale looks worse whilst also running at significantly lower framerates and having a lot more instability and random drops. Inflexion have a long long road of optimisation ahead of them if Nightingale is to succeed. \n\nTLDR; It's good, but not great.

I should noted that I do classify the participants of a game into two categories. Gamers and Players. Gamers are die hard fans of games as a whole and you can see that in how they review and talk about games. Players are enjoyers of games but stand distinctly in the consumer side of it. Gamers crave better worlds, stories, and interesting Mechanics. Players want high fidelity graphics and other superficial elements. Players opinions should be discredited in many regards but we can't because they tend to hold the most monetary power and thus are the reason we get things like Cyberpunk 2077 releasing well before it should. Gamers are willing to wait for a GREAT game, Players will accept an OK game.\n\nOnline Only - This is a big point of contention with Gamers and Players alike. I would be remiss to say that they are wrong. I am not a fan of a single player game having to be online... and for Nightingale I think there should be a STRICTLY offline mode so that those who unlike myself have no plan of playing with friends can do so without being at the whim of servers. That said, having the format they do allows me and my friends to work on the same world without being on a public server, and none of us have to host. This is an issue in games like Valheim, V Rising, Palworld, and others. If the host of the world isn't on, you can't play the game you've been putting time into. Nightingales setup resolves this issue. So while I don't want to see the current state of the game go away, I do think that the Devs need to add in a strictly solo offline mode.\n\nGraphics - I have seen people say the graphics are 'low' or 'ps2' in one review... and this comes from the mentality of the Player. The Graphics (for the most part) are stylized. I personally prefer games that don't go for needless 'hyper realism' cause then every game looks exactly the same I like the wonky long necks/torsos I enjoy the less than real looking models in a stylized and unique style. The game is not low fidelity, it just isn't hyper realistic. There is a DRASTIC difference between those two concepts. The issue I have is with the HUD scale and particle effects. I would LOVE a feature to increase the hud scale, their font is hard to read on my monitor and the feature would be nice. Particle effects are an issue with UE5... UE5 particle systems SUCK... the pricepoint of UE5 and the lack of this feature are baffling to me... so unless you want to do a HUGE overall to the lack luster system Epic shoved into the engine your particles are going to be very bland and boring.\n\nNow that's all I feel comfortable talking about right now... but these are two of the biggest issues I see being talked about so for now that's where I will leave this.", "timestamp_created": 1708472101, "timestamp_updated": 1708472101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514836370944976807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158926212": {"recommendationid": "158926212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123447600", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 390, "last_played": 1708551889}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't make a habit of posting negative reviews and am generally very positive when it comes to game releases - I was a supporter in pre-day one patch players of Cyberpunk, for reference, however this game needed to cook a lot longer than the state it currently is in. \nSome positives of Nightingale are that it has a wonderful creative direction. The surreal environments mixed with a steampunk, fairy-fantasy aesthetic are unique however are cheapened by the computer generated \"realms\" which fall into the normal complaints of said generative worlds - they don't quite feel alive or like there are any secrets around the realms, which is something the energy of midsummer night fairytale type fantasy tends to lend to. It would be forgivable if this was in later realms after obviously the game has it's hooks into you, however the hook in order to get to that point seems to not quite be there yet. It just isn't satisfying. \nNormally within this dilemma, the silver lining is the crafting aspect is satisfying, however I didn't find this. \nThe equipment crafting system is onto something, they have this really unique absolutely dopamine inducing system but at the game's current point it's better on paper than they have put into action. The basic gist of it is the individual crafting items offer different buffs depending on what they are - mind-blowing for the genre - however this mechanic that could put the game on the map is hidden behind clunky and outdated UI that feels like it's stuck in 2014. The items in the chests don't count as craftables and it's menu upon menu with crafting stations that are made redundant with upgrades done to the tables themselves.\n\nI don't know, it's just a bit like they're still building the bones of the game, so I can't even compliment or see where the game will go. There's no good loot, the crafting system isn't satisfying, the combat is okay but not really much to it and the story itself isn't bad but it seems like it's extremely similar to Enshrouded, which felt like an unfortunate game to be launching alongside of. The story and narrative, along with the little bits of lore you find throughout the world are not interesting, clunky and it's like reading a page of a book that is explaining the narrative of the game without eliciting a compulsion or tickling interest to find out more about the universe. I did enjoy the enemy design but wanted to know more about them.\nI loved the setting and creative direction, but that is about it. Maybe it gets better, I am only 6 hours into the game, but as of yet, I have not found a single reason to recommend the game to anyone. For anyone peeking at a crafting fantasy newly released game to buy, pick up Enshrouded and put this on your wishlist for a discount in the future.\n\nI've seen a lot of recommendations for this game to build upon what it has, and here is a penny for my thoughts: Obviously this is your game, but so far most people bought this for the creative direction and crafting, so I think the only way to save this will be to refine your scope. I'd recommend doing something in the earlier game to what they did with Skyrim - they wanted each area to be picturesque and that you would feel enveloped in the beauty of the world around them. Make the world alive. Add more loot, maybe look at Fable about a world bustling with secrets and fairytales. Elden Ring had a little bit of that midsommer night fairytale aesthetic, look at Bioshock 3 for that steampunk aesthetic. Look at your genre and build the bones of what you want to do and what you have seen work, maybe what you liked or maybe you see a pitfall and don't fall into it. \nI'm not telling you to rip these games off, but researching these environments and mechanics may help you make the changes you need to build the bones of this game up. A huge recommendation is to your UI, maybe you need to rethink that and do an overhaul. \n\nRegardless these are my thoughts, if you read this far, thankyou for reading my review and maybe go drink some water or celebrate a birthday you missed whilst I was yapping.

You\u2019re mining for minerals, right? So why does defeating a pixie yield more experience points than unearthing a vein of precious ore?

It\u2019s as if the game\u2019s economy was designed by a sleep-deprived alchemist who accidentally mixed up the recipe.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk minerals.

But it ain't one of the million AAA games shipped recently that flat out don't work and just want to scam a season pass out of you. If you don't want to take part in early access and make the game better, go away, play your imaginary perfect game, and leave feedback to people with an iota of sense.\n\nReview TL;DR: 7/10, with a great deal of potential.\nDevs: please keep this game up - seeing mixed must be crushing but honestly this game is great and I want to see it grow and shine. I love the idea that a single card can represent a total shake up of the biomes and world map, and I think this could be one of the survival greats.\n\n(+) Nightingale, above all, is really pretty. I've only played 2 hours but I want to see more of the world. That's a good start for this kind of game. I don't have a massively beefy computer and it still looks and runs fine.\n\n(-) Always online: that sucks, and I really hope they add an offline mode, BUT I can see why they did it - you want as many people on the servers and online as possible during early access to fill out the world, find the bugs and errors, test the load. I'm playing from the UK via wired internet and haven't noticed a single tick of lag. And I play this with friends so honestly I would have been online anyway.\n\n(+) Crafting is pretty good for the first 2 hours - being able to repair using the generic currency means I can comfortably use my best gear without carrying around 5 rocks, two diamons, a Ford F150 engine and a turtle to get the exact resources I need for a repair. Each tier feels like a noticeable increase in power/efficiency and that's the real hook of games like this for me - especially early doors. Nothing worse than crafting a 2% better pick to get the chance to make it 4% better next level. \n\n(+/-) Item storage and weight: plus and minus because there are some really good ideas in here: weight mattering for your character but not for storage containers is a great idea. I get that I can't carry 500 logs, but being able to sort all my wood into one box without having to worry about reaching the mythical 501st pound and running out of space is nice. Containers have a slot limit which - presumably - will increase as you get better at crafting or make them from rarer materials. Down side to all this is that weight can feel quite restrictive because a lot of the crafting requires maybe 1/5th your inventory to do so you end up running back and forth a LOT. You also don't really know what materials you need until after you need them, which makes gathering a bit hit and miss. \n\nNice to have update: auto-transfer contents of boxes to nearby crafting tables: absolutely amazing QoL improvement. Hope this comes soon (maybe it's already there for higher tier containers, I dunno)\n\nNice to have update 2: make it so auto-fill can't use certain rarity of items or \"flag for non-crafting\" - I very nearly broke down some good quality hides while trying to use my tier one prey hides to make straps. Not game breaking but just a risk that could be super frustrating down the line.\n\n(+/-) Combat: combat is fine, but could do with better AI. It's not particularly challenging early on (maybe it changes later but the AI formula seems fairly basic at this time) and it seems quite open to cheesing (a few friends with knives could probably run rings around most enemies). Again, it's early access and it's far from BAD, just overly simplistic (enemies run towards you, do attack, rinse, repeat). They'll also do pretty dumb stuff like if a lower tier creature is fleeing a predator, it will 100% run into a fire and cook itself if that fire is in the straight line path away from the enemy. Again, I've only played 2 hours so maybe some of the boss monsters and biggest threats have a more nuanced game plan - if so, and the basic enemies being basic is deliberate, that's kinda cool. We'll see.\n\n(+) Character customisation: Love it. My guy looks like a manic depressive bulldog inexplicably got promoted to Sergeant Major of Her Majesty's Armed Forces. 100% would make a melty toff again.\n\n(+) Eating animations: Your character is part snake. All food is inserted whole into the mouth in a single smooth pushing motion. This is invariably hilarious. 0/10 gag reflex.\n\n(+/-) Tutorial: the tutorial is great for teasing a story and giving the VERY basics, but it is missing a few key points: how do I repair a built structure, what are the \"basic\" building materials I should be aware of when planning a base, foraging for and cooking vegetables is super important to avoid starvation, why my health is set at 5 when I am starving. These things are loosely touched on but inclusion in the narrative would be great. ALSO, I really hope there's a skip option added - it's fine once (interesting even), but if I make a second character because I decide my moustache isn't bushy enough, I don't really want to spend 90 minutes faffing before I can join another realm.", "timestamp_created": 1708522437, "timestamp_updated": 1708522437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514697074890136719", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158851084": {"recommendationid": "158851084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106555624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 367, "last_played": 1708564939}, "language": "english", "review": "Was working well for the first few hours, but now I crash every 10 minutes or so (ironically when I was really starting to explore the game) Lots of promise here, but the online-only aspect of the game is really ruining the experience right now.

It has some good ideas. It also, needs more time in the oven to sort itself out. The bigger issue is the game doesn't communicate much of one thing and too much of another. Is it worth the jump into an Early Access at this price point? Debatable. IMO? Best wait for a 1.0 on this one.\n\nAlmost 10 hours into the game and I'm not exactly getting the No Mans Sky infinite width and a foot of depth vibe. Nor am I getting the warm and fuzzy Palworld vibe. There's enough depth and similarity to Enshrouded to keep me interested. It's clear to me that the game wants us to spend time with it. I'm all for that, but is it worth it? Maybe. So, for now, my curiosity is tentatively peaked. If not for the visual art style of marketing. So far I've yet to see any Carnival Row outside the character creator.\n\nIt has enough variation in the \"Realms\" That I can find some uniqueness to each Biome. The card system sees to that. I really like this system, it has potential to define something new in an otherwise saturated Open-world Survival Crafting market. There are aspects of the building system I like. There are others that I find other games do better. The same can be said about every other aspect of this game! \n\nEach new realm has to be treated like an expedition. Rather than a new place to put down roots. The game doesn't tell you this, but its something you should know. This makes \"tech\" advancement and inventory management a pain. I either go back to my home realm when I or my back pack have had enough. Or spend hours collecting/gathering to make a one time use outpost. The dev's really need to find a happy median here. Otherwise it has the potential to be a detriment to its success with the player base.\n\nCombat is lackluster and doesn't exactly inspire confidence. It really is Skyrim, but dumber and less exciting. The only reason combat is any challenge is enemies come at the player in mobs. One other thing that comes in droves at the player in Nightingale is numbers.\n\nThere are a lot of numbers in this game... If you're familiar with Cold Take's video \"Fatigued by the Numbers\" you'll know what I mean. My impression is the developers want to make a game with lots of numbers in it. I have to say, early on only Gear Score matters. You need a higher gear score to get through barriers. How much? It doesn't tell you. Frankly, why should it? The quest progression drives everything in Nightingale. \n\nThe player really only needs to follow the quest line. Everything else is a distraction. Getting hung up on exploration is more of a detriment to the player's advancement than anything. Something else they don't tell you. Which seems kind of odd, since it is open-world. If there is an open world I want to go explore it. Unlike other open-world games there is something to be gained from exploration. Always something to find over the next hill. Here there's nothing but raw resources to reward the player. Character's don't level up. Character's don't have skill advancement. (That isn't a complaint/Complement by the way, just fact) Combat is just a means to resources. Spending time to fight everything is wasted effort, unless you need the resources or objective behind it. The realms only exists to be exploited. Put on your capitalism Top-hats, bois! Tally-ho!\n\nSo where was I? Numbers... If they don't mean anything early on, why have detailed numbers at all? Why should I care about how much of a health bonus Tier 1 Bones give? In the end game, if there is one. Sure! I can see why it would matter to the kind of player who wants to min-max their character for the best outcome. However, early on it feels like being on the receiving end of a fire hose of useless information. I mean come on... everything down to the rocks has stats. \n\nAll-in-all If I had any sense i'd just delete the game now and wait for this game to cook a bit longer in the Oven.

There are far too few variants in the basic gameplay loop and far, far too many fiddly bits in the crafting and inventory management.\n\nThere are six primary materials (stone, ore, wood, fiber, hide, meat), three variants of each material per tier--discounting legendary variants--and processed versions of all those materials. There are five tiers. This results in hundreds of different primary components to juggle. Each takes up an extremely limited inventory slot, crafting requires that you have them in your inventory, and crafting itself is a player stall with completely unnecessary wait time for each step of the assembly process. If you have an ideal workstation and all the necessary materials, it will take several minutes to create a new gun, as you create ingots to make a shaft to make a barrel, lumber to make a stock, assemble that with all the other secondary components, then add infusions, add charms, and create ammo for it. Doing it right takes careful attention to material bonuses, on top of far too much patience. The game designer's love for unnecessary hurdles and details is psychopathic if not actively misanthropic in its attempts to waste the time of players.\n\nIn comparison, there are only six things to do on a map (help build, help defend, agility shrines, insight shrines, intelligence shrines, beat up monsters), with an optional tower and an optional dungeon that strings three of those things together. Aside from an extremely sparse number of quests, that's the grind. You repeat those six activities indefinitely for the resources necessary to spend hours managing inventory and making equipment back at your base.\n\nThe combat is simplistic and unrewarding. The game has a single martial melee weapon--the maul--and that's honestly already one too many, as you have limited space on your one and only hotbar, with far too many other tools to make room for a dedicated weapon. Seriously, they make you open inventory and juggle items in and out of your backpack just to harvest resources and navigate the world (Five slots for: Pick, Axe, Knife, Scythe, Gun, Maul, and the hated Climbing Picks, the worst navigation aid in any game I've ever played. Those not equipped in your five hotbar slots will be dropped upon death, so here's hoping you don't die on top of a mountain with your Climbing Picks in your pack.)\n\nBuilding in other games, such as Valheim and Enshrouded, is a genuine delight that justifies the grind. The thought of putting together a base in Early Access Nightingale fills me with dread. I already have enough problems managing seven trunks worth of trash, I don't need to go harvest a ton of stone and lumber to make something nice on top of all of that.\n\nI've played video games for thirty years, and never before has a game demanded that I learn and juggle so many fiddly bits for the sake of mastering such sparse and uninspired gameplay.

(8.6\\10) \n\nTo start let's talk about the only negative I really have.  This game has a tendency to become confusing. After the tutorial your kinda pushed off on your own with a goal. The goals are labeled clearly on the right side of the HUD, but some of them require multipart steps to complete. I had found myself a few times creating or doing the wrong thing to achieve the goal. But that's truly the only bad part of this game, and with it being in early access and open beta, not much to complain about. \n\nNow for the good, to start this game is what survival-crafting SHOULD BE! It blows games like Raft, The Forest and other open survivals I have played. The way you can control the environment, build and upgrade is amazing and shows clear thought. Secondly, the idea of this game is amazing, from the art style of the Fey to the sketches you get of \"other worlds\" is stunning. The idea of being lost in a 'madness' of fey realms and other dimensions was beautiful, and the ability to travel them felt unique and easy to achieve. (Don't worry it makes you work for it, but in a fun and earning way) The creature\\hostile mob creation reminds me of a Souls like style, you have to take a moment to think before you act in fast manners. Take your time exploring and seeing the world, this is not a blow through game. Lastly is the beauty of it, I don't run the most specked PC, and I can run this fine with stunning graphics. It does have that classic indi\\rust like character look but to me that's part of the joy of this game. \n\nNightingale is a 8.6\\10, It has made it's way into my heart and my personal top 10 list! I would highly recommend this game to others (and I have, and they have proceeded to love it). I have been following this game since its announcement on TikTok and other platforms! \n\nIf you have questions that other reviews don't answer leave them here, I'll answer them all.

HUD disappearing after a while making any interactions impossible, not good. Menu not displaying tooltips at all, or your codex not being clickable but also uses tooltip to display. I am not running some kind of beast computer but it is more than good enough to play this, or even ICARUS on max (without Ray tracing). But in this game I am getting shoddy textures and framerate drops even on medium settings, with DLSS on for good messure. \nBut look. The idea of the game so far is good, but has a long way to go in my oppinion. There is alot of work to be done and it should not have come out yet. The online only is a big no fucking thanks in my book since online only locks you out as soon as there is an issue server side. Give us normal local play like any other survival game so we can do what we always do without the headaches of stupid servers. \nI regret having bought it on launch day after following it for so long only to get this. \nMy recommendation is to not buying this game. Wait at least 6 months, or until someone you know that has it, or maybe some streamer tells you that it is \"good now\".\n\nEdit: So after being able to spend a bit more time with the game and actualy seeing some more of the content, I wanted to update the review a bit.\n\nPositive: The realms look very beautiful and lush. There are several \"events\" that you have to do to boost your essence income (just harvesting is too slow). There are even a few \"dungeons\" to do for items. Some of these will be items that boost your crafting tables, like in Valheim. For those of you that don't know, you build a item to place close to a specific table to boost it, in this case it lowers crafting times or adds new recipies. \n\nNegatives: It is slow. Everything that happens feels slow. Except the most basic crafting, everything feels slower than neccesary. But this is due to the mechanics they use, but if you are like me and are a bit slower with pushing \"Main\" quest lines, it will be a while to get the faster crafting. I put this in negative because there are people that dont have 15h a day to spend with this.\nNow this is a small one, opening realms. This is super slow for some reason, I would not be able to tell you. \nThe online only makes loading realms so slow it kills so much of it.

I will include my thoughts as both negative and positives, but I am going to start with the negatives.\n\n-The crafting system is EXTREMELY convoluted, meaning you will be spending most of your time looking through menus, and crafting single items at a time because you cannot que more than 1 item type at once. This breaks immersion and turns the game into an inventory management system that requires you to craft items at 6 different tables just to be able to progress one step of the tutorial questline, which no clear indication of how. \n\n-The AI pathing is absolute trash at this stage of the game. My follower CONSTANTLY teleports through walls, walks away from combat mid fight, and picks fights I was trying to avoid. The enemy AI is just as bad. Get ready to be cheesy and glitch them into corners and pillars just so you can actually hit them properly.\n\n-Stamina / Hunger / Status Effects in the early game are very punishing, and dont have very clear indicators. Small icons on the bottom of the screen that tell you nothing, until you open the inventory and hover over them.\n\n-The worlds are very pretty, but they are also very empty. The treasure boxes you pick up are underwhelming at best, and don't often reward anything other than potions and new realm cards.\n\n-The inventory system is flawed in the sense that multiple items of basic grade ie; fiber, ore, twigs etc, don't stack ontop of each other if they are picked up in different realms or from different sources. This creeates unneccesary clutter in the inventory as multiple slots are taken up by the same item.\n\n-Companions do not have an encumberance system, but the player does. While I can appreciate this as my follower is going to be my mule anyways, it appears unbalanced since they can carry 500lbs of rocks and sprint, while I recieve nerfed movement speed with less than 1lb over my capacity.\n\n-Too many crafting stations to make the same type of object. I need to have a tannery AND a sewing wheel AND a sewing bench, all three of those tables need a minimum of 2 different items to make ONE piece of armor, you will repeat that process multiple times to create your first gear set.\n\n-The tutorial tells you nothing but the objective. Any further information is buried in the journal tab, which creates even more menu time.\n\nThat should pretty much cover the first glaring issues I have encountered, now lets get into the good stuff.\n\n- Holy shit do these worlds ever look pretty. And I mean 'wow thats gorgeus' type of pretty. Amazing scenery, textures and landscapes.\n\n-The Audio is phenomenal. Music, ambient sounds and voice acting are really on point, and comparable to finished AAA titles.\n\n-The storyline, although it does not enthrall the player right away, looks extremely promising.\n\nTL;DR- Huge potential to be an award winning game once finished, but alot of glaring issues the reflect poorly on the product.

We have seen couple of great EA, and this is definitelly not one of them.\n\nMany thing has been said here, so just in nutshell:\n\n+ very good and original art and graphics\n+ interesting card system (still very limited, but that I can accept in EA)\n+ Pucks voiceover\n- Game doesnt deliver trailer promises\n- lacks of fun, quests all the same, seems very repetitive and empty\n- NPC and enemy AI \n- movement of all living is a joke \n- overal handling far from polished\n- apart from card system nothing really original\n- lot of soft bugs, lack of detailed animation (again acceptable)\n\nVerdict: This game was not ready for early access and is a disapointment at the moment. It was suppose to be a original one, but simply it is not, we have seen most of it already only in different coat.. I am looking forward to see it develop further and rooting for it. \n\nI will play couple of more hours to prove myself wrong, but I am sceptical big time.

For $30 you are losing out big time by not giving this game a chance.  \n\nI don't like crafting usually.  However,  the amount of options you get when crafting items makes it really fun.  Yes,  The higher tier gear requires more individual parts.  But this is where it gets cool.  The different materials in Nightingale impart different stat modifiers.   So each individual part you make you can drastically change the outcome of the item.   Make it from crap picked up in a tier 1 realm item or farm bosses and make the item from those components.  \n\nThe build system works well.  Its pretty straight forward.   The models and tile sets available fit really well and look nice.  You can even combine different tile sets to come up with something really organic looking.  \n\nMultiplayer,   You owe it to yourself to at least complete the main quest line.   Not only is it a really good quest line.  But it opens up something I have never seen in a Survival Game before.  And that is a central multiplayer hub with multiplayer world dungeons.   No queing.  You just run in and start working on the puzzles with the other players in the area.   Or just killing things.

So sadly, I also have to downvote it to keep you from buying in at this moment, at the beginning of Early Access.\n\nThis game fell for what I'd like to call the \"the New World\" trap of game designing: Technically, there is a good looking game, you can do things in it like gathering, crafting, running around (lots of it)... but there is no substantial gameplay behind everything. It's only a grind to: Unlock the next gear type, unlock the next card type, unlock the next dungeon - all with ascending rarity rating (aka a different color and higher stats).\n\nBy itself, being grindy and gear/base upgrade simulator isn't a bad thing per se, but Nightingale also pairs it with other less than optimal features: There are no rewards for doing what you're doing, no satisfaction of having overcome something, no loot that makes you experience lucky moments - it's just moving from gear tier to gear tier. From one Essence drop location to the next. From (blueprint) vendor to vendor. And you got only one direction to go, there are no alternate solutions to things, you can not accidentally get lost in a high level zone, the primary enemy group is always the same... each Realm and the locations in it are very limited in size, you soon have seen everything already, and then it's just you on repeat.\n\nOn the technical side, everything runs perfectly for me. But for my friend, who I wanted to coop with, the game won't even load into the world. Seems there also is work to be done here.\n\nCould Nightingale potentially become a really good survival game with one, two, three years more work put into it? Yeah, absolutely.

The core feature of the self-contained portal worlds are definitely a plus over a lot of other survival games in my opinion and you're probably not going to see anything anywhere near this fantasy setting for this kind of game elsewhere AFAIK.\n\nThat said, I'm mixed about a few things. The entire game infrastructure depending on their servers is definitely a minus, one which they are trying to justify as \"allowing you and your friends to be able to play on the same world together even if one of you isn't around to play\": I get where they're coming from and I appreciate the thought a lot, but I'm not sure I like that kind of sacrifice in the first place. Inventory cluttering is a real thing (especially since not everything has unique icons and some are still placeholders) and I imagine it might get worse at some point when you have a lot of in-practice redundant materials with different allocation of stats from final crafted items... Also, would be nice if the red-barrier'ed points of interest actually showed at what minimum equipment level you must be and what level the enemies inside are instead of playing \"will it shove me 10 feet away or let me through\" while you don't know.\n\nAs others pointed out, the UI is kind of a weak point. I'm also very much looking forward to the modifiers being usable for keybinds (ie, SHIFT + 3) to switch the off-hand equipment more effectively. There are definitely problems with the visual interface in menus though.\n\nPure negatives? So far, hard to point towards something specific, but I'd say that the climbing picks either require too much stamina to be used for climbing anything worthwhile and at the same time they won't register in some rocky locations where you could potentially get a use of them for the short height you'd be able to climb. Maybe when I get access to better picks and longer stamina bar it'll click, but absolutely not yet for me.\n\nGoing to leave a thumbs up at this stage and continue playing for some more dozen of hours, then I'll wait for significant updates down the road and check if progress will have been made.", "timestamp_created": 1708535487, "timestamp_updated": 1708535487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512711822986602783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158841801": {"recommendationid": "158841801", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987192446", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 5247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_at_review": 4934, "last_played": 1712812030}, "language": "english", "review": "Great so far, exactly what was advertised and then some, and rarely have I ever enjoyed my time with a survival crafting game as much as with Nightingale.

So relaxing, rewarding, and fun. I can't wait to see where this game goes!\n\nUpdate: After 80 hours or so, this is easily one of my favorite survival games ever.

It's already an incredibly well-oiled experience, and the lore and clear dedication and quality of the dev team has proven this will be an incredible game when it is fully complete.

Co-op being able to hang in a friends realm and go back to your own seamlessly leaves a lot of room for future online content. Seems a bit MMO in that respect where your progression is tied only to your character, not the realms you are on. Future solo mode will also please those ppl who are very worried about online play.\n\nBuilding is standard snapping style and isn't too grindy, with AOE pickup and easy access to common materials.\n\nCrafting is deep, almost too deep with the attribute modifier system from ingredients and then augmentations (whole nother thing), but if you are a perfectionist trying to craft perfect stats, it will scratch that itch. If you aren't, just craft with whatever types you want, you just won't be mix-maxed.\n\nCombat is satisfying enough with some dmg types and resistances. I am just getting deeper into enchantments and double infusions 50 hours in. The combat itself could use some work, maybe some cleaving or aoe abilities. When 10 bound spawn, it's tedious swinging and just hitting one at a time and kiting around for a while. Ranged weapons feel good though and balanced with reloads.\n\nMany people leaving negative reviews have under 10 hours and hardly got past the first site of power - so take their reviews with a grain of salt. The game throws a lot on you early, but really opens up later on once you understand the flow of the portal system. It does have some road bumps with the progression, quests, and feeling lost, but just explore and there is plenty to do along the way on the realms. As patches come out, the progression system will undoubtedly be improved.\n\nOverall, solid game right now regardless of EA and some obvious placeholders atm.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1708948514, "timestamp_updated": 1708948514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512635409832000732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159007950": {"recommendationid": "159007950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060749498", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1270, "last_played": 1709842663}, "language": "english", "review": "I rate this 8/10 so far.\n\nThis game I will have to say its fun both playing alone and with friends. The game is designed to explore and have a small base of operations. If you think you need a massive base and hate the limit cap of the building size 300 parts then go play something like ARK. This game is intended to explore, craft your gear, go out and explore more. There are quests to complete, bosses to kill, RNG biomes that generate each time you drop cards into the portal. \n\nIts drop in/Drop out Co op. Plus if you log out and your friends want to keep playing and progressing it wont kick them out. Think of it this way. Its a Private server you DONT have to pay for. People fail to understand this apparently. I get playing solo having to hook up online sucks but if you think about it. This allows to also set a portal you RNG to PUBLIC and meet up possibly with other players in the game to MAKE possible new friends to have more fun.\n\nSo many people say this game is \"Bad\" to be honest I don't see why. Most people say they dislike steampunk theme but I find it enjouable. A game doesn't need to  be flash or have crisp visuals to be fun and enjoyable. Plus it does not need to be massively innovative or stand out from other games for it to be \"Good\" Yes there are other games out there that may or can be better. Overall this game I have enjoyed. Only a few gripes but that is every game.\n\nEveryone has their own opinion. \"Opinions are like arseholes everyone has them and they all stink\"\n\nSupports 6 player co op and it runs well (At least for me). Most people that say it runs like junk are probably people with ancient PCs that didn't follow the recommended specs. (MINIMUM is meant to run the game and play it on lowest settings you dolts)\n\nFor those who care these are my specs and the game runs just fine with a few performance tweaks:\n\nRTX 3060 12gb\ni7-10700k\n32gb DDR4 2123 mhz (Ram rated for 3200mhz but I have a old Mobo)\n980 Pro SSD\nEthernet cord internet connection with 1gb speed.", "timestamp_created": 1708640028, "timestamp_updated": 1708640028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512635409832000732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158928746": {"recommendationid": "158928746", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996446476", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1708929655}, "language": "english", "review": "Lands somewhere between Valheim (best) and Enshrouded (meh). Combat is its weakest point with AI not being great and animations being kinda whack. \n\nLore/world design is pretty good and has just enough flavor to be interesting but not overwhelm you like some clockwork/steampunk games. You see hints of it around but they don't slam airships into your face (at least initially) saying \"VICTORIAN ENGLAND EH MATE?\" \n\nThe graphics are pretty good but not earth shattering, they have to be kinda malleable since a lot of your actions change the world (realm) around you so it kinda makes sense. It almost feels like Spore or No Man's Sky when it comes to the fauna/flora. Its a little offputting at first seeing a neon pink and green deer, but hey it works. \n\nThe core gameplay loop takes a bit to get started and it can be a bit rough figuring out what exactly you're doing and how to make it most effective. I see a lot of people yelling about always online, but if you squint you can kinda see why. This game is basically no man's sky, victorian edition. \n\nIn a perfect world, you link realms with a friend, go off to explore new ones and hop back to your respective places to stash things. The servers are a little slow so you get some kinda gnarly load times hopping back and forth so its not as smooth as it probably should be. (A simple out of the box fix would be some kinda storage that teleports your gains back home...or something like that). \n\nThe social stuff is a little glitchy and sometimes you'll join a party member, sometimes not. There's some missing features that make it kinda feel half baked. \n\nOverall, it probably needed another 6 months in the oven, but its still fun to play if you enjoy pseudo survivals. You don't need to worry about hosting a server for your pals (just unlock the realm share card) and even solo it can be a fun exploration simulator in that same vein as NMS. If you didn't like NMS at all, and you're burnt out on early access survival games then move along.\n", "timestamp_created": 1708557177, "timestamp_updated": 1708557177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512635409832000732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158898655": {"recommendationid": "158898655", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990863623", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 546, "last_played": 1708925400}, "language": "english", "review": "No Idea how this has worse rating than enshrouded, as it started of way better when looking at the simple blueprints it can draw from.

Most of what they promised from the get-go worked! Of course, there have been a few bugs. But they have been quick about fixing them!

I asked for a refund on this game, and would recommend against buying it for players with similar interests.\n\nThe TLDR: this game almost has some innovative systems, but doesn't commit to them, dumbing them down to the lowest common denominator. It also seems to lean into frustrating trends like relying on grind instead of content. As a result, it feels stale (already).\n\nIf you love this particular gas-punk reskin of this sort of game, Nightingale might be for you. If you love the grinding experience of diving into a (fairly bland) new survival crafting game and just need a new fix, this game might also be for you.\n\nIf you've been playing survival crafting games and are looking for something innovative or thoughtful, you're probably not going to find this game very satisfying. There are a couple new ideas here: some variety in crafting and the system of realm-hopping as a part of the gameplay loop. However, these ideas are minimized by dumbing them down, instead of emphasizing them to make a game with soul. At the same time, the game leans into grindy content for building or crafting--or spam clicking eating consumables every few minutes--as if THOSE are the fun parts of the game, rather than things players do in order to GET TO the fun parts of the game.\n\nThis feels like a game where someone had some interesting new ideas for the genre, but then those were stifled by a manager who wanted the gameplay to be more typical. When I see a developer shying away from what makes a game fun/interesting, and focusing on making it more average, I'm not hopeful for the trajectory of this early access project.\n\nI'll keep an eye on this game, but at this point I'm more interested in spending my entertainment money on someone who's going to do something new and interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1708552721, "timestamp_updated": 1708552721, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511447668075561523", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158993946": {"recommendationid": "158993946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034178645", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 677, "last_played": 1710423099}, "language": "english", "review": "playing the game solo an have played for 11 hours of it an been enjoying it. can't wait to get my friends to start playing with me.", "timestamp_created": 1708627339, "timestamp_updated": 1708627339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511363625526428223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159386936": {"recommendationid": "159386936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009598634", "num_games_owned": 485, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4552, "last_played": 1709924786}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]I LOVE this game[/b], but there are a lot of issues that are not typically seen with early access titles. To the extent that I would call it mistakes of developers who are new to the genre.\n\n[b]I am not even remotely done playing this game. I would continue to play the game in the current state.[/b] I\u2019d be overjoyed to see some much needed changes.\n\nThe game has high negative reviews because [b]people hate always online games[/b]. [b]Especially in the survival genre[/b]. I am immensely lucky that it\u2019s not an issue for me, but I entirely understand the outrage. I'm against online only games because the game will get review bombed for it and I want the game to do well.\n\n[b]No successful survival game is online only[/b]. The ones that are fail. (Such as [i]Last Oasis[/i] \u2013 what an awesome game, such a pity \u2026 and [i]Mortal Online 2[/i]). Online only is so hated in the genre that [b]not knowing that[/b] is a failure of the developer. [b]Market research needed to be done[/b].\n\nSurvival is my genre. I play literally every multiplayer (and some single player) survival game I find. So I have a far different perspective than most who would review this game on steam.\n\n[h2]PROS[/h2]\n- Unique explorations system unseen in any survival game. With modifiers (cards) you craft that you can choose to add to exploration worlds, which no survival game has done before.\n- Fantastic and challenging combat system with numerous ways to customise your experience; without being over complicated or confusing. Simple yet full of skill expression and customisation.\n- Unique cross genre end game that's never been done in any survival game of this type. At first it confused me as to why it was there. But I played it for hours on end without realising. The end game is surprising and enjoyably repetitive.\n- Numerous surprises throughout play that has shocked even me (that almost never happens).\n- Crafting is fun and interesting ... although confusing and requires [b]any[/b] guidance, developers, please help. (See cons).\n- Auto loot by holding E is pure happiness. Thanks [i]Rift[/i] for making games feel like we need auto loot.\n- The survivors (followers) system are a fantastic addition to make the world feel less empty.\n- No loading screens once in realms.\n\n[b]FEEL[/b]\n- The aesthetic is perfect steampunk, fae, and demonic creatures. If you pitched that to me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine it. In game, it\u2019s a flawless, attention to detail and incredible combination. Art team is genuinely skilled and has a crystal-clear vision.\n- Ideal graphic quality for the genre. Outstandingly beautiful and overly creepy (in the best way).\n- Music is perfect.\n- Sound is ideal. A lot of gamers don\u2019t realise the power of great game sounds. I don\u2019t only focus critical hits because it\u2019s good damage, but the (non ear hurting) glass shattering sound is so intensely satisfying.\n- Lighting is fantastic. Day is super pretty and night is chilling. Ideal for a game in this genre but even more so since Nightingale doesn\u2019t shy from the creepy aesthetic and themes. I [b]love[/b] developers who aren't afraid to commit to the horror element of the genre.\n\n[h2]CONS[/h2]\n- [b]The UI[/b]. The UI is suffering. Why, just why is it like this? No button for take all (at least that I see in options)? No button for moving an item from one inventory to another (at least that I see in options)??\n- [b]Storage hell[/b]. Numerous items without images making the worst part of survival games even less fun (which is pretty incredible). The game doesn't even have a \"stack with similar items\" in chests type option.\n- Crafting from chests is the new standard. It was only mods before, but since [i]Palworld[/i], crafting from chests is one of the top expectations. Even recently released [i]Enshrouded[/i] saw how wanted this was and integrated this (poorly) into their game.\n- Item quality. I\u2019ve never seen this done well and this game it\u2019s even more confusing than [i]Last Oasis[/i] and [i]Atlas[/i] combined. There are numerous items of better grades without clarity on item quality. Some items have no number for their quality, and the ones that do, are less and more than those without a number.\n- Crafting can be a nightmare. Outcome is entirely trial and error. You have to gather numerous different sets of items and compare the outcome to see the level and which stats from the items actually apply. It's worse that you sometimes have to craft 3 items from one to even start to compare stats for specific items.\n- Building and crafting item priority absent. If you\u2019re trying to build multiple things and you have all the materials, a project can take far higher components than needed making you unable to complete another project.\n- You can only build in three of the numerous exciting worlds you can find, and they are the least inspired worlds.\n- The survivors (followers) system. When I am encumbered, they walk away from me making me slow walk to them. They can disappear at will, along with their inventory full of items. I lost my NPC on a server disconnect (not on my end). They keep putting high quality burnable items in fires and there is no way to stop them, except not giving them these heavy items.\n\n[b]STABILITY[/b]\n- Because it's online only, crashes and disconnects revert progress.\n- Servers (EU) are not entirely stable. I have been disconnected randomly while talking to friends in discord. When this happens. Thankfully these are not as common now.\n- Loading times are suffering level. Disconnections in transitions are for me, around 1 in 6. It puts you back to where you started loading, making you start the overly long loading process all over again.\n- You can get disconnected for inactivity while standing in your own base. Such as: waiting for things to craft while being at your PC, watching a video. WTF game? I'm at my own base.\n\n[b]PROGRESSION[/b]\n- Progression isn\u2019t clear. It\u2019s not [i]Enshrouded[/i] bad, but it\u2019s lacking in understanding direction. Especially as to which is the main quest.\n- The quest system need attention (I don\u2019t even want to ask for love, please developers, play the game). Some quests are truly awful and made me want to stop playing. I spent hours looking for an enemy you can only find by walking on it. No alternative. It\u2019s a main quest.\n- Magic is progression gated too late in the game. It's the best thing about the combat system and you don't know about it until later.\n- [b]PRO:[/b] Unlocking a new table is as exciting as finding a new item in [i]Terrerria[/i]. For those who didn\u2019t play Terrerria, that model inspired one of the most popular games in the genre: [i]Valheim[/i].\n\n[h2]OVERALL[/h2]\nThe game needs work. But we know that, it's early access.\n\nIt feels like it was made by developers who dreamed of making an MMO but didn\u2019t have the capital, the people, or skill. That likely sounds like a scathing insult. It's not. Because what they did with those dreams is create something better. Something genuinely unique and re-playable.\n\nThe developers took risks, that is the basis for all exceptional games. Not all of their risks worked out. The ones that did made this a wholly unique experience that you can't enjoy in any other game. At this point, it is especially exceptional for the genre.\n\n[b]Despite its numerous shortfalls, I absolutely love this game! As I said at the start, I will continue to play it even in this state.[/b] But as I also said, this is my genre.\n\nNightingale is [b]the most[/b] (recent) original title in the survival genre. Anyone who loves survival games should give this game at least (an estimated) 30 hours. [b]I am certain that it will surprise you as to what's waiting for you beyond the main quest line.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1709035299, "timestamp_updated": 1709130272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511278212070465088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159383589": {"recommendationid": "159383589", "author": {"steamid": "76561199103216185", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 915, "last_played": 1709018715}, "language": "english", "review": "Full disclosure, the concept of this game is great, the execution and advertisement of this game are poor.

You are forced to think about the very PLACEMENT of your multiple crafting benches, and then their augment benches WHICH YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU NEED.  \n          The building system is basic and fluid but none of the trailer examples are even feasible for hundreds of game play hours, and not knowing the building can actually interfere with the crafting system forces you to backtrack hours of planning and building. \n           To craft 1 thing you will need multiple materials, that must be on your person, base inventory does not tie into crafting. In addition to multiple materials, you will utilize multiple benches to create parts and then back and forth you go in order to create 1 item that can take hours sourcing and crafting time. by the time you get everything along with 10k things you dont need, cant use yet  or cant carry, you need to craft 5 other things. \n             Leveling system is vague and irritating.

The idea of using different types of materials for different stats in crafting is interesting, but it results in a storage and organizational nightmare, especially since you can't craft from storage or quick sort things into chests.\n- Most of the gameplay consists of wandering around looking for these little activities that are almost identical each time. It's either kill something, jump to something, or press buttons in a certain order. There isn't even visual variety to these.\n- Building is horrible.

It's a EA title! which is what i signed up for and so did everyone else who purchased this title. Keep in mind of that, remember they are going to be adding much more when possible, until then they are slamming bugs and much needed updates. Their discord is great. If you are wondering if you should purchase, I say yes. BUT, there is a learning curve, it can be over whelming for some. Take your time, look up info, ask around in their Discord as well as the discussion section on Steam. For me it's not just the game that matters, but WHO I paid it to.. Who am i throwing my money at? I looked over the devs just as much as their main title Nightingale, I'm not disappointed. I felt fine with helping them grow the game and being a part of it. Streaming on the very first day, the birth of Nightingale to the world and will continue as it matures over time. Definitely NOT over night, Early Access means more is to come, the vision the devs have has not been accomplished yet, Nightingale is a new born on Steam and not just the devs but also US can help forge it. 7 DTD is STILL on Early Access and i love it!

I'm giving a positive review but only because I'd hate to see development stop, but this game..... It needs probably another year in the oven. There are plenty of things to complain about that just... don't really make sense or is completely unfinished. EVERY SINGLE THING shown in the trailer is VERY LATE GAME. We haven't seen ANY magic, only one gun, and one boss.\n\n-Sleeping. What is the point? There is no animation for it, 'short resting' is just another bar you need to keep full and it seems so redundant, you just go to base, press E a couple times on your bed, and leave again. It doesn't buff you, it doesn't debuff you. Why even have it in the game? You might as well just tell players you encourage them to return to base sometimes, it seems absolutely pointless. Long resting is only used to skip the night and even that has no animation, just black screen then comes back. Also, night time just switches to night time in such a sudden way it seems like your game crashed to a black screen, then fades to the correct shading. Its crazy. So many simple things that just seem completely overlooked in favor of an early release.\n\n-Crafting. It is so... Convoluted. There are so many 'augment' benches which are just... it seems supposed to be decorative benches? But they also help reduce crafting times? I'm really not even sure still. It almost doesn't explain it at all, but there are more augments than there are crafting benches it seems, and some benches use more than one, some benches only use one, so you'll end up making a few of the same augments just because the range on the benches isn't very far. Also, it's almost impossible to know which bench affects which. You have to do such a waste-of-time image comparing to see which workbench is \"tools\" and which is \"hunting\". Which one is \"blacksmith\" and which one is \"tailor\". Some benches have 'fishing' augment, and some augments give fishing, but for some reason they don't affect each other. You also have to essentially keep moving and placing down the augment to see which bench it affects, because the green lines while placing it (to show what it affects) just seems to lead to every bench or no benches. It points to warmth, lighting, and benches it affects so there are just green lines everywhere and you have no idea at a glance what it's affecting. It's insane. Also you can stack benches or chests, but they don't mention you can't move ANYTHING you stack unless you move the last item you placed first. It's almost like a manual undo button, it's crazy. My friends and I were confused why we couldn't move a row of chests, and it's just because the last one placed needed to be moved first, then in reverse order. So ridiculous. The augments are also supposed to \"Unlock blueprints\", but they just do not. My group of friends have seemed to never unlock a blueprint to craft through placing an augment, we have only been able to unlock new buildings or benches by buying them or completing world objectives to earn them. The augments seriously seem so pointless, but they do reduce crafting time.\n\n-The icons. Seriously? There are SO many icons that are just missing. Just a red N stamp. Not even a very basic icon for COAL or for CHITIN, even though they have good in game looks. It's so hard to try and differentiate items because they're just all a red stamped N. So lazy.\n\n-The questing. The questing is also generally confusing. It starts out ok yknow harvest that, build this, traverse a different realm. But it seems like they wanted to encourage you to be traveling really consistently in order to unlock different realms/tiers of weapons, but also hold you back from doing so? But also you somehow end up way ahead of the objectives? I'm truly just confused a lot of the time on why I'm progressing and where I need to go. My group played for 20 hours+ before we were able to make guns because we just... Somehow fell behind the quests while staying ahead of the curve? It's a really strange thing to explain but it isn't done very well.\n\n-The building. The building is just... bad. It's extremely basic, even though the buildings themselves can look really nice. it just always ends up being just a square room that you feel forced to build because of the amount of augments you're encouraged to build. I'm not even sure if I need all the augments, seriously. I don't know the difference or what they do because they definitely do not unlock recipes.\n\n-The enemies. There are probably like... five variants of enemies? Each realm has some cool looking wildlife that can definitely change, but the main enemies are always the same select few and it just gets old and repetitive. \n\n-Unbalanced economy. Feels like they didn't test the economy at all, at least for basic T1 essence. You can buy a water bottle for 10 essence, and then deconstruct it into 200. What??? Why???? From there on out you can just buy all the materials you need. It's crazy, and this is basically right off the rip. The next tier of essence just seems so annoying to grind because you're just doing the same world objectives for different rewards that do the same exact thing. You make slightly different looking but oddly scaled weapons/outfits, to fight the enemies that are slightly scaled with you but the exact same look and feel. The combat just does not change.\n\n-Just confusing. My group of friends and I play quite a bit of survival games and have for a lot of years. This is just the most confusing game we have ever played. It's just... So many stupid little things to make the game seem to have more content, when all it does is just make things more complicated. Like I mentioned earlier, I have played about 20 hours (They have played 30 or 40) and we are just now figuring out how to make a gun, and have yet to see any sort of magic, even though it seems really implied you're supposed to be getting those things early on with the amount of different things you can craft, which brings me to my next point.\n\n-The crafting. You need almost nothing. I have NO use for ANY bench except the workbench and the sewing station for weapons and clothing. Every single other bench either is just to refine X material into Y material for the workbench/sewing station, or filled with stuff like potions/buffs that you just do not need and have zero use for, especially because you get so many from the world. I understand \"Well in other games you can't just build stone weapons then cannons from the same bench without some grinding/progression\". I definitely understand that, but there is just SO MUCH in this game almost to pad the content, it just all feels so useless.\n\n-Bugs. The game is super buggy. There are just little bugs everywhere, in everything you do. It really seems yknow... tolerable? Ok? I find it so amusing I have put quite a few hours into this game with how many bugs or little things are just broken or don't work. The game is on such a good track but wow is it in bad shape right now.\n\nOverall, I would wait to buy it. I mentioned before it seems like its on the perfect track it needs to be on. It's hard to stop playing even through all the bad aspects of the game, but there are just too many. It seems to *ALMOST* hit the mark in EVERY. SINGLE. CATEGORY. I really do have good hope for this game, and like I said I don't want to thumbs down it because I would hate for it to stop development, but it is just so overwhelmingly unfinished I for real cannot recommend it. From basic things like eating, drinking, building, to the main concept of the game like traveling and exploring (even that gets boring because you just dagger dash with your umbrella everywhere). I cannot say I didn't have fun playing this, but wow. It really did need another delay. Hopefully in 6 months it's polished enough to at least buy and enjoy, but I would say another full year of development and patches before it's in a state I believe it should have been released in today.", "timestamp_created": 1708764294, "timestamp_updated": 1708765979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509803950786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158932348": {"recommendationid": "158932348", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970553317", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 730, "last_played": 1709248495}, "language": "english", "review": "Nightingale has been a joy to play so far.

In order to progress they ask you to take down a boss, however they have put him on top of a mountain that you have to climb, the climbing hooks that took several benches to craft  serve no purpose as even with high stamina you have about 5 seconds each climb attempt, once you get to the top through an awkward series of glitched out jumps and arriving at the boss there is nothing to save your place. After taking on the boss and getting defeated, the game takes you back to your house and makes you start the entire process over again, you have a companion for hire that's supposed to revive you, but for some reason this does not work half the time and during boss fights.

And still never found it. \nI was very excited for this one. I played solo on Medium difficulty and after about 6 network error crashes post-tutorial, I noticed the following things:\n\n- The game is a work of art and some things are beautiful to look at. This is of course, overshadowed by clunky controls (I couldn't even walk up the steps of a wagon)\n\n- Character creation has promise but some choices and graphs/grids are simply unintuitive and redundant. The ancestry tree is a cool gimmick but feels like a mundane chore when you could simply just customize your character's appearance.\n\n- Stamina is incredibly punishing, even at Medium difficulty. I went through the trouble of getting an umbrella (which I was stoked for based on the trailers) and some climbing picks to test them out, only to find out that I could only use either of them for about 2 seconds at max stamina. Yes, even after eating. \n\n- The tutorial is painstakingly long. And you can't play multiplayer until you've cleared it. Yes, you have to be online for that as well.\n\n- The graphics I can overlook, but the resource gathering did not look smooth at all and felt very unpolished. This game has the unfortunate timing of going live right after other successful crafting survival games and is comparable in price, but not quality.\n\nTLDR: The game has promise but feels veeery unfinished in its current state.

Bear in mind one caveat though, that people seem to be forgetting.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS AN UNFINISHED EARLY ACCESS GAME! DO NOT EXPECT A POLISHED PROBLEM FREE PRODUCT!\r\n\r\nThat said, the things I love about it are the building system, the survival elements, the types of challenges and number to overcome. the ease of getting into it and challenging gameplay that makes you think about tactics, and the character customization. \r\n\r\nThe building system is virtually identical to that of Conan Exiles, but took all of the good elements of it and eliminated all the bad ones...like facing difficulties.  It's pretty easy to understand and comes fairly fluidly to anyone familiar with the style with a nice gentle learning curve for those who aren't. There is a building size limit too...make your building too big and you might have to sacrifice niceties like doors.\r\n\r\nThe survival elements stress keeping yourself, fed, which gives you some buffs to make life easier, rested so you can do things like regenerate your stamina and shelter so you don't freeze to death at night. There is gardening/farming that makes food less of a problem to get in a pinch and while they require maintenance they are easy to upkeep. Don't be out at nighttime either. It's not just freezing but there are a lot more of the bound (read badguys) out there hunting for human prey. Humans suck, so can't blame the bound for not wanting them for neighbors.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of bound, think undead fey. Some will smash you with hammers, some will throw balls of death at you, some will roll up on you and breath a cone of fire up your backside, others will try to introduce you to their turbo ginsu maneuvers...and the classic rush up and eat your face because bath salts are yummy. Add to this the various predators and some rather defensive prey out there and you have a nice rounded play experience.\r\n\r\nAs for character customization it is still only half done, but you can already get more customization options than a lot of finished games I have played. You even get to set up your own ancestry going back 3 generations and have that influence your character's appearance.

The sellers sell the same things, and the recruitable NPCs don't seem to have any differentiating features. Also, you can only have 1 follower at a time, and considering their AI is absolute garbage and they really don't help you with gathering/crafting at all, it's super disappointing. \n\nAfter 4 hours I had built all of my crafting machines and a pretty OK base and I was just left with a task to \"raise my hope.\" I thought traveling to different biomes might have been the way to go about it, but that didn't seem to actually accomplish anything. I felt sort of stunted not knowing what to do to progress besides trying to make a gigantic base since that gives you more \"hope.\" That just wasn't really desirable for me to do though.\n\nThe actual base building is extremely bland. It's obvious they want you to unlock base building pieces/designs as you progress, but what you start out with compared to other games (Enshrouded, Valheim) pretty much immediately removes any sort of fun you can have with that mechanic.

I am not liking reviewers. Are we still not understanding what Early Access means? I guess those are two syllable words...\n\nThe Devs have made some incredible choices that I absolutely adore.\nSounds are fairly immersive and not intrusive, often hinting without being invasive.\nThe way technology advances and develops is quite clever, unlocking technology on your benches because you added one unique piece of furniture (Augmentation) nearby is interesting. It takes some time to get THAT far, however.\nI need to experiment with cards more. The color of ink seems to do things to a new world.\n\nMy first encounter with the Grendel was a bit rough, and so much cheese was involved because we went in severely undergeared--30 power short. (~30 hours in since my friends are... how to be nice... inefficient.)\n\nThe combat is a bit of a lead in. Early on, mobs are not that diverse, but that gives you time to become familiar with the different types of weapon and sometimes changing weapons before you get bruisers, shielding mobs, casters, and whatever other nightmares the Wylds may hold. I would say switching weapons to match the enemy is very helpful because that damage bonus can be really nice, especially if you are going into a realm with power 40 greater than your weapon rating. Mobs just take a while to whittle down at that point.\n\nThe followers are amazing. They can't wield ranged weapons at the moment, but that's ok. They carry all the heavy stuff without complaining while you carry all the random light loot yourself. When you get home, they PUT THE STUFF AWAY. Especially if you give them access to chests unlike certain friends of mine who get so angry when the follower puts the high tier lumber in the furnace for fuel. If you don't want them to touch something, just put it in a chest and leave the switch off. When you are building stuff, your follower will access chests and add stuff to the building on their own, prioritizing low tier materials first. So... keep your fancy materials in a chest with the follower turned off until you're done building.\nForgot the whole, put an axe in the follower's hands and they will go chop and collect wood automatically, or a pick if you need stone, and they keep at it while you are talking to an NPC.\n\nI have no idea why people are complaining about the online part of game. If you don't want to play with someone... you're not going to see them running around unless you invite them in like some sort of vampire fanatic playing the wrong game. Most games require the internet to even start anymore, so I'm not really understanding this as a burden unless you're staying up all night in your mom's basement eating all the bandwidth and lying that the neighbors stole your wifi password when your mom gets the bill for all your \"streaming\" exceeding the monthly limit.\n\nFinding the Grendel, Bandersnatch, and Harpy is giving me a slow rising tension of what to expect when an Archfae appears. The humans have their misconception, the fantastical seem to know different things, and the Fae are for the most part, not present save for Puck.

the forge for ingots and metal work, the tanner for leather, the sewing bench to make clothes and more, you start with simple work stations and then as you progress through the realms you unlock higher tiered versions of the workstations so you can craft higher tiered items you will also augment the benches with extra build-able objects.\n\nYou progress through the realms as you go making them more difficult as the story goes on, each time you enter a new realm you complete fae towers to unlock the map and then you complete some of the POI's this rewards you with essence the higher the realm the higher the Tier essence you get, you use this essence at the Essence traders to unlock your blueprints that you craft in the different crafting benches and the buildings you can build.\n\nOnce you reach The Watch you will find yourself in a town where you can unlock further blueprints and you can have access to doing Vault runs which again reward you with essence to spend at the traders in the Watch, you will also unlock further Ascendant versions of the realms you have previously gone to which again give you higher tiered items.\n\nyou are not handheld with this game and it leaves it up to the player to figure out what you have to do which can sometimes be confusing but then you can look in the menus and figure out if you are missing items from traders or if you are missing a quest or if you have a workbench built but need to also build an augment for the bench which will unlock a recipe.\n\nas in any early access game there are bugs and things that could be fleshed out (more verity of enemies for an example) but given time this game has the potential for those things.\n\neven though this game requires an internet connection to play you can still play this game SINGLEPLAYER without anyone else, you can set your realms to private which is the setting by default, you will see other players when in The Watch but you do not have to interact with them, when running vaults you are grouped up with random people but you don't have to talk to any of them you just go in and fight the enemy's and solve the puzzles in the rooms to move to the next, there are currently no roles like Tank, healer and damage which would require more in depth grouping.\n\nimprovements can be made like more main realm cards currently there are only 3 (forest, desert and swamp) more varieties of fae creatures and enemies, loading times, farming, but again this is all things that can be worked on", "timestamp_created": 1709214088, "timestamp_updated": 1709214088,

The character creation is abysmal anyway and I can only look at a host of ugly character models for so long. Once was enough. This game is not ready, not even close to what I thought it would be. Looks pretty I guess but everything is convoluted (the UI is terrible) and the fact I cannot progress without having to start over then it is a hard pass for me. Yes, yes I understand it is early access but I had no issues actually playing the game when it came to Palworld or Enshrouded. I do not care if it is online only if the game actually works.

The realm card system makes the game a different take on the survival, exploration game. Not sure if Zelzany's \"Nine Princes in Amber\" was a starting point but if you are familiar with the premise of that series you will see the parallels.\r\nReasons you might like it:\r\n1. The lore and background and graphics are spot on. No complaints there. Graphics and writing team nailed it. \r\n2. Sound design is pretty good. Only one NPC is voice acted, Puck - your guide, and they nailed the delivery on that.\r\nReasons to avoid:\r\n1. Whomever designed the UI apparently thought their task was to make the UI as intrusive and complex for no reason as possible in order to hinder the player at every opportunity. I have seen this more and more in games as companies in order to cut costs drop UI/UX development on the game code developers and let them flounder at it.\r\n2. You have a building game and the building system is really, really poor. It is locked, seems about 22.5 degrees, to a grid rotation and to compound that the building grid doesn't align with the world grid so trying to dovetail stuff together is an exercise in frustration. Exactly the same issues that are in other recent games, Return to Moria comes to mind. My experience is that after building my base, it randomly and spontaneously  decides to disassemble portions of itself.\r\n3. The animation for your character is pretty poor and not fluid at all.\r\n4. Combat could be described at best as mediocre especially with the disconnect between the aiming point presented to the player and where the game actually thinks it is. Even worse if you try to use 3rd person view. NPC AI is pretty much straight line attack with no real intelligence demonstrated.\r\n5. While they did add a keybind system after the alpha testing it still doesn't always work and the hint interface doesn't present accurate information to the player. For instance the building option to raise or lower objects.\r\n6. No accessibility options, other than the keybinds mentioned above, just a placeholder saying it is coming. Which is a not so subtle way of saying that gamers with disabilities are second class citizens and instead of building in support from the start they might get around to it - which would not surprise me at all if that just got dropped eventually.\r\n7. You character is apparently a teen-aged male shrew that must eat their body weight in food or starve to death. Literally minutes after eating something your character starts mewling and you are warned you are starving and their health starts to decrease. It can be somewhat tanked at higher levels but at lower levels it is fatal. Pretty sure that people don't die from not eating a snack every 15 mins.\r\n8. Inventory management is pretty much non-existent. They couldn't even implement something as simple as sort by...adding to it that the same icons are used for items and some are just a generic N icon (I would give them a pass on that since it is early access if not for the fact they have should no real work in coming up with an effective inventory system).\r\n9. It is pretty easy to get into a \"Red Queen Hypothesis\" scenario where all you time is taken up with just maintaining your stuff and you make no actual progress. especially if you only have a limited time to play. The really high cost to repair your stuff almost makes it less expensive to make replacements instead of repair stuff. Not sure if that is a subtle dig by the developers at our planned obsolescence industrial society or if they can't do math.\r\n\r\nGreat graphics, intriguing lore and world generation absolutely crippled by the gaming UI and gaming systems they developed.

It is very good if you enjoy complex crafting systems with huge and limitless open worlds to explore. If you view a game like Grounded or Palworld as complex as you really care to handle, then you probably will not like this game. If you like a game whose crafting system is more akin to Eve Online than a game like Grounded, then this may be a survival game for you.\n\nSome of the major problems for this game right now are just #earlyaccess things: \nSome systems feel a bit half-baked / awkward\nUI/Menu navigation needs some work\nProgression pacing is inconsistent and feels weird (I felt like I was in T1/T2 forever then all of a sudden I'm done with the whole tutorial/campaign - to be fair, I think part of this may be on me due to my love for random construction projects, especially early on when I'm learning how a game's building system works)\nA lot of QOL stuff missing (survival games REALLY need to learn that crafting from chests is an absolute necessity (especially for Nightingale with such a complex crafting system) - I believe I read somewhere that the devs are planning to add this soonish but do not take it as gospel).\n\nPositives:\nRealm Card system is an incredibly well thought-out and great system that can be utilized in ways the devs may not even have thought about yet. Master stroke here.\nSeems to be pretty bug-free so far.\nGraphical style and fidelity both great. (I'm on a bit of a monster machine so I can't speak to low-mid range PCs on this)\nLove the world, though I'm more immersed in the worldbuilding itself than the story. I'll be honest, I mostly skipped through anything that wasn't Puck. Can't speak too authoritatively on the story.\nThe endgame systems are really cool.\n\nNegatives:\nEarly to mid-game is tedious and arguably very boring (unfortunately, most of the friends I started playing with dipped out before we got to the end for this very reason). There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of point to this part of the game other than as a glorified tutorial. Devs need to work on this part of the game or make it clear that this is an extended tutorial and give a more guided approach. Also, let us SKIP it if we want to. PLEASE. (At the very least, on future characters after a first playthrough) I might be in the minority on this (though I doubt it), but most survival players aren't that interested in a guided story. We love our sandboxes.\nI think that because most of the progression awarded by the story/tutorials can also be bought from the essence traders, this isn't a huge ask. But I also didn't make the game, so I do not know how onerous this would end up being for their devs.\n\nI mentioned this earlier, but some crucial QOL is missing from Nightingale that are hard to adjust to. Specifically, crafting tables accessing your containers (or, at least, nearby containers).  With a crafting system as complex as Nightingale's, we need to be able to set up elaborate containers to do the sorting and we just craft from those. I've gotten literally dizzy at times trying to fly between chests to get all the constituent parts, craft the right pieces, then go back to my chests, put some stuff back, craft the thing, and then put surplus supplies back. This becomes a bigger problem when you use things like the settler's card for bonus refinement yield (which is a great thing, I love it), but means we usually end up with a surplus (unless you intentionally screw yourself out of yield, I guess.)\n\nThose two things (early-mid game and crafting from chests) pretty much covers all my negatives about the game. \n\nAll in all, I think this is going to be a great game and is going to eventually be a hell yes.  Right now I say yes if you know what you're signing up for.  I don't know if I can whole-heartedly recommend it, though. Maybe in a year / when it comes out of early access.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1708980250, "timestamp_updated": 1708980250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042229175567627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158951945": {"recommendationid": "158951945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272383383", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1709781621}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm enjoying the game.

I've always said that Skyrim has some of the best sky boxes, especially at night, but this game is a very close second.\n\n-Being able to customize your lineage and have that potentially influence how your character looks, while it has some hiccups, is definitely unprecedented as far as character creators go.  Kudos to them for trying something new.\n\n-The crafting and combat is really engaging. The fact that your equipment can look different depending on what you use to craft it is a very nice touch. Also the only game I've seen where you can instakill enemies by shooting their heart is very unique, and forces you to really study your enemies instead of just blindly rushing them.\n\nCons:\n\n-Everything.  Costs.  Stamina.  Stamina management in this game can be a nightmare.  The fact that I can sprint halfway across a map before running out of stamina, but can't use the climbing picks for more than 2 seconds is kind of baffling.\n\n-The idea of having 2 sets of hot keys for both hands, while it sounds good on paper, it's pretty awkward in practice.  Having to let go of my mouse or movement keys just to switch to my umbrella is cumbersome and clunky. I'd suggest using a key modifier plus scroll wheel to scroll our offhand slots.\n\n-Being able to craft items from storage is the default of 90% of survival crafting games, so it beggars belief why this game chose to forgo that on release.\n\nWith all that being said, I'm still going to give this game a thumbs up.  Not for what it is now, but for what it has the potential to be.  Because under the clunkyness and weird design decisions, there's a fantastic game that just needs some nuturing to become easily one of the best survival games in 2024.", "timestamp_created": 1708716793, "timestamp_updated": 1708717003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506988108158111572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158997526": {"recommendationid": "158997526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171638649", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 608, "last_played": 1709934397}, "language": "english", "review": "Character creation is kind of ugly but the rest of the game is gorgeous and very fun", "timestamp_created": 1708630441, "timestamp_updated": 1708630441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506988108158111572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158823708": {"recommendationid": "158823708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983497510", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1709419929}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING WORTH THE WAIT", "timestamp_created": 1708453799, "timestamp_updated": 1708453799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506988108158111572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158829561": {"recommendationid": "158829561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318540043", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 116, "last_played": 1709147583}, "language": "english", "review": "Genuinely really enjoyed what I've played so far.

Combat is so far not challenging but still feels responsive and fun and the environment is amazing. The different biomes are all unique with their own life and I can't wait to play with the cards and see what else I can unlock.

I would say definitely get this game on your wishlist if you need it to be bug/issue free immediately and get it when things have been sorted.

Plenty of other things to play to pass the time :)", "timestamp_created": 1708458365, "timestamp_updated": 1708463200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506926238536834717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159582704": {"recommendationid": "159582704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058876419", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7039, "last_played": 1709531154}, "language": "english", "review": "I see a lot of negative reviews due to things such as there not being enough polish, not enough variety of weapons/armor/gear, complaints of it being online only (it's not a secret people should pay attention and understand what they're buying),folks having network connection loss ( in 117 hours I lost connection from the network 3 or 4 times, and for an early access game that's impressive to me). When you get down to it most of the complaints or negative reviews are things folks should expect when they purchase a game in EARLY ACCESS.  \n\nI personally overall had a blast with the game, I ground myself up to gear-score 276 which is damn near the maximum from what I can tell. my experience was mostly smooth and the game maintained my interest and I cannot wait for more content. (side-note: a snow biome would be so much fun!)\n\nCRAFTING - 8/10 I enjoy the wide variety of materials that can be used in crafting, I like that each type of material effects various stats. What I am not the biggest fan of is the fact that it's a bit complicated to know exactly what certain things do such as augmentations. Sure, you can go through each of the 57 augmentations and set aside 5-10 minutes of your time doing so to figure out exactly what you need. I personally hope they link each augmentation to each type of crafting bench in the build menu so you can quickly assess which augment goes to which crafting station and exactly what it does. Also my other caveat is there isn't cloud storage in the game yet, so it gets rather tedious moving stuff around to craft. \n\nEXPLORATION - 10/10 I loved the sense of exploration in each of the type of biomes as well as the various realm cards and how it altered everything from the sky, space, fauna and even creatures. I strongly enjoyed the bits of lore that can be found in various places throughout the map. I would love to see more variety in the puzzle mini-games when it comes to getting essence. \n\nCOMBAT - 8/10 I enjoy the combat, the melee feels very fluid however the ranged with firearms can be a bit frustrating when you miss your first shot and suddenly it's taking an eternity to have follow-up shots.  \n\nGEAR/WEAPONS 6/10 - It's early access so I can't complain much but I really am looking forward to seeing what other weapons they add because currently it's quite limited. If I can get a sword, dagger and bow combo I'd be in heaven. The weapons we have now have some fantastic detail to them, I enjoy how the crafting materials effect the appearance of the gear. My personal dislike at the moment is the lack of variety in clothing/armor, there just isn't much. \n\nI also find it annoying how you cannot see what base item level gear will be until you put materials in. Which means to check any of the 6-8 hat recipes I have to see which is the highest base gear-score I need to go haul all my mats out of their chests just to put them into a bench and see what I'm working with. Also, in my opinion there is a real lack of clothing/armor for male character types. \n\nENDGAME - 7/10 I'm one of those weirdos who loves the endgame grind in games like this. I enjoy grinding dungeons for more essence just to get myself a nice new piece of gear. Looking forward to more variety in these dungeons/vaults in terms of location, enemies and mechanics. My biggest gripe about the endgame is how the vendors work, the clothing vendor for instance - I can buy bundles for druidic armor but I would love to see a breakdown of exactly what I am buying in that bundle. I would also like to have some type of gear stat breakdown so I can determine which bundle of gear is going to be better for my playstyle. \n\nIn conclusion, for a game in early access this game feels absolutely wonderful, the developer seems to really be focused on further improving the game and has created a gorgeous detail-rich game. I do hope they don't \"dumb\" it down too much because I love the complexity of the crafting system, just needs a handful of tweaks in my opinion. I look forward to upcoming updates, and hopefully a road-map for future content/changes. I HIGHLY recommend this game to fellow survival/crafting/RPG lovers like myself, just give it a chance and realize it is an early access game (also for $30, that fact I got over 100 hours of fun out of it is WELL worth it to me!).\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1709264009, "timestamp_updated": 1709264009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506889045238494873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159178494": {"recommendationid": "159178494", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983668123", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1709090837}, "language": "english", "review": "i can see the potential.... please bring in more content... fauna, machines, i see hints to flying ships.. gaslight/steampunk, call it what you may, but the machines, will bring more to the game than just relms of different flora.... airships... underwater vehicles .... will add immersion to the theme, right now its just land mass and flora/fauna, yes the design is different in the fauna, but never the less still fauna like so many survival games... even a sprinkling of  NCP humans in flying ships (pirates) that roam the worlds.... bring in what this game has advertised as gaslight/steampunk worldly theme.. just people wearing clothing of the period will not do... or scattered imagery of the theme... interactive is where its at.. and game play to go with.... keep up the good work, you have found a very interesting path in a survival game, lets see how far you can take it to make it truly a world of its own and not a reskin of many other survival games", "timestamp_created": 1708803604, "timestamp_updated": 1708803604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506874740123748779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158840077": {"recommendationid": "158840077", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970166619", "num_games_owned": 1111, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 3676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1709529466}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing. And even though you think you've seen a lot of \"open world survival\" games, you've never seen anything like this.\n\nPremise:\nEarth has suffered a magical apocalypse and is ostensibly gone. You have survived by entering a magical gate to the Fae realms, a multiverse of interconnected magical dream/nightmare dimensions. Your goal: reaching the last safe place left on earth, the magical city of Nightingale.\n\nAlways Online:\nFirst off, this is a pseudo-MMO. It's always online because realms are actually semi-persistent dedicated servers that you, as a player, get for free. Co-op is built into the game's DNA, so as you hop between realms (i.e. magical dream/horror dimensions) you can also hop to the realms of other players (by invitation, of course)... with additional surprises later in the game. This is NOT and was never intended to be a fully offline game. You can play solo, sure, but you're online for a reason. If you buy it with an offline expectation, that is on you.\n\nDifficulty:\nThere is a LOT of customization for gameplay styles and preferences. You have a difficulty for your own character and a separate difficulty option for each new realm you enter. At the lowest difficulty, the game is darn near cozy (pure exploration/adventure with almost no threat) - and at the highest (called \"Extreme\") this plays like a first-person Elden Ring (very high skill requirement, but always fair).\n\nGameplay:\nYou arrive in a new realm and hunt for \"cards\" that will let you open gates to even more, newer realms... ever increasing in nightmarishness as you go onward. The fighting system is great, taking cues from Soulslikes... but with difficulty options that range from \"I hate fighting and want to feel like One-Punch Man\" to \"if you make one mistake you are worm food\".  There are temples, puzzles, crafting, building, and all of this in a game with incredible graphics that runs great regardless of if you use an upscaler like DLSS or not.\n\nPolish:\nThe game is very, very feature complete and very stable. It's mostly missing little bits of visual polish - like some item artwork or minor animations (like doors opening/closing). Given the game has faced over a years worth of delays, it's nice to see that it's launched in such a solid state.\n\nEarly Access Completion:\nThe current version of the game only has about 1/3 of the planned story. You can follow the story until a very obvious point where all of the training wheels come off. While you can continue to play after that, there is no more story to advance... which is painful, because the story is actually really good. The game sets up multiple big plot points that just... cease. This is similar to the EA releases for The Forest and Sons of The Forest... where the mechanics were there from the start, but the story was being constantly developed and expanded throughout Early Access. Just be aware, this game is following that model - so there is clearly a LOT of story and content left to implement.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is incredible. It's learned all the right lessons from other games in every genre this touches. And at under $30 it's an absolute STEAL... it's easily worth twice that. But hey, that means it's all the easier to convince your friends to play... and that is, after all, EXACTLY how Nightingale is meant to be played.

An interesting overambitious little (huge ass in terms of gamedata) UE Game with the tried and true:\u00a0\nFirst Person, OpenW (realm-based), exploration sandbox game with some survival mechanics.\n\nThis is nothing new, but they sprinkled a lot of interesting new little bits and bobs in it to distinguish it from other games. The graphics are up to par with other U4/U4 SCSGs, and the launch is not that bad for a gamedev of this size with overpromised features and a whole hypetrain behind it to crash any ambition to hustle all these day-one logins. Every hyped game has this, and everyone has failed, even huge companies.\u00a0\n\n[h1]So, what's the issue? [/h1]\n\n[h2]TL;DR[/h2]\nThe game has a decent story, a solid crafting base with some but not much upgrades and plays better than most early titles of this genre. Bad timing (Palworld/Enshrouded) leans heavily against the next-gen claims of this game. So it's as always: tell the devs (forums/discord/offical communications pipelines) what's wrong, and they may fix it. If they don't fix it, change your review and learn for the next time when you buy EA-Games from this company.\n\n[h3]Long Story:[/h3]\nWarning: Please do not read the following if you are easily offended or have a personality that is centered around retro games. Or do, idc, not your father.\n\n[h3]Gameplay:[/h3]\nHeavily inspired by other SCSGs, this one has nothing new to bring to the table except a different flavor of fantasy setting and storytelling. It's fun; it scratches the itch for some new form of content in this genre without straying too far from the path. Imagine it as ice cream, while Ark is your sour-lemon sorbet that surprised you with a whole new world, while you were expecting vanilla ice cream. This sensation worn off with all this strawberry, apple, whatever sorbet-sellers trying to squeeze into this already tight marketspace and some of them thinking, well, e.g., \"pokemon\"-styled sorbet will bring all the fans of other genres into this one (with more or less effect) or, let's make it, \"minecraft\" would make anyone care for that old ass flavor. Now this one comes also as sorbet but lets out one main mechanic (taming) and adds so effing much sprinkles and glitter that you would think this is something new, but soon realize it's the same thing again with less taste and more pizzazz. This game gets dull real soon without something to work to, so they added a goal to get to somewhere and to work toward getting \"stronger\" to make more of the thing you already needed to get to this point, artificially cutting of your progress by saying, \"You need more of this, but that you can only get if you leave behind everything and start the grind again with other colored resources!\" It's mediocre, but okay for the price, I guess.\n\n[h3]System:[/h3]\nThe game runs fine if you play it on a halfway decent PC with modern DLSS capability and a wired connection over 5 mbit DSL. It's not Skyrim; I mean, why would it be? No one needs a FPARPG with a long-ass story and a crowded overworld, right? Right? But jokes aside, as always, expectation meets reality, bummer for every idiot that still thinks all the big titles from before 2010 were so much better and timeless classics as Skyrim haven't aged a bit and that no game before the great Addon-/Paid-content-/DLC-Cataclysm were perfect games with no patches needed, and you never needed to update your system, let alone your game, to play it on your potato-celeron inside clusterf'ck of a PC to get it to work: Welcome to the world of \"new games needing more space on your mini-ssd doesn't mean they must have more content: [b](UHD) Graphics > Sound-files > Rest (Shaders, Scripts, Frameworks[/b]\"\n\n[h3]Issues:[/h3]\nPerformance issues even with good setups (like every other SCSG), always online (shocking for a coop-focused amirite), less than average innovations for a saturated genre, and poor/unresponsive combat (like all others... No! Dodgerolls doesn't make it better, looking at you, Enshrouded), pisspoor reception because of too many prerenders and too little gameplay showing.\n\n[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]\nSo why do I still recommend it? Because if this is what makes a game bad, prepare for the hell that is indie-mini/streamer-game/AAA-Cashgrab hell that's about to come. Indie/Short-Arcade games are fun, yes, but fundamentally flawed in that, in order to be unique, they need some massively good concept, and guess why most of the songs you hear consist of the same combination of tones and concepts of rhythm and flow? If you think this has nothing to do with each other, good for you. Just don't ask why there is no new cool, unique music (genre, concept, or idea) anymore and everything repeats itself after 5\u201310 years.\u00a0\n\nThat is all. Game's okay. Maybe it will get better; maybe nothing changes.

The gaslamp fantasy style is wonderfully crafted and the game looks beautiful! There are some wonderful details in Nightingale; although, the game is very rough and doesn't do much to really stand out in the landscape of the survival genre. This is a game that I have been watching and anticipating for quite a while and am kinda sad to give a no recommendation on this one. This is a lot of rough edges; many aspects of the game don't seem completely thought out and come across as tacked on. There is a tediousness and arduousness to much of the game. You can get good Playtime Value out of this game, easily getting more than 1 hours per dollar spent on the game. I personally like Nightingale,; I like the gas lamp aesthetic and love how I can generate and shape realms with realm cards. Personally love the umbrella a lot, lol. But still cannot recommend even though I personally like Nightingale. \r\n\r\nI have an A Day In The Life review of Nightingale on YouTube. I played for 26 hours for that review. \r\nhttps://youtu.be/-Ayk7wlCQBM?si=3K-EWeUOwPUinv2H\r\n\r\nNow...I couldn't give up on Nightingale. I created a new character and played for about another 27 hours on this character. I had the thought that maybe playing Nightingale for content might have caused me to inadvertently play in a way that decreased my over all enjoyment of Nightingale and that maybe if I played at my own pace and not for content then I would enjoy Nightingale as much as I anticipated. \r\n\r\nMy recommendation does not change. \r\nWith more time on another character with some advanced knowledge, I understand why some of the tedium and arduousness is present in crafting and inventory management with resources but it does not mitigate or lessen the tedium and arduousness that make those systems not enjoyable to begin with. There are things that I do like that result from some trial and error in crafting and resource management but again the payout is not holistically worth it, mainly allowing you to skip some of the gear score grind a bit. \r\n\r\nAgain I personally like, but do not recommend. I will probably still play some more Nightingale as well because I want to know what this Watch is in the achievements...but many of Nightingale's competitors are doing much more to stand out and be more mechanically unique than Nightingale. I will revisit this review with Nightingale's 1.0 launch, maybe before.

I think it's worth the money for the hours I have enjoyed playing it. I look forward to seeing what comes next and I do hope they plan to expand and advance the story line and quests. \n\nI have been playing the game for 100+ hours, I am fairly new to the video game world, previous games I have played where Skyrim, Hogwarts Legacy, Avatar Frontiers of Pandora, Skull and Bones, and Anno 1800. \n\nI like survival crafting games, fantasy open worlds, it's not all about combat for me.\n\n[h3] Some things I would like to see change or improve.  [/h3]\n\n[h3] Crafting and Resource Gathering and Inventory [/h3]\nNot having the ability to stack crafting jobs at the same bench is tedious, but I have heard this will be addressed in the future. \n\nCloud storage is also being addressed in the future, and I am hoping for the ability to sort items by Tier level, and maybe have a filter? It would also be nice to able to multi-select items and transfer from your pack to storage, or your recruited follower. \n\n[h3] Follower [/h3]\n\nI would like to be able communicate better with my follower. Currently, they will add any type of fuel I give them to any campfire, I can't say how many times I have lost Eoten lumber, coal, and hardwood before I figured out my recruited follower burned everything that can be used as fuel in their inventory. It would nice if their equipped clothing items didn't take up space in their inventory. I really like that they don't seem to have a weight limit for carrying.\n\nWhen I am collecting specific resources I would like my follower to collect the same thing. For  example, when I am mining level 100 ore, I don't want them mining sandstone. \n\nThey walk into the campfires and light themselves on fire constantly, although it's kind hilarious, it's still something that shouldn't happen.\n\n[h3] Game Mechanics [/h3]\nI would like to be able to group or move multiple items at a time when building or re-arranging furniture.  \n\nWhen building, I would like the ability to zoom out to a higher perspective so I can design the floor plan from an aerial view. \n\nI hate the language \"Give Up\" after being injured. Maybe something more neutral like Try Again?\n\nIt would be lovely to have multiple sets of toolbars configurable for your carrying hands 1-0 and Q. I would like a mining resource option and a fighting one. \n\nClicking on augmentations should populate information about what craft bench it supports and a crafting bench should list what augmentations its currently utilizing. It gets incredibly chaotic trying to figure out what augmentations go to what. I would also like the guidebook combined with the crafting screen so I don't have to jump between screens to track items, learn about the augmentations required, etc\n\nIt would be lovely if the Building tab had more filters, I would like to be able to filter out the Simple, Refined, Excellent etc and I would like a count of how many items I have currently built. \n\nI hate de-foresting trees, I wish there was a way to ensure they were replanted. \n\nCoal is insanely hard to find and it's used to craft gun powder, steel ingots, or as an option for fuel so it\u2019s a precious commodity.

On two occasions I was trying to make something on a station and accidentally attacked it destroying it. Do to the fact that it was destroyed I only recouped half the materials to rebuild it (which since it was a higher tier station the mats were more of a grind to get). When you get the higher tier weapons every last one of them will one shot anything inside your base.  The base health does not bring any form of enjoyment to the game and in my opinion makes the game worse. Why would I want or need my base destroyed by a darn wolf that spawns next to it? Please remove this mechanic from the game or at the very very very least make the base components/work stations health bars large enough that they don't get destroyed immediately after being built.

It's everything you want it to be , but it's also everything that has been.\n\nSo far the game really lacks a true identity. This is the No Mans Sky of survival games so far. The attempt is to do something large and impactful in the space of survival and it's scratching the surface, but only that. The combat is no better than Conan. The building is no better than Valheim. The world aesthetic is no better than enshrouded. The point is, everything you get in Nightingale you have pretty much seen before, the one thing that we are looking forward to is the card system, yet somehow that isn't quite diverse enough to really push the boundaries of the genre. It just becomes a situation where we are re-using way too many assets and re coloring them, I am not sure how far you can push the limits of design with a game of this magnitude, but to be truly special you have to do something REALLY WELL. Combat is not done really well, AI interactions are not done really well, the best part of the game for me so far has simply been getting a sweet screenshot of the sky with the sun hitting just right... but yet while playing the game I never feel like the moment to moment gameplay is breathtaking, in fact its rather clunky. When a tree falls you just think Valheim did that better. The biggest one for me so far is the lack of pulse on the genre, no quick sort to chests?! Like these are the day 1 QOL things you would expect from this genre that has been a tried and true testament to the nature of the game. We are here with hundreds of materials and we have to drag drop everything or else it randomly throws items into a bag.

The mall in the sky.\n- \"Realms don't correlate to Earth biomes\"... really? Yes, yes they do and they aren't that interesting.\n- Once you visit a realm (Forest+Herb for instance), that's the only Forest+Herb realm you'll ever see. There's no regeneration and pretty much no reason to return after you did the landmarks in it.\n- Endless waiting to have the server do what exactly? Makes for a sluggish experience when you're having to bounce back to previous realms or drop materials off at your Respite/base.\n- Companions are totally generic and except for picking up some slack in fights or carrying some extra stuff (which they sometimes lose or put in campfires or building projects) aren't any fun to be around. They do teleport around a lot rather than get stuck but it's disconcerting.\n- Augmentations...what a pile of crap. Who designed this mechanism should have their ass kicked. It's confusing as hell and makes no sense. It doesn't help that most of the icons are missing but even if they were there, can anyone explain how putting a trout on the wall adds a couple of food recipes or having a set of bellows adds a few clothing recipes to the sewing table?\n- Recipes...I have unlocked everything from all vendors up to Gloom and 90% of the recipes are still unknown. I guess I have to go to the mall in the sky for those. Including most of the food, most clothes, most non-basic tools. Why can't you learn a recipe when you pick up a material? \n- Endless minor variations of simple things, none of which can stack together of course. Hide: tiers 1, 2 and 3 of prey, predator, named creatures, bound creatures, leather crafted from each of the hide variations, felt from each of the hide variations, 10 kinds of thread from each of the 10 kinds of fiber, endless and pointless variations so you can craft endless and pointless variations of basic clothing with tiny stats differences. Same with ores, wood, meat, glass, paper, inks, potions, every damn thing.\n- Combat...flail around with an axe and maybe you'll whack something. Oh yes, enemies have \"weak spots\" but basically you're using blunt tools to flail away just like in Skyrim from 2015 so good luck with hitting \"weak spots\". Sure you can use a gun but reloading time is long so you'll shoot it once and then switch to an axe anyway.\n- Tasks need re-balancing - for instance, avoid aiding survivors when their project is building something because they always need 300 logs and 100 sticks and you'll get 25 essence...about the same as you get from cutting down that many trees.\n- NPCs...I cannot remember the last time I saw so many wooden NPCs. The ones that do move are like robots. The rest just stand there. Where there is dialog, it's verbose and not especially useful. It's a drag to interact with them honestly.\n- Enemy \"AI\"...it's about the level of Zombies and Potholes. Sorry, but it is.\n- Rock-climbing...jeez. Needs work, like a lot of things.\n- Even the procedural generation of realms needs more variation in the land forms. They look like they pull from the same set of a few maps and scatter landmarks on top. You've seen one forest, you seen them all.\n- for all the \"steam-punkiness\", there's no building your own contraptions. Now THAT would be a cool game where you can jank together a steampunk airship or factory.\n\nWhat's good about this game?\n- I think the variation in generated buildings is great.\n- Some of the animals show some imagination (looking at you, Icarus)\n- Landscapes are pretty nice. \n- Resource regeneration is a nice touch. I wish it wouldn't regenerate inside my base though.\n\nFundamentally, there's just too much wrong with the game to make it really fun.

Look at everything these devs have packed into one game!  That's a lot to carry on a server, and yet somehow they are managing it with minimal disruptions (and you never lose progress as it saves continuously, it seems.) \n\nSome whiny people just can't seem to wait ten seconds to respawn maybe [u] once or twice a day [/u] if you're on a stable connection (like you clicked \"agree to when you installed it, people) - and the truth is they're mad and they can't wait that long [i] because this game is that good and they want to keep playing. [/i] \n\nPeriod.  \n\nOr some just don't want to put the work into learning the incredibly rich and fully-developed crafting system, and instead just want items handed to them without thought (or customization potential), so they've come here complaining and trashing the best game I've seen in AT LEAST 5 years in this genre - maybe ever, actually.\n\n[b] The TL;DR is this - Nightingale is a ridiculously intricate, outrageous, unique, and breathtakingly beautiful twist that is LIGHTYEARS beyond any game in this genre.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love if a bunch of people wanted to pick it up, but it is a strange blend of survival mechanics, mmo-ish presence and servers, exploration game and (easy, mostly) puzzler. The theme is going to appeal to more people's tastes than the gameplay itself, I think, especially judging by many of the negative reviews I've glanced through. (Common complaints I'm seeing are about the building system, the UI, the grind, or specific items / too many item types, just to state what I'm seeing.)\n\nFor me, this mix is perfect. This is ABSOLUTELY what I hoped Nightingale would be. I'm always stumbling over strange finds and exploring them, or being a busybody around my Abeyance (home) realm, or grinding materials with a gorgeous view. \n\nNotes on the negatives people have listed as follows for those in-between in opinion.\n\n-On grinding: I expect the grind from a survival game - I've dumped a hilarious amount of hours into Conan Exiles, No Man's Sky on xbox (not so much on pc), etc. I personally enjoy it - not everyone will.\n\n-On the UI: I honestly don't see a problem with any of it. It's to my taste, and I think it fits the game very well.\n\n-The building system is ... like most other survival games? Again, I'm so used to this that it just works how I expect. It's not good or bad, really. I do see lots of frustration about Augmentations - little items you place near a workbench to increase it's speed / give it new recipes - but when I figured out to build a different one for my workbench that was overloaded, my mental response was, \"oh, I'll just move one of these away real quick then, they look like furniture anyway.\" Boom, solved. Now, if you're coming from Enshrouded, you're going to be disappointed if you're expecting that, because Enshrouded *literally has the best building system I've ever seen* and I personally don't hold any other dev to that standard. Enshrouded also wasn't for me, despite the cool building system.\n\n-Itemization. There are SO many different items. I will agree that it can get annoying trying to sort them all, because different items do not stack (in those items' defense, they are different items, so... duh?) which means to store them, they need to take up separate storage slots, which means that you need to build a BUNCH of chests. At the moment there is no craft-from-chests option, so you end up running to and from your chests a bunch while crafting if you're like me and have a short memory span or don't like to hold onto more than the necessities while at home. However, as an upside, this means the crafting is SO wildly varied - I can farm the materials that are right for me as they all have different stats. It isn't immediately clear which stats will modify an item based on type, but I honestly am so fine with experimentation that this wasn't a negative to me.\n\n-The AI is actually moronic. My companion is an idiot who actually stands in my way while I mine, 90% of the time. I end up yelling at her a lot. Fighting the Bound is personally very fun for me, though.\n\n-Combat isn't really flashy, but I enjoy it anyway. Again, a personal thing.\n\n-The big one for me personally: Nightingale doesn't hold your hand through a LOT. I'm seeing this here and on Reddit: there's nothing that I saw telling you to look at your Glossary (journal button (J), Glossary at the top) to find where you can find an item. Nothing that really explains that different materials have different capabilities when crafting. Sometimes the cards are weirdly worded so it's unclear what changes they'll make, even if you're reading the stats on a realmic transmogrifier (I forget exactly what those are called). This can be... testing. I've had a good few times where I out loud was like THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT INFORMATION HOURS AGO. I will say that, in general, maybe Nightingale's lack of hand-holding is awesome in most cases for some players - maybe for some, it's the thing that makes you want to refund. I won't judge one way or the other, you do you.\n\nI will also quickly comment that, having made it to the watch, I genuinely see the point of \"online only\" and honestly do not have any inkling of an idea what they'll do to make this NOT the case. When in the watch, you are in a public area more akin to the Division's home base. The dungeons there are very, very public. My friend and I entered one on a whim and ended up fighting with (three? maybe two, I was tired) other people against a giant Eaton (ent). It was dope. If they can figure out how to make it not online-only without compromising their vision, props to them.\n\nLast note here, and this isn't touching on a complaint but a huge positive from me towards the game. The ambiance is astounding. The other night I was in a gloom forest, where it's always night, with a piercing moon through the trees. Far-off cries of predator vs prey and distant screams occasionally filled the otherwise-still air, and I had limited bullets left in my pistol and very few health potions left, so I weighed returning but I pressed on for just a little while longer. It started raining, and then hailing, and the hail and rain drowned out the distant screams and for a moment, where before I felt hope and excitement toward the realms of the Fae in general, now I just felt unnerved.\nThe ambiance is amazing. Sound design, amazing. From the ridiculous PING on a headshot or heartshot to the sound puzzles to the crumbling dusty ruins to the cries of the birds in the forest to the desert wind, sound is amazing.\n\nTLDR;\n+This game will absolutely not be for everyone! You've gotta love the theme, survival games, exploration, not mind puzzles. If you're naturally curious and go explore crazy things in the distance, you might like this game. If you're into crazy crafting systems, you might like this game. If you don't like your hand-held and are stubborn, you might be into this game. I have mostly played alone, but this game IS better with other players; you should be good either way (though I can't speak for how the dungeons in the Watch might play out after the Online Only change coming). I personally am very excited for the future of this game.\n\n-If you don't like bugs (I've had very few but my experience is rare and I'm aware of that), wait till Early Access is done before considering. If you don't like survival games, hate the concept of something being multiplayer, are not the explorer type, or are really not into the concept of sorting items / your group doesn't have someone who can, maybe pass on Nightingale. \n\nIf you made it all this way through my long-winded rambling in support of this game, get yourself a snack as a treat.", "timestamp_created": 1708801114, "timestamp_updated": 1708801114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504310309886932373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159175066": {"recommendationid": "159175066", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994469482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1709771622}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd like to slow the hate train down with my positive review. \n\nThis game is great.

The story telling is really interesting, a mix of fae lore, various well known fictional characters (Victor Frankenstein?!), and a lot of environmental storytelling.", "timestamp_created": 1708807316, "timestamp_updated": 1708807316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504021406173706055", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159182682": {"recommendationid": "159182682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120825746", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 4524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2674, "last_played": 1709173945}, "language": "english", "review": "The game starts out slow and there is a lot of story thrown at you in the beginning.

Sadly it falls short in so many ways.\n\nBase building is something that I love and the idea of finding an ideal spot in one of these three biomes to call home was exciting! Unfortunately the unlocking progress of the building schematics is slow and leaves you playing for hours with crude stone and wood structures. Each unlock is somewhat rewarding but few and far between. When you start to progress the game and acquire new recipes you are too busy grinding materials to upgrade gear and work stations that redesigning your base is just another chore at that point. You dont even unlock them all at once, its piece mill and you dont know what you will get as a reward or if you will even get one.\n\nCombat is a joke, nothing is threatening and the enemy AI is broken to the point they dont even try and attack you half the time. When they do, hit boxes are so broken they usually miss you and get stuck. If game progression did not require you to upgrade and achieve new gear scores to continue there would honestly be no reason to do it. \n\nThe worlds are big and empty. There are three major things you will do when you find a POI:\nAid- Help NPC finish a building and sometimes you havent even unlocked the proper materials to help them so then you just have to walk away. Nothing you can do there so its honestly useless.\nOccupation- Kill the enemies that hold the POI\nPuzzle/Tower- Its a mix of enemies spawning and simple puzzles that are not fun at all.\n\nServer loading is bad, I have a good PC and SSD, and still takes forever to load a game up or move from one realm to another. Its so bad. I can not stress this enough, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE BAD INTERNET. I have 200MB spectrum and it still takes 2-5 min for you to transition worlds. Why they made the dedicated server choice is beyond me. I Do like that my friends can still visit my realm when im not online but it is not worth the load times and issues this causes.\n\nOver all this game is really just boring, and that is the worst thing for a game to be. Nothing about it is entertaining.

The building/exploration/survival genre isn't new and I don't know why whoever is in charge thought you didnt have to meet minimum expectations with your game systems. Inventory and storage is about as crude and basic as they come. If you started a game and your friends started a game and you want to play with them, but you dont live together at the same base its an absolute nightmare of running to each other and long loading screens to do anything.

Aesthetically, its glorious and still has a lot of elements that should make it refreshing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've never encountered a game that is so incredibly adamant that I don't play it. I have a high-end rig, most games are played breezy on Ultra.  I have a dedicated connection and yet, the game won't connect to the realm with any sort of consistency. Multiple crashes back to the lobby are in store for me any time I try to log in. This is an EA game, I'm aware, so I tried to be patient with it because I've been following it for close to a year.  Multiple disconnects wouldn't be a big issue if that was the only thing: the game encounters game breaking bugs immediately following a disconnect, such as the escape key no longer functioning to exit menus. So, if you encounter a disconnect, it might as well drop you onto the desktop because the bugs require a full reset to fix. \r\n\r\nThat's one issue on top of others, the primary ones being that all of the cool stuff in the trailers doesn't exist until you invest a ton of hours gritting through the bugs, disconnects and low-content walking simulator that happens.

The graphics are beatiful due to Unreal Engine 5 but the assets are poorly implemented into the game. The most interesting locations have no integration into the game world. The design is very intrecate in some ways and very simple in others. \n\n[h1]Crafting[/h1]\n\nCrafting is complex and interesting but also annoying. No crafting from containers which is industry standard by now. Many interwoven conditionals like proximity to X or being exposed to Y while crafting make it an unholy mess. The game loop is very short and gets boring fast. Go to Fae tower. Kill the mobs there. Do some simple puzzle somewhere. Get essence. Go Home. Repeat. This would be fine I guess if the combat wasn't so simple and uninteresting. The attack and move sets are just the Unreal Engine 5 basics. Magic is practically non existant. Crafting the base item has some novelty to it. Using different materials to craft something gives the items different attributes. This is also very inconsistent. Some do what they are supposed to do others just don't do anything. But you don't know what works until you craft it and your materials are gone. After that the upgrade system is very simple. Apart from some guns the weapons you have at the beginning are what you have in the end game. Just with higher titem level. Typical bigger number better. This is difinetely wasted potential. Then there are the charms, enchants and infusions. These are fine but give the player less choice then you would think. Many can apply to only one specific item. Their description is lacking and does not tell you for which item they are or even what they do for some. So you end up crafting a lot of stuff you can't even use or don't want to since this slot is already filled. Items themselves can't be modified in their basic makeup. So if you have upgraded your item to a state where you want it and find some material - say better wood/stone/ore/leather - that would make it better. Start from scratch.\n \n[h1]Game Play[/h1]\n\nThe game loop is very short and gets boring fast. Go to Fae tower. Kill the mobs there. Do some simple puzzle somewhere. Get essence. Go Home. Repeat. This would be fine I guess if the combat wasn't so simple and unterintesting. The attack and move sets are just the Unreal Engine 5 basics. Magic is practically non existant. Injuries are just annoying, have no way to fix them (so far) and just waste the players time.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]\n\nMany quests require every player to do everything. The 3D map markers have poor visibility due to the chosen colour. There seems to be no difficulty scaling for player count at all. The tutorial seems to be single player only and even parts of the later quests encourage you to build seperately at first. Weird choice.\n\n[h1]Art direction and graphics[/h1]\n\nThe game is really beautiful. UE5 is not used to its full potential but the world looks really good. Art direction is all over the place. I am not sure if this is intentional or not. Most places fit the steampunk fantasy universe. Some seem a little out of place. Evil tongues may say they were just cheap in the UE asset store...\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\n\nIf you could live with everything mentioned above here comes the part that is [b]game breaking[/b]. The game runs fine most of the time. Loading times are a little long but if the game ran fine otherwise I would be ok with that. Then there are the frame drops. These can be very bad and even constant. They could be related to physics or lighting (falling trees or night time seem to make em worse). In some cases I went from a stable 60 fps down to 7fps at which point I had to fast travel home. This seems to fix the issue at least (memory leak?). [b]The servers are terrible too[/b]. Getting kicked and rolled back a few minutes is common.\n(Happened 4 times in one session. All players affected. Clearly server side). A big portion of my play time is just in the menu waiting to be able to reconnect. I had an instance crash which made me unable to play my character.

You get given the next step - and have no choice about what you do to progress and what you can craft or build. There is a LOT of grinding to get up levels. There are essential ingredients you can't get without knowing how to get them. The rewards are scant - as you progress you keep getting the same rewards for finishing minor quests - exciting at first and then ho-hum after a while. The building and crafting systems suck in general. There are beautiful POIs which seem to be begging to be used as bases, which are impossible to build to - for example - you need foundations to build anything and foundations cannot be installed to align with existing POIs. There is a complicated system for doing everything - you need reddit as your friend to figure out anything, including simple controls. And the load times! Might as well go make a cup of tea while the game loads or takes you through a portal. I'm a PC player - maybe the designers are used to developing console games for kids? It's just .... boring.\nI mean - it is early access - so reasonably priced - and I guess if you lower your expectations and have reddit on speed dial you'll have some fun.

There's a lot of content, plenty to see and explore even now. If this were the 1.0 release, I would agree with the negative reviews, but as Early Access, I vehemently disagree.\n\nPerhaps it was hindered by the fact that there were many Survival Early Access games in 2024 that were basically full releases disguised as Early Access.\n\nNightingale has a beautiful world, one of the most stunning I've ever seen to date. The card system is incredible and innovative, with huge potential for expansion. There are many things the cards do that took me many hours to realize; not everything is described on the card.\n\nThe progression is slow and challenging. This can be a positive or negative depending on your opinion. There's a lot of grind to improve gear, and the crafting system is elaborate and deep. The story is simple but very well written; the main character is very well narrated and charismatic.\n\nThe bosses are creative and interesting. There's a lot of difficulty variety depending on the cards you use and the level you select at each portal you open. The same realm can be a breeze or extremely difficult depending on your choices, with appropriate rewards for each difficulty.\n\nThe endgame feels like an MMO rather than a survival game; it's a unique and interesting blend that can be expanded upon. You don't need to pay for servers like other survival games; friends can access your realm, and you can log into it even when the realm's \"creator\" is offline, all for free.\n\nThe areas needing more attention is the combat, which is quite clumsy at the moment, and the issues with network and servers. But these are two problems the devs have already announced will be addressed.\n\nThe devs' communication is another factor deserving praise; they've already implemented improvements based on community feedback and have posted a very promising roadmap showing that most requests will be addressed in the medium term. The teasers for future content, new biomes, make me very optimistic about the game's future.

The endgame crafting of materials, despite being a chunk of peoples dislikes, is actually the biggest aspect of Nightingale I enjoy. \nSo you have to find the raw materials, all with different stats of their own, to then refine with other raw materials, to refine further, until putting all of your materials into the final product (say a knife or clothes etc.) This allows for massive diversity and range in how a single piece of gears stats will look. It actually reminds me more of Diablo or looter shooters, but instead of getting the gear with the stats you craft it yourself. I really hope they keep this structure in place because a very unique game could come out of it the further they go.\nSure it's slow, and a lot of work, but that's the point. I understand the criticisms fully, but I also think of the possibilities with this mechanic and think it sounds far better than a Victorian era Conan Exiles.\nI imagine if they went full Diablo and made the ascended realms (the harder versions currently in game) go higher and higher with increasingly better resources with diverse stats on each one.\nOr if they went more MMO and improved the Vaults to be more of an epic raid or even go Warframe with the Vaults and make them a way to fuel a power fantasy with the overpowered gear you crafted.\nOr they could go more No Man's Sky and make the randomly generated realms have more to them and be even more unique and fascinating.\nThe thing I fear though is that they backtrack and appease rather than focus on whatever their vision was, more than any game I have played in EA or tested Prerelease in probably near a decade I am excited about the potential for Nightingale, not just how fun it can/will be, or how well received it can be, but the potential to be something grand, possibly larger than itself.\nSure, it mashes a lot of other game mechanics together, but that's what games have done since the early 90's. That's how new genres are born.\n\nWith that said I would recommend this game currently, because it is fully playable and enjoyable, but only to people that enjoy slow paced, grindy, big number big damage type games - I would say 50 hours for a typical player currently and a couple hundred if you're like me and want to experience everything you can to offer feedback/personal fascination/whatever\n\nTLDR: Nightingale currently is a beautiful art piece with interesting mechanics, rough around the edges, and currently would only recommend to a niche set of people but has the potential to pave it's own niche.", "timestamp_created": 1709191440, "timestamp_updated": 1709191440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502923965454101563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159216794": {"recommendationid": "159216794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043806424", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 904, "last_played": 1709363841}, "language": "english", "review": "Nightingale is a slow burn to get into but I found that the experience was worth it.

And I can safely say I'm liking the game so far. \n\nI know there are some nasty bugs people are encountering, and the Devs have addressed some issues already. Unfortunately day one in any release is never going to be perfect for everyone. Hopefully the issues are resolved soon!\n\nBuilding is quite fun, I haven't made it out of the basic set (well I've gotten some add-ons to it from vendors), but it looks lovely even with basics. The ghost method is really nice and gives you a straight up shopping list of items you need to complete whatever building pieces you've placed down, so if you're playing with friends it makes building a breeze. \n\nMy only issue with building is that the wood and stone pieces could do with some small separation, better grouping in the menu, or clearer icons. The crude set is sort of jumbled in together, but its a mild gripe.\n\nCrafting stations have bonuses based on lighting and warmth, as well as upgrades with extra items placed nearby, somewhat reminiscent of Valheim's crafting station system, though not nearly as annoying in placement, and these items also seem to boost multiple stations. These items seem to add new recipes, though to be honest I haven't noticed some having the listed recipes and suspect that some stations might need an upgraded version, though it could be a bug, or I'm just not looking properly, some items do seem a bit more advanced. Still figuring things out!\n\nCombat is decent, I can't say it's got a wow factor to it, AI is fairly simple, though some of the enemies have some nasty attacks if you're playing on higher difficulty (I'm playing on Hard with friends, we got ourself murdered by a nasty fellow with a big sword). \n\nExploration is delightful, the world is absolutely gorgeous. The dungeons have been fun so far, puzzles, hidden loot, it really makes you explore every nook and cranny to make sure you found everything. I found a cave and thought it was just a little mining area, turns out it was full of nasties and a little portal that led to a little dungeon area once it was activated!\n\nYeah, I've been having fun, this game has alleviated some of the disappointment of recent releases for me at least.

I also think the augments idea is neat in theory (though the execution is poor).\r\n\r\nHowever, it does not deserve a recommendation at this time.\r\n1. The biggest reason overall: Gear Score. You unlock areas by equipping better items which raise some abstract number called a gear score. However, the game only tells you the gear score requirement for the first area restricted in this manner. The rest are simply locked away with no explanation. I dunno who green lit this idea, but it's definitively not fun.\r\n2. The instructions for completing various objectives are not immediately apparent, and need refining. When walking past a challenge, you receive a journal entry describing the goal of a given challenge. However, this occurs when they are not registered on the map, leaving the player to guess what they are looking at. Additionally, some aspects are never described, such as hitting buttons via a slingbow.\r\n3. Climbing picks are useless. They eat up stamina so fast at the base level, there is zero advantage to using them.\r\n4. Unlocking recipes is a chore. Scavenge materials just to destroy them then hike back to a shop with random stuff that may or may not be what you need. The same item used as currency is also used to repair items, which wear down constantly. It's an inflated time sink.\r\n5. The augmentations aren't cohesive. They work as follows: build a crafting station, then build a decorative item to unlock recipes. Cool idea...but why do the bellows unlock recipes for the sewing bench and not the smelter??? They can't attach through walls either, so there's no way to fudge cohesive decor while still gaining the proper functions.\r\n\r\nFor a game which has spent so long in development, it feels surprisingly \"same-y\" compared to other survival games.

It has a lot of things going for it, and maybe my favorite is the hosted servers. \n\nTypically survival games are hosted locally (your friend needs to be online to be able to play on the server they're hosting), or dedicated servers hosted privately that usually assumes some fee or maintenance requirement. In Nightingale, the servers are hosted for us by Inflexion (the game studio) and you can join and play on the same realm regardless of who's online.\n\nJust following the main quest of Nightingale took me about 80 hours of casual gameplay to reach the end of the story (theres a bunch more of content  after the story). \n\nThe main gameplay loop is awesome. You go through a few tutorial realms and end up in a safe realm to get your footing (and begin to meet up with friends if you want); this is where your main base(s) will be. At this point you're free to do what you want, but a main quest will guide you through progression in typical survival game style. The main idea in Nightingale is you craft some gear, explore a new realm, return home to clear a point of interest which unlocks a more challenging realm up to a point where the story takes you to a main hub. This is technically the end of the story, but it gets a lot harder with the content that's opened up after this. All along the way there are puzzles, and objectives all over the maps giving you plenty to do. \n\nThe crafting system is insanely good. Every single material that you use to craft with contributes towards the crafts stats. It's my favorite crafting of any game I've ever played. Enough said.\n\nThe building system is solidly designed. Theres a cap to how many objects you can place down, but its sufficient enough to give you room for creativity, and the cap is only limited per realm, so you could have multiple bases to bypass the cap. There's some more intricacies to the system. All in all it's nothing too inventive, but its well implemented and what you would expect from a survival game.\n\nThe combat is actually pretty fun, to the point where you're using all your tools differently based on situation. When im clearing a group dungeon, I'm switching between multiple tools for mobility, damage, healing, etc and it feels pretty fluid.\n\nAll this being said, the game is still in EA, so there are some challenges. There can be occasional disconnects (due to popular demand, they're looking into an offline mode), the UI is a little tedious in some places, follower AI is basic, placeholder assets very apparent on item thumbnails, personally i get framerate drops a lot (but im on an ancient pc and havent bothered looking into the graphics settings much), and the game overall has a few areas to polish off. It has a solid foundation and incredible potential.\n\nTLDR: Game is great, has a lot of potential and I'll likely be playing and coming back to this game frequently, but if you can't handle a few Early access headaches (nothing gamebreaking) you may want to wait until it's on sale or a few kinks get worked out.

The idea is cool and there is alot going for it in regards to the worlds/environments with a unique victoria/steam punk thing going on. However, it plays like a prettier version of the original 7 days to die. The AI is atrocious and you can tell that the studio lacked somebody that knows what they are doing and ended up with enemies that run at you stop, swing, repeat. The animations are very crude. Doors literally have to static states open/closed and dont actually even have an animation for opening. (Yea I know seems weird to call out but it's just an easy example of where they cut corners.) Same issue for trees being cut down and you get this cheesy and low effort animations for something that you will spend a good amount of time doing.\n\nThis coupled with their extremely poor choice to make it always online and using what I can only assume is some of the cheapest server providers they could find make for numerous performance issues and just all around poor gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1708608545, "timestamp_updated": 1708608545, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502427160739898682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159576723": {"recommendationid": "159576723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054838506", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4709, "last_played": 1709502982}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're wondering why this game has a low review score, it's pretty simple to say: this is a tried and true early access game, and people are not used to \"early access\" actually meaning \"early access.\" It's a game in its early stages, and there is going to be a lot of unpolished portions of the game. I know some games use the \"early access\" tag for funsies (looking at you Ark Survival), but this isn't one of those games.\n\nWith that said, is this game good? Absolutely. This game is fantastic. The foundation of this game is insane, and will absolutely lead you to know that its future - as long as they continue on this path - is going to be something even greater. \n\nSo what's so good about it? \n\nThe world: the environment, the story, the aesthetics... they're immaculate. The gaslamp/victorian/edwardian-vibe mixed with a magical twist has created something breathtaking. Look at screenshots & gameplay, and you'll see it in the skybox, in the enemy art. It's beautiful, and it's just the beginning. \n\nThe gameplay loop: the loop for this survival game is unique and interesting. You go through procedurally generated realms to unlock & obtain what would otherwise be limited resources. The combination of the type of realms that you can enter and raze are many, and they've already stated they'll continue to add more and more overtime. \n\nThe combat: the combat could use some polish (as magic is experiencing some limitations at the moment) but it is satisfying. You can get heart shots, which are even more potent than head shots. You can use magic, guns, and melee weapons, and will need to switch to better deal with enemy strengths/weaknesses. \n\nThe story: this game has, perhaps, some of the best writing I have seen in a long time. The story is profound, and has many twists and turns that keeps you on your toes. The fantasy it sets is a refreshing take on steampunk, and you'll see some familiar names from history riddled throughout. You'll be able to read journal entries that tell the tale of the final days of its writer, the beauty of a marriage between Fae & Human, the strife of the Fae Courts, the horrors of the unknown, and so much more. The writing casts such a wide net so quickly, that I worried it may have been too much too quickly. But they do so well in explaining and keeping things together. Pay attention, you'll find sometimes that not everything is as it seems. \n\nTHE DEVS: These are the most quick-to-address devs I have seen in an early access. They listen to the population and have consistently said \"We've heard you, and now we're working on it.\" They're active, they're doing what they said they'd do, and I give them so many props for that. \n\nAlright, so what needs help?\n\nPolish. It doesn't have it, and it desperately needs it. From things like wonky traders, who may trade varying sets of the same armor, to trees that can lag you to high hell if you're not careful... The game has fantastic features, but they're rigid and definitely need polishing. \n\nBuilding. It looks like they're testing their servers strength by first imposing a building limit. For people who are into massive builds, you'll find that you may have to employ some tricky strats in order to get around limitations on building. To quickly tl;dr the situation with building, you can make hundreds of midsized buildings, but if you're looking to go Minecraft Mega Builder with a single building you'll need to get clever. \n\nAnd finally: it simply needs MORE. There is plenty to do now, but we need more! The early access gives you a great breadth of the game that leaves you wanting so much more, and they tease you with all the soon-to-come things, that you'll be begging for all of it now. This is where the early access part comes to bite us all. \n\nI could go on forever about this game, but overall: I love it, and I can't wait to see Inflexion grow this beautiful game into something enormous.

It is very complex in order to provide the flexibility in gameplay. But this complexity/flexibility makes the crafting for everything else too complex. I really like that you get to choose what base materials you use for the crafting of your tools/weapons and those base materials have different stats that effect the output. Same for clothing but it makes it very convoluted. I wish I would have counted the number of crafts/steps/operations that are required to make one piece of armor. I cannot think of a comparable game. It is too much. It should be only one step has the stats and the rest just are upgrade tiers. And for the rest of everything I like that you can use any material but not being able to craft from storage is a huge let down. It is comparable to when witcher 3 had mounts that auto followed the paths and now every game with mounts now has the ability to auto follow the path. Every game now has crafting from storage.\n\nWorld design seems like 75% complete. Forest/swamp biomes seem mostly flushed out. Water is 100% and better than I expect. From a day and age of procedural generation I see less than I expected. I want more diversity or at least a heavier leaning toward the fae/steampunk theme. NMS has shown how very diverse procedural generation can be and it has honestly spoiled us. This game seems like it is 65% there. The bones of it are there but just go crazy with it. There are sooo many fae/steampunk reference materials to work from. Just let the art team go wild. The desert biome is disappointing, maybe it is a texture issue for me. The swamp biome has the water too deep. Nobody enjoys constantly being slowed down. Make it ankle deep with no slow but you can still keep the wet debuff. I would also like to see card modifiers that effect landscape and not just sky boxes.\n\nDungeons/puzzles seem diverse enough but enemy variety could go a little harder. Okay a lot more variety/weapon usage and fae/steampunk theme.\n\nI am fine with the text based NPCs but I would love some more voice acted NPCs to make me feel more. There is a lot of dreary ambiance and I would like that changed up with mysticism and more of the cowboy steampunk.\n\nCompanion AI is meh. We need to have a few instructions to give them to be useful.\n\nThe multiplayer is fine but two estate stones or a co-op stone would be nice so you can do a solo base and work on a co-op base.

The game\u2019s gaslamp fantasy setting is a breath of fresh air, offering a unique blend of Victorian aesthetics with a magical twist. As a Realmwalker, I\u2019ve traversed through various realms, each teeming with its own set of challenges and wonders.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\n\r\nThe survival crafting mechanics are robust, encouraging exploration and creativity. Gathering resources feels rewarding, and the crafting system is intuitive yet deep, allowing for a wide range of structures and tools to be created. The realm cards add a strategic layer to the gameplay, giving me control over the portals and the type of biomes I want to explore.\r\n\r\nVisuals and Audio:\r\n\r\nVisually, Nightingale is a mix of the intriguing and the peculiar. The character creator is impressively detailed, and the environments are beautifully rendered, though some textures and models can appear inconsistent at times. The audio, especially the voice acting of characters like Puck, adds depth to the world, though the lack of voice acting for some NPCs is noticeable.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n\r\nIn its Early Access state, Nightingale shows great potential with its captivating world and solid core mechanics. However, it\u2019s not without its rough spots. The game can swing between being aesthetically pleasing and outright jarring, and making meaningful progress can sometimes feel laborious.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\r\n\r\nNightingale is a game of fascinating contradictions1. It\u2019s a world of magic and manufacturing that has captured my imagination and provided countless hours of entertainment. The game stands out with its unique setting and strong core mechanics, but it still has room to grow and polish during its Early Access period23.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, Nightingale is a promising title that offers a compelling experience for fans of the survival crafting genre. With further development and community feedback, it has the potential to become a standout game that offers both beauty and challenge in its lamp-lit realms.\r\n\r\nRating: To be determined (Early Access)\r\n\r\nEmbark on your own adventure in Nightingale and discover if it lives up to your dreams of a fantastical, lamp-lit escapade.", "timestamp_created": 1710115586, "timestamp_updated": 1710115586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074658870697021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160298336": {"recommendationid": "160298336", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969819656", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8805, "last_played": 1710521079}, "language": "english", "review": "great game!", "timestamp_created": 1710113227, "timestamp_updated": 1710113227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074658870697021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159187619": {"recommendationid": "159187619", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974983045", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 625, "last_played": 1708811005}, "language": "english", "review": "Not perfect, but better than Enshrouded or Palworld.", "timestamp_created": 1708811270, "timestamp_updated": 1708811270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158923550": {"recommendationid": "158923550", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975275283", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1709337363}, "language": "english", "review": "Having the time of my life.

Well wasn't i impressed from the first moments of voice acting and the more i played the more i found depth in the systems from the crafting of items with varying quality materials resulting in not only different stats from crafting the same axe recipe twice example but getting different stats AND looks due to different wood used for the handle or different metal for the axe head. This reminds me somewhat of Star Wars Galaxies where materials had their own varying stats and would contribute towards crafted items overall stats. This also makes it fun when playing with others and comparing appearance and stats of the same items.\r\n\r\nThat;s just one aspect of customisation in this game, the other is the breathtaking graphics and familiar but alien realms. You can travel to different realms and set different levels for those realms as you create them at a portal, but not only that, you can play extra cards at Realmic Transmuters that change aspects of a realm and you can do this in realms you're visiting, but you can also do this in your home realm where you build your house! There's such a wide variety of conditions to cast on the realm, my favourite is the Trickster card, but i won't spoil it for you. I'm also currently using the Industrial card which increases ingot and ammunition yields, but turns the sky smoggy brown. It's all so much fun!\r\n\r\nThe creatures are also very cool, there's lots of puzzles and variations in the points of interest you come across and there are pacifist and aggressive paths to take for questing.

It's a survival builder game, so there's not much to say there; it's like pretty much all the rest in that respect.  The game really shines in its Realm mechanics.  Each Realm is a different, procedurally-generated, self-contained world.  The various cards used in defining the various Realm are where the magic happens.  Each changes some aspect of the Realm, such as the Feast card adding stamina regeneration speed, reducing hunger, and making food last longer per use.

If they get the frequent disconnects figured out then my review would move from negative to fairly neutral. I will never understand the fascination with always online games that would otherwise be fine single player or small party experiences these days. If I want to play a game like this one alone or with my friends, I don't want the added constraint of needing to have a solid connection to some third party's servers. If I want to be playing alone and I cannot because of an outage or something similar that's downright infuriating.\n\nThe build system WOULD be good, except for the hard limits on build objects. I get that they have limited server resources and that since they are hosting all these online realms they have to find a way to limit server size. I feel like the pretty straightforward way of doing that would be to let players host their single player games client side and continue to feel befuddled by their choices in that regards, but given the game they seem to be trying to make it still means that I cannot make the beautiful elaborate castles shown in some of the 'in game footage' on the steam page, much less the kind of grand designs I typically come to games otherwise like this one for. \n\nThe combat is fun and feels good, and progression works in a way that I feel is rewarding, if I hadn't lost a bunch of things to disconnects I would have no complaints, but as it stands... well... I'd like to be clear that I have quite fast and very reliable internet.

Was it ready to come out of the cooker, maybe not so much.  Can it recover from the extremely unfinished state and some of the devs gameplay decisions?  Remains to be seen.\nPROS:  This is a gorgeous game.  What they have built, the ruins, that which flufffs out the story line, very nice.  No lag for me but am only solo.  The concept is novel and the story interesting.  Puck's a hoot and well done.  Critters so far are pretty nice looking, don't act goofy and do silly stuff like spin on their heads or fall over and otherwise look unprofessional.  The music is nice if forgettable.  \nACCEPTABLE:  Combat is adequate if not a bit chaotic.  It's a lot of whack-a-mole, dead, next?  Some of the speed animations could use a little work but crazy fast hippos are a hoot.  The fact enemies seem to have no collision is on the edge of cons.  Puzzles though novel idea are boring after the third one and you will do dozens if not hundreds and that neatly brings us to ...\nCONS:  Don't get me wrong, I love survival games, all the things that happen between dropped naked and afraid to well developed strong survivor, lord over them all.  NG though made/led by a team of pros with some real money behind them from Tencent just feels like they don't quite know what they're doing and who their audience is.  If this was 4 guys in a garage then a lot more could be shrugged off and more slack given, but it's not and I worry that with its rough start they may not have the heart for the long haul.  And it will be a long haul.  \nRewards in this game are stingily given out.  You meander around far too long in rags, living in a hovel.  No need for immediate gratification, but a bit more would be nice.  Building is interesting but their is a hard limit that makes it difficult to even make what you need solo, much less in a group.  It might end up being good but right now (and even with a LOT of complaints) not a peep from the devs.  It's a killer.  \nCrafting:  Someone went to a lot of work to set up their system but then they just went ham and made the most confusing, overbloated, goofy system I have seen in 20 years.  There are a few who love it to death but they are from the old days of OA and really get off on spreadsheets, lists, and do not want it to change.  Everyone else suffers through it in various stages of exhaustion.  It's mostly the augments but secondarily it's piles of mats that don't stack with infinitesimal differences and make for inventory nightmareville.  Crafting from chests is coming, which will be of some small help.  But it's just too much.  Watch Skill Ups review.  He speaks well to the game and its issues.  \nLast but not least is the actual game loop itself.  It's EA so it's not complete, but it's pretty repetitive and if you have seen a biome once, you have seen it forever, X 8 levels X 3 biomes atm.  That little squirrel on the wheel, that will be you.  \nLastly, if you watch the trailer and think that is the game you will play you might be pretty disappointed.  Since it started as an MMO and morphed into a survival game, that might be the cause.  It feels more like live service and upcoming dlcs and cash shop kind of game than maybe a survival game as we know it.  Is that bad?  Well it does feel a little bait and switchy at times as in hour 40 I was still in rags hanging out in my hovel.  Even now, being old and slow, am still dressed in better clothes that are only minimally holey.  Where is that red dress with matching parasol and hat?   \nIf money is no object and you understand where this game is, how EA works, go for it.  If times are tough or your expectations can't be controlled, wait 6 months to a year.\n\n200 hours in - Oh Mama, take me home.  The game has just become so pointless.  I have come to truly hate the crafting system with a bloody passion.  We have three realms and they are pretty unchanging, just with a few color differences.  Other than that it's like groundhogs realms, over and over and over.  There is just nothing new and fresh.  Haven't quite gotten to end of where game is now, I just don't have the heart for it.  Must not be the only one because the numbers are crashing.  Most survival games, what makes them fun is the sandbox atmosphere, the replayability.  This one, not so much.  You are marched along a linear path but since there's not much to distract you, that's kind of ok but not the genre.  This game wants to MMO and survival but does neither well, and have I mentioned the crafting/augmentation system?  lol  Sad times.

I'll start off by saying I desperately want to like this game and genuinely hope the feedback and early access cash infusion happening right now translates into more fruitful development. There are a lot of great ideas and potential I am sincerely excited about. But Nightingale needs a LOT more time in the oven before before I expect I'll be able to feel optimistic or pessimistic about its ability to rise to that potential. This isn't 'early access' as we've come to experience it in the last ~4 years. It feels like ***EARLY*** access.\n\nSpoilers to follow:\n\nI'd like to focus more on what the initial experience was like, what worked and what didn't, and then what I would hope to see added or changed in future versions of the game, and less on the aspects that are inherent to the 'Early Access' status, like janky animations, or the immature crafting and progression systems.\n\nThe tutorial process was fine, pretty smooth. Character creation is currently meaningless. The family history aspect of creating your character either needs to be streamlined and made more impactful down the line (like on your stats, or maybe some story beats?), or just cut in favor of something more straightforward that can achieve the same visual results.\n\nThe Fae dimension-Stargate system with the Realm Cards has so much potential. Each realm you open a portal to is finite in size, but still decently large, and has a small degree of procedural generation. But currently there is not enough variety, of anything, to take full advantage of this setup. Realm traits, like the topography, numbers of creatures and enemies, types of sites and puzzles... are all going to need a great deal more diversity. No Man's Sky in 2016 suffered from this, but eventually iterated its way up to something that is way more fun to explore. I see no reason Nightingale can't get there, but it's going to take iterating on the bones. Everything currently looks and feels too much the same, regardless of what cards you use to spice things up.\n\nThe best example I have is when I first jumped into the Desert Herbarium level realm, and realized I could not access the next story character without adequate climbing picks and stamina to make the climb. Everything before that point had just been \"find icon on map, walk there\" level of challenging. That made work I had done previously feel meaningful, instead of just filler. Nightingale needs more progression obstacles and solutions like this. It could really fill out how much exploration and play time you get per realm you visit, instead of just popping in, raiding it for every resource you can, buying all the recipes from a vendor or two randomly dropped in the map, and then never going there again.\n\nA handful of quick ideas on this topic before moving on: Maybe vendors don't show up in the Realm until you've done some objectives and built a base of operations. Reconnect some portals so they can find you, and have a safe place to show up, THEN you can have their recipes/knowledge as part of the reward loop. The instanced 'dungeons' that are found in some realms could be expanded and diversified, and maybe opening those portals to do that content is gated by some realm-specific crafting which isn't difficult, but encourages exploration. Gating things behind tool upgrades for resources you can't harvest until your tool is a certain level feels very outdated, and not adequate alone. It could take a Zelda:TotK approach and let crafting certain equipment be part of the exploration progression. Generated ravines that you need the right equipment to get across, creatures you need materials from that need a special lure, a gatekeeper who needs three very specific items before letting you pass, which you can read about in the lore drops found around the world... just more. More variety, more obstacles to solve, more ways to solve them.\n\nThe building system shines because of the 3d blueprint feature. This should be supported down the line with more cosmetic building component options, and less grueling crafting queues/times to get higher level building materials. Just like with Enshrouded, there is currently no real threats to your bases, so materials are essentially just cosmetic. A roof made of sticks keeps the rain off just as well as stone, or fancier materials. Creating reasons to build forward bases and benefits for going deeper into the build trees will be beneficial.\n\nThe boss fights are currently a pretty low point to the experience. These need work to even bring them up to Valheim's level of boss encounter enjoyability, though it would be amazing if they ended up feeling closer to Remnant II's boss encounters.\n\nThe crafting system gets pretty complex, and for many, very tedious. I don't personally mind a complex crafting system, especially if I have sight of some great goals it will eventually get me to, like access to higher level realms, more challenging combats, or really amazing cosmetic build options. But using No Man's Sky as an example again, there is a balance to be struck with a complex crafting system that has many different items. It can feel rich and full of options, or just a tedious drag. Getting this right is probably going to take a lot of testing and iteration.\n\nI'm never going to want to reach the end game as the trailers depict right now if the game is repetitive and works against engagement. Nightingale needs to do its best to not re-tread tired mistakes that the Survival genre has been making since inception, and seize on the \"what's over the horizon?\" feeling, along with \"I want to live there!\", or better yet \"I want to live there with my friends.\"\n\nI will look forward to jumping back in to see how Nightingale progresses, but I think I'm probably mostly done for the time being.

I would hold off until these issues have been resolved. I think you can boil down the problems to two main categories: networking and crafting.\n\nThis is an online-only experience, and one of the worst I've ever played in that regard. I have never seen loading screens this long in any generation of gaming. Sometimes when I initially load the game, it takes upwards of three minutes to actually load me into the realm. There is either something seriously wrong with how the game loads assets, the path my computer takes to communicate with their servers, or the servers themselves. Perhaps all of the above.\n\nNetwork-related issues don't stop once you've loaded into a realm, either. You will frequently encounter significant freeze-ups or stuttering when mining or chopping lots of trees down; for whatever reason, the server doesn't seem to handle this very well. During these times my framerate is not dipping whatsoever. Enemies often just straight-up miss you as long as you are walking backwards and diagonally due to network lag. It's a real shame because I don't think the combat is nearly as bad as the server sync issues portray, but when you run into fast charging hippos that are rubber-banding all over the place and nearly impossible to hit as a result, it makes you want to just ignore them and do something else.\n\nYou are going to repeatedly be jumping between realms to complete quests, gather realm-specific materials, or head back to your main base to drop off loot and craft better gear. You can only have one main base and thus only one spot where you can fast travel at a time, so it's pretty much required that you build your base near the NPCs of that realm if you don't want to walk for several minutes just to buy items or do quests. And going back to the comment about loading screens, since you only have one base, you'll have to sit through twice as many loading screens every time you need to pick up or drop something off (these are usually shorter than the initial loading screen, but still take thirty seconds to two minutes each time). To a small credit, I have thus far not been disconnected from the server even once in 40hrs. Whether or not just being disconnected would've ameliorated some of the weird issues is another story.\n\nThe other major issue with the game is the crafting system. It is a convoluted mess. There are more different materials and items here than I've seen in most other survival games. It almost reminds me of an overly-modded Terraria, minus the ability to have any quality-of-life storage to mitigate the bulk of the confusion. You have different composite materials, material types, material tiers, even different version of materials such as those with ingots. There is no visual differentiation between any of these items at a glance from within your storage. Even worse, many of the materials have no unique icon to begin with, instead sharing a placeholder 'N' stamp symbol, meaning you need to hover over each individual item with these placeholders until the tooltip pops up to inform you what the item actually is.\n\nMost of the recipes involve crafting some obscure material from another bench, which as it turns out requires some other obscure material obtained from another bench to craft said bench, and the recipe utilizes some incredibly vague wording to not-quite clue you in as to what it means you need to acquire, so then you have to give up and tab out to look it up online instead of checking the in-game guidebook or search functions (which absolutely suck btw, because networking hiccups often cause the search bar to become just briefly unresponsive long enough to make the game thing you're trying to change menus instead of type in the search box)\n\nYou will receive tons of augments, which are basically furniture/decorations that grant certain recipes to your crafting stations. As it turns out, the game gives you more of these than you can use per station, meaning you'll have to remove some to utilize others. This is a pretty stupid and meaningless limitation that just adds to the fu\u00adcking-you-around element that crafting is.\n\nThere are other issues, such as the bizarre flickering on every single surface when you move. I don't know what causes it, but it's probably my runner-up for third worst issue that occurs way too often and doesn't seem to resolve itself until you reboot the game entirely and sit through another several minutes of loading screens.\n\nYour NPC survivor/recruit follower is impossible to control and does whatever it wants, when it wants, sometimes to great detriment. Giving it an axe before clearing the entire area around your base of trees is a miserable experience, giving it a hammer seems to make it actually damage your base, giving it any type of precious wood that happens to double as a fuel source (because you weren't being screwed with enough) causes the stupid fu\u00adcker to beeline to any campfire you come within proximity of (and don't think avoiding building a campfire will prevent this, because there are prebuilt campfires littered throughout every realm) and promptly chuck all your burnables into the furnace. It is incapable of using ranged weapons. As useless and annoying as this all sounds, your personal idiot is unfortunately indispensable for its lack of weight limit, meaning it can carry full stacks of heavy materials for you without issues.\n\nOverall, Nightingale is not worth it at the moment.

Unfortunately, Nightengale falls into the bad category. I admit that I had some decent expectations for this game, so I guess I am reminded to temper those hopes when it comes to EA releases.  \n\nIn it's current state Nightengale is extremely grindy and repetitive. After reaching the Gloom site of power,  I feel like I am repeating the exact same excecise over and over since unlocking Astrolabe. It's really f'n boring and not at all fun. I think another 6-8 months of developing more content will fix this. \n\nI absolutely hate the Augment mechanic for crafting...my base is basically a square lined with crafting/refining tables on every wall, with most of the Augments (and there are MANY) in a pile in the middle of the room. Some of the smaller Augments fit nicely on the shelving units, but I really hate the larger ones like the CANNON. I feel like I'm constantly having to move either Augments or crafting tables around so the recipe I want to craft actually shows up. \n\nI appreciate the aesthetics of the game, but I feel like I my starter clothes looked much better than most of the clothing sets I have unlocked thusfar. I think combat and animation could also use some more work as currently things seem rather clunky. \n\nTLDR; I cannot recommend Nightengale in it's current EA state.

I woulda still given it a yes.  Its fun, there's a lot here to enjoy, and while there was certainly some work in progess stuff, it seemed to be going in the right direction.\n\nToday's patch however has made the game unplayable for a stupid, easily avoidable reason if the people patching it had done even 30 seconds of testing.\n\nSwinging a tool to harvest something damages your tool more than whatever you've harvested is worth (in terms of essence dust) meaning you can't actually keep your tools in repair anymore.\n\nApparently this doesn't matter for those players who have already blitzed to end game content, there's a \"use your high tier essence\" workaround.  If anything this makes the situation worse. \n\nThis sort of short sightedness for something this basic kinda ruins my confidence in this team for the long haul.  There's game breaking bugs at the moment, connectivity issues, progression blockers, etc.  (which is fine, its early access!) but instead of addressing these serious issues they decide let's just crank up the repair cost to about 100x what it needs to be to make players struggle/grind more.  And since there's no private servers, offline play, etc. you can't even tweak off the nonsense punishment mechanics (seriously, who wants to do a corpse run in a single player game?  what's the point of that?).   I tolerated it because the game was fun, but running around picking up grass with my bare hands to repair my tools is just stupid.  It is no longer fun.\n\nIts a real shame, because this game has lots of potential.  But priorities do not seem aligned.

Nightingale is a game with a design that mistakes tedium for content and difficulty, it is neither. Base crafting is okay, it is the type where the structure pieces are prefab and you do your best to make something interesting out of it, to me it is a lot like Pal World in that sense. The realms are to damn big with no sensible way to cross them except to run so I hope you like running simulators.\r\n\r\nThe gear score system feels so out of place in a survival/base building/crafting game that for me it was sort of jarring. Here is the loop you will run multiple times over multiple difficulties that unlock once you \"complete\" the lower one...you craft or buy a card. You put that and another card of your choosing in the portal. The realm opens, you run immediately to the fae tower and complete some silly, elementary school level puzzle and then the whole map opens. You need these things called \"essence\" that come in tiers so you are sort of forced to RUN across the entire map doing more trivial puzzles, building someone else's house or mopping up remedial reading level AI.\r\n\r\nThe crafting is probably the part I dislike most, it is just raw tedium for the sake of it. Want to craft something? Well you better get ready because you won't be doing it anytime soon if it is the first time. You will have to gather mats, buy the recipe and then craft several other benches so that you can then gather the mats to craft other mats that you need to make the mats that you need to make your item...no I am not kidding.\r\n\r\nI will watch this game closely as I love the STEAMPUNK(wtf even is magic(k) <--- there is no K in magic core?) ascetic and the idea of playing in the Fae but right now it just feels like my time is not respected and a bunch of low effort crap was jammed together thinking people would be to stupid to notice it.", "timestamp_created": 1709696278, "timestamp_updated": 1709696278, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500941634178161621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159943942": {"recommendationid": "159943942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002365335", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1223, "last_played": 1709384095}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely disapointed from this.

Everything in the game feels like a chore, which is kind of a staple of this genre, but instead of the staple dopamine hit you get when completing the chore, I just feel aggravated it took as long as it did.\n\nChopping down a tree takes forever, then you have to wait for it to fall, and then wait for the server to catch up and generate the Wood bundles that are supposed to appear, then you have walk around and pick them each up.  It makes the most basic component of a survival crafting game a time-consuming, irritating experience.\n\nThe vibes of the game are very very cool though. I like that there is some story involved.

I don't understand the negative reviews, when they have not played through the game.\n\nIt is early access, please give them some room.   I come from 4000 hours of Rust, play, and yes I find the controls different.   However there is probably good reason for it, being the depth of the crafting.   There is also a visualization of what you are building, before it is completed, which is completely different from other games I have played.\n\nAfter playing now over 10 hours, and dealing with some frustration of the controls, the potential depth of the game begins showing itself.   I look forward to further discovery.   The path is not obvious.   It will be interesting, where it goes with the elemental inputs into each manufactured item.    What potentially goes in, has an effect on the end product.   This could get very interesting, which therefore will contribute to a depth of play. \n\nI have now played almost 30 hours.   The game keeps getting better as you understand it.   Yes the crafting is complex.   But that is part of the fun.   \n\nAlso the multiple worlds to access by cards, looks promising, but I have not investigated that far yet.    Multiple worlds, equals different depths of difficulty.   Different depths of difficulty, equals development of character at your own pace.\n\nI think the developers have put some thought into the game, leaving it open ended in terms of directional character development.  \n\nTo get away from the same old, same old, games you have to create mystery.   That element is here.   A story is of no use, if you can figure out the ending before you are finished.    A game is of no use, if it is the same as the last one you have played.     This game is different, I look forward to continuing playing it for some time. \n\nI therefore highly recommend the game.   There is quality and quantity here, to keep you entertained.\n\nOne example a solution for some of the complaints.   My backpack and carry weight is so small.   This is now part of the character development, effected by how/what you eat, and what help you can hire/get.   There are solutions to your frustration which have been build into the development of the character.    As in real life your character does not develop without some frustration.\n\nI am now at 40 hours, and it just keeps getting better.

Please give this game a chance before just review bombing it. \n\nMINOR SPOILER AHEAD...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis game becomes somewhat of an MMO once you get close to the end of the main quest (at least, as far as they've gotten with it so far. There's still more content on the way). You'll find other players in a hub world, and go on missions with them. Most people leaving negative reviews don't make it far enough to see that part of the game, so I figured I'd put that bit in my review.\n\n\n\nThis game is in early access, and I've seen and agree with some of the complaints coming from other players. However, I think what this game has to offer varies so wildly from others that it deserves better than a \"mixed\" review status on Steam. \n\nIs it a little clunky? Yes\nIs it vague and expects you to discover things on your own? Yes\nDoes it need a little more variety? Yes\nIs there room for improvement? There always is, because nothing is perfect and everybody likes different things.\n\nThe good things going for it though? Hell, I feel like some magical Mary Poppins in the industrial revolution setting out for an expedition in a magical land. \nThe atmosphere of the game is relaxing and satisfying just being present in. \nThe music is good and sets the tone for the type of experience the devs expect you to glean from this gem. \nThe crafting, albeit bulky and a little too spaced out, is good and provides some fresh takes on a genre that is full of same-old same-old. I get a kick out of watching my crafting stations use magic to get a task done, amongst other positives.\nI love the blend of 1800's steampunk and ancient civilization this game pulls off.\nThe combat, even though it's a bit wonky, feels like there's a big potential behind it that could really tip the scales on what we expect from games.\n\nNightingale has room to grow, and I expect it to do just that. I haven't put much time in yet, but I feel drawn in. It's an experience that probably isn't right for everyone, but to me it feels like I'm playing a magical version of Bioshock with the serenity of No Man's Sky. \n\nTo those worried about it being an online only game, they are working on an offline mode. Their vision for this game is to be a universe of interconnected realms, where you can visit your friends realms through portals and take on new realms together.

This lack of clarity and organization hinders user experience.\n\nRepetitive World Design:\n\nThe world design suffers from repetitiveness. Similar layouts, including identical cracked walls across different biomes and levels, dampen the sense of exploration and discovery.\n\nCharacter Annoyances:\n\nCertain characters, like Puck, are annoying and condescending, detracting from the overall enjoyment. Additionally, the companion AI, Perry, consumes valuable resources unwisely, further frustrating players.\n\nEngaging Mechanic:\n\nThe ability to modify environmental variables through card selection across biomes offers an engaging and dynamic gameplay element.\n\nVisual Appeal vs. Gameplay:\n\nWhile the visuals are undeniably impressive, they unfortunately do not translate into equally compelling gameplay. The experience is often described as bland and lacking depth.\n\nGrindy MMO Concerns:\n\nAs an MMO, the game leans heavily on repetitive actions (grinding), which may not appeal to all players. This, coupled with the previously mentioned issues, could lead to player dissatisfaction and made me go mad.\n\nTrailer Accuracy:\n\nI think that concerns should be raised regarding the trailer's potential to mislead players.

Unfortunately the game is lacking in the department of excitement. There needs to be scarier mobs and more plentiful creatures in the fae realms. I see others calling it a chill game, but this game is far slower than that opinion. The tutorial encompasses over 2 or 3 fae realms, this should be merged into 1 realm to limit boredom. The realms are mostly empty except for deer, boars, and wolves(forest realm). The other realms are very similar to the forest realm in regards to ruins, temples, etc. It is very much a cut and paste of the forest realms. The crafting system is a slow and meticulous. It takes to much time to make anything. Building in this game seems pointless. The time it takes to make a base it will already be time to jump through another fae realm.

I play them all, including the many many in Early Access. I ran into no bugs, very little lag, my system played it completely fine. I have run many D&D campaigned based in the Fae Realms. This game is the epitome of a game for me.\n\nDo not buy this game.\n\nThis game, despite the marketing and style is barely scratching the surface of Minimum Viable Product. I played for 9 hours, and have made it through to the end of Tier 1 content (Which is actually the 3rd tier of gear and items). During my time playing 85%+ of the enemies in game have been: Bound (which lets be real are just Zombies) which are probably 60% of that number, Deer, Wolves, Pigs and Rabbits. For the remaining 15% I fought actual \"Fae creatures\": mostly Robots named after chess pieces which... I dont know maybe that's Fae but I've never read it before, Grasshoppers but bigger, a total of 6 Water Kangaroos (from the tutorial), Deer - but green and with curly fries for horns (thus Fae I guess?) and the one creature I might actually consider Fae being a Fae Elephant.\n\nThat's incredibly disappointing, they couldn't even really create a style of substance experience, in a theme that is so EASY to make stylistic.\n\nOH AND LETS GET TO THE SUBSTANCE!\n\nThe main game loop starts up really fast after you get past your first few hours of grinding basic survival stuff to get your main base going and your crafting stations online. In hind sight, I should have got this much faster if it weren't for me trying to play the game like a survival game and collecting the items. A very large bottleneck for getting stations up was turning meat into fibre to unlock all the stations. I would go around hunting animals specifically to get more and more meat, but multiple stations took 30 meat worth of fibre, and that's when I started to notice something. The number of animals and locations always spawned near a point of interest, and in the same amount, and there was only so many to farm.\n\nThen I realised that actually farming materials is not how you play this game. You need Essence, and this never changes. It is the only and single most important resource in the game, and is incredibly easy to get early game. I could buy a meat for 10 essence, and by cutting down a grass I could get enough material to turn into 6 essence per swing. Instead of 40 minutes of hunting I quintupled the amount I got in like 2 minutes. Oops, my bad for playing the game.\n\nNow onto the main game loop. Stop me if you have heard this one before: You climb a tower in an area, and it unlocks the map of the area. You then run around and do highlighted points of interest to complete either an \"intellect puzzle\", a jumping puzzle, kill 5 zombies (and it was ALWAYS zombies), defend a machine from waves of Zombies (and it was ALWAYS zombies) or turn in a bunch of wood, sticks and plant fibre to complete a building an NPC requested. This would provide you with the true material that matters: Tier 1 Essences! Its like the other essence, but you have to do these events, and its green! Yes you can also randomly get a little bit from gathering materials, but it simply was viable or a good use of your time. You need these to upgrade the item level of your gear. No other materials needed, just the essence. Better or different materials will let you make the EXACT same axe, pick, weapon, umbrella whatever, but with slightly different or better base stats, but the item level of the item is all that matters.\n\nSo, the game is climb an Ubisoft Tower, then do World of Warcraft world quests. Except they are all procedural generated BUT also extremely samey, so ... worse than World of Warcraft world quests.\n\nI tried to push the main story far enough that maybe, MAYBE This game gets better. I got to a point where I found Victor Frankenstein! OH! He was mentioned in the Trailer! This must be good!\n\nOh... he's talking about ... robots and the writing is extremely verbose, and not stylised at all... doesn't sound like the books. Sure whatever. So he talks about these Chess piece robots for at least 12 click throughs where he talks about something different than what we ask. He then of course sends me on a quest.\n\nTo kill some robots? No no no. Maybe find some plans for these robots since he was talking about figuring out how they work? No. Maybe capture one and bring it back? No.\n\nHE SENDS YOU TO KILL FUCKING ZOMBIES!", "timestamp_created": 1708826430, "timestamp_updated": 1708826430, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500554919242858887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159202398": {"recommendationid": "159202398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006790276", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 571, "last_played": 1708825666}, "language": "english", "review": "Gorgeous game, superb audio engineering, AMAZING concept and style ..UTTERLY wasted on a survival game.

If this game hadn't come out post Palworld and Enshrouded I would be a little more kind to it, but as it stands now it lacks so many QoL features and makes frankly baffling gameplay decisions. On top of the woes of Early Access bugs. \n\nPros: \n- Good aesthetic\n- Good setting\n- Vaults are a neat idea, even though they are very shallow right now\n- Using dash in the air with umbrella and veil card or soaring favor is actually so much fun. Please do more things like this. \n- Puzzles are fun at the start, but there isn't enough variety. \n- A bright future if the devs stick with it\n\nCons:\n- Trivial combat, I died once ever on Medium and that was in the Apex swamp vault at ilvl 169. Then I came back with Ice Buckshot and killed him in 3 mins. \n- Bad gear progression. I used the same gear I started with to finish the game. I didn't bother to make new sets because they come so late and the enemies are just too bad to matter. I didn't bother crafting any of the firearms besides the first shotgun and rifle, and I'm certainly not going to grind for Dauntless stuff when the enemies are such jokes. \n- Item level requirements force you to do more chores in order to earn the privilege to fight a new boss that will take you between 60 - 200 seconds because they are so trivial. Then you go back to chores. \n- Horrible UI, placeholder icons, numerous errors with tooltips, codex journal and guidebooks all use unclear language at several points. \n- Can't craft in base with materials in chest, yes palworld has spoiled me. \n- Gameplay loop consists of doing the same puzzles over and over again till you can get a card so you can do the same puzzles over and over again.\n- Outside of chores the content is very lacking compared to other titles such as Valheim, Palworld, Enshrouded, V Rising, etc, this will hopefully be improved over time. \n- As a solo I felt the content was boring at medium and hard, and then just long and boring at extreme, as a group I bet it feels even more meh. Difficulty just makes bullet sponges, it doesn't actually add gameplay difficulty. \n- Most monsters are just reskins. Boar, Bigger Boar, and Hippo all do the same thing.

I am sure you can read about that in other reviews.\n\nThese are the main issues:\n\n1) THIS IS UNFORGIVABLE. I don't understand why developers keep doing this.\nThe game requires you to be ALWAYS online even in Single Player mode, so if you have a bad connection or bad ping because you live far from the servers you will get frequent disconnections.\nI don't get ping lag, but I do get disconnected from time to time, not often but enough to be very annoying. It also takes a long time to be able to reconnect giving you various connection errors, which add to the frustration.\nAnd let's not forget sometimes their own servers fail.\nSo, if you play Single Player, forget a smooth game session, it will be filled with disconnections and re-connection problems.\n\n2) This game feels very grindy, everything takes ages to do. In Enshroud the grind is so well balanced you hardly feel it. In Nightingale you feel every bit of it.\n\n3) The Maps are soulless. The procedurally generated content is beautiful and fun at first but gets really boring after a while. Exploration gets repetitive very fast, and you will find yourself walking a lot before finding something interesting to do, which is a problem for a survival game.\n\n4) Combat is basic and clunky, not fun at all. You CAN'T even Dodge or Parry in this game, and considering you will melee most of the time, this makes fighting mobs annoying rather than fun.\n\n5) Crafting and Building in general is really interesting. However there is a major issue with structure building which makes it tedious and grindy which is the fact that you cannot move Work Stations, Building Blocks or Furniture, you need to destroy them with a weapon and rebuild it. It takes ages to build a nice and comfy looking home base. Enshrouded does it much better again.\n\nCONCLUSION\nNot an awful game, with some cool innovative ideas, but if you are on a restricted budget or have a bad internet connection I suggest you buy Enshrouded instead. Better game overall, less grindy, fun combat, better Base building, and most importantly, you won't get disconnection problems playing in SINGLE PLAYER mode.", "timestamp_created": 1708517537, "timestamp_updated": 1708517537, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500267684459686279", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159293691": {"recommendationid": "159293691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198975353990", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1527, "last_played": 1711501241}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game the Victorian vibe is really cool with all the fae, it has room for improvement, but I am so tired of getting disconnected, I play solo and I get kicked all the time.", "timestamp_created": 1708911207, "timestamp_updated": 1708911207, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500180959701538086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159009460": {"recommendationid": "159009460", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986136775", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "playtime_at_review": 313, "last_played": 1712684192}, "language": "english", "review": "So far really liking the game.

There's very little content here unfortunately. There's no PvP which could be a reason to actually have to expend resources or build defenses. Most of the content can be easily burned through at 260+ GS and then that's all... That's the gameplay loop, you're done. Maybe craft that last set of armor and weapons but even then, it's not a necessity. No endgame, no real story, no climax, wasteful \"social hub\"\n\nI wanted to like this game and I did enjoy my time with it playing Co-Op. Just don't expect a 1,000 game which it could've easily been if it was released in a much more polished state. Instead, it will drift off into the ether and be forgotten until they produce another 15-20 hours of content which will be burned through in a weeks time and then poof, gone again.\n\nSad really...

I feel like I just licked the batter of the chocolate chip cookies and got salmonella poisoning.  It's not their fault, it's mine for not waiting for waiting for the cookies to bake in the oven first.  But I'm on the toilet clearing out my colon with a stomachache. You can interpret that closing line however you want.  Point is this game needs a lot of time in the oven.\n\nThere is a great foundation here for the game.  The gunplay is definitely good.  I can see the ex-Mass Effect dev veterans here at work.  The melee needs a bit of work.  It's floaty and the hits are iffy.  Half the time I feel the hit isn't registering where I want it to.  And when it does it is rarely on center of where the crosshairs are.  They are trying for the Vermintide-style combat but it will definitely need to be a lot tighter to succeed.  I'll be honest I cannot tell if it is on my end or a consequence of their always online therefore lag.  Talking about the lag, I'm lucky enough to be on the same continent and I can feel the lag and connection issues. I definitely feel for those outside of North America.\n\nArt direction is amazing. I am a sucker for steampunk aesthetics and I'll admit it.  But you realise that with the random generation you still get a lot of reused assets and a handful of them at that.  So the novelty wears off after you've seen the same things in world one be in world 10.  Character design is questionable, the joke about fetal alcohol syndrome characters or opium addicts play very well into the Neo-Victorian era.  Clothing designs are not as plentiful as I want.\n\nCrafting is tedious but nuanced.  I get what the devs are going for as there are many layers to creating gear but they are not well explained or proper contextual information provided.  They would have Tier provided for most crafting materials but not for ore and food. Sometimes tier crafting mattered, some times it did not.  It isn't explained clearly when it does, which stats do, etc etc. A lot of it is play and figure it out as you go, but it isn't done well and intuitively like let's say Terraria.  Most of my play time was just figuring this stuff out making the game tedious to play. The nuanced part of crafting for example is crafting Desert/Forest (Desert fibre + forest thread) cloth will have different stats compared to a Forest/Desert (Forest fibre + desert thread) Cloth. So there's a lot of combinations to build your gear. It's fun but time consuming and kills you're inventory management as everything is it's own item.\n\nAnd talking about time consuming there is a lot, a lot of things that just eat time for no reason, causing my internal entertainment gauge \"fun\" slowly ticking over to \"chore\".  Crafting takes time, starting portal takes time, traversing is mostly by foot, cutting tree takes an oddly long time for it to fall, certain enemies require you to kill them for them to drop it's core (if it didn't fall through the floor 80% of the time) which you would need to break with your pickaxe to drop it's loot.  Why can it not just drop it's loot. bound enemy spawns take time.  Crafting recipes are spread out between between the 3 biomes across every major realm (read higher tier world).  ie Shotgun in desert provisioner realm, pistol in forest provisioner and rifle is in swamp provisioner realm.  You want all the firearms, go through all 3 realms.  Every little thing is tedious and time gated making the game feel like a time sink.  God forbid you are a parent with children and an hour to yourself everyday. This game is not for you.\n\nEarly access games so bugs galore and incompleteness (but it's EA you know what you're getting into).  Nothing too game breaking but it does get annoying at times. Like the enemy or enemy loot falling through the floor mentioned before. Alt+tabbing and tabbing back in disables running until you open your menu and close it again. Lots of placeholder assets in the menu so at the end game I can't tell if my components are in my inventory or not at a glance.  Some nonsensical things like Vegetable (Onion) and Onion (Onion) being separate items (they have different stats but why?). I need to scroll over all the individual items that don't have assets to figure out what it is.\n\nEnd game sounded enticing, but it ended up being what you've experienced out in the game but on a slightly bigger scale with other players.  It's the same little mini-missions/puzzles to unlock recipes outside of buying from npc vendors when you are in the realm and then you finish with a boss fight.  The netcode needs work.  Definitely experienced lag, rubber banding and disconnects when playing this mode.  Voice chat is disabled currently but there is a greyed out scroll bar leading me to believe it's available later.\n\nI want to reiterate, there is a good decent game under all of this.  I don't think it's truly worth playing right now.

I'm honestly so confused. You just got entertainment for a dollar per hour. Y'all are goofy.\n\nThis game is awesome. I'm just going to put up a counter argument for all the negative reviews I'm seeing because the review bombing is absurd.\n\n\"Game is unpolished, clunky UI, some items don't have images / descriptions\":\n\nIt's early access. You get what you pay for. Very early access at that. Buuuuut the gameplay (what matters) is still a fucking blast. The combat gets HARD the crafting feels endless. The building is solid, but that needs a little more love imo.\n\n\"TOO MUCH CRAFTING\":\n\nYou're kidding right? It's a survival game. Most people when I ask what they want in a survival game, they want a deeper crafting system than what they have. This is literally giving you what you asked for. If you want something simple, go play a bethesda or ubisoft game. \n\n\"Always online\": Yeah that does suck. You right.\n\n\"Combat is simple and easy\": \n\nMan, I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you click and swing your weapon, but are we forgetting that we have a power we can slap on each weapon / tool to open up our arsenal? Weak spots matter and feel good to hit with melee weapons too. We can slap a charm and a weapon AND craft with rare items to make our gear super unique to our playstyle as well. There are also realm cards to shift your realm into harder difficulties and change your game-play quite a bit. Lastly, it's not easy man. If you think you can just scrape by and minimal craft and rush the story, you're wrong. I got checked at GS 35 when I went in with simple gear, an upgraded axe, and a NPC survivor as my ally. Got shit on by a wizard and 2 knights. Made me go \"Oh shit, I gotta go gear up.\" And I'm a player who has beaten every soulsborne game out there. So nah, I'm not just bad lol.\n\nGuys, this game is fucking sick. It's beautiful too. If you got excited by anything I wrote here, do yourself a favor and buy the game. Worth $30.

Being kicked from my session after texting a friend (<1 minute) is very frustrating, especially when it takes 5 minutes to get back in.\r\n* - Gear locked areas and dungeons - Just let us try...
