However, upon purchasing the season pass, I discovered that there is no longer any server outside of china as opposed to pre-season pass variations of it. If you are a foreigner located outside china, you will not be able to play the online portion of the game. The ping makes it literally unplayable.

If you look at every game on my steam account, I've invested multiple thousands of hours to the open world survival genre of game. This game has base building and a really cool combat system that looks AMAZING in the trailers, however it's not possible to play this game right now, as a north american.\n\nThis was my experience - I did the tutorial (which is pretty ok not going to lie), then made my character and arrived at the main menu of the game. To my surprise I'm greeted by a video explaining that this game is a player hosted peer to peer style server based game that requires you to enter a QUEUE to join. Now here's the thing, any time you actually select a server to join, a yellow text will pop up in chinese and then it will disappear and you will not join the server you select. Doesn't matter what server you try to pick. Notice how this isn't the queue'd part. When I attempted to go into MY OWN WORLD, THAT was when I was placed into a queue, and this was a queue that would never end until I gave up and refunded the game. I waited in that queue for almost 20 minutes.\n\nThe players home instanced world should not require a queue to enter. Make it so we can go into out own worlds without a queue and MAYBE I'll rebuy this game.\n\nP.S. as a sidenote I attempted to reset my position in queue by quitting and reopening the game, but this however completely removes your ability to select which language you want to play this game in. Inside the tutorial for the game it asks if you want to play in english or chinese, but after you've completed the tutorial it NEVER asks again, and defaults to chinese and the option to change the language after the tutorial is difficult to find.\n\nI'll look at this game again in a year and see what's changed, but so far it's not looking good.", "timestamp_created": 1650133235, "timestamp_updated": 1650339085, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 270, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.827919065952301025", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113954905": {"recommendationid": "113954905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331662462", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1650543338}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: Due to recent server problems I was unable to play at all for the past several days.

That free return was ended on 5/3 and I've submitted my request on 5/1. Steam Support has kicked back my request for a couple times like they don't even know about this.  \nI know a lot of players have received their refunds but not me. Guess I fall into the unlucky group again LMAO\n-------------------------------\nREFUND REQUEST SUBMITTED as of 5/1 - I have no words and hopefully no PVE player will suffer the pain of queuing forever. I'm fine but my friend literally spent over 5 hours in queue today and still cannot get in. He was 86 hours and today as he submitted refund his gaming time has been 91 hours. Thank you developers.\n-------------------------------\nanother update as of 4/29 - I'm right on the edge of getting a refund. Game dev just doesn't care about PVE players at all. Yes, the server melting down thing isn't that bad in the past week but most of my gaming time wasted in queue. In queue FOREVER. Me and my friend took turns to wait at first and took us average about 10 min to get in. However, after the latest patch, thank you game devs, it's just impossible to get in. My total time playing was 45 hours two days ago and now is 47.1 hours but I NEVER GET IN THE GAME for once! I literally spent 2 hours in queue and still cannot get in. The worst part is that their queue design is just unbelievable. Once you are in queue, it will start counting from 1 and when it reaches to 11, it will pop a notification saying hey server full. Guess what? you have to click yes or no on the notification and start queuing again. For the past two days I'm repeating the \"wait for it get to 11, click no, start queue again\" over and over again. Hey genius devs, you do realize you can let people waiting in queue without forcing them get out and come back for another queue right? \nAnd also, just want to let everyone know that the reason they let you wait for so long is definitely not because too many players online. We tried get in queue when there's 7k/5k/3k/2k players. 2k players online only and PVE players still cannot get into the game. What a joke. I remember a few days ago when we have 20k players online we can still get in. \nI was planning to wait until May (they claimed to have a new patch for PVE players playing offline). But now after all the dramas and the poor PVE experience...trying to talk my friend out of this game too. \n-------------------------\nupdate as of 4/20 - Well my friend and I planned to finish up with our base and found out we can't access server list again. Checked discussion board and found out the game has crushed in early morning around 8. Official announcement posted after 10 am and still not fixed yet. It's 10 pm now lmao. Again I love the mythology background but over 12 hours...If you are interested in this game, don't buy until the server issue is fixed.  \n-------------------------------------\nCongrats! This will be my FIRST negative review on Steam and I'm pretty sure this will be the only one since for the games I don't like I usually will just request refund and uninstall. \nFirst of all, game-wise, there's definitely no satisfaction with the combat system. Yea they designed all the attacking, dodging, blocking.....but basically the only thing you need is pure luck because there is a random delay during the combat. Click on whatever key you like, you will see your character standing there like you're disconnected from the server. Everything in the combat system is totally random. \nSecond, the server sucks. SUCKS. WORST SERVER EVER. You never know when they are going to announce the server is temp down. I mean I played so many multi-player online games, this is the first server that is MELTING every day. A COUPLE TIMES A DAY. IMPRESSIVE. As of 4/19, another big server temp down and lots of delays and even sudden disconnection. Hopefully this problem will go away in the future, or start thinking about options like players host server. I'm a pure PVE players and PVE players don't really need online server with random people. We just play with friends that's all. \nLast but not least, this is a sandbox game but I have to wait in queue trying to get into my own world? Totally not acceptable. There is no such thing as a local server. Even you decide to be a single player, you will have to join the online servers and that, again, sucks. \nAnyway...I liked this game when I first bought it.

It might need a little more explanation when it comes to what the cultivation ranks are (levels in english) other than that, I like the premise. Cultivation is all about patience, so it makes sense that you get more experience from gathering/crafting vs actual combat. So for those trying to grind levels by combat, I understand why you are upset. You are most likely paying against the way its meant to be played. Note for developers, if you make ranks English in parentheses above the Caligraphy, it won't take away from the style of the game. Also, for the judgement elixirs,  if you make it possible to gain information on the map by hovering over the boss icon and have the elixir material in parentheses along with the rank it is needed to break through to, it would also help to drop the rate of suicides due to not knowing where you are not able to go to yet. \n\nI thoroughly enjoy this game after figuring it out. It is not truly quest guided, meaning it's really on you how you will increase your strength. I've been saying for a very long time that we should have a cultivation mmorpg.  This is the closest thing to such a game. It is still in the developmental phase, so go easy on them. No man's sky was also horrible when it just came out, and you can see where it's gotten today.

Different graphic/art style, different structures, different era, different lore, but it is still a survival crafting base building everyone likes to play. \n\nThe lore of Ancient Chinese setting be it xianxia or wuxia or inbetween is, humans are permitted by gods to borrow their superhuman abilities via cultivations. Light body skill/ability to fly , superhuman strength, energy wave, just to name a few, and this game have them all.\n\nDon't be intimidated by the Mixed Reviews and kinda low percentage, those are mostly because of \"login\" problem in the game, once in the game, it's all good, but yea it can be frustrating at times, because of the long queue.  \n\n[strike]The game isn't actually an online game, but it does check something, I bet it is just for checking copy protections, some Chinese games use that. This game is actually a \"Single Player\" or Co-Op , not an mmo.[/strike] This game does have online features for reading everyone's kingdom name, and can join other people's kingdom, it also has leaderboards and rank people's progress. \n\nThe more I play and when experiencing lag, turned out the game is ACTUALLY an online game, playing on a server, because when my game crashed and I got back to it, it put me exactly where I was dc, that's impossible for a local game. Also when i was  lagging, there was rubberbanding and enemies position also followed. That only happens in a server/client connected game. So this is probably a different kind of online game, it is instanced. Same map different session just for people in the same kingdom.\n\nThe pvp in this game is quite fun, there is no one shot, there is no perma stun, in here we exchange blows, land a hit and also get hit, so a fight is very engaging, need an opening/opportunity to actually land a hit, the main combat is melee but there are atacks from afar and medium range, it can be hectic in a close range because of camera view and mouse rotation, but if lucky that could also be an opportunity to land a huge damage. Since the combat is mostly melee, kiting is also at play in combat. Healing is slow in this game, but even at low hp, can still turn the tide by playing supersafe, there's also a healing artifact which again, also slow with 90s cd and recovers not too many hp. It can be a cat and a mouse game but it can also be a cat with a cat game depending on situation. It's a really fun experience and different kind of fun from headshotting someone in fps games.\n\nOne thing I like is the raid aspect of the game. In most games raiding other's base actually destroys their base in real time, it is fun only for the winning party, the losing party will hate the game for that because all of their hard work for a long time will be gone/robbed/destroyed in just a short time of fun in pvp. In here, since the game is instanced, the game creates an instance of the real base then teleporting all participants to pvp in it. After the fight is over the game will generate whatever the winner has raided from the base they attack while the one that got raided and lost will only suffer losing a bit of what's raided and only cost 10% or whatever percent I forgot for repairing the whole base.\n\n----changes-----\nThe game is now built differently for pvp and pve. Pve is hosted by whoever loads the game from Steam cloud save, not joining on a server anymore. While for PvP is a few months session and is a paid server.

Overall the gameplay follows a similar formula but is different enough to set itself apart from similar games such as ARK and Valheim.\n\nThe game feels much more accessible than many other sandbox/crafting games, for example there is little-to-no penalty for death, you respawn at your home with all your items intact. \nAnd on that note, you have an instanced \"home\" area which is only accessible to you and your team, you can build your stuff and store all your materials here easily, there are occasional NPC raids but otherwise your stuff is \"safe\", in the pvp mode other players can raid a copy of your home island and you gain or lose points based on the outcome, from my understanding you do not lose any materials/buildings from this and the raiders only find randomised loot in your chests, although I may be wrong here due to translation issues. \nYou can still build in the main world but your constructions are always at the risk of being destroyed by players or monsters. \n\nThis might all sound good but... after the game initially had some severe server issues in the first few days after release it seems the developers have completely abandoned the idea of having servers hosted anywhere outside of China and even then the servers are not very stable. \nIn addition to this the official PVP server is locked behind a season-pass-style purchase that only unlocks access for the current season.

This game's main point is said cultivation and it is easy to think out a story around it for your character. That being said the game is in early access and it has lots of flaws at the moment, these flaws might very well be gone by the time the game returns to the store again though.\nFor people who have knowledge on different survival games would probably best understand if I compare it to others:\n\nBuilding: Basically like in Rust. you build up your basic structures and are able to later upgrade it to other materials. though there are some quuality of life features like mass upgrading mass repairing and more. As for building parts, I hope that they will add more in the future, as some are still missing, which are in my oppinion necessary. (Walls for half foundations)\n\nCombat: the combat is something new depending on your weapon of  choise, the attacks already differ. for every Weapon there is also multiple Qi abilities, frowm which you might choose two to have equippped at the same time. To unlock those abilities and level them up you have to spend skillpoints, which you get when leveling up or finding certain landmarks or skillbooks in the world.\nThe enemies are interesting, sadly I was not able to test them to their full extent, as the connection to the servers caused quite some lagg at times.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are nice. Nothing to be amazed of like the best looking game ever, but nice and typically styled for a survival game. \nThere is reason to be careful with torches though, as the fire effects are not perfectly optimized and can cause your computer to use quite some calculating power.\n\nCultivation Mechanic: For the most part you will be doing the introduction questline to learn the game. This will also lead you to understand, that pellets are the most effective way to strengthen your Qi energy (level up)\nyou will have to use a special furnace to create pellets from herbs and other materials until you reach a bottleneck and have to break through it with a pellet, that requires a boss material.\n\nOverall I already had lots of fun exploring this game.

The building part of the game is about what you'd expect as well, neither good nor bad, but enough to build pretty much what you want.\n\nThe main issue with the game at the moment, and why they've stopped sales and are issuing refunds, is that they weren't expecting to get so many players when the game first launched into early access so there's been server issues.\n\nFor the first few days, the servers would run well enough til overheating (as said in the dev post) and needing time to be fixed, not something a simple restart would fix.  There's also the issue of lag, but I suspect this is english speaking players selecting the 'Asia' server to play on, rather than the 'America' one.  Europeans and others are out of luck for now, though.\n\nThey've stated, given how they've programmed the game so far, that they'll need to rewrite the net code and a few other things, to make it more suitable for the large amount of folks wanting to play.  So, right now, they've limited how many servers can be open (since before, every single kingdom instance would be like opening up a 'mini server', which would put the main server under a lot of stress.  Their words, by the way.)\n\nThis, of course, has gotten quite a few people angry, understandably, and it's all rather unfortunate as even if they do fix this, and I think they will, the score will stay as it is and I don't think the game deserves that because it's really not that bad.\n\nIf you don't want to spend a few minutes queuing up to get your own server open, or join another (which is how long it takes right now, as of posting) then I'd suggest waiting til about May when they're scheduled to get the big fix in, and take what the negative reviews say with a grain of salt.", "timestamp_created": 1650753901, "timestamp_updated": 1650753901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114222750": {"recommendationid": "114222750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350318669", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1672498272}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game so far.

who was waiting for this type of a game for a long time, i have a very mixed feelings about it. Lets start off with basics. Graphics is OK. Neither good, nor straight up bad. There's quite a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking. Sounds are, well, low budget i would say, but also not straight up bad. All in all, its OK, \n\nNow for the systems themselves. Lets first talk about map. Its useless. Tells you where you are on the map, thats about it. In a game where you have to gather resources a lot, you would expect some indicator when you are close to something, but there isnt anything. So your best bet is to open some fan made map to actually find what you are looking for. Without it, well, good luck. \n\nCultivation. Propably the reason why y'all deciding whenever to get this game or nah. Well, in simple terms, this is basically RPG game with levels. There is little concept for cultivation itself. You get EXP for doing various tasks and once you accumulate enough, you level up, get bit of stats, and repeat. Now i havent gotten far into the game, but it looks like you have to at least craft a pill when breaking through big realm (foundation, golden core etc. etc.) so thats at least somewhat similar to cultivation. Another way to level up is getting resources and put them into furnance, which will literally give you EXP pill.  You dont get to meditate or something, which you would expect in this type of a game. Again, its not terrible, but its not good either. Really just feels like playing a regular RPG with bit of cultivation theme in it. \n\nCombat. Oh well, this one is actually pretty bad. Its clunky as hell, good luck hitting anything. Not to mention i started randomly teleporting with a club when killing a boar. (not lags, just clunkiness) \n\nIts early access and thats what i tell to myself to not feel bad about the game. If the game gets some love, and devs put in effort, it HAS potential to be a very good game actually. For now however, its not the best experience. It cost me 15\u20ac, and i am fine with that. 15\u20ac is appropriate price for this game right now. \n\nTLDR: If you have 15\u20ac you wont miss and are desperate for cultivation game, i would say get it, but dont have high expectations.

The character movement still seems slightly stiff and has room for improvement. Currently, everything is made easy and players receive a lot of items to increase their levels quickly. The environment is beautiful but still seems \"dead\" at the same time. Background noises and sound effects quality could be improved more. Character customisation: I hope they make it more detailed in the future. There is no story in this game but I hope there will be one whether as a starter or involve a story-rich content.
