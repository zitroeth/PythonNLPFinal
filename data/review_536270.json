I see a lot of people saying they can't figure out the controls or don't know what they're doing- literally turn the UI back on.) but the whole point is to figure shit out and I love that. It has bugs and there's a lot of grinding but it does a great job of putting you in the hominid's... not shoes, they haven't invented those yet. But it makes you go \"0.o this can make stick sharp?? sharp stick is good, sharp stick is friend\" and then carry it everywhere and be a menace to Miocene society.\n\nThe way [i]I[/i] think as the player has changed since I started. I started off terrified to touch the ground, just constantly climbing and looking around on edge for other animals when I needed to go to the ground to drink. I have to say the first time a machairodus attacked me I swear the roar and slow-mo reaction, being caught out in the open, and sprinting for the nearest tree triggered primal fear. I'd almost call it cruel of the developer to exploit my Actual Brain, but good on them for giving me such a good scare.\nSlowly I got more confident and learned to intimidate and dodge but it was all over for those bitches once I learned to stab things. Now I walk across the savannah alone with a stick and/or rock (really only need one) and occasioanlly forget to even check for predators. \n\nStop trying to figure out what you're supposed to be doing and Learn To Be Monke.

It makes this game very immersive. The leveling of neurons to actually effect basic motor coordination like using two hands or swapping while moving make me feel like I'm really evolving. It can get a little redundant once you figure out how it works-gen up, make 6 babies,examine dead elders, gen up again-but I think the game does a great job of capping this with skills to grind, forcing you to explore and get lost in a beautiful landscape of immersive biomes. I also greatly appreciate them staying as close to scientific accuracy as they can. Though, some phrases seem very dumbed down like, \"faster than science.\"\r\n\r\nMy only complaint about this game is that its goal is to evolve \"faster than science.\" Let's pretend that's the proper way to word \"faster than nature\" or whatever. The game rewards (actually penalizes) you with years for accomplishing feats, then pats you on the back with new forms until you quickly reach the final evolution-an unplayable species-without having explored/achieved everything with so many skills left to learn. From that save you cannot use the evolve feature to lock in new mutations without it ending the game. There have been updates since I last beat it, so maybe it's been fixed. If not, it seems the most efficient leveling for skills is to explore as slowly as possible, make as many micro evolutions as you can, and kill off any elders without mutations to keep the time slider from ending the game too soon .\r\nWhat I'd like to see in updates or sequels: \r\n-Other groups of hominids encountered \r\n-DLC\r\n-Seasons. This could be a bit much\r\n-projectile crafting . Obviously, later species/sequels \r\n-Free roam as final species to continue exploring \r\n-Contagious illnesses . Might be too much \r\n-Fire in some usable context\r\n-Dang monkeys that all listen when I tell them to scoop mud! lol\r\nGreat game ! One of my all time favs!

Buffs & Debuffs: Food, medicine, and injuries work on a buff/debuff system, so taking more of the cure grants resistance (horsetail reeds heal injuries and kapok fiber heals wounds).\n2. QTEs: When dodging, hold A in the direction you want to dodge, or at the enemy if you have a weapon. \n3. Using LB and RB you can switch hands, when crafting you interact with the item in your left hand by holding RB until it makes a sound.\n4. Travel with your tribe. Also, you can make your tribe craft spears.\n5. Generations: When changing generations, you can take as many neurons as you have children, and make them permanent. If you've bought those children to a meteor site, they'll all gain a mutation & be worth double the generation points, allowing 12 neurons to be \"locked in\".\n6.  Evolution: This only counts your elders and adults (max 12). If they have mutations at this point, those mutations will lock in. It also counts any feats such as combat, crafting, and exploration to measure progress towards becoming different species. \n7. Fear: When exploring you'll be overcome with fear when in some unexplored areas. Eating regains sanity, and interacting with objects in the fear zone fills a meter.

I love roaming around and exploring the environment - I just wish there were more things to discover - maybe I'm simply not far enough into the game (40h), but it feels like I have everything uncovered that there is. (and I really don't want to look it up - I want to find stuff myself) Tools for example - there's pretty much only Obsidian and Granite - out of which you can make a [spoiler] grinder and a scraper - combined with a stick you can make a sharpened stick which you can use to hunt and poke holes in the floor [/spoiler]... this fits the evolutionary timeframe the game is set in, but I still wish there was more - maybe a second part of the game that focusses more on (stone) technology and the possibilities they unlock in the world and less on trying not to die of dehydration would be in order. At least I'd buy it in a heartbeat!\n\nTL:DR\nGreat game if you enjoy taking it slow and exploring, and don't mind the horrible controlls", "timestamp_created": 1712572637, "timestamp_updated": 1712572637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552475392818450928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159209480": {"recommendationid": "159209480", "author": {"steamid": "76561199199358830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 100, "last_played": 1712745738}, "language": "english", "review": "i amonke", "timestamp_created": 1708833813, "timestamp_updated": 1708833813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551619291305541992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160205885": {"recommendationid": "160205885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198443762797", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 309, "last_played": 1710073028}, "language": "english", "review": "hu ha\u011faa h\u011fa \u011fua \u011fuaha \u011fu\u011fu\u011f\u011f \u011faha", "timestamp_created": 1710012047, "timestamp_updated": 1710012047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543408393859863281", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160213372": {"recommendationid": "160213372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016297010", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1019, "last_played": 1704161629}, "language": "english", "review": "Good for 10-15 hours, then get's way too repetitive and lacks depth when it comes to evolving into another generation.\r\n\r\nFun monkeying arround for couple hours tho.", "timestamp_created": 1710019301, "timestamp_updated": 1710019301, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538497447967529297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157568443": {"recommendationid": "157568443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035478674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 4623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4623, "last_played": 1707044878}, "language": "english", "review": "Spend 70 hours raising a lineage, take time to learn the mechanics. \n\nGet involved in filling out the neural branches. \n\nEvolve through the aeons and overcome the challenges. \n\nBe cautious as to not lose clan members in vain.

Personally, it really felt to me like I was THERE, being the ape I was playing as, and leading my clan. Every danger felt so real, that I needed to be on my toes all the time. The movement system felt so refreshing. There wasn't one place I could not go, not one surface I couldn't climb. It gave me the opportunity to learn things as I went, experiment, and learn from my mistakes, just as our ancient ancestors did all those millions of years ago. I loved the system of evolution, too. It really gave an incentive to really play the game and explore, try to hunt, etc.\n\nAll in all, I think this game really put you there, on the ground, millions of years ago.

Here the tutorial, markers and HUD are kept to an absolute minimum, and for me that is where the virtue arises. Both the little monkey as well as you are in a journey of discovery, starting off with the simple concept of object permanence or switching an object between hands, to developing systems of communication and crafting primitive tools.\r\n\r\nFirst things said, the game feels a bit clanky, some bugs here and there might not ruin the experience but for sure make it feel less fluid. It is something that usually bothers me a lot and in most games pulls me out of the immersion, but in this case I don\u2019t know if it is because the implementation of some new patches or because I am very lucky, but most performance issues have been minor and have not compromised my experience in a substantial way.\r\n\r\nWith that said, lets talk a bit more in depth about what the game has to offer.\r\n\r\nIn the visual aspect the game is not a marvel, but it does the job, specially in the jungle segment were the lack of direct illumination hides some of the worse details. The engine is capable of portraying truly beautiful scenery, and the use of lightning sometimes tricks you into thinking that what you are seeing is worthy of an avatar film.\r\n\r\nThe controls are a big part of the experience, they are initially complex and do not feel agile, but the progressive interiorization of them feels rewarding. It is in moments like this that it feels like you both, the monkey and the player, are leaning simultaneously, definitely a peculiar experience.\r\n\r\nWell, I will conclude by saying that it is a journey meant to be played without spoilers, and I would invite you all to enjoy it by yourselves. It is an ambitious game, developed by a humble studio and worthy of your time. I hope for this game to become the starting point for a new generation of brave developers. \r\n\r\nTotally recommended!\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1710056567, "timestamp_updated": 1710056567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160132969": {"recommendationid": "160132969", "author": {"steamid": "76561199148134819", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 20119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 676, "playtime_at_review": 19045, "last_played": 1713324106}, "language": "english", "review": "MONKAAAYYYSS", "timestamp_created": 1709932370, "timestamp_updated": 1709932370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159744316": {"recommendationid": "159744316", "author": {"steamid": "76561199394279743", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 1936, "last_played": 1713124824}, "language": "english", "review": "I like that it takes a lot of time to finish, but even though I have not finished the game yet i can tell it is a fun game to play", "timestamp_created": 1709443475, "timestamp_updated": 1709443475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159725723": {"recommendationid": "159725723", "author": {"steamid": "76561199161339541", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 414, "last_played": 1711491078}, "language": "english", "review": "Slow at first but fun", "timestamp_created": 1709421678, "timestamp_updated": 1709421678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162800080": {"recommendationid": "162800080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283291181", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1903, "playtime_at_review": 1052, "last_played": 1713737566}, "language": "english", "review": "monkey monkey monkey", "timestamp_created": 1713021774, "timestamp_updated": 1713021774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522689878940582275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162574064": {"recommendationid": "162574064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060385744", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 120, "playtime_at_review": 3192, "last_played": 1712706282}, "language": "english", "review": "if you've every thought to yourself \"I have an odd definition of fun sometimes, don't I\" then this game may be for you. steep learning curve, but the core gameplay loop can be quite satisfying when you get the hang of it.", "timestamp_created": 1712706410, "timestamp_updated": 1712706410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160930311": {"recommendationid": "160930311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299612186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1354, "last_played": 1680404623}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is honestly just too hard and grindy for singleplayer (for me).

Maybe it really is the fact I don't have a controller to use instead of a mouse and keyboard, but even the Lego games designed for controller were easier to play than this. Death is everywhere and there is simply nothing I could ever do about it, ever. Can't walk fast enough, can't run, can't jump, even when you hear the sound of the animals, you can't escape because by then it is way to late. I wish this were more fun.\nTried again on a new lineage and it really is the controls and triggers in the game to react that are just a mess. I have watched videos on how to do things, and the game is just unreliable on how it reacts. The videos filled in the gaps that the game really misses on telling you, like really important basic things, but the movement and sound triggers are just garbage. Which is sad because this game could have been a 5 star amazing game, but instead the lack of basic game controls, information, and triggers turned this into a zero star trash heap.\nClimb a tree to the top? Want to get down? You can't unless you jump. Why can't we climb back down?\nIn a tree and want to jump to the next tree that is right next to you, good luck. The controls to direct your jump are so bad that you miss more than you make it which can cause you to fall to your death. No previous save once that happens to try again because of the autosave mechanic that overwrites the game.\nListening for those noise cues to trigger your action, like evade attack, sharpen your stick, hit your rocks? By the time the trigger sound happens, its already past when the game thinks you should have triggered the action. You have to time it just right so your action happens exactly when the sound trigger happens, which actually means you have to react a split second before the sound trigger, or else your action fails. You essentially have to know when it will happen before it happens. Good luck with that.\nI truly hope they fix all these issues in some future update or version because this game could be so amazing.

You progress your hominids by repeating basic chores while carrying a child, and you lock in skill points by completing a generation.  Afterwards, you get to do it all again, because all of the skills you unlocked last generation have been reset.  High levels of RNG with the mutation system gating off skills until you \"mature\" a child with a particular mutation, and unless something seriously changes in the platforming late-game I really can't see this being a fun game to play long term.  Your character moves at a snail's pace, they let go randomly while climbing, and one fall is all it takes to kill an ape.  Hope that child you were carrying didn't have an important mutation, because they're dead now too.  Apes have a wierd sense of parinoia that I can't figure out and will randomly act like they're being stalked by a predator when there's no threat to be found, which is a major pain since they'll run back to base if they're afraid for too long.\n\nWhile the idea is interesting the assembled game is one of the most frustrating to play survival craft games I've experienced.

I'd only suggest picking this up if it's heavily discounted. If you're not sold on the theme, skip over it entirely.\n\nSomewhat amusingly for a game about evolution, the biggest problem Ancestors has is that everything follows a rigid formula. I don't think the devs finished making the game. There's no story, no objective, no purpose to evolution. It's super shallow. It's also kinda fun, but this might be 'fun to watch a car crash' style fun? I'll try and break down what went wrong, and why for some reason I still enjoyed bits of the game.\n\nThe game also adamantly refuses to use terms like 'skill tree', 'experience points', etc. For the sake of the review I'll use them, but note the game uses confusing terminology throughout.\n\nFirst, the controls. Oh heck the controls. The game has too many actions for a typical controller, so it ends up using a context-sensitive system. However the buttons used are not ideal. For example (using a 360 controller), holding A will sprint. Releasing A whilst moving will jump. Releasing A whilst not moving will cancel a jump. Pressing A whilst falling will grab onto something, if there's something to grab. Pressing A near an item will pick it up/interact with it. Pressing A whilst holding a consumable item will consume it. Pressing A whilst standing in a body of water - with no items in hand - will drink the water. Pressing A in combat will dodge OR attack (I'll get to this soon). It should be obvious how this system breaks down. What if I want to drink water whilst near an item? You can't, you grab the item. You equally might just jump off a cliff by mistake. This happens far too much. I was fighting against the controls the entire time.\n\nThe core mechanic of Ancestors is evolution. Take a bunch of hairy people, and progress them from sitting in poop to stabbing elephants with a pointy stick. Alright, I'm interested. It's a novel premise that hasn't really been explored before. Immediately this starts out good. New skills are unlocked rapidly early on, and they make a difference. Mobility goes from feeling clunky to (somewhat) fluid. New food options can be adapted to by sucking it up, eating them, and suffering with the ill effects. Learning to walk can be done by forcing yourself to stand up, walking a few steps, then falling over. Keep trying, you'll get it! I loved this. Skills work on a two-tier unlock system: first you have to learn the skill, then you have to pay XP to acquire it. I also enjoyed this as it both captured the spirit of evolution, and mechanically felt great.\n\nHowever, evolution became less cool over time. By the end I was actively resenting it. There's two major problems here. The first: in order to evolve you have to reset the skill tree, but you get to make some skills permanent. The amount you can lock down varies by how many kids you have, and RADIATION FROM METEORITES (yes, literally). Once an upgrade is permanent it's permanent for all future generations. Everything else is lost - you still have the skills available, but you need to pay xp to get them back. This could work in theory, but in practice it's painful. Skills unlock by holding a button for 5-10 seconds, once per skill. The game makes you do this hundreds of times. This was at least an hour of real time. On top of this, there's an RNG mechanic where some babies will generate new permanent skills after evolving. This is why you're forced to reset the skill tree, because you can't unlock much without the special baby skills. This leads to a boring mechanical meta: have 6 kids, pass a generation, repeat, evolve, go back to step 1. Repeat until it feels too gamey, then go stab a rhino or something.\n\nThe second problem is the world itself. Whilst your own species evolves over time, the simulation does not. It's the same in the first minute as it is in the last. Even weirder - when you pass 'millions of years' during evolution, the simulation doesn't change. It just force-respawns all items and animals, but otherwise continues from the same second. This leads to nonsensical situations, such as my stockpile of raw meat which was still fresh after 6 million years.  This also means evolution serves no purpose; it's viable to survive without unlocking a single skill, and each skill makes the game a little bit easier. Evolution doesn't grant access to new mechanics, nor new areas to explore. It's just evolution for the sake of it, and the more I evolved the more boring the game became. The first few hours were incredible (also terrifying): I didn't understand the world, and everything felt more powerful than me. By the mid-game I ran past everything because I had no reason to engage with it. There's no objective, no story, no narrative, no evolution of challenge. The later areas feel rushed and unfinished, with no reason to explore them.\n\nOn the subject of locations, oh dear. What happened here? The game starts off in a confusing jungle. It feels claustrophobic, menacing, almost an extinction level threat. But it also offers verticality, plenty of different routes to advance forward, and lots of hiding spaces for nasty snakes to jump out of. Then it becomes an open lake, when the tribe has no swimming ability. Then, as you start to learn how to swim, it changes to large grassy plains and never has swimming again. Then it's a wide open savannah, and finally a wide open desert. There's a few minor changes between these, but that's essentially the layout. The problem here: there's nothing to do in an empty plain! In the jungle you can climb trees, swing from vines, scale rocky cliffs, swim through lakes, and so on. In a wide open plain all you can do is run. This actively took away gameplay options. Whilst it was nice that the map became more open as my species learned how to be bipedal, it also became boring. There was nothing to do except sprint between points of interest for exp.\n\nThe jungle has snakes and alligators that are terrifying threats early game. The lake/grassy/woodland areas serve no purpose and should have been cut. The open plains has a full menagerie of creatures: snakes, rhinos, elephants, sabre-tooth tigers, jackals etc.  Unfortunately these all have the same AI. They sit around in a pack doing nothing, then attack you if you go near. That's it.\n\nThe map design is also too formulaic. There's 6-10 'oasis' locations in each biome, and these always have 100% of your tribe's survival needs in them. There's no reason to explore or take risks when there's no reason to leave your oasis. Why become an omnivore when you have infinite edible plants in every oasis? Why migrate when you don't need anything from the savannah? Ancestors could be amazing if they fixed this aspect of it. If the plants didn't respawn you'd have a reason to become an omnivore and fight for food. The game needs some kind of extinction-level threat that forces you to adapt or die, rather than adapt 'because there's no gameplay if you don't'.\n\nThere's also combat in this game, but dang it's awful. When an enemy attacks the game goes into bullet time, then you have to hold A, and then either point the left stick at the enemy to attack or away from them to dodge. That's it. Congratulations, you now know how to beat every creature in the game without exception. You might lose if you don't have a pointy stick, but you will always win if you do. To make up for it, all sticks break after exactly one use. This system sucks. When you attack you get a cool cinematic cutscene, and these are visceral as heck. You'll stab a creature in the gut, jump on its back, then pummel it in the head with your fists until it dies. This is awesome! I just wish it was me pulling it off, and not a scripted cutscene triggered by me pressing A once.\n\nThere's a few more mechanics to the game, but this review is hitting the character limi", "timestamp_created": 1598832627, "timestamp_updated": 1598922348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1093, "votes_funny": 74, "weighted_vote_score": "0.965600728988647461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85722505": {"recommendationid": "85722505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061898661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 657, "last_played": 1612325497}, "language": "english", "review": "UPDATE: Now that I've beat the game, I still recommend the game with a caveat; the game is still very repetitive up until the end and meaningful progress is very wide spread. Get meteorites asap, and you only need about 70-80% evolution progress to complete the game.\n\nPlay with full hud and full tutorial your first time through, it's actually mind-blowing how many reviews that are not recommending the game say the game doesn't tell you how to do things when it gives you a full tutorial card you need to manually dismiss. Just a few examples of things I know for SURE had a tutorial or makes sense:\n\n-\"For example I was asked to make a sleeping place... but crafting had not been explained to me.\" This has a tutorial, and not only that but it kind of makes sense you'd pile up a bunch of leaves.\n\n- \"Almost every activity in the game is a sort of sound based QTE deal...\" Most QTE's rely on the borders of the screen getting a rainbow effect and if you're playing on gamepad you also get a vibration most of the time.\n\n-\"...but with fighting I have no idea what to press and when, and the game doesn't bother to tell you anything.\"  The game literally has two separate tutorial cards telling you that to dodge you hold A while moving away and release at the right time and that counter attacking is the same except you move toward the attacker.\n\n-\"My first ape almost died of exhaustion as he didn\u2019t know how to sleep... \" At no point do you need to inspect to learn to sleep, you just do it at your bed. You can also hold A to lie down anywhere with an empty hand and sleep on the spot.\n\n-\" I managed a few more objectives, groomed a mate, but had no idea how to make a baby. My instinct told me we had to copulate, but, apparently, these animals don\u2019t know how to do that...\" This one doesn't have a tutorial, but it's fairly obvious you need to go to a resting spot (aka a bed) and experiment, finding out that you need to call your mate. \n\n-\"I wasn\u2019t planning on watching endless youtubes just to figure out where to go and how to solve what.\" 10+ hours in and haven't looked up a tutorial yet, personally.\n\nI will agree though, that this game is very repetitive and people will find the controls clunky (personally I got the hang of them pretty quickly, a lot of your context actions depend on you either moving, standing, having your dominant hand free or both hands free) and there isn't enough variety. There will be one or two new animals per biome the further you go, and there's a good amount of redundant items (fruits) and the crafting is still rudimentary where I am in the game. The core gameplay loop makes itself very obvious very quickly so you need to really enjoy exploring the environment itself.\n\nHowever, I've never played another game like this before, where you need to learn EVERY system from the ground up by experimenting and learning. It truly gives you that feeling of being a monke in the forest, afraid of everything but slowly evolving similarly to our ancestors.\n\nI'm going to spoil the gameplay loop for you guys, if you're still confused:\n-Have as many babies as you can (I seem to keep capping out at 6)\n-After your female apes are infertile, play as them because they can't procreate anymore\n-Saddle up with two babies\n-Explore your area, discover landmarks (diamond shaped markers)\n-Level up enough to take advantage of all your reinforcements\n-Repeat all steps until you need to go further from your settlement to discover stuff, at this point move your clan to a new oasis\n-When you complete a bunch of feats in your evolution tab, evolve your species. This is the true goal of the game, catching up to the modern era, and every feat you do (discovering areas, fighting animals, discovering things, etc.) gives you bonus years that moves you further down the timeline. Evolving also cements your mutations that babies provide after they make it to adulthood/ elder status.\n\nThe WHOLE point of the game is that you're supposed to figure everything out from the ground up, experimenting with every little thing like a dumb ape.

No, it is not. However, if you enjoy games that involve exploration, experimentation and logical puzzle solving. You will definitely enjoy this game.\n\nThe core of Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey is that you are starting as our earliest ancestors and exploring, experimenting and evolving over millions of years until you eventually become the earliest relatives of HomoSapiens. The game doesn't hold your hand, you are responsible for learning the various actions and interactions with the world and the objects in it. \n\nThe game thrusts you into the same mindset of our early ancestors. You want to make a sharpened stick? Well, you are going to need to figure out the interactions required to do it. But you aren't done there, as you get more comfortable experimenting with interactions, you may find ways to refine the process and in doing so you will unlock the neuronal potential of your chimps. Essentially you are growing alongside your chimps; as you figure out more about the game and its processes your chimps evolve and adapt more and more to their environment and move ever closer to becoming early humans.\n\nVisually the game is beautiful. Never once did I get bored exploring the massive game world presented to me. Many times I was actually awe struck by the beauty and immensity of it. I still remember when I was out exploring trying to find a better settlement for my clan and crested the top of a rock formation to be greeted with the sight of the Savannah sprawling out before me. I remember excitedly making may way down to try and explore this new biome, only to have to retreat battered, bruised, and bloody because my chimps were ill adapted to this new environment. I also remember the immense satisfaction I felt when I evolved my chimps to better handle this new challenge, then returned in force with my clan to claim our new home.\n\nOverall, this game has become one of my most memorable gaming experiences. I loved every second of the 70 hours I put into it. Is it perfect? No, there are some bugs and there is some jankiness here and there. Sometimes trying to figure out how to trigger a particular evolutionary path can be frustrating but with the exception of one (I won't name it for spoiler reasons), they were usually intuitive and left me face-palming when I finally figured out what I needed to do.\n\nIf you want to experience an epic and immersive adventure that is tied directly to our own heritage, I HIGHLY recommend this game.\n\nEDIT: One thing that I guess needs to be added is that if you are the type that can't stand playing a PC game with a controller, then don't bother.

On the other hand, I absolutely love the movement dynamics, the evolution system, the world itself and exploring, and the overall underlying concept, yet at the same time, the game has such clear flaws and missing elements that playing it just makes me sad for what it could have been.\n\nThe most glaring of these flaws is the total lack of proper outside pressures on your tribe, be it from scarcity of resources, actually dangerous predators, and most importantly OTHER tribes of apes. As it stands, there is basically zero reason to ever go out of the jungles and explore the map outside of sheer curiosity of the player and the banal desire to \"just finish the game\", which in itself isn't exactly fun because the game never ups the challenge the gameworld presents to the player, nor do the base gameplay mechanics ever really expand, or interact with one another in any interesting way. For example, you can't place food to attract prey animals to a location where you could trap them or hunt them more easily.\n\nHowever ,it is the lack of other ape tribes is something I am utterly baffled by, and have yet to find any explanation to why the devs decided to make your ape tribe the sole monkeys in the game. Territory disputes between apes is a big part of their behavior, as was most likely the same case for our ancestors, and the lack of them just makes the game world feel utterly empty. Having to deal with other tribes would have opened up a whole new element of gameplay to the game, which in my opinion, would have improved this game tremendously.\n\nAll in all, the above flaws basically mean that once you have figured out the intentionally obscure ways of how the game mechanics work (and unlocked the few that are behind evolution leaps), the whole gameworld becomes your oyster and you face basically zero challenges from the game which ends up making the whole experience dull.\n\nIn short, this game could have been a masterpiece, and it has a good idea at it's core, but for some reason the devs failed to implement vital elements that would make the game actually engaging to play in the long term.\n\nThanks for reading my blog.", "timestamp_created": 1599053386, "timestamp_updated": 1599053386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 188, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.924250960350036621", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78636157": {"recommendationid": "78636157", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966935941", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1604385102}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a radically new way of telling the oldest story.

The last part doesn't change throughout the entire game, but as you unlock neurons and evolve, you will become far better at defence, attack, resource gathering, senses, production, social ties and more efficient with energy expenditure, so it becomes far less fraught.\n\nI cannot stress enough that this will take time - many, many hours. If you do not like games that are slow paced with occasional (you hope) moments of life or death panic, this is not the game for you.

If you are looking for a game that will guide and tell you what to do, it is not worth your money. Also the save system, while I understand the idea behind it, is not very practical for real life. You can only save on a sleep spot, so if you have a time limit on your gaming you have to plan to be back at your base so you can do so.\n\nIf you *are* interested in the theme of the game and are willing to put in the time and push through the setbacks and challenges you will face, however, it's definitely worth a buy.

I was on the fence about this game and ended up just buying because it was on sale. I personally have ended up loving it and found a good portion of the bad reviews were either incorrect, didn't give enough information or had incorrect expectations. I'd like to try to address the main negative points to help any future decisions on whether to buy.\n\nThe controls - Yes, KB/M is not great on this game. I've tried it a few times and personally would not be able to complete the game with those controls. That being said, controller operation is amazing. There's quite a few AAA games that I wish would control this well. Short answer, if you play just KB/M this probably isn't your game, but if you don't mind controller don't worry about the controls. \n\n\"Game is repetitive\" - It is a survival game and probably one of the most true to it's nature of the genre. Your main objective day to day is to stay fed, watered, and healthy so you will be addressing those issues constantly.  It's also a game about evolution THAT YOU CONTROL. There are numerous methods to get food, get boosts, and stay healthy which make these tasks quicker and easier but you'll access none of them if you don't take the initiative. Basically, if you don't try new things and evolve, then yes the game will be incredibly repetitive.\n\n\"You don't actually evolve\" - I'll keep this as spoiler free as possible, but some things you should know before buying. You actually do evolve both in abilities and appearance. Appearance is not a quick process and you won't ever evolve into a human. You will always be an animal utilizing senses, abilities, and dexterity while building/technology for the most part is not part of this game. That being said, I will say the abilities both inherited and evolved make a huge difference in game play and are quite amazing. They're also custom to how you play. I noticed in my second more experienced play-through, my tribe evolved completely different than in my first, locking out many abilities I had taken for granted until much later just due to very small differences in how I started.\n\nPlease understand what you're buying.  This is not Ark, Conan, or Valheim. You can't build towns, fortresses, amazing weapons and you do not have unrealistic powers or physical ability.\nYou start at almost the bottom of the food chain with normal speed, jumping, and very few things you can eat. EVERYTHING wants to kill you and climbing is pretty much the only impressive thing in you're arsenal. You'll scrape and claw your way just to survive for the first part of the game. Very little is actually explained which actually is in line with the game design. You'll need to learn/examine basically everything before your monkey knows what to do with it. Through trial, error, and probably quite a few deaths you can evolve to become quite deadly and enjoy a huge beautiful map, but even at your strongest death is just a wrong button/decision away.

There are a couple of ways to play, but for the most part the goal is to advance faster then we did IRL. In order to do this, there are CRUCIAL pieces of information that you could only know about if you have played through and noticed (or watched a TUT). In particular, something as simple as bringing your young with you to a meteor location to get the extra reinforcements for the next generation. However, every time your clan is decimated because you didn't do something right and you have to start over; you find that there was a better way, earlier in the game to progress faster then you did before.

The game is based on real scientific research, and the developers have done an excellent job of incorporating that knowledge into the gameplay.

There're stick barriers, which I never found a real use for.  That's all you can build.\nCrafting method is interesting, but I was disappointed to find out that there is hardly anything to craft.

My review above (from 2.5 years ago) was in the lens of expecting a more extensive skill tree than what we end up with and a sudden ending.  That's how I went into the game initially, and even today I think I would have expected as much based on what was advertised.  \n\nThe game was fun and challenging the whole way and had me intrigued for a while.  Being able to take down your first predator was thrilling, and you felt the exuberance that the monkeys were displaying.  Taking the first steps into regions you were unfamiliar with and seeing other biomes was exciting.\n\nAt some point, I figured out the whole gimmick with the generations and mating, and getting DNA points or whatever it's called and was able to speed through most of the last bit of skills.  The gains were small for your stamina, health, etc, there wasn't a lot of tools.  Considering how few items there were to craft and that there was just one little structure to build, I wonder why the devs bothered with the mechanics at all.\n\nIn the end, my review still stands.

I liked the concept a lot, but after playing it for myself, the execution is very poor. I played to the point of passing a few generations, but have yet to evolve. I understand that when evolving, things get better as you can do more, but the early game is really rough and it can be improved.\n\n**Edit: A lot of the comments I have seen say to just \"play with a controller, it's better.\" The problem with that is that this game is a PC port, it should already have support for the keyboard. I changed bindings around to make it less of a pain. I have tried playing with a controller. Playing with a controller isn't something I like doing so I rather use keyboard and mouse. You shouldn't dis-miss this review because \"you said keyboard controls bad, use controller.\" I looked around at other reviews/recommendations for the game and a lot of them insult people who don't use controllers. You shouldn't tell people not to play a game if they don't like using a controller. It's their personal preference and choice. And in this review I didn't \"rip\" on the controls. Only saying its unusual to have sprint/jump binded to one control.**\n\nPros:\n-Tree swinging is fun, though after reading other reviews, a lot of people have trouble with it.\n-Discovering your environment is really cool. \n-Crafting and altering is cool.\n-Slow progression make sense and it's actually really fun to think about what you need to do next and how you can make a sharp stick, etc.\n-Reinforcing your neuronal traits with generations is interesting, yet you should be able to reinforce a lot more traits instead of just 2 or 3 here and there. I always traveled with 2 children yet I only ever seemed to be able to reinforce 3 traits every passing of generation, even though my neuronal tree was pretty filled out.\n\nCons:\n-The control scheme. Jump and sprint are the same control (called \"body movement\"). If you play on keyboard you hold the space bar to sprint. Tapping space bar is for jumping. Confusing right? In order to stop sprinting, you must stop moving, otherwise if you let go of the space bar while moving, you will jump anyways.\n-The lack of your clan members having any personality or brain at all. I found myself doing a lot of my own thing in the tutorial, so I developed a lot into the neuronal tree. This tree doesn't make your clan members also have the same traits as you. So when trying to move settlements with your clan, if you get attacked by a tiger, its over for them. You can try to do a clan intimidate to scare the predator away, which almost 100% of the time guarantees you getting out of this encounter, but for some reason they just kept coming back and attacking my clan members anyways. Not only was that a problem, but having to micro-manage your clan all the time is frustrating. You need to show them how to eat, drink, and sleep. Now this would be easy and cool if you had to do this just once, that would make sense, but having to show them every time is frustrating. If you see me drink water, that means you can drink that water. If I leave and you need water, can't you just drink the same water again? Do you really need me to show you a second time that you can drink water?\n-The dodging system. If you're in an encounter with a predator and you try to escape from this encounter, you will most likely climb up a tree or a rock wall. Now if you're not fast enough or you're still low on the tree trunk/wall, the game will force you to fall straight to the ground and try to dodge the \"incoming attack\". This is really annoying and I'm not sure if it's a bug. \n-Jumping from tree to tree. In the beginning of the game I've had to stay mostly in the tree tops to be safe from predators below. This make sense, but sometimes when jumping from branch to branch, even though you are centimeters away from it, you can still fall straight to the ground instead of just grabbing it with your hands. I'm not sure if this can be developed into a \"motor skill\" later on, like reaction time, even though we already know dodging. There were cases where I would jump to a tree branch directly in front of me and still fall down to the ground.\n-After exploring and discovering everything in your environment, there really isn't much to the game. The full price tag swayed me away from buying it at first, but when it was finally released on steam, it was 50% off. I figured I would get it and play. If I bought this game at full price, I would be extremely disappointed. There should be more content added to this game.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you're still interested in this game after my review, buy it when it's on sale (60% off or even higher) or do some more research. Watch game play but don't watch any creator sponsored by Epic Games, as they will most likely shill for the game since it was an Epic Exclusive for a year. It's not worth the $50CDN price tag. If the devs made a bit more content to the game, make some more of the early game tutorials detailed (I get the point of you're supposed to learn it on your own, but if I don't know how half the controls work or what some of the abilities do, how am I supposed to progress?), and if they fix the dodging system, I would recommend it.

IT BARELY HAS CRAFTING IF YOU CALL WHAT IT HAS CRAFTING. YOU CAN ONLY USE THE MOST BASIC TOOLS AND EVOLVE MILDLY. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL AN AMAZING DISCOVERY EXPERIENCE.\n\nAs I stated before If you are here for a great experience of discovery, you will be satisfied. There are some problems with the game however if you are figuring out/discovering everything without any help you will get the maximum satisfaction you can get. \nThe game has lots of great ideas. The artwork/Graphics are great. Sadly game also has lots of shortcomings. The part I especially dislike was Fight/Flee mechanic against animals are same as the crafting mechanic. When you get the hang of it you are almost invincible against any threat, and after you discovered/got a basic understanding of food/medicine you can recover from any injury. Which sometimes starts to make you feel like you keep walking the limited map to different areas but you keep doing the same thing again and again. (If you end up feeling like this, you can try to do what I did and focus on your experience as an evolving ape instead of searching for a rigid/solid goal/target.)\nEven though your evolution is not significant, I found it rewarding each time I got new mutation abilities in progress. Most evolution feats are sensible but there are also lots of evolution feats that look like exist just to exist and to increase the number of feats (especially dominator feats). They seem like they (and some other stuff) were added just as a result of a failing effort to increase playtime and add replay value. However, the replay value of the game is still small. I think this is mostly due to the game's nature of being a discovery game. You just can't get the same awe and satisfaction of discovery your second time sadly. (You can try to beat your record time for beating the game but with you already mastered all mechanics and learned all material/food/crafts/animals you have nothing left to accomplish/discover. Hence it mostly feels like a pointless repetition) To be honest game might already start to feel repetitive in Endgame/late game as you discovered most stuff and mastered the Fight/Flee.\nIf there is ever some kind of sequel, (I like to hope there will be) hopefully studio will learn from their mistakes and make a better/longer/more filled experience.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, my first session/completion of the game was an awesome experience and I recommend it to everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1678835801, "timestamp_updated": 1678836383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.84885329008102417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75135068": {"recommendationid": "75135068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090369490", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1672073967}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're reading negative reviews and fearing this game may be too difficult or that you will get frustrated, I don't think you have much to worry about.

It's an interesting and unique concept with lots of cool features and ideas. Then you'd be able to kill a sabertooth tiger with a stick and chop him with a meteorite stone at some point. Cool stuff. \n\nIt's a great game if you're into crafting/survival and trial and error gameplay doesn't scare you. However, there's 2 major gameplay issues that could be more or less obvious depending on your playstyle and luck. Freedom of what to do and where to go is an illusion here. I had to abandon my 6 hours playthrough because I became [strike]da best[/strike] the last monkey in the jungle and new ones didn't spawn (I've checked almost the whole map). This was reported a year ago (one year beta-test wasn't enough) as I've checked forums and many people had this issue but it happened. When I encountered the same problem for a second time then I decided to only follow \"the orders\" (there's something like a super weird quest order tab but only to some point). So I don't really believe that any playthrough here will be unique.\n\nEven if you'd be lucky enough to not end up in a situation when you'd have to abandon your 6 hours save - you'd still experience a lot of annoying/frustrating mechanics with clunky controls. I'm not talking about things that are here for immersion, only about poor adaptation to mouse + keyboard and non-intuitive mechanics. There's nothing challenging in this game. I've never had this feeling during 70 hours in Death Stranding on max difficulty while I was constantly annoyed in Ancestors and wasn't able to get used to some things even after 10 hours in the game. \n\nAll in all, Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey is a fun and unique game - I'm mostly enjoying it so far. At the same time this game may heavily disappoint you if you're not ready to google what to do in a certain situation and if you're not ready to follow in-game instructions to a certain point, because as a \"sandbox\" experience it doesn't work too well while \"trial and error\" method may end up in a completely lost progression. This is a first game where I had to backup saves and it's definitely not adding up any fun. 8/10 for the game itself and 3/10 for poorly implemented mechanics.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32296668-Casual-Game-Reviews/]More reviews on our Curator Page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1598610403, "timestamp_updated": 1598610721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 173, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843575477600097656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106997702": {"recommendationid": "106997702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025173828", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1001, "last_played": 1648923561}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking for a conventional game with combat and experience points and a static hero or party, this is not that.

I was expecting an action-adventure ape game, maybe a good itch-scractcher after watching Planet of the Apes, and I wasn't exactly wrong, but that's not the whole story. \n\nLet me just summarize this before I get to the rating part.\n\nYou're an ape some 10 billion years ago. Your goal is to make the ape human - or at least human adjacent, since it doesn't quite get to the homo sapiens stage. You do that by being ape in action-adventure openworldesque setting, by running, climbing, learning to make and use simple tools, so forth, but the real progress happens in the Evolution menu.\n\nWhich is a little complex.\n\nYou've got nodes, not unlike skills in a skill tree. They're initially invisible to you, you can only see the ones that you're ready to unlock. How do you unlock them? By being ape. Better running speed is unlocked by running. Walking on two legs better is unlocked by trying to walk on two legs. Senses are reinforced by using them - and so on. But that only unlocks the node.\n\nYou actually buy the node using \"neural energy\" which is generated by - apparently - teaching kids. So performing actions with kids present. Conveniently, you can piggyback two and have others nearby, either piggybacked by other apes following you, or following you themselves. Perform enough actions, get the energy, buy the neural node. Which isn't the end.\n\nThen you need to reinforce that neuron by passing the generation - which normally allows you to reinforce only 1 node per kid in the clan, so you want to do that often. Kids also get to have random mutations which get revealed when they mature, but only activate upon evolution leap. Which in turn is passing millions, even billions of years (depending on evolution feats) and potentially making your clan into new species.\n\nThat was a mouthful.\n\nIt boils down to the gameplay loop of filling in your clan with kids, performing actions to get some evolution feats, unlock new neural nodes and get some neural energy, maybe migrate your clan to a new area, passing the generation, doing that again - and once your elders and adults have mutations available, performing an evolution leap. And that for about 8 billion years.\n\nThing is, it initially does a really good job at showing what it could be like to be ape. You're rather clumsy, and the controls show that. Even if you do things mostly right you'll break your tools, you won't be able to communicate, you'll move slow, it's... a struggle. It gives an impression of bad controls and bad design - which they're not. They're a bit awkward, but not bad.\n\nBut as you evolve, you realize that this gameplay loop is actually quite engaging. You slowly make the environment yield do you, as you both learn it and as your clan becomes more adept at being ape. The controls slowly become more reasonable, and the game kinda starts to flow. Reaching the end then becomes a fairly relaxing and satisfying experience.\n\nSo in summary, can I recommend the game? I can. Not to everyone though. It's a deeply weird game that will appeal to players who like unusual games. I find it difficult to put it in the sentence \"If you liked X you'll like Ancestors\". But I have to admit that once it clicked with me - which required effort - I enjoyed my 30-something hours run very, very much.\n\nTry it if you like games that present you with unusual mechanics and provoke some unusual thoughts.", "timestamp_created": 1611323798, "timestamp_updated": 1611323798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841363370418548584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122201011": {"recommendationid": "122201011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051406568", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5019, "last_played": 1660820883}, "language": "english", "review": "Play the game... and find out the real monkey is YOU!\n\nA good game is not defined by graphics, sound, innovation or even story. What makes a game great, is how it makes you feel. The immersion. When the game becomes you, when you become part of the game.\n\nThis game does exactly that.\n\nYou start out as a confused monkey, who barely knows how to move around or how to grab something. By trying over and over again, experimenting with different materials and styles, you learn. And just like the in-game monkey learns, you the player learn. \n\nYou learn how to quickly find a weapon, be it a stick, a rock, or a bone. You learn to always carry a weapon. You learn to eat & drink in time, when & where to sleep safely. You learn to identify a coconut tree, whose fruits can satisfy both thirst and hunger and can heal an upset stomach. You start wielding power over not just one ape, but an entire clan. The secrets of generation switching or an entire evolution unfold. That feeling when you can make what once was mystery then work for you in the way you want it - that is the feeling a video game should give you. And ancestors does.\n\nThe game does a great job not holding your hand too much, and letting you explore, discover and learn, while still avoiding you get stuck or bored. It's forgiving enough to allow mistakes, while being brutal enough to keep you on your toes and let you realise that the danger is real. One killed monkey does not mean the end, but when you're at your last monkey, you'll quickly learn to sleep in trees or use your sense of smell and hearing before jumping into the unknown - which will turn out to be a crocodile. \n\nAs you get further in the game, the threats get more varied, but you'll also conquer more. The feeling when that panther who's been stalking and killing your clan for ages finally ends up dead on the ground after a brutal battle - that's amazing. That is why we play. And that is why you should play this game! And offcourse, your monkey will not just kill the panther. It'll also bang its fists on the dead head of the fallen foe, go totally bananas in the victory rush as all clan members join in the wild screaming and chanting... and then you find a rock, buther the corpse, and eat the meat. Woops, not carnivorous yet? No worries, your upset stomach now means your offspring will be... one day.\n\nDoes the game have downsides? Off course. It's a game about evolution, so you'll spend quite some time managing your traits and passing generations. And that means fucking other monkeys. A lot of them. And everybody knows: doing the same thing too often can feel repetitive - even fucking. Oh well. You learn a quickie is good enough to generate a baby monkey and you'll be enjoying the new traits fast enough to reap the benefits. After a while, you unlock a trait that auto-couples and auto-reproduces, and the grind lessens. \n\nSoon, you will dominate the world.", "timestamp_created": 1663101092, "timestamp_updated": 1663101092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841115891933441162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141092201": {"recommendationid": "141092201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836945309", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1673452371}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game with two serious flaws: How could you create a game where you play as an ape without having the ability to throw your own poop or find a monolith to worship?\n\nFor shame, my friends... for shame...\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1688258040, "timestamp_updated": 1688258040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 71, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838875949382781982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79155919": {"recommendationid": "79155919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842352942", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1606333588}, "language": "english", "review": "Important Update: I am very much a controller guy but I feel like this works just fine and well with keyboard and mouse.

This is my story; there are many like it but this one is mine. Day 1: Spent the whole day on two integral things - bed and mate. I made the bed and it was comfy. I courted my mate and \"she\" was sweet. We laid down and did the monkey dance multiple times to have a pregnancy; however, we continuously failed. Day 2: Woke up and decided to analyze my mate. I thought maybe \"she\" was infertile. Turns out \"she\" was actually a dude. Case solved. On to the next mate. I courted, we did the monkey dance, and I initiated the birth. Oh, and I broke a bone.Day 96: I'm cut. Also, broke a bone.Day 97: How do I coagulate!? *10 hours later* DEAD. Day 98: I am now my former mate. So, now I look for a dude mate right? I got this. Broke a bone. Day 99: The dude mate was good to me. Initiated birth after failing to conquer fears and breaking another bone.Day 294: We have two babies. They ride around with me. Apparently it helps neurological growth. Still cant conquer fear to get to meteorite.Day 297: Got to meteorite. Broke a bone. Apparently meteorites cause mutations in my children because of radiation.... *proceeds to rub meteorite all over clan*Year 2: Um... Just now discovered the remains of my mate (whom bled out a year ago) His carcass was only right by my bed the past year... silly me.Year 2 Day 32: Broke a bone but I know how to coagulate my cuts! HA no more monkey death for me!Year 2 Day 34: Found monkey caught by snake. I altered stick with rock and charged in. Saved monkey. Monkey happy. I try to get him to calm down and follow me to my clans settlement. Panther kills me. Year 2 day 35: I am now the next mate up. Find dead body of former mate. Plus dead body of other monkey I do not know. Was she cheating on me? Damn you woman. Found children. Broke bone. Year 4: 3 deaths 6 births. I claimed a new settlement. It wasn't very safe. Some gold lion stormed in and ate an elder. She was useless to me any way since she was infertile. I feel like my clan doubts my leadership abilities... I better sharpen stick.Present day: How the hell do I coagulate this cut again? Fantastic game! Steep learning curve. Push through early frustration and it is amazing!**UPDATE**My clan... We are broken... A dying breed... Please, continue my efforts.. May they not be in vain!*UPDATE*This game was such a gem. Just as the monke evolved, I too evolved.

That has not been programmed into the game and we won't tell you the way that you are supposed to do it or if it is even possible at all.

There isn't really much to do, when I evolved to Millenium Man I had already done almost everything you could do, and the rest of the game is just repetition: walk, discover a landmark, kill, eat, drink, sleep. In every biome you would have the same stuff, so all biomes had food that gave the same benefit as a different food in another biome, and there is always a wild animal that is pretty similar and has the same attack pattern as one from another biome. I did everything, got all achievements, tried to see if at some point the experience would change, and it didn't.\n\nFurthermore, it gives you a terrible experience learning the commands, especially the ones related to fighting. In the end, combat is really easy, but the first time you are attacked, and the tutorial happens in real-time as the attack, so you have to read, understand and react, which will lead you to die because you can't do everything at once - I lost all my tribe twice before I could understand the commands, and after that, I haven't died once until the end of the game, more than 40 hours in. Eventually, you stop worrying about any of the enemies. I had already killed all kinds of predators the map had to offer very early in my evolutionary process. \n\nThere are very few craftables and equipment, and after you get the Basalt Chopper or the Obsidian Scraper, fighting and modifying items gets easy and repetitive. Stuff like eating, sleeping, drinking, and exploring gets boring fast, and before my first big evolutionary step, I was already bored - and still had 4/5 to go. Also, the game gives you no real explanation of how the evolutionary steps happen - you learn by doing it, and I still have no idea when is the best time to evolve, so when I do it, I notice I have done a lot of stuff \"ahead of my time\" in the evolution timeline, which you will only discover it is the main goal of the game when you reach the final objective of the tutorial (which I did like, 35 hours into the game, as it is not mandatory at all).\n\nGiving that, I would only recommend buying it on a big sale; otherwise, you won't get as much value as the videos lead you to believe.", "timestamp_created": 1627760196, "timestamp_updated": 1628572471, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822598099708557129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148319838": {"recommendationid": "148319838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198882571366", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1681342318}, "language": "english", "review": "brought me back to the good ol days", "timestamp_created": 1697433134, "timestamp_updated": 1697433134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822128951549530029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75348582": {"recommendationid": "75348582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040403947", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1599094861}, "language": "english", "review": "ooh ooh ah ah eeeh eeeh hoo hoo hoo ooh ooh ah ah eeeh eeeh hoo hoo hoo ah ah ooh ooh ha ha ha", "timestamp_created": 1599086893, "timestamp_updated": 1599086893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 245, "votes_funny": 143, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820924818515777588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75170127": {"recommendationid": "75170127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019183905", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 651, "last_played": 1658968910}, "language": "english", "review": "I really want to like this game!! I really REALLY do!! This game has some really fun elements that are really well designed and you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. An then the parts of this game that are not so well designed will start to become obvious and they will spoil your fun.\n\nFirstly, the AI. The members of your tribe will follow you although not always the same route through the jungle as you. Often you will get to your destination to find someone is missing. They aren't missing because you went somewhere they cannot go. They went missing because they got stuck on a rock or a branch or something else that is easy to bypass. Trust me, this game doesn't look so wonderful after you lose your first few tribe members due to in game glitches.\n\nThen there are the badly designed parts of the AI. You play hominids. Our earliest ancestors. They were about as close to monkeys as you could get without actually being monkeys. They were amazing climbers................... . So what genius thought up the idea to make any AI controlled hominid who is following you who gets attacked by a snake, crocodile, saber toothed cat or boar, take off running across the ground.\n\nHumans wouldn't exist if hominids were that stupid. As soon as they get attacked they should take to the trees. I saw one getting attacked so I jumped down on the cat with my sharpened stick to distract it. The hominid got away so I turned and got back into a tree. I look back down and the hominid I just saved is running along the ground ignoring the trees, trying to get away from the cat.\n\nWhichever developer came up with that deserves a nice certificate from their employer.

I cannot find a better descriptor than what's in the title.\n\nAncestors is not a 'good' game by any standard measure. The tasks are repetitive, the controls are a little janky (it's basically assassins creed), the combat is just timing-based button prompts and about 10 hours in you can already expect what the rest of the game has to offer in terms of new mechanics.\n\nAt the same time, none of that means shit compared to the absolute dedication to anthropological theory this game proposes. Yes, you do 'return to monke' and 100% in the beginning learning how to grasp even the idea of surviving as an ape is fulfilling in of itself. if that's the fantasy to want to fulfil here it's got enough to leave you satisfied without needing to finish. \n\nHowever by the end of it, I felt more accomplished of being the human I am now than I would ever want to be monke. My body is an absolute fucking miracle of biology that I even have the brain capacity, language process capability and dexterous enough fingers to even type this half ass review. \n\nThe games almost glacial progression system where even the ability to switch an object to another hand is a skill you have to learn (and even to keep that skill is a mechanic) is something you can feel the dedication to the fantasy to a insane degree. Learning how to walk on two legs is not just a steam achievement, it's an achievement. period. Honestly, if there was a 'school edition' of some kind it could qualify as a teaching aid. 90 minutes of this game could get a kid more invested in anthropology than what 4 years of a high school course could do.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game to anyone with the patience and curiosity to commit to the odyssey this game is proposing.

Ancestors is a game that requires you to actually think. A lot of games in this past decade have set a prescient of telling you how the game works and how to access all of your abilities. This game does NOT do this. Whilst you still have the option to play with a tutorial on, I strongly suggest that you don't. The game has a fun little way of actually rewarding you learning how to do things we would call simple today. Take your time, think a lot. And unfortunately a lot the negative reviews you'll read can be boiled down to either they didn't understand the game or the control scheme is terrible. \n\nA lot of people who review games these days quite often think of themselves as betters, as if nothing can outsmart them and that their opinion means more than that of a common casual player, writhing around in your online multiplayer and your indie games. But don't let your potential interest in this game die because they say it isn't worth it. Whilst some reviews are completely fair, the game does have it's issues and I'll discuss those later, I'd like to discuss the reviews that aren't fair, so we'll \"quickly\" discuss the two major complaints.\n\nThe game is too complex: Yes, the game does take sometime to learn. But that's what it's about. You know... EVOLUTION. Honestly some complaints here just seem silly. One person complained that the game refused to use terms like skill trees and skill points, instead it use terms like Neuronal System. Which when you think about it, is spot on. We all have the capacity to learn new things, and the more we practice the more our neural pathways are reinforced. The game is about learning, evolving and becoming the best you can be.\n\nThe control layout: Okay, so this is true, yes it's a pain at first but by the 3rd hour of playtime I was use to it. This also comes with the complaint that the controls are all circumstantial. Which when I think about it, makes sense to do that. Yes it's a little dicky through a controller or a keyboard and sometimes it doesn't register that you want to do this so you grab something else. But when you cut up food your hands behave based on the circumstance. How I control my hands whilst typing is completely different to when I writing something by hand.\n\nI'm done complaining about unfair reviews now. Let's start with some positives. You start right at the bottom of the food chain, can't walk, have to be careful of what your eat or you might get sick. You'll probably spend the first hour or so just adjusting to controls and figuring out the basics. Now, an excellent design choice by the way, you can choose how much help you want. From full HUD and tutorial, to HUD but no tutorial (my choice), to no HUD or Tutorial. This can be changed at any point in the game. This gives you a chance to learn everything for yourself and really be immersed in that evolution process. \n\nGraphics are honestly somewhat disappointing. I suppose I just expected a little more from a game that came out on Consoles in 2019, considering how God of War and Red Dead Redemption II looked. Climbing could've been a little better as well. You hit a cliff that juts out 10mm and you can climb up it, you just stop climbing. Crafting is a little underwhelming. Can't make fire, spears with sharp rocks, huts and so on. The soundtrack is fine but it just seems to cut in and out at the weirdest times. None are specific to a certain area either.\n\nThe selection of animals is great, I knew about a few before I played the game but there is so much more than what I originally thought. And it was a pleasure to kill all but two, but's only because they don't directly attack, mostly just run away. Sound design for them and you is great. The models change as you evolve. Hair and facial features. There's plenty of stages to evolve to. The crafting system is fine, it really just needed more to it. \n\nThere are things that should've been added in this game. Things like more of your species, apparently you're the only clan. I would've liked to see more clans, a bunch in different stages of the evolution process. This could let us have territorial disputes. I would've like more in depth crafting. Especially more things to construct, like huts or even traps. Fire was a big thing to miss out on but I also understand that it'd be very out of place considering the stage we finish at. \n\nI had only one annoyance. Enough to stop playing for a bit at least. The game has a mutation aspect, I do think that is a little annoying but it fine than other than this one time. I needed a mutation to progress but the game wouldn't give it to me and eventually was giving me none for about 6 generations. This annoyed me enough that I stopped playing. When I hopped back on it started working again. I have no idea if it was the game or just a glitch.\n\nIn summary, Ancestors is an enjoyable game that will fill up to around 40 hours of playtime. It's a good puzzle like game that rewards you for exploring and seeing the world, learning and just having fun. If you read the game description and you found it interesting enough to read through my 10 paragraph review then check out the game.

Simply said, Ancestors is an open world survival game. You eat, drink, procreate, sleep, fight, craft and go out exploring (not essentially in this order). Sounds fun? Maybe in the first 5 hours or so, before you realize those are all the actions the game has to offer. You repeat this set of actions on different parts of the map until you make enough discoveries that make you and your clan evolve through million of years. Most of these actions can be done by simply holding down a button, while some like fighting only include one boring QTE. Sprinting and jumping is tied to the same button and often lead me to some risky moments when I didn't want to jump off the tree but I did and got injured. Overall commands feel really clunky and not intuitive.\n\nThe tutorial is mostly lacking and doesn't really explain things well, which can result in some confusing moments when the game asks you to do something, but you have no idea where you should start. Even the UI is so minimal that during the first hours you will have an hard time understanding your stats and the useless radar on the corner.\n\nThe progression system is disappointing and completely defeats the game purpose. After million of years you are supposed to evolve and retain what you learned, instead you are forced to restart with mostly your basic skills and grind all over again. Every time you evolve you respawn on a random location that you previously explored, meaning you can be brought back to any of your first explored areas and will need to move to your latest ones if you want to continue discovering new lands. Having to restart from distant locations not only is time consuming, but it's also quite frustrating. Unfortunately, the world around you stays exactly the same with no variation after million of years and the same goes for animals.\n\nClan growing options are disappointing too. You can make them follow you but they are completely brainless and most of the time they will just stare at a predator coming for them instead of getting on a tree like I do. This means that bringing your clan with you while exploring can be completely annoying as you have to do lot of baby sitting and if they die you will lose \"points\" when evolving or possibly risk a game over due to extinction. Even after evolving they never really help you in any crafting or fighting activity; you need to put items on their hands so they can replicate what you do. So while you evolve they basically stay the same, unable to do anything on their own without your commands.\n\nThe open world looks good and has different biomes, but it's maybe too big and there is not enough variety of content. There are only a few animals and hostile predators, some food and a few materials to craft. For some reason they didn't add snakes on trees, which makes them the safest way to move around the map (although not always will be possible).\n\nIn conclusion, Ancestors is the classic game that looks great from the trailers and probably for the first ten hours too, but just like you learn how to survive and discover new lands, you will also unveil the hidden repetitiveness of the gameplay and the pointless progression system. Fair warning: while I didn't play the game 'til the end and probably never will, I have to admit that the ending I saw online could have gotten me mad, particularly after 40+ hours of gameplay.

Essentially this game could be best described as a crafting survival simulation where you have to craft the crafting tree.  You do that by \"experimenting\" with what you start with and grow from there.  Experimenting is in quotes because as a video game you're limited in what you can do by default and really you'll not so much experiment as do everything with everything.  New item?  Hold X to inspect.  New food?  Eat it.  When it says experiment it means hold the X or A buttons, maybe swap hands and smack item A with item B.  While thematically it makes sense its a routine found in every crafting game.\n\nThe concept of fear is lack of familiarity but becoming more familiar again involves routine which again makes sense but isn't fun.  You investigate for things you've already discovered, eat some food, etc. and you become less fearful of new areas.  Its as if you were crafting courage because functionally its an in-world crafting tree just like \"experimenting\" is.\n\nEvolution is one of the least explained mechanics in the game to the point that 30 min after I left the menu during the tutorial for it I forgot how to access it.  There's no way to refer to tutorials after they're gone and the controls menu has no evolution menu because all the controls are contextual.  I can't fathom why the game doesn't let you refer to tutorials later as now I would either have to google how to do something I think should be easily accessible or start over.  Which I pretty much was at that point anyway because two or three of my clan members died due to one hit kill tigers.\n\nEverything about my 90 min of playtime was interesting for sure.  Of that I won't deny.  But was it fun?  Nope.  Was it challenging?  Nope.  Given my clan is the most important thing in the game its a shame none of them have a personality but they do have a name I have to navigate the intelligence menu to access.  I have no motivation to see any of them survive and death is passed off as you immediately switch to another clan member.

The soundtrack is beautiful as well as the ambiance of the wild... if you're part of the people who made this happen; THANK YOU <3 As a nerd with a bit of science-y interest this game is amazing and fascinating to explore. \n\nTo the 'review'/helpful hints (SPOILERS)\nYou will need patience for this game and definitely use a controller. I'm not understanding the bad reviews' that, in spite of, I still got this game and it plays fine. I feel it's more of a user issue and maybe they need to get better with it. This is a simulation of our origin; you will have to LEARN EVERYTHING because everything is new to you in game. Take a Dark Souls approach to this game and if you have ever played Conan Exiles you will understand what I mean when I say you have to 'unlock/learn' everything like what is water(legitimately  you don't know what water is. It's ok. Don't panic). \n\nTo that you need to analyze everything and I mean EVERYTHING('scan'/interact/eat/drink/touch/smell etc). But first and foremost make sure you have a baby on your back when doing/learning anything new. The controls are very basic and no more complicated than you make them. Don't overthink things. The game gives you all kinds of help but only ONCE and then you're on your own. The exception being a very distinctive screen signal and sound for when to let go of the 'charge' button depending on what your doing that's 'charging'. Don't release before this signal! If at first you don't succeed then try again.\n\nI'm assuming I'm still in the tutorial area and I'm fine with that. THIS IS NOT A RUSH GAME. The game even tells you to take your time and it's true. \n\nAs someone in the non-het community I thought it cool that anyone can partner with anyone(mind you this happens in nature all the time so if you got issues with that then i don't know what to tell you). If you want to reproduce a FERTILE Lady and Duder can get together etc but anyone/couple can 'raise' the baby. Speaking of baby they help in many ways. Keep one with you at all times and take care of the group. \n\nYeah this is more of a 'guide' than a review but I didn't feel the need to gush forever about the game that I feel speaks for itself. Maybe not a game for younger minds or those looking for instant gratification. There's so much I love about this game and I've yet to leave the tutorial area( I think? Dunno if it's an area or if I'm in the actual game and the tutorial was the helpful hints that came up at the beginning lol). I can definitely see having to put in LOTS of hours if you want to do it right. Rushing will only leave you with poor evolution which will probably be worse for you in the long run. It's a grind that pays off.

A very well-made survival game, which feels top-notch by many dignities both in that specific genre and in the overall gaming experience plane. If you're a fan of survival games in general, if you're a letsplayer with some fanbase of individuals who would rather watch other people playing than do it themselves, well... Don't read my review, don't try to learn anything about this game before starting it. Just get it and dive into it. And make sure that you run it on the maximum visual settings available for your rig because it is really beautiful.\n\nHowever, I am one of those players who felt a big disappointment while playing and finishing this game. So yeah, please, Do learn a bit about that Ancestors project before you start it.\n\nThe first sights are very, Very generous. We have a big seamless open world to wander about, with many different biomes, full of primeval lifeforms. We have hundreds, maybe thousands of various items to interact with, scattered around the whole map, and the thing that amazed me most? The game remembers each item you deal with. If you've dropped some stick somewhere, be sure that you'll find it even if you run around the whole map after that, and change the generation (meaning, 15 years of the game time will pass by). Even if it's not always that much realistic, it is still gross. AND this is an important piece of knowledge about Ancestors, because every time you reload your game, it replenishes all basic items in their places PLUS adds everything you merged and stored somewhere. So, one of the first things that you really should know about this game is that you can do a stack overflow error in it if you will try to store around any items besides those that you really need at the given moment. Also, don't try to build much, especially walls, because they are useless. The game can spawn a tiger right on our back, and no wall can hold it. The only thing you need walls there - is to build it 5 times to get an in-game progress achievement. Sadly, this pattern goes much wider in the game than just walls. In the end, the timings in the game are like - first 1-2 hours of wandering around and learning the ropes, then several more hours to really dive in the game, explore the map, see all the biomes and lifeforms in it, interact with all items and their possibilities. Then you change the generation - it's the basic game mechanic needed to evolve your creature into something more universal and capable. In theory. And wow! You need to develop your next generation right from the start! Not from the point where you left your progress, no - right from the same basic interactions with everything around. This might be normal from the scientific point of view - but not from the point of gameplay interest. Because it takes dozens of hours of doing [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQoVHqveQ980]Exactly the Same[/url] routine things, to make some development on the long scale.\n\nYou see, Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey is built around the idea of changing generations, where every next generation is more capable than the previous one. But! There is a very limited amount of such capabilities. In the end, the game feels like a big timesink, where you do all the same things over and over and over, without actually progressing anyhow. Even worse, sometimes you might occasionally learn something that good (like the ability to constantly walk on two legs) that you'll not be able to repeat in several (many) next generations. The longer you play, the more so-called \"game progress\" seems to be quite real (non-game) regression. You literally waste too much time there. 15 times to hit a stick to sharpen it, and it breaks even faster than those one-time \"shivs\" in the Mad Max game. And you need Many of those sticks. Sure, with some progress, you'll be making this tool with only 5 hits instead of 15, but it's still too boring to perform it that often. And the itch that really kills me? The \"development tree\". To re-enable already learned skill, after you change the generation, you need to gather \"neural energy\", perform even more of the same routine actions like more swimming, more walking on 2 legs, more smelling and listening around, and after that - go to the progress screen and WAIT with your finger on the button while some imaginary line \"fills\" the \"neuronet\". I mean it's OK for the first time - but you have to do it over and over again!\n\nSo, to be fair, I have to note that aesthetically Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey is one of the best immersion-type games on the market. And this is probably the best visual experience about the primeval world, not only in the videogames world, but also around non-scientific books like those from J.-H. Rosny a\u00een\u00e9, or movies like \"Ao, le dernier N\u00e9andertal\"... I might be imagining things, but it seems that some French people are really into that era more than most others around the globe, by the way.\n\nAncestors have nice visuals, an interesting and quite appropriate soundtrack, and even the gameplay basics, with all that minimalistic user interface where the game expects players to understand what's going on without any HUD or other crutches. Sure, if you would play Ancestors only to see four-tusk primeval elephants, and try to play a cat-and-mouse game with the saber-toothed tiger - it's a very worthy pick. The best in the world.\n\nHowever, as a complete game, Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey sucks greatly. The grinding part is way too cumbersome, the amount of different events and scenes is too small, and it really hurts to do everything, especially watching the neurons \"growing\" in the development screen. It would really help the game experience, if the developers were aimed to make more seamlessness in the game progress, as much as they added it to their open world. Instead, they deliberately made too many things to prolong the gameplay time, by all the wrong means, such as those one-time spears that you need to make over, and over, and over again. Because there is a tiger that will spawn on your back every second when you're not on the tree. Oh, and if you're on the tree, it will be a giant eagle instead.\n\nMy mark is 6/10. A very beautiful immersion experience, if you taste games only by a short sip, and dreadful time sink, if you really want to see it [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMYuTsNW9pQ]through[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1614863797, "timestamp_updated": 1614872885, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 117, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798053979873657227", "comment_count": 33, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97899153": {"recommendationid": "97899153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272444863", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1713534726}, "language": "english", "review": "reject humanity return to monke", "timestamp_created": 1629434887, "timestamp_updated": 1629434887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796782314777374268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75170583": {"recommendationid": "75170583", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992327872", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1221, "last_played": 1669222788}, "language": "english", "review": "Im really enjoying the game, most negative reviews seem to be about the lack of tutorial/direction. The point of the game is to work out how to do things,to be curious like a monkey and try different things to see what will happen, to be honest i worked out most of the stuff before I was supposed to (having not unlocked the skills in evolution), for instance spear fishing despite not being able to eat fish yet and just end up poisoning myself. Discovery/curiosity is a major part of the game so if your not into that and need to be directed in what to do, i recommend skipping this game.\n\nControls are somewhat difficult to begin with but soon become easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. \n\nthe only really negative in my mind while playing is some of the game mechanics, children are the future i get that and thats fine. My problem is that when you advance your tribe, the adults who you had been using become elders and the babies become the adults, yet the new elders seem to forget everything you have just gone through learning with them as adults (unless locked in, you can only lock in as many skills as you have babies), as the entire tribe share the same skill set. so learning something with one monkey on his own, when you get back to home the whole tribe knows how to do it. The skills remain unlocked but some sort of neural currency is required to activate them again... only you earn less of that currency repeating the same actions. so in effect your tribe loses its speed in progressing the longer it survives.\n\none technical problem I have encountered is that if you have a large tribe following you on an expedition and you shake a date tree for too long the game crashes. other than that the game plays fluidly for hours.", "timestamp_created": 1598798562, "timestamp_updated": 1598798562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.7966422438621521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 62, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 4166, "total_negative": 1252, "total_reviews": 5418}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwAAAHilz+AE": "Mon Apr 22 23:48:30 2024"}}
