I don't know why they've all been stripped of parts, though. It's probably a balance thing. A bit annyoing having to hunt for so many parts, then to carry them back to the vehicle you want, but whatever, at least it give you purpose.\n2) You can have a camper for a mobile base! Yes, as I've said, it was the main selling point for me. Now the camper's a bit small, but I've managed to cram a double-bed, several containers and a large shelf inside it, so I'm quite happy. Still, would be nice to have RVs as well.\n3) You can use paint to recolour your vehicle and camper. Finally, I can live my hippie camper dream!\n4) Large map to explore. I've not explored for long, but from what I've gathered there are supposed to be several zones, so having a vehicle is indeed important.\n5) Storage, storage everywhere. Portable storage, vehicle storage, a cart that you can drag around to carry all that storage. It's useful, and it helps to not need to build your own containers, like so many survival sims make you do.\n6) I actually like the fact that you can pick up random props and take them with you. Lets you make your base your own, and the prop placement mechanic is pretty good (my only qualm is that I sometimes pick stuff up instead of \"using\" it, but this can be fixed by changing the key bindings, I think).\n7) Wild, non-zombified animals. I don't actually know of any zombie survival sims that feature non-zombified animals. Here, though, I've come across two bears, just chilling around. The game is supposed to have other animals also, but I've not met any so far.\n8) You can modify your guns. You've got suppressors, sights, grips, stocks, whatever. And the gun-mods actually help, the supressor prevents enemies from getting alerted, for example.\n9) The game has a day\\ night cycle, changing weather, and apparently seasons. Haven't reached winter yet, and I could really use some rain, but whatever, it's still good.\n10) The game can be pretty.\n\nThe bad:\n1) The zombie AI is pretty dumb. The zombies run at you mindlessly, but if you climb on something, or close a door in front of them, they just stand there, helplessly flailing their arms at you. Yet they also have enough intelligence to run for cover when in direct sunlight? That's just weird.\n2) Grammar. Way I understand it, English is not the developer('s') native language, so technically this can be forgiven, especially since you can indeed understand what the game is telling you, but it just irks me when I see some of the weird grammar. Get a proof-reader, please!\n3) The crafting is actually pretty complex, which is pretty good. But most of it requires a workbench, which sucks.\n4) Some resources are way too abundant, but you have little use for them until you have access to a workbench, so they just take up space in your storage. I've gathered up so many rags, so much scrap metal, and so many 'components', yet I can't do anything to them! (again, not until I get to a workbench).\n5) Quivers. You can find bows and arrows in the world, but can't use them, because you didn't find a quiver. As an amateur archer in real life, and a fan of achery in video-games, I find this design choice really frustrating.\n6) Using some of the items is just busywork. So there are two ways you can carry an item: in your inventory (not all items) or in your hands (most items). The problem is that if you want to actually use some of the items, you need first hold them in your hands, because, for whatever reason, the game doesn't acknowledge you having them if they're in your inventory. I understand that it's a realism thing, but using an item straight out of your inventory is just a far better design choice.\n7) Daytime is way too short. At 6 PM it's already pitch black outside, meaning that you have to go to sleep for 12 whole hours, unless you want to run around fighting or dodging zombies. The game supposedly features seasons, but there doesn't seem to be a difference in daylight between summer and winter.\n\nThe ugly:\n1) The game is badly optimized, even if your computer can run it on highest settings, you still need to wait for all the assets to render before you can actually start playing, and even then you might have to deal with props just popping into view as you go. I've seen a playthrough where the player was driving his car pretty fast and crashed into a broken bus that wasn't there just a moment ago, because the game didn't manage to render it in. Was a bit funny, but it's actually a serious problem.\n\nSuggestions:\nAside from what I've written above, I'd like the option to switch off zombies\\ bandits\\ hostile animals when starting a new game. Sometimes you just want to explore the game world, to see how long you can survive without some mob constantly knocking down your door. Green Hell lets you do this, The Long Dark lets you do this, so why not? I get that the game's whole plot revolves around zombies, but options are always a good thing. Project Zomboid lets you toggle zombies off at new game, so why not? \nAnother suggestion is to let us wield weapons lefthanded. I know it's extra work for the devs, but since you're already giving us the option to use the left hand for secondary items, why not make it fully useable?\n\nOverall, I like this game. If the devs fix its standing issues, it might just become a genre staple.", "timestamp_created": 1707532727, "timestamp_updated": 1707533141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773420214653015137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157099526": {"recommendationid": "157099526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131737336", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9197, "last_played": 1709523815}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely love this game - even in early access, it remains so fun.

I used to like the game and it was running pretty smoothly, but when I tried it again just now, things were loading much slower and the performance was a lot worse. I tried to change the graphic settings but the buttons and sliders were barely working at all. Like, I wanted to change the mouse sensitivity because I thought it was a little too high, and everytime I clicked on apply and closed the pause menu, the sens would just reset to the default value. Every time. And that's not the only weird thing. I wanted to open a container and to my surprise the pick up interface on the screen showed key \"none\". In fact all interactions showed none. I thought it was some bug that was caused during the loading screen, so I simply exited the game and loaded the same world. And as another surprise; I suddenly just went uncon, and my hunger and thrist showed red. How's that possible? I legit exited the game literally where I spawned in and I hadn't played on that world much at all. And the weirdness sure doesn't end there. As I click on the exit game button (so I could go back to the menu and create a new world) my game just go boom crash and the Unreal Engine crash window appears. Wtf.\n\nSo I restart the game and create a new world, just to find out that all my keybindings have been set to none, and that's why I couldn't interact with anything. Why the hell would they just unbind themselves? I also noticed that my sens was set to the value I wanted to give it earlier, and upon closing the pause menu it tried to reset itself to the default value again and even asked if I wanted to save the settings.\n\nSo I only have one question: what kind of a buggy mess has this game turned into?", "timestamp_created": 1707005456, "timestamp_updated": 1707005456, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630448281764984131", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158993724": {"recommendationid": "158993724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129702159", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1713351743}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is quite okay. However, after playing for more than 10 hours, it becomes irritating due to bugs. It has a significant number of bugs, and I mean A LOT.\n\n- You can drive the ATV backwards as fast as you would drive it normally.\n- The ATV gas doesn't run out.\n- While driving, on a random fabric, the ATV just flew into the sky.\n- When in a vehicle, zombies don't attack you.\n- Vehicle movement is very inconvenient.\n- I placed logs into the wood storage, but every time I came back, the logs had disappeared.\n- Zombies can't run upstairs.\n- Sometimes, when in the inventory, pressing on a weapon/gun causes it to randomly shoot.\n- When there is too much weight, it says you can't jump, but you still can; it just displays the message.\n- There was an engine in one car, but when I came back, it was already gone.\n- There were random shelves in the garage. I took them out, even destroyed them, and placed lockers in the same spot. After a while, the shelves randomly appeared again on top of my placed lockers.\n- Zombies always appear at the same spot in houses, etc. For example, when walking into the same house again, you already know there is going to be a zombie or zombies. It makes the game predictable.\n\nThere are more, but I can't remember them all. The game is fun and interesting; however, the bugs make the experience less enjoyable. The map could be bigger, and there could be more NPCs around the map, not only bandits. Also, there are random bunkers in the forest that you can't enter. Initially, it makes you excited that you have found something, but you can't get in. There could also be way more variety of zombies.\n\nOverall, the game is great but needs bugs fixed and more content added.

I just played for like 4 hours and managed to make a car functional for the first time since getting the game, only for it all to be swept away from me because I climbed a tower and the ladder at the top spit me out over the edge and I fell to my death. I then lost most of the things I brought with me upon reviving (which arent dropped in the world, they are deleted), and on my way to sprint back to my car I fell maybe 5 feet and died on impact while walking down the side of a slope.\n\nTo the dev; I really hope you get this game functional. As of now its rather buggy, the human AI either 1 shot you as soon as they see you or they dont shoot at all just jog at you, the zombie AI either tank a shotgun shell or die in one hit and if they touch you, forget about it. The worry in them isnt the numbers, its 1 of them managing to hit you 4 times because you had to resort to melee combat which either can 2 shot a zombie to the head or feel like you arent hitting them at all. And the one boss zombie I fought could tank 30 shotgun shells. The amount of stuff you lose for dying is insane. It almost makes me want to only use craftable melee weapons but I know if anything sees me at all Im doomed. Resources are abundant but of the things I dont need at all.

It's one of the best aspects of this game.\r\n- it requires a bit of brain power to figure things out. Crafting system is good but it doesn't tell you much. \r\n- the map is good size with plenty to explore. I love that it's split into areas like town area, industrial area and hunting specific areas. You HAVE to go exploring if you want to survive. I find that other games have an abundance of resources which make it too easy to stay full and hydrated, and too comfortable in one spot.\r\n- the damage system is fun too. Eating less than fresh food or falling from too high a height will cause injury.\r\n- Graphics are simple but pleasing. \r\n- I LOVE the harvesting system in this game. You can use up the whole animal, guts, fat and all. Harvesting plant foods will give you seeds but you won't find them growing naturally. \r\n- Sounds are quite nice too. Nothing to overwhelming.\r\n- the mist event definitely gives me some chills. Not being able to see my enemies until they come running towards me is frightening but so much fun!\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- there are a LOT of bugs that need attention. \r\n- sometimes I get stuck somewhere silly and can't get out. \r\n- some objects move about after loading back into a saved game. Some objects respawn but can't be moved,  then disappear again later. \r\n- there are no instructions on how to do things, so for some players that might be a minus. \r\n- some crafting recipes are very expensive, more expensive that they should be. \r\n- screen loading time takes a while. Longer than it should, in my opinion.\r\n- i had to set my controls before i could play the game. Normally it's pre-set by the developer\r\n- in general the game needs a bit more optimization. \r\n- some descriptions have broken English. I think developer's first language isn't English. Doesn't really bother me but should be fixed for final release. \r\n\r\nRegardless of the issues this game has a whole lot of potential and I'm looking forward to seeing what the next update will bring.!", "timestamp_created": 1711145512, "timestamp_updated": 1711145512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576271176338195801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158893128": {"recommendationid": "158893128", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995133113", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 14799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14520, "last_played": 1709195546}, "language": "english", "review": "game has gone back to a shitty mess it will never be finished at this rate.", "timestamp_created": 1708525478, "timestamp_updated": 1708525478, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555240452289581299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157683085": {"recommendationid": "157683085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135819165", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 76086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 68282, "last_played": 1710257574}, "language": "english", "review": " i think the more updates it gets the worse it get map is to small it was better game yrs ago", "timestamp_created": 1707178559, "timestamp_updated": 1707178559, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157678768": {"recommendationid": "157678768", "author": {"steamid": "76561199116408480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 5189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5141, "last_played": 1709409542}, "language": "english", "review": "Every update seems to bring more issues.

Other recent reviewers are correct.  The game is currently unplayable.  I have a very high end system  that Ive played Mist on before.  My previous, older system could also run Mist well. When I tried to play Mist today, The screen locked up the moment that any landscape loaded.  In other words, I got through the \"A mysterious thing happened with mysterious fog\" screen without a hitch,  and then had no problem selecting \"new game\" and then another menu type screen(cant remember exactly what it was) but as soon as the game loaded up the character/environment, it froze solid.  Could see the general landscape and mountains in the distance but absolutely no bloom. So, at least for now, and despite the fact that I liked playing Mist, I must change my review to negative.  One cannot consider a game to be positive if the game cannot be played.  Dont waste your money until you know if this issue has been fixed.\n\n\n\n\nMist is a great start on a good Zombie survival/crafting type game.  Its quite similar to 7 days to die but I like the graphics style and over all game atmosphere better so far.  There are no minibikes but you can fix up and drive cars which I also like better.  One thing to know before you buy Mist is that there is pretty much no tutorial to speak of at the moment.  This isnt a huge deal since all I did was start a new game once I had made my mistakes and figured things out better.  I keep seeing other reviewers complain that multiplayer hasnt been instituted in Mist yet.  Well, Im not sure that it ever will be.  Right in the main description for this game it states as clear as day that its a single player game.  Im ok with that too since I prefer to play single player in all my games.  So anyway, for the small price, Mist is a great deal.  Its fun enough as is and if the devs keep on going with it, I cant see how they can go wrong.

Perfect, there are plenty of rocks and sticks around! But they aren't the right rocks and sticks the game wants you to have. They're just static objects to populate the environment, you can't actually pick them up. Need scrap metal or wood and see a huge pile of it? Too bad, it's just a static object. See some cars off in the distance and hope they have some stuff in their trunks to loot? Too bad, they're just static objects. Have a crowbar in hand and can see items in a locked motel room with a HUGE glass window? Too bad, you can't break the window.

They had a practically complete map with a good amount to do and were originally working on expanding that original pre .4.1 map which I was really excited about, but with the .5 update they put our a new map that has nowhere near the content or locations of their previous map and I can't for the life of me figure out why they just threw away all of that work and reverted back to what is essentially not even a half finished game. They had a solid foundation to work from before 0.5 but with this new map the game just isn't worth it anymore I will continue to hope they go back to their original map and plan of expanding it, but right now I can't recommend it which is sad because it has great potential and honestly was one of my favorite games to play.

On that note I have some suggestions for the developer that would make the game better!\n\n1. radomized spawning - I think if you spawed at a different base everytime you start a new game would make it a little more interesting I know their is random spawning already but for diverse.\n2. more crafting recipes for structures\n\n3. co-op mode might be a good idea for the future\n\n4. rebuilding broken down buildings and living in them such as crafting doors and such.\n\n5. maybe a bigger map in the future\n\nI would like the developer to focus on the big things before he implements harder aspects to the game so maybe co-op can come for the future.\n\nIf the creator is looking at this maybe implementing this would be amazing for the future.\n\nNice job on your game!", "timestamp_created": 1534808741, "timestamp_updated": 1535309384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 310, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855506837368011475", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64831207": {"recommendationid": "64831207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135913580", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 2382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1064, "last_played": 1650915962}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice.

I'm currently 65 hours into it and still having a blast. There are some bugs that you will come across but that's to be expected with an early access game. Let me dive right in and give some thoughts and helpful tips for new players or those thinking of buying the game.\n1. When you first spawn in, look around and loot all you can. Be sure to grab the backpack nearby too and check the little wooden container. You don't want to stay here. There is absolutely 0 protection from anything. Your best bet is to find a cabin or some sort or a white house and start setting up shop even if it's just temporary.\n2. Daytime starts at 5 am (the birds will start singing) and nighttime starts at around 19:30ish, although I've never encountered a zombie before 22:00... yet.\n3. Mist encounters last anywhere from 1 to 4 hours. You can hide up in water towers (zombies can't climb... yet), inside cabins that have no boarded up windows (zombies can break through boarded up windows and come inside to kill you - if the window isn't boarded up, then zombies can't enter through it), inside drivable vehicles if you've restored them, on top of the taller army vehicles, some of the motel rooms are zombie free and safe to hide in, the ranger towers are great, upstairs in the white houses there are bedrooms with doors you can shut and be safe. There are other places, but those are just a few that are easy to come across.\n4. Hitting TAB brings up some basic stats as well as the time.\n5. Read the dang tutorial. It's got some helpful beginning information about your stats and such.\n6. I try to carry at least 1 food, 1 water, 1 bandage and a way to defend myself at all times.\n7. Don't eat uncooked food or drink unsafe water. It tells you if food is raw or not and it says safe/unsafe on water. Colas are common and always safe. Potatoes NEED to be cooked. The other veggies can be eaten without cooking.\n8. The livestock fencing keeps the zombies out. You can place then build them over the boarded up windows and make your building safe to live in. Zombies don't break them at all. I like to live in the white houses, use the livestock fencing to block all the boarded up windows and build a big area out front that holds my blacksmith and other items. Also gives me a place to stab the zombies in the face with a spear without getting hit if I want that extra loot! The zombies will gather at whatever livestock gates you've put along your livestock fence and you can safely stab them and collect loot after the mist or night has ended.\n9. The biggest tip I can give you is to save often. Get a good loot run? Save. Kill a bear? Save. Save. Save. If you die, you have 2 options, respawn and chance a bunch of your stuff being gone or quit to menu and resume from your last save point. If you save often it's never a big loss to quit to menu and come back into the game.\n10. Temperature is currently irrelevant as of right now. There is no winter. There is no pants or jacket in game yet.\n11. There is no map in game (yet?), but you can easily google search for one. \n12. Suitcases, lockers, and some of the small wooden crates can be storage containers. You can pick them up with M and move them to your base.\n13. You can search the cars that don't have tinted windows. Don't forget to check under the hood for gas (if you've got a jerrycan) or spare car parts. There is usually goodies in the trunk and sometimes inside the cars themselves. The vehicles with tinted windows you can destroy with an axe or sledgehammer for metal scraps, components, wood, car parts, etc...\n14. If your fatigue bar reaches 0, your stamina will NOT regenerate. The only way to fix that is to rest or sleep. Sometimes eating/drinking helps if your fatigue/stamina is low since it forces you to rest a bit. So make sure you're sleeping regularly to keep that fatigue bar in good condition.\n15. If you rescue one of the AI's, you can give them a gun. They will help defend your base.\n16. Absolutely under no circumstances log out of the game or save inside of a mine. You will fall through the world and die with no way out except to respawn and lose a bunch of stuff in the process.\n17. Be on the lookout for backpacks to increase your inventory size. They are spread out everywhere. Bandit camps usually have 1, ranger towers, starting locations, etc. Just walk up and hit F on them to expand your inventory.\n18. Once you repair a vehicle, try to keep some spare parts and gas in the trunk or in a storage container if you've got a truck. If something goes wrong,  you will want to have them handy to fix your vehicle so you can get home easily. \n19. You can put storage containers in the bed of the trucks you fix up. Lockers, suitcases, small wooden crates, or you can simply stand on the tailgate and yeet items into the back from your inventory. You can put items like the sawbench, workbench, water containers etc back there too. \n20. When you're searching for loot, be sure to check nightstands, dressers, cupboards, wardrobes, anything with drawers. There is hidden goodies in there sometimes.\n21. Be careful with heights. It doesn't take much to get a sprained ankle at which point you will be stuck walking until it heals 30+ in game minutes (and that's if you're lucky and have painkillers). If you're out in the world that makes you an easy target for zombies, bandits and bears since you can't run away.\n22. If you're having a hard time finding items on the ground like sticks, rocks, feathers, leaves.. you can turn down the foliage in the settings. Sorta cheaty but who am I to judge, I'm blind as a bat and use this trick myself hehe.\nI really hope they add a co-op or multiplayer function to this game. It would absolutely make it 100% better to be able to play with friends. Also the ability to mod it would be fantastic too!\nRemember, save often and have fun!\nThis review has been posted on 5/10/2021 and the game is subject to change which can make some of these tips useless in later releases.", "timestamp_created": 1620681338, "timestamp_updated": 1620681338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.84959942102432251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133613902": {"recommendationid": "133613902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131635246", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 945, "last_played": 1702353039}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the game just wish that it would come out with co-op.", "timestamp_created": 1677360717, "timestamp_updated": 1677360717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846775352954864502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45594351": {"recommendationid": "45594351", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970279423", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 4071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3674, "last_played": 1552356742}, "language": "english", "review": "Is it fun, yes.  You feel like you need to struggle to survive, but it wasn't so hard I felt the need to rage quit.  The threat of the bears during the day and zombies in some of the houses, add just the right amount of fear of wandering around during the day.  And sets the stage for heightened fear for going out at night and raw terror if you're caught outside during the mist events that happen periodically.\n\nThe dev is regularly responding to input from the players and has added content on a regular basis.

Them Z`s attacked my house and i honestly felt scared. I have not had a game actually make me afraid since i was a kid playing Resident evil. This game is SO Great and i will support it in any way i can. Yes there is a few glitches and bugs here and there but that isnt surprising with it being early access. I have had no issue with game play so far besides a few cars have the sun roof floating above the car. Besides that there is nothing bad i can really say about this game. I love it. I Cant wait to find survivors and build my home up. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes crafting Survival games. Just remember to watch out for that mist =P.\n\nFrom what i heard there is only one dev working on this game and i think hes doing great. I have read some the negative reviews but crap if someone can really complain about spending a entire $10.99 on this game then they have issues in my opinion. Phone apps want 9.99 for a stupid gun that breaks 9 mins after using it. I have spent 60+ on games ten times crappier then this in early access. I read another review about this being a mix between the forest and 7D2D and that made me laugh.

So how does Mist do? Well at this point it is abundantly clear that this game is in early access. There are many bugs throughout almost every feature in this game and it really does hinder the experiences at this point of the games development.\n\n   Although this game does manage to still be fun if you can really just come to roll with the punches and get use to reloading all the time. The game also does kind of lose it's immersion probably at hour 2. You will realize that zombies can be killed easily by sprinting and timing your hits, and they never will chase you outside of the houses they spawn in. The mist it's self (while an interesting concept) is not really all that scary because of the ability to abuse the zombie's poor AI.\n\n  Wildlife at this point really only contains bears and chickens. Chickens are pointless and Bears can be killed easily late game with the amount of ammo you have, or avoided outright. \n\n  Cars are pretty easy to repair but I did find myself just running around despite my fixed car more than driving so that whole mechanic can be avoided if you don't mind sprinting everywhere.\n\n  The AI really does have to be the worst part of this game so far. Zombies (as stated above) rarely pose much of a threat to you at all, where as every bandit has been coded to be a top class Navy Seal with the same health as zombies and the laser precise aim of an elite super soldier. You will find yourself save scumming a ton just to find the right way to abuse their AI and wipe out their camps. \n  \n  Lastly the map is very sparse. Many houses have nothing at all in them, some are untextured, almost all are copy and paste versions of each other and the map really just feels like you are in a big rock surrounded bowl with either instant kills walls, or no collision rocks you can walk through.\n\n[h1] Verdict\t[/h1]\n\n  While yes, Mist Survival does have an abundance of issues; the game has a ton of potential. Even at it's broken state I found myself reaching 6 hours of gameplay relatively fast and without much of a grind. If you have some money lying around and want something fun to mess around with, pick this game up. If you are looking to spend your money on a complete and polished game then I would say wait a year or 2 on this title. \n\nGameplay and mechanics: 6/10\nSound: 6/10\nGraphics and design: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1535858149, "timestamp_updated": 1535858149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822083115577697754", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45611468": {"recommendationid": "45611468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171674489", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 4698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4575, "last_played": 1586296800}, "language": "english", "review": "everything is good about this game but the only thing it needs to add a co-op to make it alot fun then playing by yourself\n\n8/19/21: Still no co-op to this game after 3 years.", "timestamp_created": 1541287262, "timestamp_updated": 1629394089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816021859645843506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62549860": {"recommendationid": "62549860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309090135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 260, "last_played": 1580249345}, "language": "english", "review": "wish it had multiplayer but its not bad", "timestamp_created": 1580188090, "timestamp_updated": 1580188090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812539875507354736", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55406337": {"recommendationid": "55406337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139374490", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1565, "last_played": 1702342668}, "language": "english", "review": "First, the negatives- Smallish map, Bandit snipers that can see through trees, and idiot allies at your base camp THAT WON'T LEAVE THE F****** DOOR SHUT AT NIGHT. The NPC allies seem to be a bit broken, as one of mine, (Scott) won't go and cut wood. You assign him the task to cut down trees, but he just stands there with axe in hand, not doing anything. Assigning crafting tasks does work, however. Also, arming your allies is a waste, because when the infected get into your base either through a window or the aforementioned F****** DOOR THAT THE ALLIES KEEP OPENING AT NIGHT, they just stand there and won't attack the enemies.\n\nPositives- This is not a game that holds your hand. Combat can be tough if you rush right into it. I see this as a positive because if you go up against a bear in real life with just a hand weapon, you probably gonna die. I also love that the vehicles you can repair serve two different purposes- SUV to give you basically more pockets when scavenging, and the pickup truck lets you bring back big movable items like water containers, lockers, and crafting tables. The best part of the game I feel is the sense of fear. Kill a bear and start butchering, and suddenly you see the Mist developing around you during the passage of time feature. Go to sleep, and be woken up by a noise. Either you hear nothing more, or you hear monsters outside your door.\nI'm really enjoying this game. I hope the developer keeps updating, because I'd like to see the military and office buildings you find opened up to be explored and scavenged. This game has a lot of potential, because it has a pretty solid foundation already. It does have its bugs, but is definitely a good experience, just as long as Kate SHUTS THE F****** DOOR AT NIGHT.", "timestamp_created": 1570023696, "timestamp_updated": 1570023696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 50, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809171080589294434", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121689332": {"recommendationid": "121689332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042122929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 948, "last_played": 1662308437}, "language": "english", "review": "Best way to describe this game is \"mediocre with potential\".\n\nThe GOOD(ish?)\n- The environments look nice.\n- Looting buildings is fun. (Sadly you run out of buildings to loot too fast and loot doesn't respawn.\n- Exploration is fun up until you run out of things to explore.\n\nThe Bad\n- It is FAR too grindy. Crafting recipes require too much in materials and farming said materials takes too long. Reliable ways of farming materials like say ore require exploits such as saving the game and reloading it to respawn the ore. Its really awful and is a requirement because even 1 node of iron ore only MAYBE gives enough for like 2 ingots. When the recipes call for upwards of 8 or 10 ingots? This feels horrible to play.\n\n- Alot of the crafting recipes are just ridiculous. I mean why do I need leaves and tree bark to make lashing?? I go into houses and barns and see plenty of rope. Why can't I just loot that? Or better yet why can't I use the stupid amount of rags I find to make rope?\n\n- The mist event the game is named after is in the beginning annoying and then afterwards just uneventful. Because combat in this game is a pain in the ass (which I'll get into) and \"sneaking\" is a bit of a joke you are better off just sleeping in a random house if the mist event pops off. Otherwise you are just going to be frustrated with the \"stealth\" in the game and getting bum rushed by zeds. Which there aren't even that many to begin with. I was kinda expecting the mist event to just be a swarm. Zeds spawn close to you too actually. You can see them spawn in. Its immersion breaking and a bit silly.\n\n- The new map is complete trash in comparison to the old one. The new one has ALOT of empty unused space. You spend too much time running from one point to another rather than actually surviving. In my opinion the dev should abandon the idea of the new map and go back to the old one. The game excels when your in a city type environment. Go to the work in progress construction area with the office buildings and you'll understand just how much cooler the game would be if the game took place in a cityscape.\n\n- The combat is frustrating. Zeds attack too quick and do too much damage. Make melee combat a big no no. You can't run while reloading or switching weapons which is something that really needs to be changed. You are just letting zeds get in free hits otherwise. Bandit ai is broken unfun garbage and is actually what has made me put this game down. I tested this to make sure of the behavior they have. If you are spotted by a bandit there is no way to \"unspot\" yourself. You have to legit runaway from the area (despawning the enemies) then go back to reset the aggro. Once spotted, bandits know where you are at all times. They will shoot at you even if theres a stupid amount of terrain between you and them. They can't possibly hit you shooting through a hill but they still keep firing with there seemingly infinite ammo.\n\n- The game suffers the problems alot of survival games have where it tries to go for realism is some aspects but then in others it falls on its face. Take hunting for example. I was attempting to use a compound bow on a deer. I hit the deer but it didn't go down (which isn't the problem) but said deer ran off. Its kinda a pain to keep up with the deer and it wasn't leaving a blood trail so I can only assume the deer isn't going to bleed out either. So basically that ordeal told me that I need to be able to 1 tap a deer otherwise don't bother. Then there was this other situation where a wolf attacked me so I pulled out my 1911 to shoot it. I only had 4 bullets but the wolf didn't die. As someone who owns a 1911 irl let me tell you .45 acp is no joke. That wolf woulda been yelping and running off after being hit ONCE. But nah he takes 4 rounds like a champ. Normally I avoid making these types of comparisons but its hard when the game picks and chooses what it wants to portray as realism. And sadly it picks annoying things to portray.\n\nOverall I'd say to stay away. I'm not super miffed about the game as it was only $10. It definitely has potential but with alot of early access titles lately (atleast for me) development is slow and makes it difficult to want to support a project when said project might not even be ready until 5 years down the road.", "timestamp_created": 1662226828, "timestamp_updated": 1662226828, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 148, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808368146419525146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55126213": {"recommendationid": "55126213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350933928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 576, "last_played": 1679415742}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the game so much but can you do a multiplayer \u2764\nI want to play with my brother :C", "timestamp_created": 1568560567, "timestamp_updated": 1588056772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.80797123908996582", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90165220": {"recommendationid": "90165220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112162416", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 330, "last_played": 1682984673}, "language": "english", "review": "Add CO-OP and its a masterpiece!", "timestamp_created": 1618192148, "timestamp_updated": 1618192148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803885996341705322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63631945": {"recommendationid": "63631945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022162628", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1681117989}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game but would be 10x better if multiplayer would be possible", "timestamp_created": 1581883245, "timestamp_updated": 1581883245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 96, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800805449485778809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131401011": {"recommendationid": "131401011", "author": {"steamid": "76561199281044789", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1677114996}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice Game, But it starts to get boring alone.

I bought this for 11.00 us dollars. I expected either to instantly dislike it, find it EH, or like it a little and get bored of it FAST. I cannot tell you just how much fun the past 6-hour climb has been. I won't lie. It is a slow climb. Your luck & patience will determine how well you experience this game. IF you are not a patient person DONT get the game. This is a SURVIVAL GAME and the only way to progress is to invest time & with a little luck, certain \"tasks\" can be achieved faster.\n\n[DIFFICULTY]\nThe enemies without guns are hard as shit. And even WITH guns missing your shots is a HUGE mistake you can't take back & this is doubly so for facing more than one enemy. Bandits can laser the hell out of you, but as long as you are smart and move well, you can take on a group of them. Just don't stand out in the open as this dipshit did. WEAR ARMOR.\n\n[STORY]\nEverything you experience in the game is explained away by said opening explanation. So at least everything makes sense.  Too bad (Honestly speaking) that there is no story. I honestly believe this is ONE example where only having notepads/notes would be better UNLESS if voice acting is added, it is actually good. I think finding notepads as you explore/survive and look for a way out would probably be the best experience. IF the voice acting can be done well, then adding radio chatter through the base radio or a handheld radio as you progress the story/map would be the \"perfect\" way to do this. Honestly, just voice the MC & the other character who is helping them leave and just give the survivors you work with random lines.\n\n\n[BASE BUILDING]\nYou can build your on bases from templates ranging from small to large. You can also claim places from small to large. Claimable places have more variety than buildings you can build from scratch, though this makes sense. The base building also makes sense and is super simple. The things you can build for your bases all make sense. There are more than enough things to build. Supplies needed to build seem fair to me. They CAN be difficult or time-consuming to find. But this IS a survival game & with luck, you can find things faster.\n\n[Hunger/Thirst/Fatigue]\nHonestly. I have no issues with this at all.\n\n[Injuries]\nFucking sucks when you got one but feels perfectly balanced right now.\n\n[Farming]\nNot needed imo. NO this is NOT me saying you need to decrease food/drink loot spawns. Just saying if you dedicate time you CAN survive without farming. Its great that it is there though for those that want to use it.  Keep as is.\n\n[Vehicles]\nThey need to take damage. When the battery hit zero it still worked fine. Controls are fine. Sometimes you spun out but I think this is balanced well.\n\n[Melee]\nMaybe add some melee variants where nails combined with a baseball bat will attach the two and do increased damage and bleed damage. Idk, just a thought.\n\n[Guns]\nAmmo is scarce (Which is intended). Attachments even as simple as just adding sights /scopes for each gun would be great (Excluding pistols IF you don't want to). This part honestly only needs the simplest of additions. Lasers, sights, scopes, done!\n\n[Ambient Sounds & Music]\nThis brings me to the second worst thing for me. The game lacks sound. This makes sense if this was the real world in this situation, but for the game, I really wish either there were a lot more ambient sounds or there was subtle music that played based on the situation.\n\n[Graphics & Animations]\nI'll tell you right now I am a graphics whore. I LOVE 4k ULTRA graphics. Animations can definitely use some work. Weapon reach needs polishing and a personal thing would be showing our hands when driving. I definitely think IF POSSIBLE, that I would LOVE graphics, textures, models, yadda yada to significantly increase lol. But I can settle and probably will, with what I got now. Though they definitely still need some work.\n\n[Conclusion]\nIf you like survival, don't mind decent graphics, and everything I mentioned here, as well as are okay with spending 11.00 US dollars when not on sale. I definitely recommend it. It's no triple A-game. But it's something I think you should play at least once. P.s. open up the closed buildings, let us loot everything that is of the same type, and there are more suggestions that just can't fit here. This has a lot of potential. As it stands. It's worth the current price. But this game can be so much more with graphics being increased even if only a little, and story being implemented. After beating this in the next day or so, I will probably return either after a FULL release is announced, or 3-4 years.", "timestamp_created": 1603621859, "timestamp_updated": 1603674822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.789406538009643555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44242773": {"recommendationid": "44242773", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994043631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 50, "last_played": 1534620649}, "language": "english", "review": "(Note: this isn't a full review as of yet, but I will be pointing out the Pros and Cons about the game so far) \n\nSo, I had a short while so far with the game, expecting it to be yet another horrible cashgrab Zombie Surivial title, but it ended up surprising me with some of the production value looking better than average for a Early Access game. The game doesn't look like Crysis or anything but it has it's moment. \n\nNow I'll quickly go into the Pros and Cons I've found (So far) in the game:\n\nPros + \n+ Graphically, the game is good for such a smaller budget title. It kind of reminds me of The Forest in a way.\n+ Gameplay is fairly decent, with a good range of options to choose from, especially knowing the game doesn't hold guns back from you like most surivial games do. \n+ The idea of your tools wearing down overtime has been done before, but I think it's done well in this game, even showing a percentage which indicates how depleted the tool is before it breaks. \n+ Car Mechanics such as building a car from a wrecked car is a really good addition as it really gives the player a better chance of exploring the world. \n\nCons - \n- I had found some glitches throughout the game that had to force me to restart the whole game as well as start a new one. \n- Enemies are basically the same with little variation in them. \n- Some of the buildings feel unfinished (but it was expected from an Early Access Title)\n- I feel that some of the blacked out cars should also be accessible as well as camper vans, just  it feels like a waste of oppertunity for a possible base.\n- The fog, though a really interesting part of the story, doesn't really do much other than spawn in more Zombies, which if feel could have been handled better like possibly having Special Zombies only come out during the Fog.\n\nOverall, for the price you get I say it's worth even a look into. \nThe dev really seems to have put their heart into this project with updates and a pretty good idea of how to create a working Menu system. \n\nGive it a shot, maybe you'll be just as surprised as I was.", "timestamp_created": 1534648066, "timestamp_updated": 1534648066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786744415760040283", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119980106": {"recommendationid": "119980106", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972398706", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 8004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 68, "playtime_at_review": 4480, "last_played": 1713265283}, "language": "english", "review": "This has the potential to be a great survival game and even in it's current state it is very playable and enjoyable with a real challenge in the early stages to find food and water.

Almost a year since my last review and there has been virtually zero progress made on the game.\n\n(Actively updating as I trudge through all the game has to offer.) Honestly, games got solid bones. However, the game has been in early access for over 3 years now and the dev keeps adding more stuff without addressing issues that the game has had for 3 years. First off, the ai in this game both zombies and humans is laughable. Zombies directly run straight at you at a ridiculous speed and then attack at an unreasonable rate. It's just way too robotic it's almost impossible to defend against more than 3 unless you have an insane hoard of ammo. Now to the people ai, they basically have aimbot, that mixed with the inconsistent melee combat makes them almost impossible to beat if you don't have a revolver or rifle. They can also see through trees and bushes and can snipe you before you're even visible. Then there's just a bunch of other small nitpicks. The dev keeps working on new areas now labeled WIP on the map even though 50% of the rest of the areas not labeled WIP are just empty. The parts that arent empty also suffers from the classic issue a lot of indie devs run into. They crowd buildings with useless items. In a survival game especially almost everything inside a building should be useable in some way, but in this game, 99% of the objects you find in buildings are unbreakable, unmoveable, and unusable. For example, there are buckets in the game as an object you use for crafting several items, but there are also like 5 different bucket assets throughout the world that you just can't pick up, they're there, they're buckets, but I guess they're not bucket enough. Overall got good bones but I wouldn't purchase for at least 2 or 3 more years based on the speed at which the dev is addressing the issues in the game. The dev also needs to remove all human enemy AI in the game until he can fix it to be more fair. Enemies will snap and teleport up and down structures, sometimes even across entire camps. Snipers will kill you in one hit before they even render into the game. Right now bandit camps are virtually impossible.", "timestamp_created": 1659895293, "timestamp_updated": 1688926032, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780622720718383789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73355928": {"recommendationid": "73355928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013125196", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1090, "last_played": 1613641730}, "language": "english", "review": "I really loved this game but got bored after time.

Gameplay is great, every step needs to be planned. At the start, it feels like danger is everywhere, but after almost 20h of gameplay, I\u2019m settled in and feel much more confident. \n\nAs many of us, I took the white house as my base, 2 floors with a bed and some cabinets. \nThe first days I got ambushed several times during the night by the undead, but after placing a chicken fence IN every window (trick I found on the net), no zombie gets in and I feel much more secure, also after placing some of those fences before my front door. I can jump over, zombies can\u2019t. What bandits concerns, I never saw one yet (edit: while writing this, I cleaned out my first bandit camp). But again, I\u2019m the type who likes to feel completely safe and well equipped before going out on long trips or engaging enemy\u2019s.  \n\nFood and water\n...are vital for surviving. First, roaming the immediate vicinity of your base should be enough to find water, coke cans, canned food and all types of supplies you need to build things. You can find them in abandoned cars and buildings. Some buildings contain zombies (you hear them when approaching), so better leave these alone, for now. \nWhen you decide to expand your range, you can take one of the many cars randomly available, but you need to get them to work first by finding spare parts. But that shouldn\u2019t take much time as there are many available. Fuel can be unloaded, but you need a jerry can to do so. I had found one in a small cabin close to the farm (large fields). But you can also make one (see later). Be aware that these car parts wear out rather quickly (especially when you hit a bear, another car\u2026), so better stock on spare parts, and (hint) put them in the trunk of your car so you have them with you when your car stops driving in the middle of nowhere when the mist comes up :s \n\nWhat to build first. \nIn the meantime, the searching through cars and buildings will have given you probably a saw, axe and hammer. So you can start building! \n\nFirst I fortified my villa to feel more safe, especially at night. Building a chicken fence is easy and doesn\u2019t need many materials. (hint) if you want several of these fences interlocking, place them first without effectively building them. \n\nSecondly, I built a \u2018Barrel fire\u2019, not to use as a fire place, but to make wooden planks out of tree trunks that you need to build e.g. the \u2018Workbench\u2019. The \u2018Workbench\u2019 is a must-have tool. Then I started building a \u2018water purifier\u2019 and \u2018water barrel\u2019 to solve the thirst issue. You need to find water to put in the purifier. The villa happens to be close to a lake. You need an empty bottle or better a bucket (10l) to transport the \u2018unsafe\u2019 water back to your base. I had found a bucket while searching the area, but you can make one yourself with scrap metal you find using the Workbench.    \n\nWeapons\nDuring my travels around my villa, progressively going further and further, I spotted 2 \u2018Guard towers\u2019 and yes they gave me a pistol and shotgun! Ammo is scarce I have to admit, I have around a dozen cartridges for each weapon at this time. Ammo can also be found in the white villa\u2019s you come across. In one of these villa\u2019s, I found an M4 rifle. \nMaking a bow (go for the longbow, the first is a waste of time and supplies) is time consuming. You need \u2018dried animal guts\u2019.\nDrying? So you need to construct a \u2018Drying rack\u2019.\nNo bow without quiver. For a quiver, you need leather, for making leather you need dry animal hide...so you need to build a \u2018Tanning rack\u2019. Keeping busy. \nBy the time I decided to make a bow, I had found several arrows during my trips outside. Hunting arrows are a must. You can also make them with wood branches, feathers and arrowheads that you can produce with the \u2018Blacksmith place\u2019.\n\nWhere to find animal guts and hide? Bears maybe.\nAnd while doing all this time consuming constructions, you need food so you need to constantly search the area to find food cans. After a while, you like to find a better source of food. Bears maybe? \n\nBears.\nThere happens to be one roaming the area of my base. Thought to give it a try. One shotgun blast to the head killed the animal. I could extract raw meat, guts, fat & hide. (hint) adjust the amount you want to remove as it\u2019s standard \u201c0\u201d so it won\u2019t do anything. \nTaking all that to your base.\nYou can place the hide to the \u2018Tanning rack\u2019 to dry (takes lots of time!).\nBefore you can use the animal guts for the bow or eat the meat, you must dry it on the \u2018Drying rack\u2019. Before you can put the meat on the drying rack, you need to add \u2018salt\u2019 to it. Salt can be found on zombies and obviously in kitchens of some buildings you come across. Keeping busy. But a piece of dried bear meat can feed you for a much longer time than a beef can. So you can keep the canned food for the periods in between the bear killings and drying times. \nEating raw meat (or unsafe water) can give you food poisoning, which again can be helped with antibiotics you may have found. For 2 or 3 times, I had a food poisoning without eating any of that (don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bug?).\n\nMist events. \nThese occur randomly as far as I know. Once coming up, zombies starts to appear. Initially I quickly ran back to my base. I still try to run or drive to my base if possible, but when too far away, I quickly hide in my car and that seems to keep you safe. Once I thought I would drive back to my base in the mist, but not seeing much I got lost and still had to wait in my car. \nWhen I\u2019m at my base and mist comes up, I try to attract some zombies and while hiding behind my chicken fence wall in front of my door, I try to kill them with the bow. They drop salt, gunpowder...and you can retrieve the arrows, which is a good thing.\n\nWhat else did I build?\nA \u2018Blacksmith place\u2019. I did make some ingots of scrap metal, I needed nails and had to build a pickaxe needed in the mines. I made two visits to the mines where I extracted some iron, zinc, copper, sulphur etc (again, you need a pickaxe!). You need a lot of copper ores to make brass ingots which you can use to make cartridge cases. With sulphur and saltpetre you make the gun powder. \nTo effectively combine both to make ammo, you need to build a \u2018Reloading bench\u2019.\nWhy there is gold in the mine, I don\u2019t know, maybe something we can use after further updating the game. \n\nI also placed a \u2018Chicken coop\u2019, chickens are roaming close to my base. You need to run empty handed and when close use the \u2018F\u2019 button to grab them; release them (\u2018R\u2019) in your \u2018Chicken coop\u2019. They do produce eggs, which you can eat but this adds barely something to your food bar. I let the eggs alone, I thought maybe they do hatch? But that didn\u2019t happen, instead they were rotting so I had to throw them away. You can also kill chickens, pick them up and \u2018harvest\u2019 them for some meat and feathers.\n\n\u2018Lock picks\u2019. Easy to craft. Take some with you during your travels as behind these closed doors interesting things can be found: weapons, ammo, \u2018backpack upgrades\u2019 (to increase your inventory slots). An alternative is making a \u2018crowbar\u2019.  \nYou may find cloths that you can put on, does this mean you were naked all the time before? \n\nI admit I\u2019m a hoarder so I have built 7 extra \u2018Security Lockers\u2019 to store and organise all my items.\nI had my first interaction with bandits, but there was sort of bug as 2 of them came very close and kept walking against me, without attacking me. They dropped things that I didn\u2019t encounter before: grenades, gun powder, apple, broccoli and I could pick up their M4 rifles and shotguns. I left the \u2018survivor\u2019 in his cage, he didn\u2019t move or said anything, and I don\u2019t see any use of them :D \n\nThe game is in alpha stage and I\u2019m almost 20h far in the game, so I still have things to do, but I wanted to write some \u2018tips & tricks\u2019 that may be useful to new players. \n", "timestamp_created": 1542372624, "timestamp_updated": 1542372624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773158788681030273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120077755": {"recommendationid": "120077755", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971210248", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 40815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40581, "last_played": 1708794345}, "language": "english", "review": "To the Devs,\nWhat I don\u2019t like;\n\nI have over 676 hours into the game to date. Before the big update everything worked other than a few quirks in game that I\u2019ve lived with. Never the less, since the update, there are some major issues. To name a few\u2026.Weight restrictions. Although necessary you have made it much too difficult to carry anything never mind upgrade bags, the way its set now what\u2019s the point of upgrading if you can\u2019t use the slots. Furthermore with my carrying the revolver + ammo, advanced bow with tactical quiver loaded with exploding arrows (also I\u2019ve lost a number of exploding arrows by changing quivers. This is actually one of the quirks before the update), Shotgun + ammo, Hunting rifle + ammo, water jug, one can of food, bandages, and axe. This puts me at +75% in weight, which only allows me to carry \u201c4 to 5 LOGS\u201d! Not good! Food and water decreases way to fast to keep up with hunting and grinding. As for graphics, OOOFF, I have a GForce RTX 2070 Super and have to almost go to bare specs with the game in order to run it efficiently. There is more but I think you get the general idea of what\u2019s going on.\n\nWhat I DO like (Love);\n\nThe ability of the infected now able to destroy the fences as well as climbing the Ranger towers. That one made my heart pump. Nice touch.  The new Weather feature with the realistic thunder and lightning. The added new infected, green mist, and what I\u2019m calling the \u201cAlien Blob\u201d that you have to destroy to further progress, and last but not least, the additions to the map! Absolutely Phenomenal!\n\nAm still going to give a very favorable rating to this game. What you guy\u2019s have done so far is amazing. The best part is where you can go from here. Keep plugging and don\u2019t forget about your fans.

This game sat in my wishlist for 2 years, reviews have always been very positive, so I picked it up. It's ok, for a proof of concept demo that someone threw together in the space of a week or so. It is NOT anywhere near release or even early access. The POIs aren't. (interesting) It's built on Unreal and frankly I can't understand why so many people are so positive about it. After playing it for a few hours and then re-reading the reviews I still don't understand. It's got generic mechanics that are built into the engine itself. it's got a crap ton of empty generic assets that have very little work or thought put into them. In the single \"town\" there is a laundromat with almost nothing in it, and on the very next street, directly across from the original, there is the very same laundromat. with nothing in it. \n\nIt's a beta you say?  Well, the developer released it 6 months ago. Then retracted it. When a weekend's work would've fleshed out some buildings and content, virtually nothing has been done. \n\nThis seems to me like someone had a decent idea, decided to learn Unreal to implement it, got it to a somewhat playable state, and called it good. When he needs a little more money, he spends a couple hours \"improving\" the game and there is a new flurry of excitement, and people spend enough for beer money.\n\nThis looks like at most a few weeks work by someone who knows very little about programming, or game design, and frankly is making very little effort to learn either. From October to March I would've expected more than one update. The update I did see was what looked like about 4-5 hours of concentrated effort.\n\nI'll continue to play and continue to hope, but at this time I'm not very hopeful.", "timestamp_created": 1647196328, "timestamp_updated": 1647196328, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767091155052185059", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127882791": {"recommendationid": "127882791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052711187", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 3432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3377, "last_played": 1671361576}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, I had some fun, the begining was chilling, some nice ideas, but there is still lot of work to do. I spent 50+ hours on it and I believe I saw and tried almost everything.\n\n- Fridges (at least the big one) do not seem to work. Food is spoiling at the same rate (I may be mistaken).\n- Survivors are very limited. Some are not doing anything. Some can be used as workers on specifc tasks (sawmill, workbench). I built a base on a lake with wooden foundations, teleported the survivors on it and.... too bad, they are now totally useless, not even moving. Some even spawned under the foundations, holding their breath for ever ! Amazing but useless !\n- When you pimp a car in your garage, do not leave game before the end of the process or it will stop and you will lose all pieces of craft. (red truck can't be pimped).\n- Yeah I used \"loot refresh\". I do not believe you can craft everything without this cheat. Gear parts are soooo rare.\n- Fights are deadly at the begining. And later, you still have to know what you are doing.\n- Found a boss. Hard to kill but worth the price.\n- Many places are not finished or empty.\n- Too bad you can't set any house as your base. There is some nice spots. You can still craft a house on the spot and set it as a base.\n- Too bad you can't clean all garbages. Could be nice to clean a nice spot so you can build a base the way you want. \n- Nice to have a dog, but it is useless. And you can't give him water, only raw meat to feed it. It stays thrirsty but it doesn't seem to be impacted.\n- The red truck, even if you can't pimp it, is the best. You can build storages on it; very usefull when you farm wood logs.\n- Heat or cold is just an information; never got sick because of cold, or fainted being too hot.\n- Bandits are dumb but they can be sharpshooters sometimes.\n- The mist is chilling. Never be outside a safe place when it comes or you will probably die.\n- Munitions are scarce. Thank you, \"loot refresh\" !\n- Tried to grow crops not long ago. Can't say so far if it is worth it. \n- Tried fishing. Failed once and never tried again. Can't say if it is also worth the price and time.\n- No story at all; one Fedex quest given by a survivors. Not sure there is more.\n- You can move a lot of the crafted stuff. Very nice ! Being able to relocate them is a very good idea.\n- I wish foundations and housing part could clip on.\n- Pay attention on the structure crafts list. There are more than you think at first glance.\n\nThanks for this game anyway. Cheap but may never be finished. It entertained me for a while. I'll come back on next update if this is a major one.

I have had some fun playing this game but because of the problems I cannot recommend someone to buy this game.\n\nlet's start with the good...the few things that are good\n1. The updates to the game usually add some decent stuff (sometimes, other times they are useless) but they do take quite a while to come.\n2. Graphically, it's not too bad for an early access game, though there are some textures that will make you want to puke, it looks better than fallout 76, meaning it's got that 16x the detail Todd promised.\n3. Movement and controls are pretty fluid and feel nice, it doesn't feel too clunky (most of the time) and it feels pretty well polished\n\nNow let's get to the bad stuff, there is quite a bit of it\n1. The AI, the AI is awful\n-The bandits, the bandits can detect you from a mile away which makes it impossible to sneak up on them and once they spot you, you're practically dead, but at the same time, if you're just to their right or left, they have no clue you are there, also, when they shoot at you, they don't stop, even after you're dead, they keep shooting.\n-The zombies/mutants, they are supposed to remain in the dark during the day, I.e. in a house or building, but if the see you, they'll chase you, even if you're outside, they will leave buildings and chase you for a couple of minutes sometimes, only to turn and run away the next second. They will also detect you through floors and walls, meaning, if you're in a two story building, they'll detect you even if you're on a different floor. At night when they come out, they will sometimes target you, sometimes target the window barriers, even if you walk up next to them, they will continue hitting the barriers. These enemies are also incredibly strong, being able to 3 hit you, meaning melee is completely useless against them, and sometimes (maybe I was just unlucky or it was a bug) these enemies will hit you through walls.\n-The friendly AI, these AI are useless, the walk around and well...that's it, they don't do anything at all, they need work, and a lot of it\n2. The Mist - The mist is an incredibly cool concept, but one of the problems with it is how bluntly it comes, it just appears, it doesn't really fade it, but also, the enemies that come during the mist just appear out of thin air when the mist does come, making it a pain to be in the mist at all.\n3. Bandit camps - Bandit camps are a great idea and can be a lot of fun, but it has a huge problem, if you die at one of the camps, all the AI will disappear meaning it is easier to just let the bandits kill you and then come back to loot the camp as once you die, they will all disappear and you won't have to fight them.\n4. Looting - Looting in this game can be cool, but half of the objects you think would be lootable aren't, and the objects you can loot will most of the time have completely useless items in them. Guns aren't terribly hard to find but the ammo is, ammo can be incredibly scarce which wouldn't be a problem...except guns are the only viable option for combat as any melee approach will surely get you killed.\n5. Combat - Melee combat is completely out of the question as you'll either get shot before you can get close (in the case of bandits) or you'll get swarmed by multiple zombies and get killed that way, even trying to fight a single zombie with melee is hard, as there is no way to dodge their hit, and they can be incredibly strong. The gunplay feels very nice, but as I've stated, ammo can be incredibly scarce, but also, if you're just slightly too far away from an enemy (maybe 30Ft - 45Ft.) your gun won't work and will just alert them. Guns can also be inconsistent, either ending any fight in a matter of seconds, or being useless, as the gun will do very little damage, taking up to 8 pistol shots to kill 1 zombie sometimes.\n6. Health - Healing is incredibly slow, and you take damage quickly, meaning combat can be a pain. Bandages don't actually heal you but stop bleeding (which isn't innately a problem) but there isn't a real way to heal except sleeping or waiting. All enemies do a ton of damage to you until you get armor, but when you don't have armor, gun fights can be hell, or even just fighting zombies can be a pain. You aren't able to heal in combat which means you can easily die if you make even one slip-up or make every fight last way longer than it should. As I said, fights become a bit more forgiving once you have armor, but even then, it's not that much of an advantage, and finding armor can be a real pain, meaning you will go without it for a while.\n7. Navigation - The map is good, and can be very fun to explore, but overall, everything looks the same. Navigating during day can be a pain, but during night, it's nearly impossible as it get's near pitch black. This game also has no map which is a pain as it's a survival game with no map meaning, if you get lost, you're gonna have a hell of a time getting home as much of the map looks the exact same. \n8. Cars and Driving - Driving can be fun, but getting the actual vehicle is a pain. You have to scour the map looking for car parts, then put them on a body only to have them break shortly after and have to do it again. Driving the car is useful, but any minor damage to the car, and all your parts inside go from 100% to 17% in an instant. Driving at night is impossible as your car's headlights are maxed at about 5% brightness, meaning they won't shine on something unless it is 2 feet in front of you.\n9. Stamina - Stamina in this game sucks. Although it goes down pretty slow, which is very nice, it regenerates insanely slowly, taking upwards of 5 minutes to regenerate from empty to full. Any action you do, I.e. melee combat, jumping, sprinting, ect. all drain stamina, all of these put together, or pretty much basic combat, means you'll run out of stamina about half way through the fight leaving you to hide behind the nearest object or climb on top of something to avoid dying.\n10. Gameplay - The idea of the game is to survive (obviously, it's a survival) but there really isn't a ton to do, you can build bases, build items, loot, drive and fight impossible enemies. Practically everything you do gets very boring and feels pointless as most of the time, you're just gonna end up driving from one building to the next looting item you already have.\n\nTLDR: This game has a lot of potential, but in it's current state I can't recommend it to anyone, I would say save the $11 you would use for this game and hold off to buy it until it becomes a bit better, the game has potential and I badly want to see it become better, but in it's current state I simply can't recommend it as it has too many issues, it has too many bugs but it also can be very unfair and downright unplayable at times. It can be very tedious and very repetitive and most of your actions can feel pointless.

It's very easy to learn how to build tools and structures like a cabin or work bench.\n    [*]Zombies are either in or around houses or structures or they come out when the fog/mist rolls through.

Other games do have ores also, but not so much in detail or the fact that you have to kill some zombies and even a berserker to get to them. Take note that the old mine does not have zombies, but also don't contain all minerals like the one with the zombies.

Apparently I had a lot to say.\n\nCan't say I'd recommend the game, though there are redeeming qualities some people might find awesome. The old game/world from when I bought it a couple years ago was simply more immersive and captured the survival feeling... This new map and some of the mechanics simply don't. The survival has gotten ridiculously simple (you're able to have shelter and 100% of needs covered before end of first day, no joke) and this new map is very homogeneous. \n\nThe old world and systems felt satisfying to use, and you could navigate by landmark and experience because everything felt distinct. Additionally, the environments told stories. I remember I would go into something like a motel and look at the rooms, trying to break down what happened. By contrast, I have to navigate this new world using a 3rd party map on an open browser tab because it's literally nothing but hills, roads, water, and scattered outcroppings of buildings. This new world feels utterly sterile. Head into the wrong gully and you can lose your navigational indexing very quickly. Sure, you could argue this would be more \"wilderness-like\" or something, however in a game where you can hoist an adult grizzly over your shoulder and sprint into your home like you're training for the olympics, I'd say sometimes game-ification should take precedent. \n\nLook at The Forest as an example... Basically nothing but trees, yet you often have an idea of where you are due to appropriately diversified landscaping, and every time you find a new landmark, there's environmental cues and storytelling to be had. Without a word of joke, the most environmental storytelling I've seen so far has been finding the 327th random encampment on the map and seeing that there was a fire already lit, so maybe someone was there recently.\n\nOn the bright side of things, while the survival might been ludicrously easy compared to before, I will admit that it is far more balanced. Additionally, there's a distinct lack of detectable bugs which used to be the BIGGEST issue by a landslide. From a technical perspective, the current version of the game is undoubtedly superior (if too easy). I just wish it hadn't come at the expensive of the content of the original game. I genuinely wish I could recommend it because at it's core there's a good game there... It's just now cloaked in a bog-standard, low resolution/stock-asset feeling shell that's devoid of character or intrigue.\n\nHonestly I think I'm just disappointed. When I last played this game is was pretty damned good but basically abandoned. The only reason I stopped was I hit yet another bug, but this one halted all progress that I could make so I lost interest. When I saw the devs had been working on it again I got excited, but returned to a game that feels like a college project or a tech demo or something. It went from being all substance with marginal play-ability to being as polished and devoid of color as a freshly cleaned drinking glass. I've been trying to get into the game but I just can't. It's boring now, even though it works much better. Big sad.\n\n*-*_*-*_*-*PROS/CONS*-*_*-*_*-*\nPROS:\n- Updates have rendered the game comparatively bug-free vs. the games original state.\n- Game runs well\n- The game is VERY noob-friendly. If you don't normally play survival sandboxes, this would be a great starter.\n- Loot mechanics are reasonably balanced.\n- Resources, for better or worse, are plentiful and easy to come across.\n- If you make a mistake and/or run out of a limited resource, you can reset the loot pool. \n\nCONS:\n- If you make a mistake and/or run out of a limited resource, you can reset the loot pool. This is a \"survival\" game with no consequence. You can just hit \"Loots Refresh\" and respawn the world's loot pool.\n- Oh my god does it all look the same. Original game might have been using stock assets too, but this is just a solid MEH for appearance. At least old game was kinda pretty/diverse, felt lived in, all that.\n- The visuals have become dull/drab/boring. Beyond the fact that it all looks the same, it all looks BORINGLY the same.\n- The world is sterile. If you like dusty looking trees and hills boy are you in for a treat, but the only thing that interrupts trees/hills are random camps or the occasional settlement. The old world had a grunge to it, it looked like it had been ripped apart, like something had happened. The only thing in this game that shows ANY wear/tear are the cars. Buildings, trees, roads, everything else is stock-asset pristine.\n- There's no survival crunch. You can get everything you need before sundown on your first day, and the near total lack of reasonable threats means you just pick the first house you see and live there. It's more of a post-apocalypse real estate sim than a survival game.\n- Complete lack of story telling. \"You're alive after the mist turned most people into zombie-things... annnddd go.\" is the extent of the immersion. The devices that DO exist only go so far as to have you identify what a certain building is, i.e. this is a laundromat, that's a house, whatever. Some don't even go that far.\n- DIFFICULT to navigate just by playing. 3rd party map is a must, lest you be turned around momentarily while running down a hill and lose your sense of direction. \n- Worst sin of all... It's just not compelling anymore. By the 2nd day in game, I was already cruising. This wasn't helped by the fact that I think I got a bug, because the zombie-things stopped showing up. I was out-and-about through day/night/sun/rain/MIST EVENT, doesn't matter, no walkers. However even if this hadn't happened, I'd still feel like nothing was drawing me in. \n\nSorry for the novel.", "timestamp_created": 1675554701, "timestamp_updated": 1675554701, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75238490104675293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119015790": {"recommendationid": "119015790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064977526", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1685315447}, "language": "english", "review": "Call me when the zombies stop spawning inside my completely walled-off base.", "timestamp_created": 1658158197, "timestamp_updated": 1658158197, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.752087950706481934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121897697": {"recommendationid": "121897697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207833508", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1662584920}, "language": "english", "review": "Very pretty game and a fun zombie/mutant survival.

That means development can be a bit slow at times, but it is consistent.  The game has a clear direction and Rati is very involved with his community of players; this is the kind of project and developer that Early Access was made for.  I've sent in bug reports and actually gotten a response every time; Rati seems 100% invested in his project and I don't see him going anywhere any time soon (like so many EA developers do).  Anyway, none of that says anything about the game itself - it's just worth mentioning since this is an Early Access game.\n\nIn my mind there are two kinds of survival games: the brutal ones where you're constantly fighting what seems to be a futile battle and the chill ones where you're just living your life; gathering resources, killing zombos, building a base, etc.  Mist is mostly the latter with touches of the former here and there to keep you on your toes.  The systems that are in the game are very well done.  While there are certainly many bugs, they are typically addressed quickly - if you find a bug, it will usually be fixed within 1 or 2 patches.  Amazing how one guy can get things done faster than most big studios!\n\nHonestly, there's not much to say about the game...it's just another survival game that at this stage in development doesn't really offer anything special, but it's a good one with a developer that actually cares about making it the best it can be.  I think Mist definitely has the potential to become something special, and I think Rati is a developer with the drive and commitment to make it something special...so I'd say it's definitely worth picking up.", "timestamp_created": 1547083143, "timestamp_updated": 1547083143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730128765106201172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102316549": {"recommendationid": "102316549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198451149039", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 460, "last_played": 1675271451}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good and fun game, but I would like to add multiplayer", "timestamp_created": 1636198731, "timestamp_updated": 1636198731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.729168713092803955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98542182": {"recommendationid": "98542182", "author": {"steamid": "76561199160879551", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1589, "last_played": 1704582641}, "language": "english", "review": " Very beautiful game. i have been playing games since pong. yes, i'm 52..

Maybe it's just my memory playing tricks on me.\n- Less buildings to take over (I only found a couple of barns and two houses)\n- The bandits are still using hacks\n- I think even more bugs than there were two years ago\n- Not optimized for ultra wide monitors\n- Disappearing stuff\n- Inventory management is a pain\n\nOverall, I feel like if the developer made the game from two years ago, more stable and balanced, it would've been an awesome experience today, but I think more and more features have been added that made the game even more unstable. \n\nMy opinion is that if the game would've just came out as an alpha today, it would be ok, but after more than two years, it should be way more than this. I feel really sorry, because I really thought this will turn out to be one of the best survival games, but at this moment it's still just an alpha version.\n\nI'll check back in two years.\n\n2020:\n\nWhile I think this game is enjoyable and has a LOT of potential, unfortunately there is a major issue with it.\nA big chunk of the game is basically a shooting FPS, but overall the shooting part of it is just unbearably bugged. \n\nPros:\n\n- Great environment, beautiful scenery\n- Awesome survival mechanics. Not too much and not too unrealistic, just right.\n- Free building\n- Cars!\n\nCons:\n- Snipers can spot your through trees and I would even look over this but they also can shoot you through them. \n\n- The enemy NPCs (mostly the bandits) are way overpowered and I really don't mind that one or two shots can take you down, but again they can literally shoot you through stuff.\n\n- While the bandits have unlimited ammo they rarely drop any ammo or weapon parts (or I'm just really unlucky).\n\n- Wherever you go they will definitely know where you are.\n\n- Because enemys can literally sense you, stealth rarely works. \n\nTL/DR:\nSo while I think this is a great start, I can't recommend it at this moment. The building and survival is fun, but as soon as you have to get out and get some late game stuff... it's kind of rage quit inducing. I hope they will keep up the good work and make this game flawless!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1584473666, "timestamp_updated": 1661166875, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725536644458770752", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68827139": {"recommendationid": "68827139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264110187", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 118, "last_played": 1703476842}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend this game for purchase, but i do not want the game to add aliens, in my opinion it is too much.

This game is a bit too early in early access.\n\nThe Long:\n\nFor the sake of not making this a mile a long, I'll do bulletins and explanations..\n\nMy biggest issue.. The Infected. They pose almost no threat whatsoever except for the fog events, which are predictable (around mid-day). These can currently be bypassed by simply crafting something to pass the time or sleeping. Since the infected cant go out in the sun, and are very loud, you can just loot freely throughout the day with very little worry. This -killed- the fear and survival aspect of the game.\n\nSemi-fixed, at least not a big issue.. Parts are more common and respawn.[strike]Car durability - Drive a half mile without hitting anything and you lose 10% of the engine durability. Since engines are a finite resource, expect to be walking -a lot- late game. [/strike]\n\nThe horrible English grammar in this game. Being that the only language option available is English, I am confused how it could be so bad. (Dev, if you need someone to properly go through the text and make sure it is correct, there are many people who will do it for free, including myself).\n\nConfusing world resources - Need a tire? oh there's a stack of tires over there.. no wait.. thats just decoration. Is this destructable for resources? maybe.. it could also just be an indestructable decoration. A lot of things that are lootable, are also used as un-usable item decorations so you are always left guessing if you can pick something up. This is a huge no-no in decorating a game. Also.. why is the only cars I'm allowed to drive the only ones with absolutely nothing left in them (literally stripped down to their bare frame, not even a spark plug in them), when there is so many nice-looking cars parked everywhere that are totally unlootable.\n\nNo Randomization - All resources are in the same spot every time, you start in 1 of 2 areas, each are very close to eachother. This gives 0 replayability.\n\nEnd of the world. Reach the end of the map? Thats it, it just cuts off. Most people who have played games know that most game designers add witty ways to end a map, such as an impassable mountain, a giant sea, walls, buildings.. ect.. nope, it just cuts off. This is game design 101.\n\nUnending spawns. Want to add excitement and actually fight some infected in a house? Lol no. Expect them to keep spawning on top of you till you are dead, like a clown car from hell, they will just keep pouring out.\n\n*This has since been fixed* [strike] Forced VR. If you have a VR setup, you will not be able to play this game without turning on Steam VR, despite this game not being a VR compatible game. [/strike]\n\nResolution options are inaccurate and bugged. If you like playing in window mode, you are going to have a terrible time getting this game to get the correct resolution.\n\nPro's and Cons\n\nPros: \n- Rapid development speed so far\n- Despite it's issues, it is fun to play for a short period\n- It does bring new concepts to the genre, hopefully the devs can deliver\n\nCons:\n- Above are most of them\n- This game needs a couple years of work\n\n-Final-\n\nAs stated, I don't recommend games on potential, but I do believe this game is on the right course for something excellent, whether or not the devs can deliver based off of the current state of the game is one thing. The glaring issues in this game are that of beginners, which does not inspire much hope in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1535123606, "timestamp_updated": 1541790166, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 223, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715990662574768066", "comment_count": 45, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45764345": {"recommendationid": "45764345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007263489", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1570, "last_played": 1597020132}, "language": "english", "review": "First Day:\n- Logged in, grabbed starting items from begining camp  *Chances of survival, optimistic*\n- Find a road and start walking towards a structure in the distance *Chances of survival, still optimistic*\n- Abadoned hotel with lots of goodies *Chances of survival,  pretty optimistic*\n- Go to the 2nd floor of hotel and realize one of the doors is a no go *Chances of survival, back to just optimistic*\n- Discovered a dirt road leading to what looks to be house, potential base *Chances of survival, extremely optimistic*\n- Walking down the path towards said structure when I begin to hear loud thuds in a pattern *Chances of surival, What's that sound?*\n- SHIT BEAR!  *Chances of surival, PANIC!*\n- Dodge in between trees, bear loses interest and shorten distance to future base *Chances of survival, back to optimistic)\n- Claim base and squel as I walk in side to see my new home *Chances of survival, IN YOUR FACE GAME)\n- Find water and knife inside but need supplies but happy to be weaponized *Chances of survival, Game's a Joke!)\n- Exploring becomes addictive, so many goodies, lose track of time *Chances of survival, Feels like I'm raiding WalMart, sooo many goodies*\n- Shut hood to car after grabbing engine to realize that the once beautiful nature sounds have been replaced with something...eerie *Chances of survival, PANIC!*\n- Turn around to look back at my sweet new base, now, not even visible *Chances of survival, Okay, Okay, I might of been a little too cocky*\n- Begin to attempt to make it back to my super sweet base when I realize I am no longer alone *Chances of survival, IT JUST GOT REAL*\n- At same time, the AI realizes they are no longer alone, AI runs like USAIN BOLT on CRACK *Chances of survival, Can't think straight, running for my life, dropping F-bombs all along the way*\n- Attempt same strategy of bear against my new friends, doesn't help, gets me lost *Chances of survival, THIS CAN'T BE THE END*\n- See a shack in the distance, looks like a shelter, I can make it! *Chances of survival, I'M GOING TO MAKE IT!

Of course being EA if you are more into the basebuilding side of the game, do not get attached to your bases during EA. To implement new features you will have to restart. It's expected in EA's to have to start from scratch a bunch so if that's your thing you may want to wait. \n", "timestamp_created": 1541953430, "timestamp_updated": 1541953430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715465784072875977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 41, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 5178, "total_negative": 1460, "total_reviews": 6638}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwAAAHfwuNkE": "Mon Apr 22 23:48:36 2024"}}
