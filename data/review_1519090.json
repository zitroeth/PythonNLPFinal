Pathfinding can be annoying in some places.\n\nThere are buildings to build that in normal survival games are just chests and workbenches.\n\nThey do work for you? You set up a beacon that requires energy to operate you have to produce first. So you can only build a very limited number of them since there are only three \u201cfuel\u201d points on the map, these are just wooden sticks that you burn for energy. Set how many Zombots have to work there, and then you never have to go back there again.\n\nThe enemies are fun and some can be tough, but overall the game is so easy that there is no challenge at all, which makes it very boring very quickly. I play with the bow and can kill groups of 20 zombies without even getting hit and with no zombies protecting me, with ease.\n\nThe fast travel spots are placed in strange places and result in a lot more \"walking simulator\" (or let's call it what it is) \"content stretching\" than necessary (which also makes it more boring quicker).\n\nWeapon progression is not good at all. I still shoot almost every zombie with the bow.\nSome have to be killed in melee so I use a spear to fight them, but there aren't many that require you to fight in melee, all can be killed in ranged combat, some only have armor so you do less damage , so you COULD even play the whole game with just ranged combat.\n\nThe auto aim is the worst of all, it makes the game so easy even my dog could play it.\n\nNot everything is bad, you will have at least a few hours of fun playing this game.\n\nThe biggest problem I have is that it's a finished product (so not early access), so I'm afraid there will only be small hotfixes and no major changes.

Getting a zombie minon to help mow down hordes was pretty fun too, especially with my coop partner. The game then introduced camp building and pylons which was the peak of excitement for me. Unfortunately it all went downhill after that. \n\nI think the game has a really neat idea, and tries to bring a lot of cool mechanics to the table. However most of those mechanics are short sighted, and lacking the depth needed to make them fully enjoyable. Ill start with what the game does well.\n\nHack and slash combat. This game does the mindless combat where you can do silly combinations of things with your minions and partner really well. This doubles down when done as coop. Though I think any more than 2 and the game would become too trivial. Unless the game spawns in zombies per player then that could get bonkers at points. Combat was a 5/5 for me\n\nRPG elements. The skill trees offered are simple, but neat. I opted for full zombot control while my partner dabbled across all three skill trees. It really didnt feel like our playstyles were directed much by the leveling paths we took up until I had 6 zombie minions to her 2. I would say the RPG elements are a 3/5\n\nTactical/strategy elements. For this I basically just mean the zombot control with a tiny lean into base mechanics. The zombot's were an exciting thing to me. I was in LOVE with Pikmin, and Overlord, and the idea of controlling zombies to do my bidding and keep me safe in the apocalypse was mouth watering. When it got down to it though, I was pretty bummed. Being limited to 1 zombot for about 50% of the game limited my options of tactics, meaning I just had to smack and shoot as much as my partner despite having all my points into my zombies. The zombots have neat automation triggers for in or out of combat, but fine control of them is nonexistant. Once I got to my second zombot, and they controlled two of their own zombots each it started to get quite funny. I didnt have to hack and slash much any more, but that is more because we had 4 zombots with flamethrowers and had very little to do with my extra zombies. A negative side note to the base part of this is the game takes the time to teach you how to capture your zombie, then as soon as you build a camp the pylons can just spawn in up to 9 infinitely. I would have much rather had to go collect each zombie I wanted to control and then leave them at the base. Tactics/Strategy elements were a 1/5 for me in this game\n\nSurvival elements. I have very little to say here. Crafting outside of bandages and ammo is basically nonexistant. You can make weapons, but the combat is so spammy and simple that the differences came down to if it was aoe or not and if the damage was high enough to one shot. I just crafted the ranged weapon with the biggest numbers and found a spear and never looked back. Survival elements are a 2/5.\n\nBase building. Awful and pointless. Unclear and wonky hitboxes mean base spacing is inconsistent. There really seems like there is no point with only 1 trap and wall type up to the halfway point of the game. There is really no need to have a camp, not even for your crafting needs because you rarely need to craft, and it could have just been a shop or npc you did it at instead. The prebuilt camps you can fight are built in a way more effective and compact way, making your base feel even worse. It fully feels like it was added just for the purpose of saying it is there and that is it. Having said all that, I am entering the part of the game where you are required to defend your base from zombies, (chapter 4) so maybe the next hour or two will change my mind. As of now Base building is 0/5\n\nOverall the game is not worth what I paid for it ($25). I could see it being a great get at $15 maybe even $20 if you can couch coop or remote play it with a friend. Solo, or if you each have to buy a copy I wouldnt spend more than $10 on it. Especially since they have over 5 cosmetic microtransactions already. This game is a fun little lighthearted couch game to play, I could see kids especially enjoying it with how simple it is.", "timestamp_created": 1709451856, "timestamp_updated": 1709451856, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.774196505546569824", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1709453385, "developer_response": "Hi TKG KnightHawk,\n\nThank you for playing Welcome to ParadiZe and sharing your feedback about the game.\n\nYour input is highly important to us.

I was waiting for this as I liked how it looked, it is very much my type of game, so I pre-ordered. Day of release, I had my beer ready, after work, time to relax! I open the game and at first launch the game felt very nice, looked great, played great, fought zombies, started the story and I was feeling good about this game! fast forward 12 hours in game later and well the truth is that the game is just very boring, the only gimmick is that you can kinda control zombies, but trust me, that wears off very quick! the game is full of these tiny things that irritate you in the worst kinda way, you can sometimes clip over some walls by rolling, but you can't get out unless you destroy the wall, the animations of the cut scenes are just horrible, I don't care much about that in particular, but I do hate that I cannot fast forward the dialog, either you watch the whole cut scene or skip it completely, if you choose to watch the cut scene, then sometimes the characters stop talking for a few seconds... then they continue, but you don't fully know if the dialog is over so you end up skipping half of the dialog scenes, not that it matters, the story is just plain simple, there is no meat and no real interest to find out about it other than to continue with the same missions as the missions all seem to be the exact same with minor variations, the enemy variation is meh at best, I have fought only 2 bosses, and they were as easy as they come they were more of a nuance than a real fight. The game feels easy and there is no way to change difficulty, most of the times I've died is because of stupid mistakes by me. The UI looks nice, but its very cumbersome to use. Building is VERY limited, it seems they want this to be part of the endgame, I guess for some reason they think people will keep playing the horde mini game after they complete the game? There is absolutely no survival elements present, the food and water just give you some healing and some of them status effects, but they are absolutely not necessary.

but that's the only technical issue i found.\n\nno one cares about the story in these games. but it's kinda here. again very tongue and cheek. some memorable characters, like the nurse (probably in name only) Mary, some not quite hitting jokes about popular figures in real life. the dialogue and great, it ain't terrible either. npc models are a bit sketchy. but again: who plays these games for the plot.\n\nthe major isssue i got is the balancing. there's some work to be done here. escort mission are a mess, the npcs you escort pretty much die instantly, which leads to a restart of said mission. you can kinda work around this by clearing the path beforehand...but that's just not great design.\nand the base defense missions later on are just plain terrible. doesn't matter much how strong you build your base or the defenses: it's to many enemies and to strong ones. there's whole guides already on how to cheese these missions, cause doing em normaly is beyond frustrating. \nbottom line: balance needs patches.", "timestamp_created": 1709667904, "timestamp_updated": 1709667904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737509667873382568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160882844": {"recommendationid": "160882844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383502372", "num_games_owned": 973, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 774, "last_played": 1709341971}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing the other zombie top down games these guys made, pretty interesting but nothing earth shattering.

You don't need your base near water or wood, because the pylons (zom-bot spawners) can be anywhere on the map (in the forest).\n\n\nIt is ok enough to enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1709242393, "timestamp_updated": 1709242469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673393726348876953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159780238": {"recommendationid": "159780238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122701506", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1709757076}, "language": "english", "review": "Not really understanding the negative reviews... level 28 and 12 hours in, sure its not some genre defining masterpiece but for the price i think it nails everything its trying to do.

I was amused for a while, the humour was a nice touch and it's a fresh take on zombie survival. I laughed out loud when I hopped on the back of a zombie and rode him. Aesthetically, it's a good looking game and runs well but that's about all the positives I can think of.\n\nI haven't finished it but if there's something in my suggestions that's already in the game feel free to point it out and I'll change my review.\n\nThe combat needs some more variety. Zombies should hit harder and getting swarmed should be dangerous but instead I'll voluntarily roll into a group and start swinging my bat knocking all the Zs around. Ranged combat felt nice at first. High velocity shots hitting with power that knock enemies around or make them fly if they die but once you realize that ranged weapons can take out groups in no time at all it just becomes a monotonous game of auto aim and fire while walking around. I'd like some skills to add to the weapons, maybe add modifiers to the ammos and weapons to do different things or add an extra skill or two to melee weapons. Blades (or sharpened blades for already bladed weapons) for some bleed chance or insta-decap chance, weights to knock Zs around, fire to set ablaze groups, shocking to electrocute and briefly stun, etc. A sprinting attack and two handed weapons with some ground attacks would be a welcome addition too think. I do love slamming around zombies with a sledgehammer or big axe. \n\nSpeaking of axes, in the wood farming areas (stick spawners) there's an axe right there that you can't take. I was super disappointed. Then I was even more disappointed when I started building my base and the only tree in the middle of it is permanent and has a huge area around it where I can't build anything. Base building feels so restrictive when it comes to building around existing pieces of the world. I understand not being able to cut down trees on the borders of the paths but let us cut down the solo trees for some extra wood, sticks and leaves. \n\nSetting up material farms is pretty lackluster too. They take up power from your generator, you choose how many Zs to spawn, you give them a couple commands and never come back. Let us have to to give the Zombots axes to smack around trees instead of having them eternally pick up sticks, or have us have to set up defenses or walls for them to help them defend against small hordes or something.\n\nZombots are a unique mechanic but not very deep. I have no attachment to my zombie companion. Why bother with wasting a skill on being able to revive them when I have 50 more helmets in my inventory. What else am I going to do with that 2000 scrap and 150 broken helmets? They should be given a random name (so we can bond with these lovely beings) and they should level up separately from me, though have them level faster and have a low max level so you don't feel gated into having to keep them. Maybe two types of helmets that pick between our current limited Z or a levelable companion, the latter being a lot more resource intensive to make. Just something to make us choose between wanting to have an actual companion or a disposable self-destructing meat sack that will run into hordes with spiky armour. Maybe give them a small set of skill points and move my skills that boost their skills into their own skill tree. So I can hack a zombie, give him a gun or machete and as he levels I can put points into levelling up his damage, attack speed, health/regen, or even give us the ability to make them a pack mule and add points to help them carry my junk. I'm also a bit disappointed that you don't really equip them with items from your inventory and if they die, the next zombie you hack immediately has the item and armour of the last one. \n\nFinal complaint is more around the NPCs dialogue flow. Their animations are randomly looped and constantly played and make them feel like puppets instead of humans. Bob swinging around his arms opening and closing his laptop 20 times during our conversation was super weird and felt like a lazy design. NPCs need to be less animated during dialog and when they do animate it should be for emphasis or at least related to the context of the conversation.\n\nOverall, like I said it's not bad and definitely has great potential.\n\nI think was hoping for a bit more of a survival element than an this arcadey auto aim filled left click walking simulator.", "timestamp_created": 1709317562, "timestamp_updated": 1709317562, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630814671516418457", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1709421389, "developer_response": "Hi bradyonly,\n\nThank you for playing Welcome to ParadiZe and sharing your thoughts about the game. \n\nWe are glad that know that you like the game, and we really appreciate your thorough and detailed feedback about our game's combat, axes in the wood farming areas, setting up farm material, Zombots mechanic and NPCs dialogue flow.

Mindless button mashing and killing zombies, that's about it. That's a lot less than I was hoping for out of this game when I first came across it.\n\n- The map is very expansive, but feels sort of lifeless beyond moving from objective to objective and the occasional enemy base.\n\n- The UI could be a little better. Some of the gun icons in the inventory look too similar, I find myself hovering over ever gun to determine whether is a pistol, rifle, etc. I'm sure with another 5+ hours they'd start to look a little different, but when I want to change weapons on the fly, it can be difficult, it cant take a second or two.\n               - Moving items from your personal inventory to your camp inventory could also be a lot better if I could just Shift + Click on the items I want to move.\n\n- Weapon upgrades. To me, it seems pretty silly to me that you have the ability to upgrade weapons that require XX level to use, when your character is currently below that level. It took me a solid minute, minute and half to figure out why it wouldn't let me equip my upgraded air rifle. Turns out, I was Level 14, and I couldn't equip that upgraded rifle until Level 15. Seems it would just make sense to lock those upgrades until the appropriate level is achieved.\n\n- Melee combat could be a bit better. With how the AI zombies move from time to time, your swings can be wildly mistimed and misplaced. I wish I had the ability to pivot my character mid-swing to adjust for that.\n\nBesides the few downsides, this is a fun game to just hop on and mash away at zombies. But as of right now, that's all I really see this game as: a time killer.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what QoL improvements come over time.", "timestamp_created": 1709256075, "timestamp_updated": 1709263276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563080251216888428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1709424300, "developer_response": "Hi Cappy,\n\nThank you for playing Welcome to ParadiZe and for sending us your thoughts about the game.

I hope that the game evolves and then bring us more modes and more challenges. \n\n[h2] Pro: [/h2]\n- Easy to play (either keyboard/mouse or joystick).\n- Unique and innovative approach.\n- Good translation \n- Many constructions and items.\n- RUN USING (O)/(B) IN JOYSTICK IT'S A PRETTY BAD CHOICE. I think that's the only complain about the controls itself. \n\n[h2] Cons: [/h2]\n- Too easy in some moments. Except for a few instances, most of the time, the game feels a bit 'too easy.' It lacks the sense of 'desperation' and 'challenge' that other similar games, such as Project Zomboid and even 7 Days to Die, provide. I'll elaborate more on this in the 'Is it worth buying this game?' section.\n- Bad optimization. It's a joke that a game like this requires 12 GB of RAM and sporadically gives errors warning that 'The game will crash,' which are caused precisely by the lack of available RAM on the PC. This is clearly a serious mistake that needs to be fixed if the game wants to reach a large audience. Definitely, a game like this should not require 12 GB of RAM.\n\nSo,\n[h2] Is it worth buying this game?[/h2]\nI paid approximately 18 dollars and I genuinely believe that the game has a lot of potential. Considering its already robust structure and well-established physics and gameplay, that can worth the money if Nacon doesn't abandon this game and creates new modes, maps, etc. (please create a Survival Mode for Multiplayer) This game has the potential to be one of the best ever made in the zombie genre.\n\nBut, if they don't improve with more zombots to get and stronger zombies I really think that this game will be a big waste of potential. \n\nI believe in Nacon. \n\nPs: I really thinks that they need to balance the early game. That needs to be harder. Just nerf the damage, put the max health character in 50 and it's done. And then enable more zombots", "timestamp_created": 1709337406, "timestamp_updated": 1709337406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542112886905670166", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1709424255, "developer_response": "Hi Jhowpitoco,\n\nThank you for playing Welcome to ParadiZe and for sending us your thoughts about the game.

Every environment, from the sandy beaches to the dimly lit arcade, oozes authentic retro charm.\n\nThe synthwave soundtrack is a standout element, infusing every moment with an infectious energy that propels you forward. Each track expertly balances catchy melodies with a sense of underlying intrigue that hints at something lurking beneath the carefree facade.\n\n[h2]Paradise Has Its Secrets[/h2]\n\nInitially, Welcome to Paradize presents itself as a relaxing and aimless exploration experience. You're free to roam the island, interact with quirky characters, play arcade mini-games, and bask in the nostalgic ambiance. But as you dig a little deeper, the narrative starts to unfold, revealing a central mystery and a surprising level of depth.\n\nWithout delving into spoilers, this mystery element kept me thoroughly engaged. Discovering hidden messages, piecing together clues, and encountering increasingly bizarre situations became the driving force behind my playthrough. The narrative strikes a satisfying balance between humor, strangeness, and a touch of the existential that makes it feel entirely unique.\n\n[h2]Gameplay Variety & Unexpected Depth[/h2]\n\nWhile the visuals and music might be the initial draw, the gameplay in Welcome to Paradize kept me hooked. The island is surprisingly packed with activities.  You can perfect your skills at arcade classics, try your hand at fishing, test your luck with hidden slot machines, or even partake in some impromptu car races.\n\nI was impressed by the amount of hidden content and unlockables scattered throughout the island. Exploration is consistently rewarded, fueling a satisfying sense of discovery and a desire to see everything the game has to offer.\n\n[h2]The Verdict[/h2]\n\nWelcome to Paradize took me by surprise. It\u2019s more than just a nostalgic visual treat. This is a surprisingly polished and content-rich experience that weaves a compelling mystery alongside its laid-back, summery vibes. If you have a fondness for retro aesthetics, synthwave music, and enjoy a little strangeness mixed into your games, Welcome to Paradize is a must-play.", "timestamp_created": 1712952277, "timestamp_updated": 1712952277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511861324310302734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159580255": {"recommendationid": "159580255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069133132", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1709215637}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is pretty clunky at the moment, twice while playing in the full screen mode, I switched to a different window and it froze\n-Tried to play on the second monitor (it being a TV), there was screen tearing despite me trying many different graphic options and fps settings\n-The AI is horrendous, the zombie picked up only one item while I had the time to pick up 10 things.\n-Set the zombie to attract attention while in and out of combat, had mostly no affect\n-Some things just insta-kill you, like the green gas or spikes, but there's no warning, in other games super dangerous things push you back usually, or gradually kill you so you can turn back\n-Those executions of the zombies on the ground are useless and just take too long, might as well just last hit them instead\n-You can't even walk while charging your heavy attack, which is ridiculous\n\nOverall the game feels not ready, maybe later it will be good, it does have potential imo if you can get over that ugly render style, which makes the game look outdated.", "timestamp_created": 1709260620, "timestamp_updated": 1709260620, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510835945606231689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1709320176, "developer_response": "Hi xazard,\n\nThanks for trying the game and sharing your experience.

How about multiple Zombies, how about a complete slave labor force of zombies to fight for you and do menial task? Well, stop because that's weird. This game isn't for you. You personally, the guy or girl or alien whose eyes are reading this comment right now. This game is not for you. It is a game for anyone but you. You the individual reading this comment from your phone, or carved in an apple, or sitting at your computer or standing on your desk in the middle of mars. Stop doing that, why are you even there. Jupiter is the planet that all the cool people visit. Mars is a big red dead desert. Jupiter has a big ass eternal hurricane, and its made up of different stages of hydrogen. its a big red hydrogen rusty looking planet full of cookies and kool-aid.

You get a pretty decent experience.  Its like pokemon or Palworld, but not as detailed, meets diablo. It has that top down dungeony crawly look....but, you mostly dungeon crawl through Nature's Dungeon, The Forest. But, not the Forest from the game the Forest, or the Forest 2. Hold your horses. if you have some. if not, ill wait for you to go down to the local wally world and buy a horse. hurry though, we are all waiting. basically you can capture and collect Zombies, you can give them bling. You can dress them up like a horse, make them wear a target, give them nerf guns, then go around fighting and collecting other zombies.  It has some base building, i guess.. you can't build things brick by boring brick like in Minecraft, if you progress through the game, and get the resources you get a choice of pre-fabricated buildings that you can construct. Also, every time you die you lose experience. Which sounds legit. I mean every time you bonk your head you lose memories, and gold rings. So , of course if you die you'd lose experience. The best experience is gaining back lost experience. Which, you probably will die. Probably because you do something stupid, or smart but the game slaps you around anyways.. This isn't dark souls though. or Elden Ring.  So, its not gonna slap you hard. just a light slapping. Youll be fine. so tl;dr - You make zombies your servants, and you survive. thats the gist here.

It's bigger than I thought it would be, and there are a lot of options for your zombies that you don't see right off, as the game opens up and you get more equipment for them that causes them to behave differently.\n\nYou open up enough new stuff and areas to keep things interesting as you go, so it ended up being one of the few games that I actually finished.\n\nWhile the zombie skill line is definitely the most interesting, it feels a bit weak compared to what you can learn in the other lines.\n\nThere is a skill respec, but I've seen a bug report claiming that using the skill respec makes you lose the extra skill points you picked up in side quests.

[/h1]\r\n\r\nTLDR: Good initial presentation and premise, very flawed execution due to frustrating combat that lacks depth, base/resource management issues, forgettable maps with awful temperature and traversal mechanics, and weak characters driving a story with basic and annoying quest design.\r\n\r\nI'll just list the major issues I had with enjoying this experience with the least amount of spoilers possible. \r\n\r\nFirstly are the zombot companions. The limitations of 2 zombots in their number and gear variety became more obvious as the game stretched on as you cannot upgrade their gear beyond \"common\" and the health of enemies ballooned with higher levels causing me to fall back on the only major damage and crowd control idea I could come up with which ignored primary weapons completely (mine laying/throwing cannot be mitigated, goes through some walls, destroys structures/groups and simply going up the skill tree allows for tanky, self rez, aggro generators with the downside that they are unreliable sometimes due to pathing sticking to certain buildings and walls, enemies ignoring them even when provoked and cluttering the map with interactable mines). Before that was flamethrowers as they also cannot be mitigated and were good against crowds. The central idea was that I was always looking for something that was guaranteed to work because I had gotten fed up and seeing a melee/ranged zombot waiting for me assist them against an enemy resistant to their weapon-type (dancers are just always immune to ranged???). The frustration of managing their gear became critical in later zones, requiring babysitting the bots for harsh weather effects and traversal demanding changes in one of your only two bots at minimum for entire hours worth of regions. Examples being: the saddle being used to awkwardly cross gaps in harsh weather regions while the zombots just fall into the gaps leaving you alone until you rush to replace them manually or die from weather, gear being used to clear instant death fog that can return even with a player inside of it despite the fog having no real purpose other than instant death hazard that enemies can ignore, and temperature control constantly forcing me to hover around my bots (even when I also need one with a saddle to cross lava???). The final tragedy is that they have zero personality beyond voice/body/gender differences, no reason to be attached to them, no reason to be selective with which ones you control, no regional differences other than clothing and new gear, none of them have interesting mutations or special statistics/preferences for gear, they are not your friends, they are tools that at best can salute you (at the cost of one of their behavior programing allowances).\r\n\r\n...Realizing how much time I'm spending on this I'll summarize the rest. \r\n\r\nMaps - Terrain issues causing restarts in the first desert (player stuck) and in chemical zone (zombots under the map, I'm trapped by instant-kill gas and everything else is dead, god help me). Themes are as bare bones as possible, forest, city, desert, swamp, snowy mountains are all filled with uninspiring visuals and forgettable expanses of nothing, landmarks being toppled cars, gravesites with no background information, caves being absolutely devoid of anything meaningful and stretching on painfully, the worst being the final volcano zone that at best... has an amongus reference at the entrance. The charm of a theoretical paradise resort fallen to zombies was realized by games like dead island 12 years ago and the wasted potential of the exact same but with a society built on mind controlled undead with a more comedic and lighthearted approach is simply not fully realized.\r\n\r\nCombat - Hit things or shoot things, some times you are forced to do the other or you are instant killed by an explosion or stunlocked from being shot and falling down into being swarmed. You never really feel amazing about combat, there's no complex executions or satisfaction of a fully realized build overcoming a great challenge. The defence of a base relies on chokepoints, mine spam, or similar as entire waves of bomb runners from multiple directions forced me to move my base (a boss can just spawn hazards on top of your zombots that disable your defences and mindcontrols them unless destroyed). Massive levels of explosives, traps, gun wielding, or heavily barricaded enemies made late game agony. Bosses tend to be massive bullet sponges, some requiring specific targeting on parts which zombots fail at and make the fights awkward. Also, no zombie bosses outside of animals, why?\r\n\r\nStory/Characters/Quest - I don't remember anyone's name beyond Bob... and that at one point the player character is betrayed by a person they help and is forced to flee, but you never get vengeance, or an explanation, and you just move on. In fact I think basically everyone just bosses you around or is terrible to you for a majority of the time outside Bob's group and \"noname\" which would be fine if it were funny or entertaining to interact with the characters, but I never felt happy about doing so. All Quest are either fetch quest, an interact with thing here quest, or a kill/destroy quest with sometimes very vague instructions (like an entire region being the zone to search for destructibles) and at worst... [b]  escort quest... WITH TANK CONTROLS?! [/b] Also I just did not enjoy the entire ending sequence.\r\n\r\nOkay, I'm too tired to ramble on, there's plenty of more issues (like how mythic weapon rewards are only from base defence, but nothing tells you that...) I don't want to list that loomed over my time with the game. I really wanted to not regret purchasing and spending time on this product, but I just can't say it was worth it, nor would I want someone who thinks any of my explained points would ruin their experience to also have my same regrets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1709400578, "timestamp_updated": 1709400578, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925341129302979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1709449573, "developer_response": "Hi Kota,\n\nThank you for playing Welcome to ParadiZe and sharing your feedback about the game.\n\nYour input is highly important to us.
