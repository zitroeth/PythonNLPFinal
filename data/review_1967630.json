The initial struggle for survival was great. It was fair and not tedious as in some other games. You almost feel how pathetic your initial primitive tools are. And you really cheer once you figure out how to build better ones. The shelter/house building system is absolutely great and not grindy.  One chopped tree lets you to build up to four wall segments. An absolute gem is the ability to move already constructed walls (or disassemble them and get the resources back).\n\nAll islands are cleverly designed with lots of hidden stuff, resources and varied animals, encouraging exploration.\n\nThere are some pretty unique mechanics (very minor spoiler for the first 5 minutes of the game: you can choose some initial tools), a very reasonable fast travel system once you construct a raft or a boat, animals that are getting easier to hunt, but still dangerous later on if you don't pay enough attention etc.\n\nI've spent 100+ hours on it and thoroughly enjoyed every single minute on it. The game was in EA when I reviewed this, but I have not encountered any bugs or crashes. The last region was not available. All other regions were fully finished. The story was entertaining and well written.\n\nOverall, I found my favourite survival game!", "timestamp_created": 1706657891, "timestamp_updated": 1706657891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708960950374603271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161767294": {"recommendationid": "161767294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172621506", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3286, "last_played": 1711754002}, "language": "english", "review": "I... REALLY like this game.

Barely.    Unfortunately a lot of them are badly implemented in some of the most annoying, tedious and obnoxious ways possible.   Hopefully this crap gets addressed before full release. Some of the worst examples:\n\nPick up 2 rocks on an empty inventory and you're over weight.  Worse, the terrible sound design has you ceaselessly grunting like you're constipated.  Its almost impossible to craft anything without an overweight inventory.  Carting around a wheelbarrow with you everywhere barely helps.\n\nAn unreal amount of time passed to do anything... and I mean anything.   Pluck a tree for a couple fronds.. hours pass in the game.  Open a coconut to drink, hours pass.  This means its almost impossible to stay on top of the constant thirst and hunger.\n\nObnoxiously arbitrary degradation of a lot of things in the game where the stuff degrades based on days, not usage which would make more sense.  And remember above.. everything takes stupid amounts of time.  12 hours to start a fire.. another 20 just to cook a couple things and now look, all the stuff you just made to wear is seriously degraded from you just standing there.   Whee, how fun.\n\nOverall terrible sound design.  Most sounds in the game are just annoying in not only how they play, but the frequency.  From the overweight constant constipated grunting, to the worse rattlesnake noise that I've ever heard.  And what's the excuse here, not like the sound of a rattlesnake is copy-written.  Any moron can find an example of a real world rattlesnake sound.  Most animals in the game are like this.\n\nAnyway, the game does have a lot of good going for it though too.

Even when you get \"better\" weapons this doesn't improve.\n\nWater is always a problem especially when you get to the next island where you overheat and it becomes a real pain. I spent so much time travelling back and forth between islands to stock up on water. The tools you need at the various benches need to be picked up, used and put back in a chest. Does a blacksmith carry around his tongs and hammer or does he just leave them on his forge? It's just irritating when it tells you you're missing a tool. Even more when it tells you it's broken and needs repairing. \n\nCreatures seem to spawn too quickly. I need to kill 4 or 5 crits on my way into a camp and following the same path back they were waiting for me. I couldn't repair my spear, which broke during this so I had to run through them while they beat on you. (while overheating and low on water) If you sleep without a 60% water and hunger rating you don't fully heal or regain stamina so you need to gather water.......\n\nWeapons and tools need to be 3x stronger. Get rid of the overheating and this could be good.\n\nThis should be fun but it isn't. I've come to the third island and my motivation is gone. I wanted to carry on but I just can't.

The game\u2019s setting, and the freedom to play it as a sandbox facilitates roleplay at your own pace. Of course there is the storyline which can serve as a pretext for exploration, but it will not be the focus of this review.\r\n\r\nThe game can be highly immersive with the right approach. Set it to the highest difficulty from the start. Figuring out the mechanics, as well as the whole journey will feel much more rewarding. You may die a couple of times, but it\u2019s not much of an issue, as the penalties for dying are nullified through an ingame mechanic \u2013 living water.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the limited resources you will find, however the main limited resource, in SFoY as in life, is time. The gameplay loop is centred around time management, and by progressing in technology the player can complete actions more efficiently, i.e. gather, repair, cook, or even travel at a lesser time expense. The progression from stone, through obsidian and copper, to iron is an experience of human prehistory.\r\n\r\nSFoY can be relaxing when taken slowly. Once you overcome the struggle of getting water, food, shelter, and medicine there is still more to do. Explore. Collect rare items. Upgrade your gear and tools. Make a garden. Build an amazing fortress on top of a mountain. Watch a sunrise at 3 a.m\u2026\r\n\r\nIn summary, SFoY is not a perfect game: there is some jankiness in animal movement, and the story snippets and cutscenes may lack the triple A polish, but the game is a great sandbox survival experience when played on the highest difficulty setting. \r\n", "timestamp_created": 1713383839, "timestamp_updated": 1713383839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504595577716827393", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158681082": {"recommendationid": "158681082", "author": {"steamid": "76561199383677250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2671, "playtime_at_review": 4713, "last_played": 1713735019}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so fun!

At its best you experience a tactile engagement with a living world. Chopping that log, felling that tree or picking up those rocks needs to feel good and rewarding.\n\nOr you could just make the process so tedious, I loose all enjoyment of it. \n\nWhich is what this game chose to do.\n\nHere, when you engage with any object or \"resource node\" in the world, you press a button to interact, which brings up a menu. You then select how many resources out of a maximum you want to harvest from that node - let's say picking up three sticks out of five available from a small tree. The game then calculates the time per resource harvested to pass while you did that and advances the clock accordingly.\n\nIt feels like sitting in a beautiful nature location, but only focusing on the spreadsheet data printouts of it that you have brought along. \n\nIt feels inherently wrong.\n\nIt feels like I am playing a game, not interacting with a world.\n\nWhile this is the one design choice that made me not want to play the game, it is by no means to only bad one.\n\nIn good survival design a resource node never feels like a resource node, but a part of the world you engage with. The opposite of that would be when you, for example, cannot pick up those nice looking stones over there, because they aren't part of a node or you can only harvest sticks from that specific kind of tree, never mind picking them off the ground like you would in real life. \n\nWhich, again, is what this game chooses to do. \n\nNevermind that those basic resource nodes are unnaturally scarce. I get that the developer wants to make survival challenging, but when you make picking up sticks, stones and leaves a tedious process with a lots, and I really mean lots, of running around, the fun gets lost along the way. I don't think I have ever seen it done quite as badly in any surival game.\n\nSadly, the world interaction through menus and time passing offscreen seems to be integral to the developer's vision for the project, which is why this ended up being the first time I actually refunded a game on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1688940555, "timestamp_updated": 1688991348, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 383, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90990293025970459", "comment_count": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139605262": {"recommendationid": "139605262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183828193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2655, "last_played": 1710364036}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely one of the best survival games I've played.

My first semi-blind playthrough took 33 hrs, altho I like to take my time, explore and prepare, so take that as you will. The game is, compared to other offerings in the genre, very polished for an early access release. UI is also really nice. That said, the crafting UI is very, very game-y and if you're a fan of how Green Hell or The Forest handle their crafting UIs, you very likely won't like this one.\n\nIn most survival games I've played, there's a point where you can grow your own food, have excess of every resource and generally become unkillable. This isn't the case in this game (not right now at least). Natural resources respawn after +20 in-game days, there are various status effects you have to keep in mind or take care of (weather, diseases, etc.), you have to sleep once in a while to not fall over from exhaustion. It's always a risk if you go out exploring without proper prep. Exploration is fun and rewarding. The plot is there for you to unravel at your own pace, there's no HURRYUP'pers at any point. Graphics are respectable. not AAA quality by any means, but the game does look nice.\nAs far as performance goes, it's meh. Not great, not terrible. GPU is almost never fully utilized (RTX 3070). There's no upscaling (DLSS/FSR), no borderless windowed mode (it can forced with Borderless Gaming or alternatives). Also no FOV slider (at the time of writing this review) so check out the demo first (if it's still up) or some gameplays on YT to make sure you're fine with it.\n\nWhat I don't like, in no particular order:\n- Going down slopes makes you do tiny little jumps. These jumps count as being mid air, so you can't jump by pressing your jump key. This makes nailing jumps trickier than it should be. Also the sound of constantly landing on the ground is annoying.\n- Fall damage is very \"aggressive\", so to speak. Falling from small heights deals little bits of damage that add up over time. I'd prefer if the lowest required height to take fall damage was increased along with the damage the player receives.\n- House building system is rather painful to use. You have to craft an item that's essentially a \"building block\", craft a hammer, place \"ghosts\" of what you want to build using the hammer and then manually go through the so popular \"crafting popup\" for every single piece. It's somewhere between Icarus/old Conan building system and Valheim/Rust, where the latter is superior. That said, once built, you can freely move most things around without deconstructing them, which is really, really nice.\n- There's way too many goddamn crafting stations. And most of them have upgrades, one or two levels. Upgrades which either unlock crafting recipes that this station should have access to from the beginning or something that's available later in the game. There's an alcohol distiller that's sole purpose is to make one item. Sure, it makes sense it does just that, but it's a video game. Why can't the alchemy table do this?\n- Certain actions take way too much time. I think I know why it's the way it is, but as the same time I wish it didn't take me 45 minutes to pick 3 oranges from a small tree.\n- Storing large amount of heavy items is a PITA. Storage containers have infinite slots (I think), but are limited by weight, so if you wanna store a lot of rocks or ores, be ready to build multiple boxes.\n- Refining ores doesn't follow the established \"confirm the action and stare at passing time\" crafting system. You put the ores in, light the fire and have to babysit the crafting station to manually remove the crafted item, put raw resources in and press \"CRAFT\" again. It's tedious and not fun. Same applies to making charcoal.\n- Other minor balance oddities like a barrel holding 5 more units of water than a palm sized bamboo stick.", "timestamp_created": 1682630203, "timestamp_updated": 1682630203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.817230224609375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141171632": {"recommendationid": "141171632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165355474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 10298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1875, "last_played": 1701807164}, "language": "english", "review": "Post Update Edit: Game is getting much better after the last update.

This is not a game that players should attempt rushing through. You really have to look at the resources you need for your future crafts and plan accordingly. \n\nOne of the oddities of the game mechanics that players may or may not enjoy is the that nearly all resource gathering and crafting is menu driven. You won't be swinging your axe to chop down a tree. Instead, you will be taken to a menu which will tell you how long it will take for the action. Time in this game passes accordingly, and is an ever present struggle. For that reason, simply gathering everything you see is a poor strategy that will often leave you starving or dying of thirst. \n\nI personally am not a fan of this mechanic. It is the least immersive way of experiencing a survival game. It feels like it should be a placeholder for future animations. But given that the leveling system is based on this time mechanic, I believe this is the direction the developers will continue forward on, for better or worse. \n\nGraphically the game is average, and so is its music/sound. However, the maps are designed well and create an engaging player experience. \nAI leaves a bit to be desired. Fighting in this game comes down to timing your attack so you don't take damage from creatures leaping on you. \nWeather conditions and your overall character hunger/thirst/energy levels do play an important part in success, and are a contributing factor in whether you get wounded while engaging in nearly any activity. It also effects how likely you are to catch a cold, a stomach ache, fever, etc. There are a number of different conditions, all resolvable by creation various liniments and bandages. It does however ultimately come down to RNG, and can be very frustrating, especially in the early game. \n\nOne gripe I do have about the game is that the feeling of real progression is difficult to come by. Important resource nodes take a long time to replenish, so even though you may be able to craft better gear, the resource cost often means you'll still be crafting stone tools well into the late game. Similarly, the game leaves you feeling like you're just chasing your own tail most of the time. And though the game does get easier through your characters level progression and perks, you never truly feel like you've fully gotten out of the stone age. Larger ore nodes and/or faster replenishment time would help alleviate this issue, but it may be by design. \n\nIt is worth noting however that the game is far from complete. There may be more tiers that they will be implementing to get around the above issues. To the developers credit, I had no serious bugs during my 60 hours of playtime. The bugs I did experience were more of a slight inconvenience. The part of the game that is complete is well done and perfectly playable and enjoyable. It seems that the devs have more of a DLC style roadmap in mind, where they will release new islands through development. This is a smart idea, and I hope that players will not need to start completely over as they add to it. \n\nOverall, the devs did a great job bringing everything together, and I recommend the game for anyone into this genre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1688491147, "timestamp_updated": 1689054038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785822689533233643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1688556463, "developer_response": "Hello!

But I now very much appreciate how the physics of the player work in the game, as it feels more grounded in realism, and really isn't that bad at all. The time passing mechanic kinda grew on me as it actually keeps the pace of the game going from decision to decision and I have absolutely no complaints.\n\nWhat keeps me hooked on playing the game is the immersion I feel in the world.

Which was a good thing, because there aren't that many survival games focusing on balanced and realistic survival. Gathering food, water, treating wounds, hunting animals and struggling against hostile environment to survive until next day were your primary tasks. It was clear that original concept for the game was a realistic survival simulator where you had to carefully explore islands and plan your actions in advance, manage time and resources.\n\nThat's why people who played the demo reasonably expected the game to continue evolving in that direction. Unfortunately, developers didn't have a spine to stand up for their original vision. As soon as some kids from Minecraft/Roblox scene started to complain, because they had to actually spend their time surviving and could not just instantly win everything and build skyscrapers, developers took the game into a drastically different direction - towards a relaxed doing-nothing & fooling-around sandbox game.\n\nSome recent changes the developers introduced compared to original Fountain of Youth from 2022:\n[list]\n    [*]Attack trigger distances for all animals were reduced by 500% or more (now it's less than 2 meters for some predators), so now you can freely walk everywhere without ever being attacked, unless you specifically look for encounters and literally bump into animals.\n    [*]Inventory/carry capacity was pushed well beyond any realism (was ~20kg on hardest mode after all upgrades, now it's over 90kg), so managing your inventory and building carts to carry more items became irrelevant.\n    [*]Crafting times for all blueprints were reduced to bare minimum.\n    [*]Requirements for quantity of resources for crafting are also reduced in every update.\n    [*]Amounts of resource spawns is increased in every update, while resource respawn times are decreased, so there is less and less incentive left exploring islands.\n    [*]Fire starting time was decreased several times, so now you don't even need to use tinder (which was an important part of original gameplay).\n    [*]Time to harvest resources is decreased in every update, so now all harvesting is almost instant (takes 1 minute, in the past it was from 5 to 10 minutes of in-game time).\n    [*]By disassembling crafted objects you always get back 100% of resources, including from burned fires. Which means you never need fuel for fire, it's infinite. The whole concept of harvesting and stocking wood (integral part of original gameplay) is destroyed.\n    [*]Original concept of exploring global map and travelling between distant islands was removed completely. Was replaced by instant-travel, where you just click on a button and next second you arrive to another island without any effort. Food dehydrator and smokehouse became meaningless for gameplay, since there is no feasible scenario  any longer where you need any long-term storage food.\n    [*]Mines with ore, which in the past required crafting pickaxe, now have pre-mined ore just lying in front of them, so you can pick up ore without any effort.\n    [*]Cold temperature at night (required burning campfire), mosquito swamps (required malaria treatment), and many other features from demo were also removed completely.\n[/list]\n\nThis list can go on and on, every single aspect of gameplay was affected. The whole game was remade in a way so that you can successfully \"survive\" without any real effort and without ever being in danger. After all these changes, there is no survival simulator and no original FoY concept left to speak of.\n\nMoreover, all of that fully applies even to hardest modes. While I and other people asked developers to differentiate between difficulty modes so that the game remains similar to demo at least on hardest settings, there was no response, and developers keep introducing sweeping changes across all difficulty modes. Every next patch note comes with row after row \"more resources everywhere, less time to do everything, easier everything, etc.\" They call it \"improving game balance\", but somehow all that balance always goes only one way - by making everything x2, x5, or x10 easier, and discarding all original survival mechanics one by one.\n\nLong story short, in hopes of attracting a wider audience of casual gamers who can't be bothered to actually survive and just constantly beg to make instant-craft, instant-harvest, auto-walk, auto-eat, infinite-resources, and basically instant/auto/infinite everything, developers completely butchered and destroyed their original vision of the project.

The game already feels like good competitor to Stranded Deep which is finished and released for quite a time. Here are core points for people wondering about place of Survival: Fountain of Youth in vast space of 'open world craft' games:\n- Story is not forced or mandatory. In the start, your major concern will be survival and first steps in story helps you to figure it out. After that you will be able to afford to indulge your creativeness and build things as you want.\n- Game progress is based on skills/perks and resource/tools/machines. Skills and perks are not simple bonuses to crafting speed and some choices can make your survival a lot easier. But like in a real life, the biggest leaps happen due to exploiting new resources and building new tools. Exploring and hunting is necessary for a lot of critical materials but ability to reveal parts of the map simplifies this process a lot.\n- Renewable sources of materials. Respawn times are quite long but still there is no pressure to hoard things and no existential dread of running out of resources.\n- Several tiers of tools and equipment. Crafting menu is quite extensive and will expand in the future. Crafting complicated stuff have a lot of requirements but some simplifications are made and overall it is quite manageable.\n- A lot of factors to take care of. Sunburn, indigestion, heatstroke, poisoning, flu, fever, injury, light conditions etc. Everything can be solved and even quite easy but it could be a steep learning curve. Some negative reviews are already reflecting that, for example, people having no clue that they are getting injuries due to crafting in the dark.\n- Story and lore are there if you need it. It is not just pure sandbox, there is a proper setting and pieces of the puzzle spread across the islands.\nGraphics is good enough for such extensive game. Music, on other side, is quite good and really gives vibes of 16th century expedition.

It also looks very good! UI, controls, all nothing crazy, but works. And as usual, WAY too grindy in default settings. \nThe medical system is overloaded and annoying in any setting though. \n\n The boat system  is even now something more interesting. Hoping there are more options coming. \nCombat is pretty standard, not amazing or anything special.  There are also multiple difficulty options to adjust the gameplay.

The game is still in EA and only 2 of 5 regions are currently available but there is already a lot to see and do while the realities of walking/sailing in and around Caribbean islands in the 16th century make the world seem quite large - and biome exploration is a basic requirement if you want to do more than sit on a beach drinking coconut milk and trying to spear a crab for lunch. There is a good amount (over 100?) recipes and techs to learn, upgrading gear, clothes, ships and workbenches as you go as well as 'learn by doing' character development system. First person only may be an issue for some, however, the difficulty settings provide options for hard core masochists as well as casual gamers looking for a less stressful way to die slower (jokes, \"very easy\" mode is just that). Building is solid if not amazing (want to build a polished marble Greek temple? Go play Conan) but Fountain of Youth allows you to build a base that looks and feels like it should for the Robinson Crusoe you essentially play (Having said that, the super-harsh piece collision with terrain and admittedly VERY ordinary camera perspective for building make building anything more than a glorified box a beach a VERY painful experience). The wildlife and resources have been balanced since the demo released and the whole package is now just a blast and one where you are (thankfully) never really super resource rich and secure as things take a sensible amount of time to regrow/respawn. In terms of hardware, I have an intel i7 8700 with a GTX 1080Ti and the game runs silky smooth for me and I've had zero freezes, CTDs, save game problems or any other issues at all that I can think of. The devs are engaged in the Steam forum and more updates are planned in the months (July?) ahead. I've finished the story such as it is to date, been to all the islands and key locations (that I know of), built most everything there is to build, stocked up on a relatively comfortable amount of resource in my base (again, not enough to feel really relaxed about things) and it has taken me about 60+ hours (I really didn't rush through though) - I will almost certainly stretch that as playing it as a sand box is very possible.

I did experience several crashes right after the intro and had to turn all of my graphic settings down to low to even get past it. \n\nThe game looks great, graphically and I was getting good frames after figuring out how to get through the crash-at-intro issue.\n\nMy issue with the game though is one of the most basic, core elements of any survival game - gathering resources. In every other survival game I've ever played, you actively chop wood, gather stones, mine iron, etc. But here, if you want to gather wood for instance, you just press E on a tree, choose how many sticks you want to gather, it tells you how much that will degrade your tool, then you press G to confirm, and it's done instantly. \n\nThis also means that you don't really interact with any of your tools, other than weapons. You just craft an axe/cutting tool/pick and it sits in your inventory giving you the ability to use the gather GUI for that resource. \n\nNow, on some settings, even though the gather action is instant to the player, it will take in-game time. On the basic settings, it is just instant. This just feels to me like a cheap system all around. \n\nI will probably come back and give this game another shot after it progresses a little further, but it just feels a little underbaked at the moment for me.\n \n\nEdit after developer comment: I really don't understand that logic at all. Actively/interactively  gathering resources (Green Hell, Grounded, Subnautica, Icarus, etc.) also burns time, energy, hunger & tool durability.

That which seemed like hostility towards user difficulty mods very probably isn't.  Under that light I'll say that this game likely shows a lot of promise in the future.  Right now it's a bit prohibitively difficult in how much realism it tries to portray, but in the future may offer the user more options to customize this.  Keep an eye on it for updates.\n\nCertainly all the right elements are there for this game to be potentially tons of fun for just about any fan of survival+building games in the future.  Right now all the basics are there, but difficulty is a bit rough.  Firstly, the timescale positively blows through the day at an insane rate.  Just gathering leaves can take 20 minutes even though it's just simulating you literally just walking up to a tree and pulling a few large leaves off.  Not a large backpack full of leaves.  3 or 6.  Creating a campfire with rocks consists of taking a few rocks and sticks out of your backpack and arranging them in a circle.  This takes an hour and 7 minutes for some reason...  I think our character must have serious OCD where the rocks must be arranged perfectly, only the leaves with exactly zero blemishes will do, etc or something because otherwise I simply can't see why it takes so long to do these things...  \n\nUnfortunately this is paired with a hunger and thirst meter that go down all too fast as time passes which is too hard to even get up very much upon actually eating things.  I don't really understand how these people in actual emergency situations struggle so much to handle hunger and thirst really.  Humans can live more than a week without food in an absolute emergency and go several days without water.  Of course this would be bad and probably after something like three days without food or two days without water you'd struggle to be able to hunt or etc effectively so I'll accept that, but you can start struggling even before the first day has ended even though you even eat and drink a tiny bit right at the start as part of the tutorial.  (Ok it's not much, but it still should help more than it does.)\n\nBut the thing that made me decide I just didn't even want to deal with this one right now in its current state is degradation is so extreme that many things like the clothes on your back or your backpack just degrade over time automatically.  Not just tools (I already hate that as a thing) but the stuff you have to rely on even just to walk around and do basic things.  Without a backpack you can barely carry anything and without clothes you get sunburn insanely fast and start suffering negative status effects.  At first I had to spend all my time rushing between shade and even then still got a low level sunburn.  It looks like you can repair stuff, but of course you need the proper materials which just adds to the grind loop all the more.\n\nUnfortunately Steam only gives us two hours in which we can try to evaluate a game (I really feel like it should be more for these types of games where even a light player will hit 200 hours easy) so I couldn't really evaluate any building stuff.  What I can say is that I was fighting so much just to keep sufficient food and water levels with my health so low (while hostile creatures hissed at me any time I approached anything -- I had a spear by then but with low HP due to all the sunburn, starvation, etc etc I didn't dare tackle them -- especially with only one) I just never made any progress towards even beginning to build during the time I dared.  I was hoping to build a workbench, but even that was a struggle and I was dying of starvation and struggling to get enough food in time to not die when I decided I just didn't have enough time to really evaluate any further.  Unfortunately the food thing is quite an issue because apparently several crabs aren't enough for even part of one meal.

I often find myself spending two ingame days collecting food and water, for those few days where i can spend the whole day crafting or reading a skill book. \nIve found that the Civilization \"one more turn\" feeling, hits me in this game as \"one more day\". just like in Green Hell, i find myself hoping to spend a day, and ending up with a weeks worth of preperation, meticulously checking off a mental list of everything i may need for an expedition, be it across the island or to another island entirely. and while you may have a map, youll find yourself memorizing the landscape if you spend enough time. only to forget if you put the game down for extended periods. The hand crafted environments both confounding the unfamiliar eye, and comforting the native. eventually recognizing landmarks like \"oh theres that rock/tree, i turn left here.\"\nThe struggle to find water in the mid game is real, as you realize your coconut sources have gone dry and the rain, unreliable as they are, have not come. \n\ni absolutely recommend this game to Survival lovers", "timestamp_created": 1694486781, "timestamp_updated": 1694486781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593094944953918457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149438455": {"recommendationid": "149438455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032426402", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 3684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 887, "last_played": 1704795894}, "language": "english", "review": "Negatives first - (1) The dogs are the most annoying creature of any game i have played.

At least let the concentration skill highlight enemies.. i don't care about the 1000s of overlapping footprints.... Or just highlight a noise or foliage rustling.\n\n(2) Please can we have a system where you can use items stored in nearby boxes?? It gets frustrating going in and out of boxes to get a hammer, now a saw, now an axe, now a narrow leaf  oops i need a wide leaf, uh oh need a twig etc etc  after a few hours of playing it gets old quickly. \n\n(3) Jumping - You feel like a feather, it's weird. You can't jump up small ridges but can lash ropes to huge trees and build complicated things??? I nearly refunded early when I was on a mountain trail and decided to look over the edge because there seemed to be a hidden path - Even when standing still you seem to slip ...I went over a tiny ledge but couldn't jump back up. Even more ragey is the fact you bounce off the tiny ledge and almost float off the mountain to your death ( I pride myself in zero deaths in these kind of games). Anyway please change the way you jump and land - there's too much skidding and bouncing, making  combat near impossible. \n\nBuy it if you like an open world challenge. You're more or less allowed to play how you want. It's a really great set of islands so far (still getting regular updates too!)\n\nWhat's different from Green Hell? - When you do any action it costs you time ( you don't see the animation of cutting/making something) - So say it's morning and you decide to make some clothes, you might press the button to do the jobs 5 times and suddenly it's nighttime because each job took 1.5 hours. When it's dark you have a chance to injure yourself when doing a job (unless you have a light on) so plan ahead!\n\nIn game bugs - Your equipment sometimes doesn't repair properly and you waste time repairing it only for it to say 'no equipment' durability 1/50 etc. Dogs/Boars seem buggy when they disappear from sight but suddenly jump out from within the floor to hit you.\n\n\nI know this is weird review, I didnt feel like writing what others have explained. Overall it is a great game and is different to other open world games .\n\nEdit - COMBAT - perhaps it's obvious but for anyone on the fence about buying/refunding because of the feel of combat, try to notice that when you HOLD attack it SLOWS time for a split second so you can aim and get a BLOCKING hit.

I have enjoyed many survival games in the past, but none have gripped me so hard with their gameplay before.\n\nThe map is unique, filled with secrets, but not to the point that you are annoyed by their quantity.\n\nThe story is simple to follow, yet beautiful and surprising, so you are often left wondering what you will uncover while preparing for the next journey ahead.\n\nThe crafting system is vast, but I never felt overwhelmed. New items were always only introduced once they seemed within reach.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is this game has struck a perfect balance in many ways for me personally. I was always eager to try out new crafting recipes, prepare for the next adventure, or stock up on much needed items. Things always seemed possible, and I was never too bothered by anything. I always wanted to play more. For me, many games today just start being a headache after a certain point, too much to manage, too much to explore, and too much story, so I rarely finish an experience. This game felt like a book that I could not wait to turn the page in, and learn more. I finished what is in store for now and I can not wait to get more from the devs.\n\nImprovements I wish could be made:\n- Make turtle shells spawn from every turtle, I have killed like 7, and even though I can see it right there on it, I can never harvest it. Maybe you could make it so that if you unalive the turtle in a specific way ( ie. hitting it only in the head) the shell is always there, otherwise it gets damaged and is unusable.\n- I have never found horseweed, and I swam around huge rocks for 2 hours straight looking for it. Overall I think the marine biome needs a little bit more work, but I trust that you are on it.\n- Allow me to slow time while aiming, at least if you are intending to keep animal movement so fast and clunky. Especially against larger predators in caves, it never made sense to use ranged weapons, and I would just resort to melee and heals, which felt like a shame.

I say 'potentially great' because this game lacks in several departments.

This has to be the 2nd worst thing besides the piss poor performance. Aside from that I really do enjoy the theme and time period this game takes place in.

As it stands, the main starter area is done as well as one additional island group, with another slated for next month and two more to follow. The developers have been adding these areas as they approach full release on schedule, with added patching and bug fixing between the area additions. Even at it's current state, it's quite balanced in gameplay and difficulty, with additional difficulties for a challenge if you prefer that option, including a hardcore death mode. It's reminiscent of a combination of The Long Dark, with a more first person perspective similar to The Forest. It is single player, but don't let that dissuade you from a very good game that looks to be a keeper even now, and with additional areas before the full release, should be a mainstay in the survival genre.\n\nThis isn't a shooter, nor a co-op game and the struggle you will face to survive long term is real and an integrated part of the gameplay. You have to carefully manage food, drink, rest, and multiple health conditions, even as you attempt to gather resources for a foothold, and many upgrades of things along the way. But the story here also pushes you to advance and not get stagnant, with rewards for things along the way as well as points to spend to customize your character a bit. The maps are static, but quite large and as a guess should provide 80+ if not 100+ hours of game time by the full release.\n\nI've played through to the temporary finish point on normal and about at the same point  on hard mode (with an additional challenge mode after that should I want to play it.) The additional challenge is welcome and puts this game very close to the feeling of The Long Dark where you have many times during gameplay where you wonder if you'll make it, if you'll loose a precious life (called fainting here,) or if on hardcore death setting, if you'll end your game. This game requires a bit of strategy, a lot of preparation and some luck along the way to survive. As someone that loves survival games, I appreciate that planning, upgrading and building are rewarded during gameplay, and while luck is there, you can fight it with better planning and gear. \n\nThe graphics are good, utilizing the Unity engine they appear to have gone for a feel somewhere between painted as in The Long Dark and realistic, similar to The Forest. If you've played Green Hell, its a similar look and feel. There are multiple dark areas in the game as well as some stormy/rainy nights that can be VERY dark. Weather is handled well in the graphics engine and is also an integrated part of the gameplay, requiring rain for water collection, overcast days for better fishing, sunny days for better visibility to do mapping, etc.\n\nThe sounds are good, with a decent undertone of music, which changes as you approach danger, etc. There are also unique sounds to most of the wildlife in game, providing a way to hear when they are near, as well as which direction they may be in, even if you cannot see them yet. \n\nThe game loop slowly changes over time from basic survival, branching out to gaining a foothold with an encampment, and growing to sailing, traveling to new areas, creating small outposts to help process things you find there, and so on. Boating in this game is rather simplified, but allows fast travel once you do some initial exploration.
