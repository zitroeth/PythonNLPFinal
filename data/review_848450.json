Unfortunately, with \"Below Zero\", some of the things that were the \"most right\" in the original were dropped. \nIt's like removing the meat from a burger and replacing it with - I don't know - more bread?\n\nThe worst change for me is the transition from the mute character, that forced me to think by myself and, as a direct result, made me actually BE that character, into a talking puppet, that can't seem to shut up and thinks my thoughts for me. This detaches the player from the character and totally ruins the immersive effect of BEING that character. I'm degraded to controlling somebody else.\n\nThe second worst flaw (though it might as well share the first place with the talking puppet) is that modular truck thing.\nI totally get, that it must have sounded very promising on paper. But then it feels like they went on to develop one module after another.\nAnd by the time anyone would have figured out, that it's just not really working (with it's unnatural, unrealistic handling based on the seamoth and the uselessness of many of its modules and its clunkyness and its total lack of impressiveness....), I assume it would have required balls to admit that and scrap it, simply write off the time it took to get there.\n\nMany (most) will agree, that the Cyclops was THE big achievement in Subnautica. It was a mighty thing, I loved the voice of its AI, its handling, that gave you the feeling of captaining a huge vessel to go deep down...\nSo with this being the pinnacle of vehicle achievements in Subnautica, let's scrap that in \"Below Zero\", shall we? After all, we have a crappy sea truck.\n\nSpeaking of deep down. Wasn't that great, that the further the game progressed, you had to go deeper and deeper into more and more dangerous areas? Sound effects, that would give you goose bumps (my son frequently asked me to take over the controls when he found it too chilling to do by himself)?\nBelow Zero comes off as a nice snorkeling trip. No suspense, the atmosphere is simply dull.\n\nIf Below Zere were part one, I'd say it's a great promising game - and the original Subnautica being the sequel, I'd say \"now you nailed it!\".\nBut the way it is, I'd recommend: play the original twice and skip this one.", "timestamp_created": 1711117543, "timestamp_updated": 1711117543, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 244, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.901483118534088135", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159444715": {"recommendationid": "159444715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983632024", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2258, "last_played": 1711407730}, "language": "english", "review": "The original subnautica is one of my favorite games of all time. I say this because I want to be clear from the start that Everything I say here comes from a genuine place of love for this series.\n\nBelow Zero is a fantastic game. I had this game for 2 1/2 years before I actually decided to hunker down and do it. My problem in all my previous attempts was that I expected just Subnautica: The Rerun. This game may be great, but it is very different. It took a while for me to accept those differences and recognize the beauty of this game.\n\nI'll start with some objective positives. The visuals in this game are downright stunning. The creatures and areas you come across, especially in the deeper biomes, are some of the most visually interesting and pleasing I have ever seen. I will try to limit spoilers, but there is one creature in particular who is incredibly unique and you can even go into it to harvest resources. It is some of the most interesting sci-fi I have ever seen. If you enjoyed the unique creatures in the original, they only get better, and the graphics follow suit.\n\nAnother total victory on Below Zero's part is the music. The music and ambiance in this game is great. The music present in each biome sets a perfect musical tone for what to expect. The devs have also added in a few songs from fans of the original game that you can play. A nice little treat for the fans.\n\nNow, one major difference between this game and the previous is what I will simply refer to as space. The original subnautica excelled at really exploiting the fear of what we cannot see. The game is really open and spacious There are plenty of points when you will look down and see nothing but blue or black. You have little to no idea of what will be waiting in the depths until you choose to go down, or you just constantly stick to the floor to always know where you are. It's very reminiscent of the real ocean.\n\nThis game is much \"shallower\" although I don't think that is technically the right word. There are very few times where you will look into the abyss and see nothing. There will almost always be a floor or rock or creatures not too far away. It is a very different experience. Now, it is less a fear of what you cannot see, but more of a fear of what you can. You are always seeing something that is a threat. The game also has a greater focus on enclosed cave systems and tight spaces, preying on one's claustrophobia, which is not helped by some massive carnivore circling above. It turns the game almost into a strategic board game, having to keep your precious truck out of harms way. It turns into a very different experience compared to the original. If you go in expecting wide open spaces like before, you may end up like I did and think the game is not good.\n\nOverall, Below Zero is a fantastic game in its own right. There are plenty more good aspects I could mention. The seatruck (or as i call it, the Fjord F-150) for example is implemented great. It is not perfect, some things are hard to figure out naturally and some places are a bit hard to build in, but overall is a great experience. If you liked the previous game, love the ocean, love open world survival games, or all of the above, you will love this game. But, if you love the original a bit too much like me, give this game a chance to make the experience its own.\n\nThese games are both master classes in open world survival.

Innovation tends to be punished when a developer deviates from an original formula.\n\nI think BZ is better than Subnautica in many ways, but that's just my opinion. I'll try to outline why I think that way though.\n\nThe first is obviously narrative. Subnautica had little to no story, with only a silent protagonist and drop pod messages probing you to explore deeper to uncover what happened. That's fine, the focus of the games is different (and this is why I think so many people hate BZ, but I'll explain that in a bit). While the original focused more on exploration and the fear of the unknown, the sequel wants to tell a story within the world that was built in Subnautica. The voice actors are good, the story is decently written (imo), and the way it unfolds is similar to the original in that you will receive clues at certain intervals (this time from a character that the MC interacts with instead of because of dead drop pod messages). Overall the story is better (imo), and it's given life with just a few characters. A few of the people (not all of them) I've seen complain about the story generally seemed to hate the characters as people rather than giving any legitimate complaints about story. It boils down to insults including vague things like \"boring\" and \"annoying\", then going to the weird like \"too many women\" or \"too g@y\" (Yeah, some people actually wanted to make those complaints). It's fine not to like the characters and judge the game based on that, everyone is entitled to their opinions (and this is just mine). Just know that there are certain biases tainting those opinions (everyone has biases, including me).\n\nThe second is the world. Subnautica was about the fear of the unknown, unexplored areas, and mysterious dangers. The world was vast, sometimes dark, and often incredibly scary. This worked well when you first play the game, but after that it's incredibly predictable. On a second play through of the game I found myself jumping out of vehicles and knifing leviathans until they died after I stunned them. You can do this in BZ too, it's just not as interesting to do so because the world is more interesting than the fear (imo). You see, with the original the biomes eventually became large open spaces (for a specific reason that I'll get into next) that didn't hold much more than a few resources and one or two leviathans to keep you away from the borders. In BZ each biome has lots of interesting creatures, plants, and resources. Things are more abundant and the world feels alive. I always thought it was a little weird in the first game that a MASSIVE space conglomerate like Alterra came to a planet to strip mine it while I'm struggling to find enough resources to build a SINGLE base under water. The story in Subnautica tried to hand wave that away, but it was only vaguely successful in doing so. The original felt too *dead* to me for the story it wanted to tell. BZ is tightly packed with tidbits of info everywhere, and the environments are better at telling that story too (imo).\n\nFinally there's the vehicles. I don't know if people are romanticizing the Seamoth and the Cyclops from the first game but this is where I adamantly disagree with a lot of people who don't like BZ. The Seamoth, while useful in the original, actually only had one purpose: faster exploration. Well, two if you count \"getting away from leviathans\" as another. Because aside from arriving somewhere quicker without running out of oxygen, it was essentially useless. In the beginning bumping into a small fish could cause you to lose 10 percent of your hull, never mind bumping into a spire or getting grabbed by a leviathan. I found myself repairing my Seamoth more than actually travelling in my first play through until I found the hull upgrade. Which is just a waste of an upgrade slot honestly. The Cyclops... Oh, the Cyclops. An unwieldy and even more annoying \"vehicle.\" The open and dead spaces I mentioned earlier were probably meant to allow you to traverse them using the Cyclops... Because if it wasn't as open it would be an even bigger nightmare to maneuver that thing than it already was. Not to mention that if you're using the cyclops it's to get somewhere really dangerous... but you'll have to be jumping out to knock off fish hiding on the hull and sucking your power or to repair the Cyclops hull... or even putting out fires if it's your first time piloting it without a specific upgrade. Less fun, more micromanaging, much more annoying. The Sea-Truck is a good cross between the Seamoth and the Cyclops. You have more speed if you detach the modules, a sturdier hull than the Seamoth, more maneuverability than the Cyclops (which also works better in the tighter and more focused environments), and finally, it's not annoying to drive it.\n\nBelow Zero isn't trying to be Subnautica 1.5, which is what I see a lot of people wanting. It would be impossible to reclaim that success, especially with how Subnautica relied on the fear of the unknown. I think the developers understood that many second time players were going to find it predictable thanks to how things worked in Subnautica so they wouldn't be as afraid as they were in the first game. People probably would have complained about that as well, and I think they knew that. It's a \"d**ned if you do, d**ned if you don't\" scenario honestly.\n\nIf you think a game that's set in the same world as Subnautica but *isn't* exactly like Subnautica doesn't appeal to you, then the first game still exists. You can definitely replay that, and it would probably make you happier than this game.\n\nTo someone looking for something fun and a little different than the original, well, dive right in, the water's warm.", "timestamp_created": 1706551551, "timestamp_updated": 1707581222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 146, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.829836010932922363", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162058797": {"recommendationid": "162058797", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970725915", "num_games_owned": 775, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1638, "last_played": 1712087981}, "language": "english", "review": "I get why people were disappointed after playing the first one because it's a much smaller map and quite short in comparison.

It was the ocean exploration game I'd always dreamed of.  The creatures were beautiful in sound and in design.  The story unfolded through your exploration.  The world felt so big and alive.  It was an immersive (lol) experience near perfection, especially for an aquatic science nerd like me.\n\nThen they decided to make Below Zero.  And somehow - either through incompetence or spite, because there's no way this was done through ignorance - they took everything that people loved and replaced it with the parts that people hated.\n\nNamely, the biggest change: instead of exploration driving the story, story drives the exploration.  This sounds great on paper, but is terrible in execution.  Mainly because the game utilizes Forspoken-style dialogue long before Forspoken made it noticeable.  You know the reveal in Subnautica when [spoiler]you try to deactivate the gun, only to be told you are infected and the planet is in quarantine[/spoiler]?  How the player is given that much information and then gives them time to realize the situation?  If it were this game's writers, [spoiler]Robin would have shouted \"Quarantine?  Infected?  Oh, this isn't good.  I need to find a cure and fast!\" and Alan might have chimed in with a \"I concur.  Time is of the essence, for the infection spreads quickly.\"[/spoiler]  That's the game.  [i]You[/i] don't get to decide how you feel about the situation you are in.  The game will tell you what you need to feel.  It will tell you where to go next.  And it will rip you out of your immersion every time.  [spoiler]Also I [i]hate[/i] that they brought back Margeruite.  Ruins the Degasi storyline just to give people fanservice, because people decided that people who kill wildlife indiscriminately are cool.  I never liked Marge.  And I don't like that she's here.  Especially since her presence amounts to NOTHING.[/spoiler]\n\nCreature design is a step down.  They don't look or act like beings adapted to their environment, as the critters in the first game did.  They look and act like beings adapted to be in a videogame.  The predators have looks and sounds that demand the audience be scared of them.  Its the same effect as a man in costume chasing you in a haunted house screaming \"OOGA BOOGA BOOGA.\"  The Leviathans don't deliver the same awe or terror as the ones in the first game; again, the designs try to hard to be spooky.  Honestly, the only design I encountered that I liked were the sea monkeys.  And even then, they're overanimated to the point of parody.  \n\nThe only thing this game did better than the first was base building options.  You can build a huge underwater house with rooms, rather than a bunch of circular modules.  These options lead to a much more homier base that looks more refined.  But they added a lot of that back to Subnautica, so there is really absolutely no reason to get this game.\n\nIf I sound unusually harsh, its because this is a franchise I care about.  I bought this game day one of Early Access.  I remember when Robin was a researcher sending samples to her sister Sam up on a satellite [spoiler]which would lead to Robin accidentally sending a live Kharaa sample, needing to find and befriend Sea Emperors to save the research station (or at least, that was the theory)[/spoiler], and when [spoiler]Alan[/spoiler] was a prick who warmed up to life [spoiler]and was heavily implied to end up getting put in a Warper body[/spoiler].  It was cozy and a great base line for an unfolding story set in a growing frozen world.  It was all about research and exploration, just like what I wanted.  And they THREW IT ALL OUT THE WINDOW BECAUSE I DONT KNOW.  I genuinely do NOT know what they were going for.  And the final result is such an obnoxious, hand-holdy, unimmersive experience.\n\nHere's hoping the true Subnautica 2 will be a return to form.

Yeah, it's got [i] new stuff [/i] but the game is ultimately smaller than the original Subnautica. It is, quite literally, shallower than the first game, which was a huge disappointment as one of the biggest parts of my gameplay on the first game was entering a deeper, more alien environment and just watching that depth meter drop.\n\nI remember when, in the first Subnautica, I first set foot on dry land. I about crapped myself, because I hadn't even considered it a possibility. It felt truly special, for the lore, resources, and unique base-building potential. In More Please, Dry Land is dangerous, unrewarding, constricted, and only serves really to extend story content. It completely missed the mark.\n\nSpeaking of story: what the original Subnautica did so right was that they leaned into the nature of a freeform survival game: the player tells their own story. With a little digging, you can find your character's name, but it's androgenous and the only indication of your appearance is a fairly androgenous outline that can be seen in the player's cast shadows. More Please screwed the pooch. Instead of being allowed to tell my own story, I'm telling my version of the devs' own (frankly, contrived and unimaginative) story about a very intensely characterized person with whom I share no common ground. It feels bad to be constantly jostled between telling my own story and having someone else's idea of what my character should think and say be shoved down my throat.\n\nThis game completely missed the mark on pretty much everything that gave the first game so much success. I genuinely cannot fathom (har-har) how this mess never got reality-checked during development. I know I'm late to the party, but was reminded by a steam sale that it exists and felt I ought to share my thoughts. To anyone who reads this: just play the first game.

[/h1]\r\n\r\nI must preface this with a fact: Subnautica is one of my favorite games I've played in the past five years. It contains everything I enjoy about survival games, while also blending in elements of marine biology and sci-fi. Somewhere in the endless fabric of time, I created Subnautica so that my present self could enjoy it today.\r\n\r\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\r\nThe dialogue was fine. I haven't seen many reviews, but I can imagine many gamers probably hate the dialogue in this game. At times, it seems forced, but honestly, I didn\u2019t really mind. Some might say it was cringey, but I scoff at that idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quality of life improvements with the Prawn suit were amazing. Going from Subnautica to Below Zero, interacting with the Prawn Suit is night and day\u2014you get in and out almost instantly. When I inevitably return to Subnautica, I suspect I will miss these enhancements from Below Zero.\r\n\r\nLeviathans were okay. Subnautica still has the most iconic leviathans, but Below Zero doesn\u2019t hold back either. The Shadow Leviathan and Ventgardens are awesome, especially since they are designed with their biomes in mind. The Shadow Leviathan, resembling a centipede, fits through the tight spaces of the Crystal Caves, which enhances the challenge. The other leviathans, however, were less remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe giant jellyfish tree, aka Ventgardens, was a true spectacle the first time I saw it. Discovering that you could enter them to gather resources blew me away. Unknown Worlds Entertainment must have some insanely passionate biologists on their team because they consistently excel at creating intriguing creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crystal Cave was a phenomenal biome. It\u2019s not only a beautiful biome, but the progression from purple to red crystals as you go deeper is great. The Shadow Leviathan really makes this biome terrifying to navigate. In my first playthrough, these creatures constantly chased me from 600 meters to 950. I always had at least one near me, heightening the tension compared to the end-game biome of Subnautica.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Monkeys were a creature that kept on giving. Not only adorable, they also gifted you items and their nests contained important blueprints. Being able to visually identify the blueprints in the Sea Monkey nests was a godsend improvement.\r\n\r\nAl-an was cool. I really enjoyed the lore dumps from him (I\u2019m not kidding). It was interesting to get more context about the Kharaa Bacterium and to learn at the end that he was the reason it escaped in the first place. The sequence where you finally build his body and travel off of Planet 4546B, presumably to his home planet, left me wanting more.\r\n\r\nMarguerit Maida was the second most memorable character, right next to Al-an. If other crew members had survived and been given a body to their voices, perhaps there would have been more impact. But Marguerit is a stone-cold badass, and the first time you enter her base and see the huge reaper leviathan head on her wall, you just KNOW she\u2019s built different. I also have to mention her custom Prawn Suit and how much I wish we, as players, could do what she did with hers. Maybe in the future.\r\n\r\nFlora and fauna were obviously amazing\u2014100% blew it out of the park. This is the selling point of every Subnautica game. If they lose sight of that, I think the series will die off. Creating whimsical, yet believable flora and fauna from an alien planet goes hand in hand with Subnautica. Some of my favorites were the Ventgardens, Shadow Leviathans, Sea Monkeys, Lily Paddler, Spinner Fish, Eye Jelly, Grand Cotton Anemone, and Thermal Lily.\r\n\r\nIf you loved Subnautica like I do, then you will enjoy Below Zero. It still hits many of the same notes that made Subnautica so enjoyable, although not as many as you might expect.\r\n\r\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\r\nThe majority of the land-based gameplay. I\u2019m just not interested in the cold mechanics and traversing the glacial tundra, especially at night. When I think of Subnautica, I think OCEAN, not jogging around a giant glacier.\r\n\r\nThe Snowfox was a buggy mess. I learned about the Snowfox, gathered all resources for the Snowfox hoverpad and the Snowfox itself, went back to base and built it all. Finally going back to the arctic spires and using the Snowfox, it fell through the floor. I kid you not, this happened three more times throughout my playthrough. The first time, I literally quit the game for a month because I just didn't want to deal with the hassle. The controls for the Snowfox were strange, clunky, and weird. Having this constant worry that unpacking my Snowfox might cause it to glitch through the ground and force me to go back home and make another was just exhausting.\r\n\r\nThe giant glacier was extremely confusing to traverse (maybe a skill issue). The Arctic Spires and Glacial Bay were extremely confusing for me to navigate. I often got lost, to the point where I just looked up where the key pieces were and went there directly instead of circling around the island another ten times.\r\n\r\nFor me, the reason why Subnautica: Below Zero doesn\u2019t live up to Subnautica is because of the heavy reliance on land-based gameplay. If they focused more on ocean-related stuff and less on land, I guarantee this game would be better. But I do respect them for branching out and trying something new; I find that to be a refreshing quality of this game.\r\n\r\n[h1]Undecided[/h1]\r\nThe Seatruck. Throughout my whole playthrough, I wrestled with the fact that we don\u2019t have a Cyclops anymore. I loved the Cyclops\u2014it was such a cool and giant ship, essentially a moving base. The Seatruck is their evolution of that, but I am unsure if it actually is an evolution or a devolution. The modules that the Seatruck supports are epic. Being able to customize it however you want and put whatever modules you need is great. My setup was the Fabricator, storage, teleport, and docking module. But I still can't shake off the fact that the Cyclops was just so cool. I am all for having more customization, but I want my Cyclops back.\r\n\r\nHaving a protagonist that talks. A character with a backstory and a purpose for coming to Planet 4546B is good, right? Well, I don\u2019t know. For me personally, unless the character has a genuinely compelling story that can be told, having a faceless, mute protagonist is much more fun. I like being able to transport myself into the world and experience it like I am really there. Having a character just makes it feel a little less immersive, and a little more divisive. It was an alright choice, and obviously necessary for the interactions between Al-an and Marguerit and everything else to happen, but I\u2019m still unsure about it.\r\n\r\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\r\nSubnautica: Below Zero is a good game. If you loved Subnautica, you will like Below Zero. There will be moments when you love the game and think, \"Man, give me more of that!\" Then those moments will swiftly end, and you will be met with ham-fisted mechanics that don't really fit into the game you know and love. Ultimately, I respect Unknown Worlds Entertainment for trying something different with their game.

Quite frankly, the early builds where you had a comms line to the orbit to your very much living sister was much better of a premise than what we get currently. It also helped drive in the sense of isolation even with AL-AN giving you waypoints every now and then without being overbearingly formulaic, and feeding every objective to you off of a silver platter. The very opening has the voiced main character (another big gripe of mine) say out loud that she ought to head to the waters and find the habitat pod, like the devs were afraid the players could get lost on the way from crash site to shoreline and not figure out what to do on their own. I miss when games didn't cater to journos and respected their audiences by not belittling them at every turn. Hopefully Subnautica 3 will let the players get hopelessly lost in the ocean by themselves without a  voice in their brain telling where to go every 10 minutes, and should they choose to do a voiced protagonist again, keep the chatter to a minimum as well as write it more fittingly.

That moment you knew all you need to know about the writing and dialogue, one line is enough for me to be put off by the writing. Additionally, adding voice lines to the protagonist was the biggest mistake. The voice not only added nothing but show how bad the writing is. For the voice acting itself, I didn't like any of the voice performance, and that another reason to make a silent protagonist\nAlso, the characters design are all bad especially the protagonist, there is nothing special about it. The rest of the characters have a little bit of wokeness on them. I seen a lot of games with similar writing and character design and I'm starting to notice a trend.\n\nHowever, in the end of the day there are almost no games that have the same gameplay and exploration as Subnautica, there just any underwater exploration games.

It feels like they took everything from the original and dumbed it down or diluted it in an attempt to reach a wider audience but in doing so has lost what made the original so spectacular. The leviathans weren't very interesting except for one that was passive and the ones meant to be scary have nothing on the ones from the first game. They also have this story they try to essentially shove down your throat which i just personally wasn't much of a fan of. This isn't to say the game is an awful mess with nothing good coming from it though, it does have some redeeming qualities like the sea truck for example, it's very convenient to use and had something going for it with it's interchangeable compartments. Some of the fauna were also evolved forms of creatures from the first game which i found pretty cool. Overall though the game is a good bit boring and has left me mostly just disappointed.

This game does not do that enough, and I constantly feel lost and don't know what to do next, it feels like the game expects you to just explore on your own and know everything at start.\r\n-The first game had Aurora as a good landmark so you could easily position yourself on the map, but now it's difficult to navigate and have to use beacons so you know where everything is. \r\n-I hate the seatruck, I ram it on everything and get stuck as it isn't as nimble as the seamoth. \r\n-The previous could also be because of the biomes, caves are narrow and/or filled with plants \r\n-I dont care about the story.\r\n-Resources and other stuff you need are so hard to find, I constantly have to google where I can find things.\r\n-I hate the weather, it makes the already difficult navigating even harder.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it feels messy and rushed compared to the first one, these small things make me roll my eyes more than I ever have in my life.

Hard to believe this is the sequel since a lot of features are a downgrade from the first one. I have accepted I am never going to finish this game. The map design is irritating and difficult to navigate. The land areas in particular are labyrinthine with winding paths and multiple levels of elevation and are very annoying to deal with, especially during the scavenger hunt the game sends you on. (Way too much time spent on land for a series originally centered around deep sea exploration.) The flora & fauna are pretty similar to the first game but the hostile creature designs were lackluster and are rarely seen in the game, especially compared to the first one where reapers are a frequent threat. There are some very minor improvements to the base building system (basically just a larger room option) but it feels like this game is riding on the coattails of a successful standalone game. There is very little in this game that I consider successful that wasn't imported from the first game.\n\nI became entirely dependent on walkthroughs to progress the story because after a while I wasn't getting dialogue triggers or objectives telling me what to do. Not sure if this is a bug, related to me accidentally finding a plot point out of order, or if the game really does leave you dead in the water later in the story.

It's a much more shallow game (yes, I will be making puns, and no, they won't get any better) that features a much smaller map overall, with relatively large portions of the map being dedicated to boring land segments. Because that's what we all wanted from a Subnautica game, right? Walking simulator gameplay!\n\nThe atmosphere is similarly disappointing. Bright and cheery environments abound, I felt very safe playing Below Zero, which is not what I want from a Subnautica game. In playing this game, I realized just how much of Subnautica's charm comes from its atmosphere. Without that, Below Zero becomes a bit of a slog.\n\nIndeed, Below Zero adds precious little new gameplay elements to make up for the atmosphere and charm it lacks compared with the original. The Seamoth and the Cyclops are also absent from Below Zero. The \"Sea Truck\" replaces the seamoth, and despite its modular upgrades sounding useful on paper, in execution it's more cumbersome than useful.\nYou do, however, get a little hoverbike for the land segments. It's cumbersome and clunky, but it might shave a little walking time off the walking simulator segments. So that's good, I guess.\nOh, and you get a Spy Penguin. It's cute, but not really used outside of one or two story related applications.\n\nBut wait! There's more!\nWhile you explore this underwhelming sequel to Subnautica, you'll be listening to perhaps the most unnecessarily verbose voiced protagonist ever. She too lacks depth, much like everything else in this game. Imagine voicelines written by a chatbot, using a dataset consisting entirely of 5th grade philosophy. \n \nI was debating whether or not to review this game, because while I was certain Below Zero did not deserve a positive review, I was unsure whether it truly deserved a negative one. Then I encountered the bugs.\nOh boy. \nLet me tell you about the bugs!\n\nHave you ever drowned on land?\nHave you ever swam deep into the ocean, confused gravity, and then became stuck walking on the bottom of the ocean?\nHave you ever been forced to use the console to fix the game, because unstuck won't help you?\nHave you ever realized, upon completing the game, that by using the console to fix this buggy game, you permanently disabled achievements?\nHave you ever had to replay a game to get the achievements you missed, and realized by the end you now hate it?\nSubnautica Below Zero offers all of these amazing features, and more!\n\nTL:DR: Subnautica Below Zero is a pale, shallow sequel that nobody asked for, bringing all the quality and polish of a modpack, but with more bugs.

SOME resources are less tedious to find in this game (except for lithium and lead) but that seems to be the only real positive I can say about it. Gone is the mystery and fear of the endless ocean of the first game, that's been replaced with a claustrophobic, island sized ocean that's uninteresting and far less varied, with way less biomes and variety in how the biomes look than the original game had. Gone is the awesome Cyclops submarine, replaced with a meet-in-the-middle Seatruck that tries to combine the Cyclops and the Seamoth from the first game with mediocre results. The enemies are much less varied in the way they move or interact with you or other wildlife in the world. The writing is hamfisted, going from a silent protagonist in the first game to a person who says bits of pieces of information out loud to herself, and none of it ever seems to ever teach you or mean anything. The first game rewarded players for paying attention to research logs, PDA's, and figuring out what you're supposed to do from context clues, where in this game everything is just kind of shoved in your face. It really just feels like a mediocre expansion to the first game instead of a sequel or spin off. The worst part is the game really increased the amount of on land sections compared to the first game, which were my least favorite part. Going and looking for a base on an iceberg, that looks like every other iceberg in the game, with weather effects spamming your screen every 3-5 seconds so you can't see anything just results in utter frustration.

I played both Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero from the beginning of their early access launches.\nAccording to Steam I have played:\nSubnautica- 100+ hrs\nSubnautica: Below Zero- 60+ hrs\nIt's so hard for me to let go of the hope of this game being something more than what it is turning/turned out to be. To be philosophical for a moment, we are more disappointed with something that gets close to the target than we are with something that misses it completely. To me Below Zero is a large step back from the original in the ways that made the original so special. Which is a heart wrenching thing to see. I will break it down more but first I want to make sure that you, the reader of this knows that Below Zero is a good game. It's beautiful and engaging. Like the first game, it is one that is hard to stop playing. Also like the first game, Its base loop of resource gathering a tool creation is well paced and gets you to explore farther and dive deeper to find those valuable resources.\nWhere Below Zero falls short is in its understanding of what made the first game amazing. It is a survival game. There are A TON of survival games. But how many strictly underwater survival games are there? When the first Subnautica came out I think it was the only one. Yes it has some out of water roaming in it but it was very minimal. The atmosphere was also incredible. It takes place on an alien planet so there isn't any people roaming around. Aside from some logs there isn't any form of human life. To add to the isolation the radio guy says they are gonna rescue you and then they get blown out of the sky! If that doesn't make the atmosphere seem desperate then sprinkle in the fact that all other survivors are eaten before you get to them and you have yourself some edge of your seat suspense. Next, the first game has a huge open world. For an indie game, it's HUGE. Lastly, the survival loop was great and you really progressed to the point where you felt like a master of your domain. Yes, you need to avoid those leviathans but the game really gave the sense that you started from nothing... and now you are driving around a massive submarine!\nTo summarize:\n1. Isolation\n2. expansive underwater world\n3. Eventual dominion over that world\nWhen I look at those 3 things, they really are the base of any survival game, except for the underwater part(the unique trait of subnautica)\nNow looking at Below Zero.\n1. ISOLATION\nYour character drops onto the planet on purpose. so right off the bat it's not about survival in the mind of the player character. Then there are audio logs everywhere. The first game had logs like I mentioned but they didn't have audio which adds alot more personality to the characters but takes away from any sense of desperation or dread. Also, there is a voice inside your head that your converses with, again removing a sense of isolation. Lastly there is a human NPC in the game, which makes you physically not alone. So the strange alien world I was in felt a bit more homely that I was anticipating when I started playing.\n2. EXPANSIVE UNDERWATER WORLD\nThe underwater portion of this game is significantly smaller than the original, like 25%-33% the size(my estimation). Also I'd estimate that 25%-33% of Below Zero's entire world is on land. Which means they removed 25%-33% of the world that made the game unique from all other survival games. Yes, the land is still on an alien planet. But there are plenty of run around survival games on alien planets. I can't help but think of what it would of been like if that 25%-33% was put into the underwater world. Another amazing biome or 2 could have been added. Oh man...sweet, beautiful underwater biomes...\n3. EVENTUAL DOMINION OVER THE WORLD\nI was waiting for a giant sub like machine to be introduced into the game. The sea truck(which is a small sub) is fine, but it hardly feels like a sea conquering machine. While you do progress and climb the ladder of dominance it end really quickly. You find the sea truck withing a few hrs and then you made it. That's it. You get attachments for the sea truck(a cool idea) that lets you explore farther and longer. The attachments are things like more storage or an aquarium for storing food. But by adding attachments the truck its movement speed is reduced significantly so I usually have 1 attachment and go back to my base when I want to swap(cause the underwater world is so small it doesn't take much time). If I really need to have access to food and storage(among other attachments for the truck I wont mention) why can't I use the great base building mechanics and build small bases around the small underwater world? That would eliminate almost all of the benefits that the truck provides! \nI walk away from this game confused and sad that the developers didn't see what made the original so amazing. It's almost like they went in the opposite direction. I hope Below Zero does well because they are obviously very talented people and I want them to succeed. I also want them to try again.\n\nSide note. Below Zero is $30!?

But I did play the original first, and that set the bar for my expectations -- especially given that the two games are the same price.\n\nIt's gorgeous. The coding is tighter, the animations are smoother, it is WAY better optimized -- no more chugging and chunking while distant objects struggle to render. The weather effects are great, and the addition of temperature as a survival mechanic is neat. There is a lot of new lore (with an interesting cast of characters), plenty of new flora and fauna to scan, great new base building pieces, and a lot of new decor options.\n\nNow here comes the bad:\n\nThe map is TINY compared to the original. And extremely shallow -- you can go almost everywhere that matters with the first depth module for the seatruck and a bit of free diving.\n\nThe survival elements feel poorly balanced. I got the tank upgrades very quickly, and never felt concerned with hunger or thirst thanks to slightly overtuned edible plants being so easy to access, and food/water being in so many of the numerous crates scattered across the map.\n\nThe progression curve feels flat compared to the first game -- the upgrades come too quickly, and don't feel as rewarding. The Cyclops allowed you to go DEEP. Well, there is no \"deep\" to explore, here. And no reason to do so anyway, as all the endgame crafting materials are very plentiful and are able to be picked up very early in.\n\nYou unlock some things at weird times. Some too early (like the multipurpose room), some too late (like the decorative plant walls -- which you can only scan from one specific area, despite encountering them in more than one place).\n\nYou are able to scan a lot of new plants, but the ones you can actually take seeds/samples from and grow for yourself are EXTREMELY limited. Why? Even if they were just decorative elements at your base, with no other use, that would still be SOMETHING. There aren't many creature eggs to find, either. It almost feels like the game was pushed out early, with less content than originally planned.\n\nProps from the first game are used as decor in the second game, but are unable to be scanned or picked up (all the lab equipment, many island plants). This makes no sense to me. The assets are already there, in use in the game world. Slap an inventory icon on it and let us use them!\n\nThere aren't many uses for the spy pengling. At all. It could have added a lot of exploration value, but it's mostly a waste of inventory space. Same for the snowfox, which I used approximately once and then discarded -- it really needed to be able to hover on water, to make it worth zipping around on.\n\nThere aren't as many leviathans, and they aren't as scary. The game in general isn't as scary. I never felt alone. I never got lost in an utterly black void, a cave system some 1000m down, unable to orient myself and running out of air, water, or flashlight battery.\n\nThe player character legit sounds like she is edging a big fat orgasm when she eats (UNNHHHH, MMMMM, AAAHHH). There is no way someone didn't bring this up during playtesting. It is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nOverall, it's fun and polished enough (and I got it cheaply enough) for me to give it a thumbs up. But if you pay full price for this and expect it to be just like the first one, you're gonna be disappointed -- there just isn't enough of it. Once they finish backporting the building elements from this game into the original and fixing up the older code, I'll never touch this game again.\n\ntl;dr - Super pretty, but it feels like a DLC, not a sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1657361327, "timestamp_updated": 1657797525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 306, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.942139804363250732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88736158": {"recommendationid": "88736158", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976043137", "num_games_owned": 1129, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 4858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2472, "last_played": 1700210534}, "language": "english", "review": "Tough call. I agree with the reviewer who said this is a good game, but not the game they wanted and hoped that it would be. It feels like DLC, not in terms of the amount of content but in terms of how quickly you chew through it, and I think if you go into it with that fixed in your mind, it'll have a better 'feel' for you -- maybe play it immediately after playing Subnautica, without a break in-between.\n\nI think I'm sort of the odd one out in that I don't actually hate the sea truck, as many people seem to. If the cabin were slightly smaller and more nimble like the seamoth, less prone to getting clipped on sidewalls and rolling, I wouldn't think there was anything wrong with it at all -- it's mostly the compact, cabin-only mode that frustrates me in that way. And sure, it might be nice if the storage module had more storage, but honestly, the smaller world means that less available storage on the move hasn't felt like a huge problem for me. Being able to drag a fabricator around with me is pretty nice, too.\n\nFor me the weirdness comes from two places, and I have a theory as to why they might be related. The first is the pacing: everything is vastly accelerated. The progress you make through the tech tree and the story is really rapid. The biomes are much tighter, so maybe that's part of the reason why -- you're spending a lot less time traveling from one place to another, which could be a good thing or a bad one, depending on how you feel about it all.\n\nThe other weirdness for me -- and maybe this is just me, idk -- is the feeling that the biomes themselves have, maybe as a side effect of how compact they are. They're really beautiful environments, and I think a lot of love went into them...but I've hit a weird wall in my playthrough. I can't figure out where to set up my Big Main Base, the one I'm going to pour a lot of time and resources into, because all of the locations that look like grand set-piece locations, all of the places you might want to put your base and build it out so that you have some cool stuff to look at through the many new glass ceilings and other transparent elements, aren't designed with your base-building in mind. Every time I run into a spot with a killer view or a convenient location there's another structure there already, or it's too narrow and tight to accommodate player structures in any way that makes sense, or there are significant predators that are going to casually destroy my stuff every time they swim by.\n\nIt's a weird feeling after the last game, where my late-game base was located in a spot I felt was custom-made to give players a fantastical spot to live. Combined with the dizzyingly rapid tech progression, it almost feels as though Subnautica was designed from a place of envisioning how the player would experience the world for the first time, and Below Zero was built from a place of constructing a world for the player to experience, thinking mostly about the world itself.*\n\n*I'm not a dev and I'm not going to pretend that I know whether or not this is true, or what approach was taken -- I'm just saying that in thinking about the differences, this is the closest I can get to articulating what feels different to me.\n\nThe bottom line is that this game still has most of that great Subnautica flavor, and if you liked Subnautica you'll enjoy most of what Below Zero is. It's beautiful. It sounds great.

Without going into spoilers, I think the important ones are:\n\n1. The story is very different. Do not go into BZ expecting the same emotions as Sub. As an analogy, Alien (1979) was a horror film, but Aliens (1986) was an action film. Both are exquisite, just not the same genre of story. BZ is not \"action\" to Sub's \"horror\", but the stories are very different energies like that.\n\n2. The setting and technology is not the same. BZ is not just another story in the same setting. It is the same planet, and there are a lot of familiar elements, as a result, but the location and technology are different in many ways. I won't give specifics, just don't expect to navigate the map in the same ways, or experience the same kinds of dangers.\n\nWith that said, I want to talk about some of the other reviews and address many of their criticisms for folks who haven't played the game yet, to give you some context. I feel that many other reviewers are unreasonably expecting a sequel to magically recreate an experience that was dependent on everything being new. If you played Sub, then you already know so much about the setting. BZ fundamentally cannot be the same experience, but that does not mean it can't be incredible in its own way. That said, many of those other reviewers sound like they really power gamed or min/maxed Sub, and if you're that kind of player then their reviews may actually be helpful for you. But if you are in it for the story, and aren't trying to unlock literally everything before completing the game, then my comments may be helpful. My points above already address several criticisms, but here are some more specific ones (very mild spoilers):\n\n1. \"These vehicles suck. Sub vehicles were better.\" -- for Sub vehicles, I can't think of a single bad thing about the seamoth, it was wonderful, but the cyclops and prawn suit were pretty awkward and restrictive. But I didn't even care. They were just what they were. I loved my cyclops and prawn suit. I lived with the awkwardness and embraced what was wonderful about them. BZ vehicles are no different. There are good things and bad things about them. I don't think their shortcomings are any different than Sub vehicles, they're just different.\n\n2. \"The map was so much more confusing, and important stuff was harder to find or more hidden.\" -- I literally had to look up a guide to finish Sub because I couldn't find a key item. In BZ not one single blueprint or item that I actually acquired was as hard to find. They weren't just sitting in the open, but it wasn't in some secret cave I wasn't going to find without a scanner room. Both games do have an element of randomness in the form of how much you actually just explore your environments. I got stuck a couple times in BZ looking for some blueprints, but I just went to the places I knew I hadn't explored yet and easily stumbled across the blueprints. Same as in Sub. But hey, you can also just use scanner rooms to find stuff. That's what they're for.\n\n3. \"The story is a mess.\" -- I truly have no idea how people can say this. Maybe they played an earlier build that was different (if early builds were even that different), but the story I experienced in the first 2 weeks of Jan 2022 was perfectly coherent, understandable, and enjoyable. Not everyone is going to like every story, that is incredibly valid, but I think the story is far from a mess. Sub's story was incredible, and I was really affected by the end. Well I loved BZ's story and how it ended, too. As I mentioned above, it's a very different story, so you may not like it, but I think it's wonderful in its own way.\n\n4. \"The world isn't as spooky/scary\" -- I think there's a minor element of truth to this, but I also think folks are taking for granted that they learned to deal with a lot of scary elements by playing Sub. First time going to many areas in BZ were real scary to me, but once I realized what the dangers were, and got to see all the creatures, I quickly fell into late stage Sub energy, where I could travel around pretty freely without worry. Sub just taught me how to handle those fears. The only exception is the big leviathan you have to contend with late game, which I always treated with a healthy amount of extreme caution.\n\nHope this helps someone.", "timestamp_created": 1642127967, "timestamp_updated": 1642127967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 276, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.933187961578369141", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91966462": {"recommendationid": "91966462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130226651", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3946, "last_played": 1620975925}, "language": "english", "review": "Compared to the first Subnautica, I feel like there are numerous minor improvements in this one. The most notable being the fact that it feels far less grindy when gathering materials. Materials are spaced in a much better fashion and are not nearly as annoying to collect. There are also numerous sections that are designed for you to have to navigate without a vehicle early on using plants that give about 30 sec of oxygen and take time to recharge that add a lot to the feel of the game. The AI for many of the creatures also appears to be significantly better than in the first game, although they still run into walls. There's a much heavier focus on story in this one as well, and the writing is quite good at times. I overall think this game has much more interesting designs on many of the creatures (although others fall flat), but it has nothing on the scale of the Sea Dragon or Emperor from the first game, which I found disappointing.\n\nThere are also quite a few things this one doesn't do as well as the first game unfortunately. I don't know if there are actually less creatures in the world, but it feels as though there are. Some environments feel just as interesting as in the first game, but others feel very bland once you spend some time in them. The crystal caves at the end have fantastic visual and level design, but aside from the (very cool) shadow leviathans, there's nothing new or special about the area really. It mostly contains the same creatures you'll find in numerous other locations. The following red crystal area is even smaller and more disappointing in that regard. It's just one big loop effectively, with the same creatures as the preceding area for the most part. Squid Sharks are particularly cool in my opinion, but they get heavily overused. The shadow leviathans are awesome, but they effectively just fill the same role as ghost leviathans in the first game. The other major ocean threat leviathan in the game has an interesting design, but doesn't even begin to inspire the fear that the reaper leviathan does in the first game. There are also few less of them than reapers, which leads to most of the ocean feeling relatively safe, which is a shame.\n\nThe place where this game suffers the most is the place where it deviates the most from its predecessor - the land gameplay. It's simply not very good. The animations on land are still very stiff and there's no option to crouch. The snow fox is cool, but flips easily and you'll spend half the time getting knocked off of it by the ice worms. The ice worms themselves are too on the nose and lack any real suspense. I was never afraid they were coming - it was obvious they were and they were more of a nuisance than an actual threat. I thought the land environment was very interesting and well designed, but the gameplay just doesn't support it well. There are numerous mechanics that work great under water that just don't translate (or look good) on land.\n\nOverall it's a great game and I would recommend it. But, I would recommend the first one more. During the first part of this game, I was very immersed and was even enjoying myself more than the first game, but after only a short time it felt very small. Without an equivalent for reapers to box you in, there's really not much you can't just go explore very quickly, and it's far less scary of a game once you get familiar with it. There are also no major events like the Aurora exploding or the Skybeam (or whatever it's called) getting shot down, making the game feel less active as it progresses. The later areas are far less mysterious and interesting than the final zones in the first game. The alien sites are much less impressive and much less interesting, which is a shame considering the focus on alien sites in this one.  If you like the first game, you'll probably like this one, but if you haven't played the first game and are deciding on one or the other, get the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1620974933, "timestamp_updated": 1620974933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1194, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.93187326192855835", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119149961": {"recommendationid": "119149961", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993073639", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1724, "last_played": 1596495825}, "language": "english", "review": "I have 291 hours in original game.\nI have 28 hours in this one.\n\nI'm not going to thumbs down the game... but I'll let you decide what I mean by the above.", "timestamp_created": 1658339395, "timestamp_updated": 1658339395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 288, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.928446710109710693", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71217874": {"recommendationid": "71217874", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986572155", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 3017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1600, "last_played": 1654239912}, "language": "english", "review": "It's incomplete, but still worth the money right now.

I found that, throughout my entire play through, the whole experience didn't feel nearly as mysterious and terrifying as the first game. In BZ, they replaced the huge, open map with a small, almost linear one. While some may like that, I didn't personally; I loved the huge areas of purely dark water with no visible bottom (obviously excluding the void) and the excitement of exploring these uncharted waters. In BZ, however, since there was an entire team of scientists, engineers, etc. in the area to begin with, it feels like the entire map's already been explored, which discouraged me from exploring it. The biomes don't feel nearly as unique as they did in Subnautica; they almost blend together. \n\nThe story is okay. It's nothing life changing. Now, the original's wasn't either, but it was at least different. There are two main story lines in BZ: the one regarding the death of Robin's sister and the one about helping AL-AN. The latter has an interesting ending, and goes into the Architects in greater detail, but the one with Sam is just boring. I didn't care at all about the Sam story line; I had no incentive to find out what happened to her. It was, frankly, boring.\n\nOverall, if you loved the original  you should definitely try BZ; while it's not as good, it gives you more of the Subnautica experience, but in a different fashion.

Then play that game. Then when you have spent adequate time there please return to this review.\n\nThis iteration of the Subnautica franchise sees you dropping from an Alterra rival ship onto the familiar 4546B. This time landing in the arctic zone near the last known location of the protagonist's sister. I will not spoil any further story and will focus on core mechanics in place and gameplay experience.\n\nThe addition of temperature regulation to Subnautica at first seemed egregious, but quickly becomes a second sense. At no point in my play through have I felt that temperature management was unwieldy. Especially with the addition of new mechanics and technology for managing the meter.\n\nThe sea of Below Zero is somewhat smaller than the sea in the original game, however this in my experience adds to the player's ability to find important entrances and landmarks to deeper biomes. Likewise, I have seen complaints about the amount of land exploration required in Below Zero, I have found the land exploration to be a welcome distraction from the thallasophobic exploration of the deep sea. And, the land is not without its own set of dangers.\n\nCore gameplay is very solid. Coming straight from the end of Subnautica into Below Zero I feel very at home and reasonably bug free. As I explored I found that there are still many unfinished story elements as may be expected from an Alpha game, however there is plenty to do and plenty of challenge to overcome at this stage.\n\nThe main disappointment with Below Zero at the moment is that the danger feels much reduced to the original game. I have found that a well equipped player can fight her way out of most situations with more than moderate success with the one potentially offensive tool at your disposal. I am sure that more danger will be added to the game as the development continues, but can safely say that if you are looking to extend your Subnautica journey after the first game this early access title will scratch the itch.\n\nIf nothing else I have had immense fun exploring the new technology tree and the new world in its current state. I am looking forward happily to the final product and wish the devs the best of luck. I hope that my early purchase helps them in some small way to continue creating engaging new stories on planet 4546B for us the players to experience.\n\nI would recommend this game as a way of supporting the devs, and as a way to continue the Subnautica journey after you complete the first game. At one time in my current save I experienced a large bug where my vehicle winked out of existence far from home, but the experience otherwise has been smooth. Again there are obvious story elements you will encounter which are incomplete, but the core gameplay should give you something to do while adding recommendations via the in game menu.\n\nI personally support this project completely and am thrilled to be able to experience it as an evolving entity based on user feedback and the discretion of the creative team.\n\nFacts: I paid for this game. I think this franchise is the defining work of the studio. And, I believe these games will appeal to the natural curiosity and will to survive hardship in all of us.

It offers a fresh take on the addictive gameplay of the original. If you were especially interested in base-building and biome exploration then this is a no-brainer for you.\n \nMany aspects of the game design and story were changed and it adds some amazing new features. This really gives below zero its own fresh taste. However some things were not to my liking. I highly preferred the original's feeling of lonliness and getting frightning bits of background information. Below zero is surprisingly lively in that regard. The environment is packed with details and the biome designers truly put all their creativity into it. However as a whole the game lacks the authenticity the original had. The voice logs and new PDA voice often come across as cheap comedy and this just creates a bizzare atmosphere for a game where you're supposed to fear the depths and be suspicious of everything you come across.\nTwo more things, the new vehicles kinda work, however they have fundamental flaws in their design, which leads to disappointments. Lastly this game just doesn't offer the same progression you got in the original. I know it's supposed to be a \"small\" DLC, but the gameplay progression was one of the core aspects which made Subnautica such a damn good game. \n\nNonetheless a very nice follow up game and highly recommended for Subnautica fans.

It's fair to say that most everyone interested in this one will have tried the first one. If you're not played either, it's definitely better to start with the first Subnautica. The reason is, and this is why there are alot of thumbs up reviews here that are \"disappointed\" in this follow up - there is no way you will ever recapture the feeling of awe and wonderment at being dumped into the middle of a hostile mysterious world and left to fend for yourself. You've had it in the first game (and if not, go experience it) and you will not get it back - there is nothing the devs could have done short of wiping your memory, so they decided to try something a little different. And the game is better for it.\n\nThe core of the gameplay is the same as the predecessor - you're violently thrust into a world you know nothing about, with nothing to your name but a waypoint to a pod which will be your first home. From there you explore, collect, craft and thrive. Your exploration is limited only to oxygen capacity for yourself, crush depth for your vehicle and fear of the unknown (or known).\n\nSo what's changed? One change is apparent from the get go - your character isn't a mute, she has a voice and opinions. She has her own goals to accomplish - which you can ignore if you want. There are also now humanoid NPC's you can interact with. Audio logs usually have character portraits. All contribute to make you the player feel somewhat less isolated that before.\nAnother change is more emphasis on land exploration, complete with monsters and terrible weather that will make short work of you if you're unprepared. There's a lengthy section, mandatory for story completion, that will make you dream of diving back into the water - remeniscent of being stuck in a blizzard surrounded by bears. Which is by no means a bad thing, I enjoyed that part exactly because I didn't know where I was - I was making progress - and I was under-equipped and close to being overwhelmed by the hostile terrain. Upon reaching my goal I realised I now had to go back the way I came which was annoying to contemplate and exhilirating to execute, as I had no means of defence against the monsters and had to outwit them.\n\nWhich brings me to another fine point - you are very free to attack this hostile terrain however you want. Careful observation and diligent exploration can make you pretty much untouchable. The monsters I mentioned? There are two ways you can discover to deal with them that will make them a non issue. But you don't have to - buy the time I found those two ways, I never had to deal with them again. And it was tricky, and it was fun. There are so many tools at your disposal, it's sometimes easy to forget that some can be used to solve problems in very creative ways.\n\nSome reviewers mentioned the size of the game as a negative, compared to the first. I disagree. It's not as big, but it doesn't matter. It's the right size for the story it's telling. The different biomes felt unique and fantastical with a shade of real world basis for all of them. Having completed the game it didn't feel like there should have been more for the sake of it - it's a complete package, and it works. The first game achieved a sense of vast isolation with the massive, mostly empty landscapes in about a third of it's biomes, which contributed to the creepiness factor. That's gone - and it wouldn't have worked here. You'd have to go back to a mute protagonist and tone down the story, and everyone would say it was too much like the predecessor but not as good anyway. By the way, the biomes, with the audio cues, are sometimes jaw dropping.\n\nSo what sucks? Well most of my problems were tied to navigation. The first part of the game is spot on, no problems there. You explore, you get waypoints, you figure stuff out, great. But later on you don't get no waypoint. Fair enough, you have to listen, remember, figure stuff out. You can find at least 2 maps ingame that help. So let's take a particular section, one of the outdoor icy ones, a section they drew you a map for. Just like the other blizzard bit described above, I was well unprepared, making it by the skin of my teeth. Except this bit wasn't facing in one direction. It was twisty, full of caves, full of bears I had no way to deal with (that i knew), hailstones dropping every 30 secs and snow fog. Was there something at the end? Dunno, I was circling around for ages in the foggy blizzard and had no idea where I was or where the end was. It was one of two times I looked up a wiki - it was confusing and frustrating - so very unlike the worm one, that one was fun because i was making progress.\n\nAnother example - in the main plot you're asked to find 3 mcguffins. Two get a waypoint. One doesn't. I was in that area, with two leviathans biting at my bumbags, for absolute aeons, and were it not for the wiki I believe I'd still be there, circling, gently weeping. So that's 2. Not too shabby, because the rest of the game I was just stumbling around exploring and managed to hit pretty much all the story beats organically. And it was a fantastic experience.\n\nOh and for those saying the main characters' motivations are swept by the wayside as the main plot opens up, which makes it redundant, i'd disagree. It's not forced on you, which is a good thing, and as some have mentioned they didn't much care for it anyway. But it is important enough to be acknowledged at the end, so treat it as an optional main plot thread, rather than a main quest turned into side quest.\n\nSo there it is, don't listen to the critics, I thought I was going to hate the talky protagonist and the reduced world size, and I have to admit I was wrong - it works! Don't think of it as a sequel - it's not. Think of it more like a different flavoured \"Tales of Subnautica\" parallel game, go in with an open mind, and enjoy, I did", "timestamp_created": 1672539551, "timestamp_updated": 1672539551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 317, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920985639095306396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92542196": {"recommendationid": "92542196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055331665", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6386, "last_played": 1621442431}, "language": "english", "review": "Is this as good as Subnutica? No, it is not.\n\nAnd there are a few reasons for it. What Subnautica had going for it was a simple premise \"We need to go deeper!\". And every time you did, you felt more vulnerable again until you got new upgrades. And everytime you went deeper you were amazed by a new biome with different creatures and new things to explore. You had a few above the ground areas (the two small islands and the Aurora), just for a change of pace - nothing too drawn out. And there was the danger of the Reaper floating somewhere in the vast open oceans, you could not see it, but hear his roar. You had a range of vehicles, the small beloved Seamoth, the Prawn Suit and a submarine you could create base in for long explorations.\n\nIn Below Zero most of that is missing: The ocean feels small and cramped, the biomes most of the part are uninteresting, with the exception of the Lilipad Islands and the worst thing of all \"We need to go deeper!\" is missing. The map is just too small for an underwater game to work. And that causes many other problems. Multiple dangerous leviathans cramped into small caves are not as dangerous compared to a single reaper somewhere in the far out ocean. The fear of the unknown and the wonders of the depths are missing. \n\nTo top it off we have a voiced protagonist, and as often voicing and dialogue lead to a very linear game play and take away from the exploration in survival games. In BZ it is most of the time: go there, scan this, now dive there, grab this, oh go there and scan this, now build this. It took out all the wonder of exploring a vast open ocean with endless depths. That is the other huge mistake in the game and goes against what make survival and exploration games so interesting. Also the different text-to-speech PDA voice is quite terrible. The story is ok, but very generic.\n\nThe third mistake is the glacial basis/artic spires. A huge above the ground area where is not much to explore and is mostly just snow. Yes, there is one great part in it, the frozen leviathan. It had a bit of the feeling of finding the huge leviathan skeletons in the Lost River in the first game. But given the size of the Glacial Basin and Artic spires there is not much do to. But instead you are constantly attacked by annoying creatures over the ground you just do not care about. Even the above the ground vehicle does not work as it steers like a broken shopping cart in a grocery store. I did not bother to use it more than a few minute. The gimmicky remote camera penguin? Serves no purpose beside being part of a find-the-needle-in-a-hackstack fetch quest. Many things in BZ felt like cut content from the first game, hot glued together. Well, expect the Jukebox, that is a great addition as well as some newer stuff for base building. But given the map is so small, you never really complete your base as you might have in the first game.\n\nThere are other things that just do not work out, like the Seatruck with its many modules. You do not need them and do not care about them, in fact there is no need for any mobile base at all, given the map is so small and the diving depths so shallow. The change from the Seamoth to something else ist just for the sake of chaning things. It doesn't work out well, and navigation with it can be annoying as you bump a lot into the surroundings.

We didn't even know his face. He was us and we were him. When you lose that aspect, the thrill and scare just disappears. In Below Zero we know the main character very well.

I'm discerning about what games I choose to buy and spend my time playing. I obviously ended up getting it though and I just finished a very 'no rush' playthrough. If you're in a similar position to where I was, this is the review for you.\n\nFirst, where I'm coming from. My favorite part of Subnautica was the unique balance of open-world exploration, self-paced storytelling, and plain, primal terror (not to be confused with horror). I also found the plot interesting and it held my attention, and I only found it more intriguing and believable for the slowness with which you discover details and the lack of direction each discovery left you with as to where you go next, and the incompleteness of what you learn. And, I loved the graphics and environment - the graphics are not very technically impressive, but the developers made beautiful, compelling things with what they had, and that is worth infinitely more than any amount of polygons on a screen or pixels in a texture.\n\nFrom the start, Below Zero is not set up the same way at all, and that's totally fine. It doesn't come even close to feeling linear, and it doesn't hold your hand per se, but it starts you off knowing why you are here and with some idea of where to go. You are given most of what you need to start digging into the plot's mysteries fairly early on in the game, in terms of both technology and story information, and it falls to you to use those things to explore and connect the dots. It does present its story in a similar way though: most of what you get comes as logs and wrecks, and you piece it together yourself.\n\nMy only plot-related complaint would be that the story played up the dystopian transgovernmental corporation that is Alterra a little bit too much, to the point of being a bit caricaturesque at a couple points, only to have Alterra just disappear which I think is extremely out of character for an organization in their position (I can't say more without spoiling anything). It's not really that big a deal and I'm probably giving it more text than it's worth, but you notice it after you stop playing and you you contemplate the events of the game, and it does break up the story just a little bit.\n\nNow, the progression is one area where the original Subnautica was perhaps flawless: the equipment you 'unlock', the new environments you push into, and the new threats you face are all balanced spectacularly. Below Zero definitely comes up short. A huge part of the reason - you knew this was coming - is the Seatruck. I don't think a comparison to the Cyclops is valid so I won't try to force one, but the Seamoth is fair game. And I think the early game Seatruck compares fine to the Seamoth in practice; slap a storage module on the back just like you stuck hardcases to the side of your Seamoth, and you're good to go explore areas you would have struggled to reach before (or did struggle but did it anyway, now you can go back). As you go, you discover upgrades and new modules that add functionality to the Seatruck... in theory. The implementation just isn't great. Give it enough modules and upgrades that hauling a Prawn suit along and trying to use it as a roving base makes any real sense, and it turns into an awkward balance of zippy but clunky, the poor storage capacity is simply frustrating, and the Prawn never feels really necessary. You can use it that way, and you probably will, but it never turns into anything that makes it feel more useful or powerful or rewarding than it did early in the game. It just ends up getting old and being mildly annoying. It probably seems like I'm harping on this vehicle, but Below Zero is built with the Seatruck as a core part of its gameplay, and for something that essential, it isn't as well done as I'd hope.\n\nThen there are the bugs. The original Subnautica had a few - I'm sure you've been trapped in a Prawn suit, or beached your Seamoth as a means of parking and come back to find it 10m under the ground. But Below Zero is riddled with minor graphical bugs that let you see through ledges and see certain things from absurd distances and cause weird and very noticeable lighting issues. It also has quite a few spots you can accidentally trap yourself on terrain geometry and essentially softlock the game, and that even happens in areas that are important to the plot in places you are likely to go through (often you can save yourself by looking down and placing a light stick, if you keep one on you like I do). And there's one particular mean leviathan in one particular area that has a nasty habit of getting out of bounds and then coming at you through the ground or ceiling once or twice before getting back in bounds and on its normal path, which is stupefyingly scary but also extremely immersion-breaking and frustrating. The result of all this is a game that feels unpolished... not unfinished, just unpolished.\n\nAnd on a similar note, Below Zero doesn't feel quite as fleshed-out as the original either. There were something like three dozen species of plants you could harvest in Subnautica, just plants, and most of them had absolutely no practical use whatsoever. And there were bunches of little pieces of useless equipment and glass containers and bags and all kinds of other things lying around you could pick up and keep like some kind of sea/space raccoon. All this let you decorate your base and make it feel more like home using the things you found in the world. Below Zero has tons of neat-looking plants and all kinds of equipment to give depth to the biomes and locations you find, but it only lets you have what is useful so you can't bring that depth home. All it adds in return is a bunch of posters and picture frames, and a bunch of options for bedspreads and a faux wooden desk in the habitat builder. This isn't a problem per se, but let's face it, we all enjoyed the crap out of sprucing up our seabases and turning them into a sort of home beyond just a place to store materials and fabricate components, and Below Zero takes an important part of that away which leaves it feeling disproportionately spartan.\nPlus, probably more importantly, there's no wondering what you might want to collect in your travels; if you can pick it up or harvest it, you should keep it around, especially if it isn't edible. Below Zero also has quite a few large plants and/or plant-like things you can't even scan, where that was unusual in the original, so that's a bit weird too, and it becomes more frequent and more noticeable in the 2-3 late game areas which is... *narrows eyes*... interesting.\n\nI realize I just wrote a short essay criticizing Below Zero's issues and shortcomings, but that's because I think it's good enough to be worth criticizing. Most of my gripes are fairly minor, and most are probably fixable via updates.\n\nBelow Zero also does some very important things right. It gives us a whole new world of unique and beautiful environments to explore and ecosystems to see, complete with the occasional moment of terror as the world reminds you that you are small and fragile and there are places you do not belong. It gives a story with interesting, flawed, and dynamic main characters, and a compelling overall arc that the original doesn't compete with. I enjoyed this game and I am glad I played it.\n\nBottom line here. If you enjoyed Subnautica and you want more, Below Zero will probably scratch that itch quite nicely. Frankly, I don't think it's quite as good as the original, but it's not too far off.\nIf you haven't played the original because you are daunted by the 'wander aimlessly' premise, Below Zero doesn't do that for the most part so you should be fine, and it will kind of teach you how to survive the original game too. Otherwise, I'd probably recommend you play the original first and get this only if you do like it.", "timestamp_created": 1661490752, "timestamp_updated": 1661490752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 164, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.905454039573669434", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78103118": {"recommendationid": "78103118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066106970", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 313, "last_played": 1712505423}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm about halfway through the game and its been good so far, but the only reason i'm writing this is so you understand why the first game in my opinion is far better.

Much of the game functions the same; craft items and build bases from materials scavenged from the environment, explore the dark depths while avoiding nightmarish creatures, and unravel the story of why you are there and what happened prior to arrival.\n\nThe game places you in the shoes of new protagonist Robin, traveling to 4546B (from the first game) to discover what happened to her missing sister. Unlike Riley, Robin is fully voiced, weighing in on the game's events throughout. While I believe that the VA for Robin did a fine job, some of the writing itself may leave something to be desired. The game lacks some of the wit and charm of the first one, most notably in the way your PDA now talks to you. Some of the found data entries still contain that humor, but it feels fewer and farther between. There are a few exceptions that I found great, but I won't spoil them here. None of the voicing is by any means terrible, but perhaps lessened (at least for me) due to expectations from my experience in the first game. \n\nThe story didn't feel any longer than the first game and carries most of the same formula, but it does feel more involving with a few twists thrown in here and there. You'll find a few callbacks to the first Subnautica and big, new set pieces as the story progresses. I did enjoy the direction the story went with, but it is difficult to describe it without giving away some of the surprises.\n\nThe biggest drawback for me was sadly the environment. The map feels noticeably smaller this time around, at least as far as the underwater sections are concerned. This is largely due to the inclusion of more above-water areas to explore. For me, these snow covered areas left much to be desired; composed primarily of barren snow fields and valleys that become increasingly more confusing to navigate the further you go. This made these new additions feel more like a slog than enjoyable new content. Even when in the ocean, I found myself spending most of my time back and forth between the same 2-3 areas. There were even entire sections I rarely visited as they had few to no points of interest or anything particularly enthralling to look at. At least in Subnautica, it had a wider variety of biomes, each with their own distinctive look and feel - not quite the case here. Part of me wishes that the land sections were removed entirely in favor of more water. That said, there were a few late game locations that I found both beautiful and fascinatingly scary to explore.\n\nAnother big disappointment came in the form of the vehicles provided this time around. The beloved Prawn Suit makes a return, but gone are the Seamoth and Cyclops in favor of the Seatruck and Snowfox. The Seatruck functions almost like a modular Seamoth, with the primary cab (responsible for movement) attaching to a slew of containers that can be entered, hosting things like storage or fabricators. This felt a bit novel, with the ability to change what you want to bring with you. The problem is that each added compartment decreases the Seatruck's speed and makes it incredibly difficult to maneuver in the game's tighter spaces, of which there are many. Additionally, you can not add any extra habitat items to the inside of the containers, like how you could place growbeds or additional lockers inside the the previous Cyclops. At a glance, the benefit of the Seatruck seems to be that it is more agile when tackling the deep, but it actually feels slightly worse given that the Cyclops at least had things like sonar, exterior cameras and more defensive options. The Snowfox plays out like a small landspeeder, hovering above the ground. It is used exclusively on land, letting you glide quickly across the snow. This would have been great if not for its touchy maneuverability and propensity to throw you off of it after being attacked by a particular land dwelling creature. It was often more an inconvenience to use at all, usually having me switch to the Prawn Suit for land exploration instead.\n\nAs far as gameplay, you'll see the most similarity here. Collect mineral and organic fragments to build your tools and start a base. Cook fish to replenish your food and water. Use your hard-earned vehicles to traverse the environments. Read from your collected PDA entries. I am a sucker for base building and customization and Below Zero thankfully offers a bigger assortment of (mostly cosmetic) items to fortify your underwater fortress. There are a few new tools that can be added to your arsenal, like a mineral finder that will locate a variety of specific materials, similar to how the scanner room functions but in a portable manner. I never personally felt like I needed to use some of the new additions, but they are there for those who want to expand how they play. Essentially every item from the first game makes a return, such as the laser cutter, grav trap and so on. Some familiar fish make a return alongside a host of new creatures, most of which are expectantly terrifying. Rest uneasy as there are new Leviathan species to encounter, from gentle giants to massive menaces. \n\nWhile I had some gripes, I did still enjoy my time with it. At the end of the day, it was more of that charming underwater adventure that I loved from the first game and even most of the flaws are still salvageable. My only wish is that the treks through land were removed, reduced, or otherwise made more fun, as well expanded and more varied sea biomes. If you have played Subnautica and need to scratch the itch for more, I certainly think this game is still worth the effort (though may not hurt to catch it on a sale).", "timestamp_created": 1654188452, "timestamp_updated": 1676125610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.89364159107208252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55162641": {"recommendationid": "55162641", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999230480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1623510796}, "language": "english", "review": "Revision as of 3/8/2021:\n\nI'm very optimistic. \n\nThe decision to remove the voiced character of Sam and replace her in the role of your story companion with Al-An didn't make for a huge leap in the type of dialog, but it made what was there *much* easier to swallow. The new story arc feels pretty solid. Like the original, there are hints and suggestions of where to go, but not a huge amount of handholding. In this case though, the smaller map size and less obvious choice in terms of continually escalating intimidation factor of a given biome makes for a bit less seamless self-directed pacing. The tradeoff here is that traveling is now MUCH less tedious, abut also much less suspenseful. I find this to be a plus and a minus at once. In the original, I HATED moving through open water because the Cyclops was slow and needed to be managed strategically in order to avoid being chewed up by the reapers or the ghosts. In this, there's much less strategy to the encounters. YOu either hit the leviathan with your defense zapper or climb out of your sub and it gets bored immediately and leaves. I found this less stressful, but at the same time less rewarding to come out of. The emergent atmospheric horror element that I loved and hated about the original is diminished, making this, for better or worse, slightly more casual feeling. Is that bad? Nah. It's accessible. This might be a good option for people who like the idea of Subnautica but found the original title too intense.\n\nThe design of the biomes was a little more arbitrary in this case. Visually interesting, but the lack of much in the way of distinctive topography meant that basically, everything was flat-ish, and half of everything had cracks in the ground that you could go down into. THis made searching a bit more procedural. A bit less of a chore, which is a plus, but it felt a little less natural. Again, this felt like a tradeoff. This game demands less of you in terms of patience and resolve, and rewards you with a greater variety of above-ground biomes to explore. I found the latter part of that to be very refreshing, as going back and forth helped to break up the slightly smaller variety of underwater topography and variety. \n\nI am compelled by the more narrative story here. The original was great for what it was. It had less of a story and more of a suggestion of a story, which contributed in a magnificent way to the mysterious and atmospheric nature of the game. \nThis game moves in a different direction. More straightforward, but somehow managing not to be linear. Brilliantly done in that regard, that's a tricky balance to pull off. I play games for the story, but linear games can feel confining and often work against the sort of atmosphere and pacing this title has. It's not mind-blowing, but they pulled it off in a way I really enjoyed.\n\nTL;DR - \nSome creative choices were made over the past couple iterations that I totally dig. I'm not in love with the in-game world, but it's balanced out by the fact that the studio managed to combine a more narrative-driven experience with a game that is still atmospheric and nonlinear. \n\nIf you are looking for an experience exactly like the original, you might find this lacking. \nIf you like the idea of the original but found it nerve-wracking and stressful at times, you may find this refreshing. \nDefinitely recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1568768545, "timestamp_updated": 1615267296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892968654632568359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92108128": {"recommendationid": "92108128", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991103051", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 252, "playtime_forever": 3296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3296, "last_played": 1621133370}, "language": "english", "review": "1 step forward and 2 steps back.\n\nI played and beat subnautica 1 for the first time a few weeks before the release of below zero. After playing and finishing both back to back, It's very very clear to me something happened to Below Zero in development that took a winning formula from the first game and twisted it into an unrecognizable mess. In no particular order, I will go over my issues:\n\n1.) Story - The first game combined story telling with gameplay seamlessly. You have instant motivation and direction from the first second of taking control of the playable character. and that wasn't because you had some magical being in your head telling you where to go and why youre going there. It feels like Below Zero has 2 different stoies crammed into 1 and as a result, neither side gets the attention it needs and ends up feeling like both stories are unfinished and uninteresting. You have the story of AL-AN the alien and the story of Robin (you) and Sam (your sister). Al-AN's story is mildly interesting because it adds to the lore from the first game but, thats the only reason it has any interest (a common theme I've noticed). Sam's and Robin's Story is the whole reason youre on the planet in the first place and everything is pretty much told to you within the first hour of starting the game. This story just dropped off the face of the planet as soon as you meet AL-AN.\n\n2.) Map/materials - The map design for BZ compared to the first is just garbage. The first game anchored your internal compass to the auroara then it generally kept changing biomes the further down you would go. On top of that, the transitions between biomes generally made sense. In BZ the biomes are seemingly randomly squished together with very little landmarks or uniqueness to orient yourself. Every spot in the crystal caves looks like every other spot in the crystal caves, every spot in the purple fissures looks like every other spot in the purple fissures, ect ect. The materials you use have this problem too. You find just about everything you need outside of magnitite and the blue crystals in the area you find AL-AN in, which is probably where everyone builds their first base.\n\n3.) Land/temp meter - So the 2 biggest aspects to BZ that I gathered was a larger focus on land exploration and an additional survival mechanic in the form of a temp meter. After beating the game, I do not understand why they did this. The temp meter really only has any change when you are on land and wasnt a factor even a little bit under the water which makes 0 sense to me. When you are on land, dont worry as there are about 3 heat flowers every 10 steps you take so youll never run into an issue with freezing. After getting the prawn suit (which you can get within the first hour easily) it becomes an even bigger non issue. As for the land aspect, what a bore. Theres less to see on the 3 islands in this game than there was on the 2 islands in the first game. Everything above water is frozen so its all white and when its not thats because its storming or hailing or something and you just cant see anything. There are a ton of \"land\" survival exploration games to play that do it way better because they are geared for it. Subnautica is at its best in the water and thats clearer than its ever been after spending as much time on land as you do in BZ.\n\n4.) Survival - It wasnt particularly difficult to survive in the first game but BZ its almost impossible not to survive. Somehow its easier to procure food in a freezing climate than the more temperate climate of the first game. Who knew? You get the potatoes and watermelons from the first game but add on to that peppers, nuts, fruits growing under ice and more nutrient bars than youll ever need. Theres even an over abundance of air assistance even though you can get the max air tank pretty early on. You have o2 trees everywhere, fish that give o2 everywhere, and rock outcroppings that act similar to the o2 plants from the first game. On top of all of this, you unlock a chest that acts like the ender chest in minecraft where its shared with other ender chests so you can rest assured even in a pinch youll always be able to survive and if you run out in your chest just use the instant teleporter device that instantly teleports you back to your seatruck. Way too easy.\n\n5.) Vehicles - There is no vehicle progression in BZ. You use the sea truck for all of 20 minutes before unlocking the prawn suit and once you have the prawn suit thats it. You dont need anything else. The upgrades are cheap and theres plunty of storage you can add on to ensure youre never low on supplies. On top of that the prawn suit makes all of the land sections a joke and you casually jump past the \"scary\" worm without breaking a sweat. You unlock modules for the sea truck that turn it into more of the cyclops from the first game but its not like you could take it anywhere. Its so slow and cumbersome and it will not fit into the places you need to go. The prawn suit fits everywhere you need to go and youll only make a trip deeper than 400m or so maybe 2 times so its not like you need the mobile base aspects of the cyclops like sea truck.\n\n6.) Glitches - I played the first game years after it came out so im sure it was patched to fix glitches and such but this game has a ton. At least 1 serious one that I found and 2-3 map glitches (on land of course) where I fell out of the map. The serious glitch was towards the very end after you assemble AL-ANs body, my prawn suit just vanished. I reloaded my save and repeated this process with the same effect 5 times before I found a spot to put the prawn suit far enough away that it was still there after the cutscene. I was under the impression early access was designed to eliminate these kinds of glitches. \n\n7.) Base building - This was the only area of the game that I think actually improved from the first game (although not much). They added a larger room and more stuff to put in it although that stuff is primarily cosmetic. They even added a new room with the control room but it doesnt actually do anything. It just gives you some minor information like the time of day and your power use. It would have been nice to actually get some room additions that had some greater purpose. For instance (minor spoiler) [spoiler] I think it would have been cooler to have to build a fabrication room for the purpose of getting AL-ANs body than just bringing the materials to the room in the crystal caves to build it. [/spoiler] \n\n8.) Leviathin designs - These guys are laughable in BZ. They dont deal much damage, they dont chase that hard, and they arent threatening. There is no dragon or sea empress in BZ. You can casually just swim on by the sea life in this game much like the worm i mentioned on land. Even if one of them catches you in your prawn suit, theyd have to do it 4 more times for it to matter.\n\nAll in all i dont really know where all the development went for this. I saw a video from someone playing it at like the end of 2019 and it looked like a much more complete game somehow than the one launched like a year and a half later. I think with the way this ended up, BZ would have been much better as an add on to the first game for like 10-15 bucks in the same map with the same character as the first game with the AL-AN story added in and the extra base building aspects added in.\n\nPretty sad experience, especially after just finishing the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1621180082, "timestamp_updated": 1621180082, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 698, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889918029308319092", "comment_count": 44, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88434361": {"recommendationid": "88434361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279295337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1144, "last_played": 1621094106}, "language": "english", "review": "How do you write review for a game that feels so much tighter, and yet so much less, than the original? \nSubnautica 1 had it's problems bug wise, but that's because it swung for the fences.

The forced statements overrides any chance of developing a ludo-narrative (an emergent story driven by gameplay). It surely must have cost a lot of resources to make given the scope of the studio, which were unfortunately wasted entirely. Bad Netflix-like stereotypical dialogue and characters, an incredulous overabundance of \"badass\" female characters [spoiler](the crashed ships captain is literally called \"Captain Badass\", sans any self-awareness)[/spoiler] The Degasi crew from the original represented one of the highlights, a simple but engaging story that paralleled player experience, gradually discovering their fate as the player explored and the planet. [spoiler]Discovering that each of them ultimately suffered a tragic but fitting death, helped underline the grim reality of planet 4546B. Come Below Zero however, not content with ruining its own worldbuilding, takes the \"badass\" female character Marguerita from the Degasi crew, and retcons her into having survived miraculously thereby ruining the poetic ending of the original. Maybe if she played a crucial part in the story, which seems to be the case initially - but as it turns out this story-thread is sidetracked entirely in favour of an Architect alien storyline.[/spoiler]\n\nWhich brings us to what is revealed to be the main storyline, the discovery and consequent interaction with [spoiler]the alien AL-AN character.[/spoiler] Intriguing at first, it soon becomes apparent that it trivializes the ENTIRE point of the game. All possible exploration is now moot, because every [spoiler]Architect location[/spoiler] is given it's own fat juicy marker. Besides one or two final locations for the story which are impossible to miss due to it being located underneath [spoiler]Marguerita's base[/spoiler], everything gets pointed out. What is left, is an world without any sense mystery or scope. [spoiler]In exchange we get a run-of-the-mill goofy robot \"what is love\" interaction dialogue, that ultimately leads to the conclusion of the game, as the alien offers to bring us along to its homeworld. Our character can simply hop on board, as I did, only to realize after traveling through a well made closing sequence - I never actually \"solved\" the original storyline to completion. Oh well, my strong independent gay engineer genius sister died pointlessly, after having fabricated a cure in 5 minutes for a disease that an alien super AI couldn't cure in a thousand years. Yet despite having this cure she opted to blow up the remaining source with explosives (because evil company bad) and ends up killing herself and an innocent coworker, because... reasons???. [/spoiler] \n\nLastly, in the original Subnautica, the excellent writing of the PDA-AI assistant added a crucial amount of  flavour and humour to the world. For some (obviously contemporary political) reason this has now been given an indian accent, which is whatever, but the unique sense of humour is lacking entirely.\n\n[h1]Dangers[/h1]\nThese are now entirely toothless, there is no actual depth to the world, and consequently to the game, creatures are copy-pasted across the biomes. While they are well designed on a technical level, they are overrused - depriving them of their unique character. Consequently, very few locations felt unique, the only \"deep\" location of the game was entirely enclosed and therefore lacking the feeling of the unknown. The new Leviathan in the deep area is nicely designed, but due to the limited space of the location, you are basically forced into being attacked by it, and soon you realize it barely does damage. \n\n[h1]Base building[/h1]\nThe only positive compared to the original, adding and expanding on the existing great base building options. Unfortunately these felt meaningless due to the lack of depth or variety in the world. I only expanded towards the one location near the deep cave, but soon realized it just contained [spoiler]two easily reached story events without anything else.[/spoiler] There was never any actual need to build a base there. I could've reached it without any vehicles as it turned out. \n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nSound design was mostly decent, not quite as inspired musically or tonally as the original but worthy enough for a sequel. However, one major issue kept jumping out - they \"crocodile / lizard\" like creatures had an obvious bugged biting noise which reached way beyond to what it should. It absolutely destroyed immersion, and was it was surprising to see this obvious bug unfixed after such a long time after full release. \n\n[h1]Land exploration[/h1]\nThe new cold system started out decently, having potential to add a new element of danger to land travel, inverting the original experience of land offering some recluse from the hostile world below. However, this new survival element becomes harmless almost immediately through the overabundance of frost peppers, which give you all that you'd ever need without having even the most basic of protective gear or vehicles. The new land vehicle looks cool but is somehow less controllable than a Warthog in Halo 1, and despite \"floating\" it manages to hit everything on its path. Its only use is to serve as a magic heater, and is entirely trivialized by the prawn suit, offering no benefits compared to the latter. The great looking Land Leviathan creature soon becomes predictable as it's clearly reduced to static \"trigger\" areas without any feeling of being sentient or it being capable of giving chase. Not to mention the low quality interaction it has with the new land vehicle. \n\n[h1]Subnautica[/h1] \nThe power of the original was its combination of survival, exploration and overcoming the immense looming fear that the unknown depths summoned, with little story notes and soundbites sprinkled across. The PC was a typical silent protagonist, surely due to budgetary restraints, which had the added benefit of aiding player agency and immersion. Instead of being shoehorned into listening to some badly written Netflix derivative garbage, I could simply [b]be[/b] the player without any explicit character identifiers overriding immersion. \n\nDanger seemed to be everywhere, and as I became familiar with the layout of the world and its creatures, I gradually overcame this fear. Each biome would offer something new entirely, with clear character, new creatures with new challenges and opportunities. Behaviour to study and be fascinated by. Exploration felt meaningful because something could be hidden [b]anywhere[/b]. With progress gated behind depth it allowed for a nice gradual progression, as my technology improved, I was able to uncover more of the world and its simple but engaging story. \n\nIn the end, I was fully familiar with the world and able to travel around it comfortably, now fully feeling in control. I looked back on the planet with a sense of pride and joy. \n\nYes, there were certainly things that could've been improved on in the original. But instead of improving upon the original, Below Zero seems to purposfully try to dampen the stengths of the original. As so often happens to studios as they grow, they all want to be Naughty Dog and basically make a linear Hollywood narrative, forgetting that what made their studio rise in the first place was not the linear narrative, but the player-driven ludo-narrative. But instead of enhancing the ludo-narrative, they've chosen to pursue pointless contemporaneous goals. \n\n[i]\"My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.\"[/i]\n\nWell not really, it's still moderately fun to play, but ultimately unremarkable and only truly disappointing in comparison to its brilliant and most likely one-of-a-kind predecessor.", "timestamp_created": 1646436747, "timestamp_updated": 1663459937, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 184, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.888109385967254639", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150101155": {"recommendationid": "150101155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030691235", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2535, "last_played": 1699729231}, "language": "english", "review": "It's almost as if the studio did not understand what made Subnautica good in the first place.\n\nWhat made Subnautica great: \n\n1. Map Design:\n\n Not only were the deep trenches of subnautica scary, but pushing into them was paramount to player progress. Facing your fears head on was rewarded with new information, materials, blueprints, and incredible spectacle. Subnautica had far reaching and wide expanding biomes that offered a lot of space to explore and even build. \n\nBelow Zero chooses to build deep, not far. Instead of having new and interesting biomes, we have a few biomes that are filled with needlessly intricate maze like caves, often holding unique and important upgrades for your seafaring vehicles. These caves are often filled with twists and turns, and so occupied that not even your smallest vehicle can fit through without taking extensive damage. I would almost liken these to the Paris catacombs where many dozens of experienced explores lie dead due to the needless expansiveness of them. (These often hold important upgrades that cannot be found anywhere else, despite other upgrades being founds in hundreds of locations)\n\n2. Vehicles: \n\nIn the first subnautica we had the seamoth, prawn, and cyclops. Below zero is far too condensed and shallow to allow a vehicle like the cyclops to operate properly, so instead we have the Seatruck. The Seatruck is slower and less maneuverable than the Seamoth and even with its module add-ons it does not provide the 'moving base' aspects of the cyclops. Its 'Storage' module addition provides about the same amount as the player character itself, very clearly not worth the hit to its already terrible speed and maneuverability.  It is not the best of either world and is a general downgrade from both the Seamoth and Cyclops respectively. \n\nThe addition of the Snowfox for the land section would have been better handled if the player could get all blueprints as soon as they reached the land section. As it stands, you must nearly reach the end of the land based section to even get the needed blueprints before spending an inordinate amount of time backtracking to the Seatruck or a base to gather the needed materials, then craft the new vehicle. An additional 3 minutes on foot would get you to the last needed area without the use of this vehicle thus circumventing its usefulness entirely, as well as a special suit that also requires the use of a machine without any explanation, and it usually achieved well after its usefulness has expired. \n\n The Snowfox also has insanely poor handling. While most vehicles turn with player perspective, the Snowfox requires turning perspective, holding either left or right, as well as moving forward. It makes for a very clunky experience for something that is supposed to glide smoothly over land. \n\n3. Story: \n\nThe charm of Subnautica came from the subtle humor of Alterra not caring about you or really anything on this planet that would not prove profitable. You feel the isolation, and you also feel the cold and callous approach that Alterra takes for this \"rescue\" attempt. You slowly gather clues that lead to a much darker and sinister history of this planet which is also directly affecting you, your health, and your rescue attempts. While not directly told to pursue a specific goal by any character it is very clear what your goal is. \n\nBelow Zero has a very surface level story, seemingly drummed up as a flimsy pretext to get our player character onto this planet. Our character is constantly voicing her own opinions on matter and also engaged in middle-school levels of philosophical arguments with a cookie-cutter rendition of \"advanced species\" that has apparently outgrown us so far they can't recognize the importance of emotion to the prospect of survival.\n\nThe story is also driven through the MC's dialogue with an alien. We are no longer a voiceless character simply finding remnants of deceased passenger's logs from our ship that can guide us in the right direction. THIS MAKES BELOW ZERO ROBIN'S STORY, NOT THE PLAYER'S STORY. As soon as you force your voiced main character to have their own drivers, you remove the agency from the player. This is in direct opposition to how any successful open world story works. I want to have a good reason to explore something only because I want to, not because my stupid character does. \n\nThere are many more reasons that this game does not succeed in its predecessor's footsteps, but I found these to be the most prominent. I hope the studio really studies what made Subnatica work well, and why it is beloved and also take a hard look at Below Zero to see where they went wrong. \n\nI hope below zero was just a grave misunderstanding, an experiment gone horribly awry, and not a symptom that portends the future of this studio's creations.", "timestamp_created": 1699943017, "timestamp_updated": 1699943017, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 455, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.886824429035186768", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140565645": {"recommendationid": "140565645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309904795", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 799, "last_played": 1644672450}, "language": "english", "review": "so glad the submarine isn't controlled by a old ass playstation controller.", "timestamp_created": 1687541168, "timestamp_updated": 1687541168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 548, "votes_funny": 470, "weighted_vote_score": "0.885625720024108887", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82926779": {"recommendationid": "82926779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025324009", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 4121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1386, "last_played": 1622130009}, "language": "english", "review": "I picked this game up after finishing Subnautica.

Which could have been okay if it led to something that was completely different, in a good way.\n\nBut it didn't. It's just less good in every possible way. There's no sense of isolation or looming dread or vastness or mystery. The world is shallow, in more ways than one. It's just much smaller (about a sixth the size, I hear), and there's less in it. And what is in it is less interesting. While they copied the same format for progression--explore, collect, upgrade, so you can explore more, etc... They somehow managed to make it deathly tedious, instead of addictive and exciting and stressful in a good way.\n\nNot to mention the story... Good lord. It was an insultingly incoherent dumpster fire of a story. They swapped the silent protagonist, which reinforced the mood and themes of the previous game, with incessant chattering that includes possibly some of the most inane dialogue of any video game ever.\n\nI enjoyed the visuals, new, cool-looking creatures, etc, and getting to have more furniture in my base...

I had remembered fans of the first game having disliked Below Zero and didn't really understand all the hate the first time I played the game through. After finishing (not completing, but decidedly not returning to) my second play through, I can safely say that I get it now.\n\nHere's everything wrong with the game:\n\n1. Progression - Progression in Below Zero is completely uneven. Maybe twenty minutes into my run, I had found Outpost Zero and scanned several blueprints that would be considered mid-late game in the original Subnautica. I don't think I even had a Seaglide yet, let alone a builder tool. This phenomenon continued throughout the game, and I often felt simultaneously over and under geared.\n\nThe depth mechanic that facilitated progression in the first game is pretty much non-existent in Below Zero; you can comfortably navigate about 80% of the (meaningful) map with a basic Seatruck, Seaglide, and Oxygen plants. As a result, there's no real order in which you gather blueprints and experience events, and it makes the whole experience very disjointed.\n\n2. Characters - one of the biggest changes from the original is greater focus on characters and dialogue. This wouldn't be an issue if the characters weren't all unlikable, childish, one-dimensional caricatures. The writing is absolutely awful, and I felt embarrassed for the voice actors every time I listened to a recording. I completely understand Alterra's decision to stick all of these people together out in the middle of icy nowhere.\n\nRobin is a whiny, jaded know-it-all, and her conversations with Alan sound like something out of an undergrad philosophy dormitory common room. I don't even know the name of the protagonist from the original game, but after a few of these conversations I thank him wholeheartedly for keeping his mouth shut throughout the first adventure. Love that guy!\n\n3. Large Areas - While many of the new biomes are great (Twisty Bridges, Lily Pads), there are some infuriatingly large, empty areas that the game forces you to slog through. The two overland areas essentially serve to be as annoying as possible to get all the way through, just to grab the one thing you need and never return. They are large seemingly for the sole purpose of being time-consuming and confusing to navigate; that's the challenge. There is an alien gateway shortcut in one of these overland sections that literally takes longer to utilize than just walking to the end destination - what?!\n\nDon't worry though - large, useless areas aren't just limited to the land. The end-game deep biomes are just as huge and empty as the overland areas. Subnautica's Lost River was undeniably huge, but despite it's name I never remember actually getting lost. The tunnel does a good job of guiding you to the end of the game. The deep areas in Below Zero are twisting networks of interconnected caverns that all look the same, and I found myself going around in circles until I managed to get lucky and find the tiny little area the game had me looking for.\n\n4. Boring, Annoying Leviathans - the Reaper put Subnautica on the map, I don't care what anyone says. There are areas in the first game I still haven't been to after maybe a dozen playthroughs because those things are so terrifying (although pretty manageable in the end). Leviathans in Below Zero are the opposite. Save for the Vent Garden (that thing is awesome, maybe the best five minutes of the game), the new Leviathans are all unintimidating and incredibly frustrating to manage.\n\nRemember what I said about the huge, empty deep zones? I forgot to mention that, while cruising around in circles looking for the next place to go, you're going to get grabbed by the Shadow Leviathan roughly every thirty seconds, spend the next thirty seconds repairing your ship, travel maybe 100 meters, then rinse and repeat. ALL THE WAY DOWN! Unlike the Ghost Leviathans, the Shadow Leviathans can pull you out of any tiny crevice; there is no escape.\n\nIn the end, this is what killed my playthrough. I got to the last area deep down at the bottom of the map, only for the game to inform me that I needed to turn around and brave the onslaught of Shadow Leviathans again to collect the wide variety of resources I'd need to complete the game. It was at that point, having re-experienced Below Zero to my (dis)satisfaction, that I decided to power down and call it quits. I can only pray that Robin stays in that deep dark cave at the bottom of the sea and never has a chance to run a power drill between another player's ears ever again.", "timestamp_created": 1684556100, "timestamp_updated": 1684556100, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 137, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.876465201377868652", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57714583": {"recommendationid": "57714583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008070928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 595, "last_played": 1706223973}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it so much, but i hate it so much. 10/10 would swim away screaming \"no no no no no\" again.\nPs. thalassophobia just makes this game more engaging, however take frequent breaks.", "timestamp_created": 1574530688, "timestamp_updated": 1574530688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 124, "votes_funny": 78, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875687360763549805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153012954": {"recommendationid": "153012954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063456617", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 2894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2894, "last_played": 1701898701}, "language": "english", "review": "For fans of the original [i]Subnautica[/i]: consider this less of a sequel and more of an expansion pack; an additional campaign from the same game.

It is also, however, significantly smaller - both in direct scale and because 1/3 of the map is taken-up by above-ground snowy mountains and icebergs.\n\nThe above-ground gameplay, while not quite as bad as the original, is still this game's weakest point, and I was grateful when I had served my time in those monotonous mountainous mazes and could return to the more interesting underwater environments.  \n\nWith the map being that much smaller, though, the biomes you [i]do[/i] encounter are significantly smaller and fewer in number, making exploration feel much less rewarding; coupled with the game's more effective guidance, you end-up spending so little time in each biome that they never progress beyond feeling liminal.  \n\nThe game seems to encourage you to avoid lingering, too: the Seamoth and Cyclops have been replaced with a single submersible: the Seatruck, which can be extended with a variety of modules to obsolete almost every aspect of base-building, allowing you to perpetually stay on the move.  There's no functional reason to build a base beyond recharging batteries, so that aspect of the game has been relegated to an opt-in feature for those that enjoy it.\n\nThe leviathans and fauna, too, have been streamlined - their number and variety significantly reduced, and their behaviour homogenised - this has the effect of nullifying the horror aspect of the game from quite early on, as once you have the perimeter defence system up on the Seatruck, everything will leave you alone after a quick zap.  Where each creature from the original had a distinct call that could easily be identified, these new ones all fill the soundscape and blur into one, making aural scouting nigh impossible and removing that aspect of gameplay entirely.\n\nBelow Zero is a fine game and, for fans of Subnautica, it will scratch that [i]particular[/i] itch the series creates - but it doesn't hold a candle to the original and I would recommend it only to fans craving that underwater-exploration vibe.", "timestamp_created": 1701901612, "timestamp_updated": 1701901612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875599086284637451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63324895": {"recommendationid": "63324895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134267492", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 862, "last_played": 1621721423}, "language": "english", "review": "14 hours in about 3 days.

Every creature feels like it belongs into this world and interacting with them is a truly memorable experience.\n\n- The [u] Base Building [/u] has been improved compared to the first game both in content as well as in stability.\n\n[hr][/hr] \n\n[b] Now to the bad: [/b]\n\n- [u] The core premise [/u] of the game just can't compete with it's predecessor. Being stranded on a foreign planet, forced to unravel it's secrets if you wanted to escape it's grasp was an immense motivator in the original. Here there doesn't seem to be a real goal or threat to push you towards the end except your own boredom. Now to be fair that was to be expected and i wouldn't have minded it as much as long as the rest of the game held up.\n\n- [u] The map [/u] both in layout as well as in depth just doesn't compare to the original. It may look vaguely comparative in size on first glance but that is deceiving: \nA large part of the map is the land area which is just an uninteresting barren ice desert compared to the underwater portion with a lot less to explore. There is no real reason to stay longer than absolutely necessary.\nThe depth part is the real problem though. In the original Subnautica the real challenge was going deep. Finding the right equipment, preparing yourself and slowly pushing your way into the dark and hostile depths of the planet made for one of the most memorable and rewarding experiences i have ever had in a video game. In Below Zero that is mostly gone. Not only is the map in general a lot flatter but the most interesting areas are all close to the surface leaving not a lot left to motivate the player to go deeper.\n\n-[u] The Story. [/u] I have to be honest here: I could not bring myself to finish the game so I can't speak to the later parts of the story or the ending but what i have experienced of the story was pretty generic and forgettable. In the original you stumbled into this vast alien world that didn't give a damn about you, nothing forced you to do anything but your own curiosity. You experienced the story through the world and at your own pace desperately searching for every crumb of knowledge. \nBelow zero replaces all that with the staples of a more traditional story-based game like dialogue and cutscenes (and a forced jumpscare, really?), none of which are particularly well done. The dialogue especially stood out for me for being incredibly mundane and uninspired.  \nOne Example: \n[spoiler] At one point in the story an alien AI gets transferred into your brain causing it to occasionally comment on your actions, something that could have been an interesting way to get new insights into a familiar world but the writing completely ruined this intriguing setup for me. From playing the beta it seemed to me that originally the AI was supposed to be a lot more snarky and condescending, commenting on your tiny meatsack brain etc. which could have made for an interesting companion. But in the final game the AI is more like what I can only describe as pseudo-philosophical(?) A lot of the dialogue with it now is about basic human concepts like dreams and music and it's just not well done.  [/spoiler] \nI think the approach of the first game, probably a result of a more limited budget, worked a lot better for this world. Sometimes less is more.\n\n- [u] The Vehicles [/u] Well...the one vehicle... The original game had two underwater vehicles (three if you count the Prawn Suit that is more of a tool in my opinion), each with it's own purpose. This game has one: The Sea Truck. Having a modular vehicle that you can customize according to your needs is a nice idea and a good addition, however it doesn't really make up for the fact that there is now less content to unlock and play around with than in the first game.\n\n-At last, and the most egregious: [u] The Atmosphere [/u]. I could have enjoyed the game despite all it's flaws if it wasn't for this dramatic change. In the original Subnautica visiting the darker and deeper areas of the map was a nail-biting experience. Listening to howls from far away and getting spooked by shadows from above always reminded you that you were nothing more than an insignificant intruder into a big and uncaring world and not getting noticed by it's scarier inhabitants was often the only way to survive.\nIn Below Zero that just isn't the case and there is one design-decision that completely breaks the atmosphere for me, so much so that I'm not even really sure if it's really an intended mechanic or just a bug but if you are detected by a leviathan while inside your sea truck and you step away from the rudder of your vehicle the leviathan immediately loses interest in you, even if it had already started attacking you. Take the steering wheel again and it will notice you again, step away and it will ignore you and you can repeat this ad nauseam. This single aspect completely breaks the very bedrock the game is resting on and caused me to stop playing despite wanting to finish it. \n\n[hr][/hr] \n\nAll in all I can't recommend it at anywhere near to full price. It is more of an expansion than a full game and worse in almost all important aspects than it's predecessor. If you didn't play the first game you are probably going to enjoy this one; if you did, you probably can still enjoy it if you are willing to hamper your expectations.\n\n[hr][/hr] \n\nAs a final note I would like to emphasize that the devs still did an amazing job overall on the game; most of it's faults are conceptual rather than a lack of skill or dedication on the developer's part. Maybe they were just a bit too hasty to capitalize on the success of the original. I still enjoy playing the game occasionally for its good parts despite all the faults i have listed in my review and I'm cautiously looking forward to a sequel should there ever be one.", "timestamp_created": 1677796676, "timestamp_updated": 1678141483, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 434, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874487817287445068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73556871": {"recommendationid": "73556871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137795071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1623360469}, "language": "english", "review": "water", "timestamp_created": 1596195069, "timestamp_updated": 1596195069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 522, "votes_funny": 251, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870615243911743164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93418588": {"recommendationid": "93418588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045692513", "num_games_owned": 1410, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 2863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2863, "last_played": 1623093323}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] [u] Quick Overview [/u] [/h1]\nSubnautica: Below Zero is a first-person survival crafting game. Adopting the spirit of its predecessor, players must depend on the ocean for food, water, and shelter, but also be wary of the beasts residing in the tenebrous, uncharted waters of planet 4546B. It encourages its players to explore the vast ocean biome and hardly ever holds your hand. I would consider this more of an expansion rather than a full-fledged sequel. All in all, it was still able to mix underwater exploration and survival elements into one wondrous package.\n[h2] Pros: [/h2]\n[list]\n       \t[*] Amazing sound design and atmosphere\n       \t[*] Considerable amount of replay value\n       \t[*] Underwater exploration is phenomenal and unnerving\n       \t[*] Long playtime (40+ hours)\n\t[*] Performance is generally fine\n\t[*] The depths of the ocean are beautiful to look at\n[/list] \n [h2] Cons: [/h2]\n[list]\n       \t[*] Story falls apart near its conclusion\n       \t[*] Minor glitches like fish swimming in your base\n       \t[*] Land-based exploration was tedious\n[/list] \n[h1] [u] The Gist of the Story [/u] [/h1]\nYou play Robin Ayou, a scientist in search of clues about the suspicious death of her sister, Samantha. Robin journeys to an alien planet known as 4546B, a frozen wasteland filled with dangerous creatures, with nothing but her survival skills and sharp mind to keep her alive. While traversing through the harsh arctic region, she uncovers a kindred soul buried within the ice, eager to find that one human to bring them home.\n\n[b] [u] My thoughts [/u] [/b]\nThe switch from a silent protagonist in the previous game to a voiced one might irk some fans, but I thought Robin was snarky, and I enjoyed her commentary. The story\u2019s strong point was from the beginning to the middle, and then it strays towards the conclusion. There was an intriguing air of mystery surrounding the death of Robin\u2019s sister. However, the game introduces a second storyline that feels tacked on just to give the player more fetch quests. They weren\u2019t bridged together properly, which caused the ending to seem out of place. \n\n[h1] [u] Gameplay [/u] [/h1]\n[b] [u] Survival [/u] [/b]\nFirst of all, you have your standard thirst and hunger meter. There\u2019s also an oxygen meter to keep an eye on when you\u2019re in the water and a temperature gauge for extreme weather fluctuations. The notifications aren\u2019t as invasive as other games in its genre, although the PDA voice assistant will occasionally warn you when you are in critical condition.\n\nForaging for food and access to clean drinking water can be a problem during the early portions of the game, especially with how fast the food spoils. However, I mitigated these issues by setting up a garden and creating a self-sustaining supply of food, solving the spoilage issue.\n\n[b] [u] Crafting [/u] [/b]\nThe fabricator is your friend since it enables you to cook food, purify water, and create tools as well as other life-saving equipment like a rebreather or a better oxygen tank for deep diving. You\u2019ll need to scour the ocean floor for raw materials like titanium or hunt for edible fish to fully utilize the fabricator. Hoarding materials is much easier since grinding for them isn\u2019t as tiresome as the first game.\n\nOne of the most important tools is the scanner because once it scans an object, there\u2019s a good chance it can be added as blueprints in the PDA. Unlocking these blueprints will enable the means to assemble vehicles, better habitat shelters, and make other furniture/devices for an underwater base, improving the quality of life.\n\n[b] [u] Vehicles [/u] [/b]\nThe Seatruck and the Prawn Suit are your go-to modes of transportation, and they make aquatic expeditions more accessible. The Seatruck is essentially a mini-submarine, and it can be modified by adding modules, which are separate cabins consisting of various functions such as extra storage, a bed, or a docking bay to carry the Prawn, my favorite mecha helper. It\u2019ll mine resource veins with its drill or protect you from the elements. It is much slower than the Seatruck, so I found myself taking it out less.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2510545867\nAnother addition is the Snowfox, a land-based hovercraft motorcycle. It sounded great on paper, but it was frustrating because it was too floaty and difficult to control. It didn\u2019t help that the area it was driven on was the worst part of the game. Traveling on land, in general, was dreary and aggravating. Perhaps, it left a bad taste in my mouth because it was easy to get lost in. Visibility, especially during snowstorms, was extremely limited.\n\n[b] [u] Fight or Flight [/u] [/b]\nFlight is the smarter option of the two, and there\u2019s hardly any benefit to fighting back. With no access to proper weapons, Robin is only able to fight with a knife. The Prawn Suit seems to have the potential to play an offensive role, but I never used it in that regard. The most dangerous hostiles are the Leviathans, and these enormous sea monsters are not to be trifled with. Thankfully, the Seatruck has a useful defense mechanism that can shock incoming threats, keeping them at bay.\n\n[b] [u] Base Building [/u] [/b]\nAnother essential tool is the habitat builder. This enables you to construct your home away from home. Base building isn\u2019t too complex, and as long as you have the ingredients for the rooms, you can customize your home any way you want. A power source must be included in your design and can consist of renewable energy sources such as solar or bioenergy. Power is needed to ensure oxygen flows smoothly throughout your abode and charge your appliances.\n\n[h1] [u] Scare factor [/u] [/h1]\nIsolation paired with deep diving makes for a very terrifying adventure. At one moment, you can be innocently swimming through dim underwater caverns, and then a sinister tentacle coils around your hand. Sometimes, the growlings of a sea serpent miles away will pervade your ears, or they will bump against your Seatruck while you\u2019re heading towards your next objective, creating an unnerving sense that you\u2019re not welcomed in this world. These small and immersive moments deliver an unforgettable and frightening experience that I haven\u2019t felt in a while.\n\n[h1] [u] Graphics and Technical Issues [/u] [/h1]\nFor context, my specs are RTX 2070 Super, i7 4790S, 12 GB ram. Playing on 2160p resolution.\nThe designs for the depths of the ocean are fantastic. The surface level features a nice, clear, aquamarine hue, but then submerging to the mouth of the abyss changes the color to an ominous,  dark blue, signifying the change in depth. The terrain transforms and becomes columns of purple crystal, depending on how deep you are. The graphics are both beautiful and haunting.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2510547220\nI didn\u2019t come across major glitches, but a few times, I noticed  the fish  gliding through the air in my base as if there\u2019s still water there. My framerate, for the most part, stayed at a consistent 60 fps. I only noticed performance dips in certain areas like outside my base and heavily populated flora environments.  \n\n[h1] [u] Wrap Up [/u] [/h1]\nBelow Zero kept what made the last game great. With more than 45 hours of gameplay and four game modes, there\u2019s an appreciable amount of replay value. Nothing significant changed, which is why other fans have referred to it as an expansion rather than a sequel. I agree with them, but it isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. If the formula still works, why fiddle with it? I recommend this for newcomers and fans of the original.\n-- --\nThank you for your time reading my review.

Below Zero's map is more compact so there's less satisfaction in reaching new areas. Also, choosing where to build bases was important in the original, but in BZ, it doesn't really matter because you can reach anywhere in a few minutes.\n\nThe original encouraged you to explore into the unknown, and when you did, you'd find something interesting and want to keep exploring. I tried that approach in BZ, but I mostly found things I would have been directed to if I had just waited. There are a few exploration benefits, but they're not that far off the beaten path and I believe most people will stumble across them accidentally or with little effort.\n\nIt seems that the developer's approach to this game was to take whatever someone found challenging in the original and remove it so that no one gives up in frustration. You just go where it tells you, build what you need without much effort, and enjoy the scenery -- not quite what Subnautica was, but enjoyable nonetheless.", "timestamp_created": 1616368514, "timestamp_updated": 1616368514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870117843151092529", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89392840": {"recommendationid": "89392840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185784355", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2814, "last_played": 1621016630}, "language": "english", "review": "Firstly, I would like to say that Below Zero is by no means a bad game. It's definitely enjoyable and well worth checking out, but I can't help comparing to its predecessor and feeling like Below Zero just doesn't measure up.\n\nLet's start with the positives. The map is absolutely stunning visually and I was constantly in awe of its beauty. Another thing I really enjoy is the expanded variety of edible plants. I must also say I really enjoyed the Al-An story. Unlike many other reviewers, I found the inclusion of NPCs a nice touch, namely a certain grandma who is made of 100% pure badass. The addition to things you can build on the base is very convenient, especially the Large Room. Lastly, many creatures are very cute and I appreaciate that.\n\nMoving on to things that could be good but they would require a few touchups. \n\nFirst, the Seatruck. Love the idea, not a massive fan of the execution. The ability to customize it with modules is really good on paper, but some modules are just straight up useless - the aquarium and the sleeper module come to mind. The storage module could use some more space. There is so little storage that it makes longer trips extremely inconvenient, requiring at least two storage modules if you want to take along more loot than what you need to play through the story. \n\nSince I'm on the topic of vehicles, I can't let the Snowfox go unmentioned. A hoverbike sounds great on paper but the controls are awful. It feels extremely clunky and unresponsive at the best of times and straight up requires the jump module to do anything, meaning you can't use any other upgrades. It feels like something that would be great to cover vast expanses of open space, but it's meant to be used on very diverse land with a lot of obstacles. I ended up fully ditching it and just running everywhere on foot instead. If the controls could be adjusted, it would help a lot. \n\nThen there are the Precursor artifacts. Once again, great idea, not the best execution. I ended up having to look some things up on the wiki, which is never a good sign. I have absolutely no idea how I was supposed to find some of the that Al-An didn't give me coordinates to (and some he did point me to).\n\nI'm very torn on the streamlining of the game, because at times it feels straight up excessive. While I understand that it's a good thing that the player isn't forced to run across the entire map back and forth all the time, it seemed like I needed absolutely no preparation for anything. Going to the cold places? You don't even need the cold suit or any warming food, there are enough peppers on location to keep you warm. There seems to be little to no need for preparation. I'm usually not one to complain about games being too easy, but Below Zero went a little overboard with the handholding there. \n\nAnother gripe I have is with the Sam side of the story. It has some great and very interesting elements but it feels unfinished. I played through all of it, found the vast majority if not all the story related PDAs and I'm still not clear on what exactly happened to her or why she just didn't handle certain things herself, seeing as she clearly had the means. Same goes for the Mercury II, it just needs a bit of a push and it will be really great.\n\nThe last thing in the good-but-not-quite-great category would be the sound design. The music is very enjoyable, but there are small things with the sound design that just don't sit right with me, those being creature roars. In OG Subnautica, the roars of every predator feel very distinct and clue you in as to which creatures you may be dealing with if you head into certain places. In Below Zero, all of the sounds feel incredibly similar. Is it the cryptosuchus or the chelicerate roaring? I couldn't tell you. This leaves especially the leviathans feeling quite underwhelming and much less memorable.\n\nThere is really one thing I straight up dislike about Below Zero and that is how painfully short the game is. The map is tiny and even the fact that most of it is winding, confusing caves, doesn't manage to make up for it. Even while I spent about half my playtime on my first playthrough after the Seaworthy update being lost in said winding caves, it still took me only 15 hours to get through the entire thing (compare that to 35 in Subnautica). The map design also doesn't really provide any incentive to build bases (it's fast to traverse + there is a serious lack of nice spots) or really grow any plants because of how plentiful food and resources are. The deeper parts being small, tight caves full of obstacles also mean it's plain not worth it to build or use the Prawn suit. Unfortunately, I don't think this is something that can or will be changed at this stage of development, but it is a detriment to an otherwise really solid game.", "timestamp_created": 1617136707, "timestamp_updated": 1617136707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 115, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865546762943267822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74209931": {"recommendationid": "74209931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009157809", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 403, "last_played": 1631308978}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not scared of real water.... but this water gives me nightmares.", "timestamp_created": 1597270720, "timestamp_updated": 1597270720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 124, "votes_funny": 70, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865304052829742432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76936970": {"recommendationid": "76936970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042590399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2425, "last_played": 1653452862}, "language": "english", "review": "This is exactly what you'd expect: the original Subnautica experience with a new world, new biomes, new monsters, new tools, new habitat components, an [i]excellent[/i] new soundtrack. And it's all wonderful.\n\nIn my opinion, the Below Zero biomes seem to flow more naturally into one another, and the progress is less predictable. In the first game, I sometimes felt like I was looking for one specific hidden passage somewhere that would lead me to the next depth level and the next tech tier. In Below Zero, the challenges are more varied. Some shallow areas can be quite dangerous. Some deep areas are quite safe and peaceful. There are multiple routes in and out of the cave systems.\n\nThe above-surface zones are a nice change of pace. The large open area you explore mid-game can feel a bit bland, if only because the new underwater biomes are so varied and gorgeous.\n\nThe new vehicle is great. [spoiler]The sea truck feels more balanced than the Cyclops from the first game; it's more akin to a customizable mobile base than an ass-kicking end-game novelty. The truck is unlocked fairly early and can be upgraded throughout the adventure.[/spoiler] \n\nThere are several nice quality-of-life improvements. Renewable food can be found very close to the starter zone. The thermoblade is seemingly unlocked much earlier than in the original game (although my memory is fuzzy on that), which makes extended away trips much more fun and sustainable. [spoiler](For those who haven't played: the thermoblade lets you kill and insta-cook small fish as you come across them, so you can keep your vitals up.)[/spoiler] \n\nAs of this writing, the campaign [i]scaffolding[/i] seems basically done. Much of the voice acting is incomplete, and some placeholder text remains (eg, a text blurb might say \"Robin and Alan discuss their feelings about X\".) But you can absolutely work through the story and tech progression and still have a pretty good idea of what's happening, filling in the gaps with your own imagination.\n\nIf, like me, you're more into the exploration and discovery, the game is basically ready to enjoy.

The whole game has so many downright strange design decisions, and compared to it's incredible predecessor I can't help but feel like it's a bit of a disappointment.\n\n-In the original game, you were alone. Everyone on your ship is dead, and your one chance of escape was detonated in front of you. The only voice you're allowed to hear outside of the data logs of your dead friends is a cold, unfeeling AI (at least up until the very end). In Below Zero, a few hours in you'll always have AL-AN chilling in your subconscious. The main character talks too, and she's... just incredibly unlikable. After awhile, her dialogue lines really started to grate on me. The weirdest part is this wasn't a problem in early builds! She used to actually talk like a human being with emotions, and bounced off AL-AN and her sister pretty well. A shame they butchered her character in the full release.\n\n-The ocean was vast and terrifying in Subnautica. Everything felt unknown and scary. In Below Zero, the map is tiny, and it's very rare I actually got unnerved by anything. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with the smaller map if they put that development time into making the sea much more densely packed and interesting, but instead, they focused on the Arctic, which ended up releasing as a broken, unfinished mess of an aboveground area. I have no idea how they did it, but they somehow managed to make a HOVERBIKE not fun to use. It's almost impressive.\n\n-Speaking of vehicles and not being fun, that applies to all of them. The zippy Seamoth has been replaced with the slow, bulky Seatruck, which while a cool concept just isn't fun to actually pilot. They also completely ruined the Prawn Suit Grappling Hook, as for some reason they decided chaining grapple boosts to zip across the landscape at (reasonably) fast speeds was just *too fun*, and patched that out. Despite the world being so much smaller it takes an artificially long time to travel from point A to point B due to these changes. In Subnautica it wasn't often I had to face one direction and hold down the W key for longer than a minute, but in Below Zero it happened *frequently*.\n\n-Also, despite being much smaller, the world manages to be much more confusing somehow. Incredibly useful blueprints are stuck in very obscure positions, important areas can be easily missed if you're not poking into every crack in the terrain, and fragments can get incredibly annoying to find (there were several occasions where I'd spend upwards of an hour searching for one or two fragments despite already being in the biomes they spawned inside).\n\n-I'm not going to get into the story, but... I really don't understand what they were thinking.\n\nIt really sucks that this game turned out like this, as there's still glimmers of Subnautica in there, deep down. The soundtrack is also fantastic; I'm a big fan of Ben Prunty's work and he took the helm gracefully here. The environments are also beautiful, and areas like the Tree Spires and Twisty Bridges really have that mysterious, beautiful charm of the first game. Unfortunately, that charm never lasted long, as instead of focusing on those areas the game spends far too much forcing you into the terrible Arctic sections and prodding you towards the next goal of the complete mess of a story it has.\n\nIf you really, really, REALLY loved Subnautica, and are willing to look past this game's flaws just to get something close to it, then sure, I'd recommend Below Zero. I genuinely do think it has some good aspects, but they are greatly overshadowed by the flaws. Otherwise, just play (or replay!) the first game, it's leagues better.", "timestamp_created": 1641003839, "timestamp_updated": 1712880554, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 410, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858294010162353516", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85598368": {"recommendationid": "85598368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021561197", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 174, "last_played": 1621320163}, "language": "english", "review": "UPDATE: 1.0 is out. Everything in my review is the same because nothing changed.\n\nBelow Zero looks right but feels wrong. The only things *better* than the first are the improved visuals and the freezing environments (which are pretty but very empty). \n\nThe story is just poorly done. When you find out what your sister did, her actions are completely stupid and careless. You are clearly supposed to hate Alterra, but according to the story (voice logs) they had good intentions. The other Alterra employees are good people. Generally speaking, the writing/characters are so simple and brainless I usually tuned them out after a few seconds. These aren't scientists, explorers, or people filled with awe at an alien world - tonally they are petulant high schoolers stuck in the fish section of a cold Walmart. Your voiced character is supposed to be a xenobiologist and never acts like it.\n\nSound design (which is one of the best features of the first game) is now annoying and *breaks* immersion. Two medium-sized predators in particular just go *CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP* mindlessly if you get within a dozen feet - they snap their jaws on nothing and the sound is just aggravating. Oh, and they chase you and keeping chomping on loop. Who thought it was a good idea for predators to attack like Pac-Man? Waka Waka Waka Waka. It'll make sense later, trust me. You can't really get a sense of size of the predators via sound, they all sound ridiculously loud, big, and unforgivably aren't distinct. This only makes the bigger predators later less terrifying. None of the deeper biomes sound as scary as your first exploration into the blood kelps of the first game. The new PDA tells you useless quips, makes bad jokes, questionably says political/government statements, and now has a silly accent. \n\nCreature designs are another let down. Someone really likes their shrimp/squid/shark hybrids, and placing them down by the dozens. In some ways it's nice, it shows that life is coming back after the events of the first game. On the other, it just feels lazy. The one *different* predator that's a bit like a crocodile moves wrong, it pretty much doggie paddles with zero grace and chomp chomp chomp chomps. What a missed opportunity for a good ambush predator! It  all feels really...bland for an alien world. All the leviathans of the old game are gone. There's no strange or mysterious predators, they all just swim about in plain sight and if you get close they attack. No tricks, they attack mindlessly like zombies and you'll see them a mile away unless it's dark. Remember when the original leviathans would sneak up behind you in the murk? That's gone now. \n\nThere isn't a good sense of progression via exploration and you feel like the world was made for fetch quests. Go here, scan that, make this, repeat. That was the formula of the original game too, but here it's just crude and far too obvious. There's odd concentrations of unique materials in these fetch quest spots and you won't make progress otherwise. There's only 3 smallish shipwrecks and a few bases to explore. The cave systems are very confusing because they are more tunnel than cave and it all looks the same. For some reason the game is a graveyard of seaglides, you'll see them in most biomes and rapidly learn to hate them. They are pretty much the scrap titanium of this game. If you go deeper you'll find the graveyard of thermal plants.\n\nVehicles are another sore point. Cyclops and Seamoth are gone. There's something new called a Seatruck that kind of combines the two vehicles, but badly. It's modular which is interesting, but it gets stuck everywhere and just lacks that *wow* factor. It's an underwater van that can tow things, big woop. Sound design on it is bad too, I couldn't tell what the *hit* sound was for a few hours, it sounds like metal on metal and I thought it was some battery or energy thing. I ditched the Seatruck as soon as I found the Prawn Suit. The new Snowfox is like a hover-motorcycle, but I haven't used it because it can't punch alien polar bears in the face like the Prawn Suit can. I have no idea why an alien polar bear would chase and fight a machine twice it's size to the literal death with zero chance of success, but whatever. I was annoyed that you can't lasso and punch the big Ice Worm, you just clip straight through and it can't be hurt. Boring.\n\nIn the first game, I never killed unless I had to eat (the headcrabs got shot into the horizon to live another day). I was respectful of being on an alien world. Here in Below Zero, I was on genocide mode after I got the prawn suit so predators would stop attacking me every few seconds and spamming me with random loud noises and chomping sounds. This game just gets so so many tiny little details wrong from the first game and it REALLY adds up to a different experience. It feels more like a game and less like a living world.\n\nIf you haven't played the first Subnautica, Below Zero is pretty good.

The world continues to look wonderful, the creatures, the flora, everything looks great and detailed. The weather system adds a lot of immersion with the storms, auroras, fog, etc.\n\nSound effects continue to be awesome and immersive. All the voice acting is great. And the music is excellent, also the jukebox tunes are great.\n\nGameplay was a bit of a step-down from the previous game. Starting the game on land, and having to spend a lot of time on land during important parts of the game, in a game named Subnautica, was very disappointing. Part of the magic that the first game had was the endless ocean all around you, and the feeling that you experienced is just lost in this one, when you are surrounded with land and icebergs full of friendly penguins.\nResource gathering and basic survival stays mostly the same, although this one felt more rushed. Some of the tools and upgrades that in the first game you had to do a lot of exploration to find, in this one you find pretty fast, making some of them unrewarding and even pointless.\nThe fauna continues to be interesting, with new fun additions, and for the most part not that aggressive or dangerous. The new leviathans are not that scary or dangerous as the ones in the previous game.\nResource availability in general is fine, with a few exceptions that you will notice pretty early. The distribution of resources on the biomes felt a bit off, I mean, finding almost endgame materials near the first biome was a bit disappointing.\nThe lack of a map in this game was even more painful than then first one, mainly on the land parts, but also underwater (the lack of the sonar was really painful). I still don't understand how an exploration game have no actual map (yeah, there is a map that is just a vague image of the land, and it's pretty much useless) to discover, add points of interest, rotate, zoom, etc.\nMoving to the vehicles, losing the seamoth and cyclops was a heavy blow, I loved those. The replacements, are not so great. The sea truck pretends to be a mix of the two, offering the speed and versatility of the seamoth, and adding the \"customizable mobile base\" component of the cyclops with the modules. But in reality, it fails to deliver both. The size and shape of the sea truck makes it get stuck in all sort of places and is slower than the seamoth. The animation to get in and out is super annoying every time that you forget to park it tilted. And most of the modules are useless. Not only, they make the sea truck slower and less maneuverable, they offer little to no benefit. Only two of the six modules are really useful. If for some reason you still decide to build them all, you can't even park them in the sea truck dock, because every time you  leave, you have to manually detach the modules. The snowfox bike is just useless, weak annoying to drive, gets stuck on everything, can't ride over water, etc. Thankfully, we have our trusty prawn suit to save the day.\nThe building system continues to be great.\u00a0There are a bunch of new tools, a TON of beds (seriously, how many beds can you build?), a lot of new buildable cosmetics, new cosmetic options for your base and a few new and redesigned machines.\n\nThe story has so much more focus this time, with a lot of voice acting, images of the characters that speak, characters background, etc. It was nice, not that interesting as the first one, but ok. Also, the order in which you find the PDA's hurt a lot the development of the plot, and maybe even leave you saying \"what? that can't be right, i'm surely missing something\".\n\nLike the first game, there are a bunch of game modes to select when you start playing, depending on the experience you want to have. If you want more freedom to build and explore, or you want the survival elements as well, or you want to customize every aspect of it, there are modes for you.\n\nIn short, great and immersive game, it still has the core parts that made the first one so awesome, but is a bit of a step-down in many of the mechanics.

I've always thought the way the first Subnautica handled its plot was messy. As someone who bought into it pretty early in Early Access, I perceived a shift in focus from the developers from a exploration-driven, atmospheric survival game to a more plot-driven affair. This led to a lot of of the story stuff later on in the game feeling out of place for me, and the game's 1.0 version ultimately disappointing me. I still stand by the opinion that the beginning parts of the game were the best parts, as the most effort went into those early biomes. In later areas of the game, the wildlife, plants, and general design felt more artificial and mundane in comparison. \n\nI knew going into it that Below Zero had seemingly fully committed itself to the story elements of the first, but I was fine with that. Instead of a game where it felt like the developers changed their minds halfway through development, this title would be fully focused on plot---overall leading to a more coherent and polished experience. And in many Subnautica Below Zero is exactly that, for most of the plot and gameplay flow rather seamlessly. But unfortunately, issues start to arise towards the end with an anti-climatic finale, plot points that started as important but were demoted to side-plots by the end, and an overall lack of character in the main character. Who unlike the first game, is now a speaking role. Something I don't have a problem with, but with how the game is in its current state I think they easily could've done without and put that effort elsewhere.\n\nAnd the environments also feel lacking throughout the entire game. Never did I see the imagination pumped into every biome in the first title, here most of the map is covered in a homogeneous arctic and even the underwater sections are underwhelming. The creatures either aimlessly float the waters or make pitiful attacks to harm you in some way. Unlike the first game where many of the sea monsters were powerful and daunting, nothing here captures that feeling again, at least, not after your first couple of encounters.\n\nI'm willing to accept that some of these complaints arise since I played the first game before this, and as such I'm already familiar with the gameplay design and formula present here. But even then, I think there are major downgrades in the overall experience and also, the vast majority of people playing this game would have played the first. \n\nBelow Zero is not a bad game, and you should 100% still play it.

It's got way over a [b]thousand[/b] comments now, and people keep bickering there every single day:\n\n[i]'Below Zero sucks! I hate it, it makes my blood boil!'[/i]\n[i]'No, ya dimbo, it's great! I loved every second of it!'[/i]\n...ad infinitum.\n\nDespite the fact that a full year has elapsed since the game's release, neither the defence nor the prosecution have been able to make their closing arguments, 'rest their cases' and just go home. The smouldering embers of this dumpster fire just refuse to die, and I believe you can already draw some important conclusions based on that fact alone. People feel strongly about this game and the franchise in general.\n\nI am one of those who loved Below Zero despite its shortcomings, but I will make an effort to remain impartial and unbiased in this review and explain both sides of the story. If you don't like going in blind with your entertainment purchases, stay awhile and I promise you'll come out the other side much better equipped to make a well-informed decision.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2796283190\n\ud83d\udc0b The most resounding complaint, the overarching theme of all disparaging comments is the fact that the main heroine... [i]talks.[/i] The mute, expressionless dummy we controlled in the original installment is now replaced by Robin \u2013 a female researcher who is practically never at a loss for words. Some players attach significant importance to the atmosphere of utter loneliness and helplessness that was present in the previous game; for them, this atmosphere [i]is[/i] Subnautica. If you share this point of view, you're in for a nasty surprise \u2013 not only does Robin talk, but she's also not the only human being around. \n\nTo be honest, I didn't mind the vocal protagonist and additional characters one bit \u2013 [i]on the contrary,[/i] I enjoyed the unusual flavour it gave to already familiar game mechanics. It felt fresh and I'm glad the devs decided against doing more of the same and in favour of being bold and creative. The lonely and helpless feel of the first game was born from the [b]absence[/b] of things \u2013 absence of ideas, absence of characters, absence of interactions; the product of natural limitations of a small studio, and barely the pinnacle of game design. \n\n\ud83d\udc21 The voiced heroine is not the only groundbreaking change, however. Anyone who's played the first part remembers that there were some land sections \u2013 a couple of small islands, if you don't count the Aurora. In Below Zero, land sections make a return, but now they're beefed up on steroids and occupy nearly 50% of the entire map \u2013 but we're still playing Sub[u]nautica,[/u] right?.. \n\nWhen on land, your body temperature drops at an alarming rate; thankfully, there is a variety of ways to keep it at optimal levels \u2013 the one you'll be using most often is jumping back into the freezing arctic water. \n\nSure. Makes sense\ud83e\udd14\n\n\ud83d\udc1f When not exploring snow-covered plains and mountain tops, you'll find that most ocean biomes are pretty crammed, with the majority of them being caves, ravines and twisting narrow passages of different kinds. I find that to be a pretty clever design choice; in the previous game, if you badly needed oxygen and safety, you could just... [i]go up.[/i] Here, directly up oftentimes leads nowhere, and the feeling of claustrophobia suddenly locks you in its wet, sickening embrace \u2013 especially if you have 10 seconds of oxygen left. To compensate for that, there are now oxygen plants sprinkled here and there throughout the dark depths, and you'll be frantically looking for them, praying to see that welcoming green glow around the next bend. This adds a whole other layer of emotional intensity that the original simply didn't have. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800073898\n\ud83d\udc20 Many players complain that this iteration of the series is guilty of 'handholding' you and does so in an annoying, obtrusive way; how I wish that was true! From the very beginning, you can go pretty much anywhere, but the story in Below Zero is presented in such a way that there is only one 'correct' path you may take that will allow all the little bits and pieces of the main plot you gather along the way to make sense. Unfortunately, I wasn't so lucky and didn't do things the 'intended' way; very often me and my partner were scratching our heads, completely stumped as to what the heck we were supposed to do next, and we had no such issues with the first game. The writing is sometimes sloppy and at odds with the story of the original. All that is one of the [b]two[/b] reasons I couldn't give Below Zero the \ud83d\ude0d rating.\n\n\ud83d\udc2c The second one is the omnipresence of bugs and glitches, especially if you're brave (or stupid) enough to build your base on land. Things will constantly break for no reason at all; floating staircases, disappearing vehicles, the whole shebang. This is nothing new, as the first Subnautica also had similar problems, but this time the issues are pretty glaring and I have no idea how the devs missed them. \n\n\ud83d\udc1a On a more positive note, if there is truly something to pat Unknown Worlds Entertainment on the back about, that will be all the clever ideas they introduced in Below Zero; I couldn't help but say [i]'Oh, so now we have THIS!'[/i] nearly every time I sat down to play the game. One example of that would be the jukebox; you can now listen to music in your base and in your main vehicle as you explore the neverending cave systems, and every single song absolutely [i]slaps.[/i] They tried to include as many genres as possible; there are [b][url=https://youtu.be/E87WYWs4xZU?t=62]beautiful, unexpectedly emotional songs[/url][/b] that make exploration feel much more immersive than it was in the first game, and there is also... okay, sit down if you're standing \u2013 there is [i]Subnautica rap.[/i] This stuff starts at unbearable levels of cheese and comes full circle to being simply [b][url=https://youtu.be/RBdm83TdkeM?t=39]genius[/url][/b]. Never been a fan of rap music, but I appreciate the level of creativity that went into writing these lyrics. Overall, the presence of the jukebox spells death to the rather primitive (in my opinion) 'lonely and helpless' atmosphere and proclaims the beginning of a new, multi-layered kind of fun you've never felt in Subnautica before. \n\nOh, almost forgot \u2013 you can add your own songs, and it's really simple. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2802309020\n\ud83d\udc19 All right \u2013 time to wrap this one up. For me, Below Zero was able to reignite the spark, returning the wonderful feeling of being lost in an unfamiliar world. I played the original for well over 100 hours, completed it several times with and without mods, and the excitement naturally dwindled; I knew what to expect, what to do, and where to go. Below Zero combined relative familiarity with core gameplay mechanics and a completely different environment; even though it made some mistakes along the way, it accomplished the main goal \u2013  allowing me to go on a brand new adventure once again, and for that I'm thankful.\n\n\ud83e\udd88 P.S. Some particularly nasty individuals can't stop going on about this game being 'woke' because it's got a couple of gay characters and a black female as a protagonist; if you get your panties in a bunch because you see 'propaganda' in a game where someone's sexual orientation is casually mentioned [i]once,[/i] then get on yer little soapbox and speak of your petty frustrations to the world \u2013 whatever, everyone is entitled to have an opinion.

For the past 20 or so hours of playing the game the always recurring question I asked, knowing I would write this, was \u201cwould I really recommend this game?\u201d The answer, ultimately, is no.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a bad game. I even would say it is a good game, but is it worth playing? Is it something I would say \u201cyes, go play it\u201d? And the answer is no.\n\nThe most charitable I can be with this game, after the amazing experience that was Subnautica (1), is that the Developer does not understand why Subnautica was the amazing experience that it is.\nI went in, expecting an experience similar to my Subnautica experience and measured against that experience this game falls short. If you never played Subnautica\u2026 if Subnautica didn\u2019t exist, then yes this game deserves to be played. But Subnautica exists.\n\nFrom the Getgo this game fails where Subnautica succeeded. Subnautica immersed me. Made me feel like I crashed on an Alien Planet. It gave me this feeling of \u201cdamn this is amazing\u201d from the get go. Below Zero never did.\n\nBelow Zero crashes you onto the planet and even in this very first scene of the game the difference is clear. Subnautica made me feel like \u201coh shit, i am F-ed\u201d. Below Zero never gave me that feeling. I watched a sequence I struggled to understand, as my character waved a PDA around, which I can only assume were the controls (not not attached to anything). And I crashed to the planet, got dropped to the ground in a meteor shower, while being told to seek shelter. It was clearly scripted and I never felt in danger. Subnautica I had this feeling or urgency. I remember how I struggled to douse the flames and scrambled to save my lifepod. Here? Your ship crashes and you are told to go to your safe harbor. I didn\u2019t spare my crashed ship any mind, until 10 or so hours later, when in an idle fit of fancy i thought \u201cmaybe i should check if there is something back there?\u201d\n\nBelow Zero continues in this fashion, the experience ultimately unimportant and undermining itself. There is a relatively harmless predator that makes so much noise that I never had the \u201cdamn, what was that?\u201d panicked feeling i had in Subnautica Proper, when some rare thing sounded off in the deep dark.\n\nThe biome transition is also terrible. Not a gradual change but more like a curtain drop. You swim from bright sunlit waters into a darkened area and it feels like someone turned off the light for no reason. Swim a meter back and it's a bright sunny day again.\n\nIt has pretty biomes, but that is about it. It's not an alien world. There are even Predators that are so horribly scripted they ignore other Fauna. You are told to be weary of this iceworm and man the PDAs set this thing up so amazingly. And then I entered its territory and see other creatures running around and I was like \u201coh I should be safe, if they are here\u201d... nope. Scripted predator is scripted to ignore everything but the player. The first Subnautica made me feel like I was on an alien planet, exploring said planet and trying to survive. Below Zero is a video game. A good, competent video game, but a video game. Not the immersive experience Subnautica was and that is why I will never recommend this game. It is not a worthy sequel.\n\nIt is competent. I played through the story and it was fine. It\u2019s nothing special. Nothing you need to experience or would miss if you hadn\u2019t experienced it.\n\nI do hope for the next one.

I love [i]the hell[/i] out of Subnautica. [/b]\n\nBut as I wrapped up my final session of Subnautica: Below Zero and watched the credits, I just didn't feel like it gave anywhere near the same energy and thrill the original game did. I've read many reviews saying that while it wasn't as good as the original game, it was still good. And for the first few hours, I'd agree with that statement. But progressing through and putting more time in, it felt like an entirely different [i]game[/i].\n\nLet's start with the land exploration. The original Subnautica had a bit of exploration out of the sea - it was a  nice change of scenery from the underwater portions, but a miniscule part of the player's overall journey. Below Zero implements its 'temperature' mechanic this way. Being on land will tick away at a temperature gauge, and if it drops to zero, you die of hypothermia. It's understandable to have a mechanic related to heat in this game, but here's the kicker - there's A LOT of land to traverse. I have some qualms about the temperature mechanic itself but what's so irritating is that the land segments seem to overstay their welcome long before you're finished with them. If you built the Prawn Suit for these sections, you're all good, these segments can be traversed without much worry of temperature or injury. But if you're a player like me and traverse these areas without one, the cracks begin to show in the land-based traversal. Your character gets hung up on multiple things, whether they be tiny ankle-high obstacles, scattered materials, or perhaps most confounding, elevation changes. I found myself on multiple occasions leaping around trying to find the spot that would allow me to progress, and this was especially frustrating when I was simply trying to climb a snowy hill or walk towards a vent to warm myself back up. This is interspersed with multiple PDA warnings that hazard 'dangerous weather' and to 'seek shelter'. Thing is, dangerous weather almost seems to be the standard - I'd hear one of these warnings every few minutes when navigating on foot and it made it irritating to navigate the areas where shelter wasn't an option or I'd just left a safe space, although the weather changes themselves didn't seem to alter much. Walking isn't this game's strong suit and as I navigated these areas I found myself desperately wishing to be back in the water.\n\nAnd while I thrived in Below Zero's initial routine, I found that being in the water here wasn't what it was in the past. Environments seem to have no semblance of connecting with one another - I navigated from a lush green environment full of seaweed and fish to a barren landscape devoid of life, then continued on to find [i]another[/i] flourishing landscape full of lilypads and moss. It's even worse in the late-game areas - what awaits you below are long mazes cramped full of environmental hazards that damage vehicles and lend no semblance of where you are going. Getting lost almost seemed to be part of the game at this point - there are multiple areas that appear to be ways to climb upwards or descend downwards that instead lead the player into a dent in the landscape instead of a tunnel. Why make navigating these areas so irritating to accomplish and so dull to be in when the endgame areas from the last game [spoiler]like the Lost River and the Lava Zone[/spoiler] were so thrilling to find and explore?\n\nThis frustration is compounded by one creature[spoiler]- the Shadow Leviathan[/spoiler]. These pricks are found weaving through the tight narrow areas deep under the water's surface, and they take every opportunity to engage the player. Once it makes visual contact, it lets out a roar and weaving and diving through the environment or trying to find a hiding spot is useless at that point - it will find you and it will engage you. They lock you in a grapple animation if you're in a vehicle, and you have to tediously wait as it takes its time munching on whatever you're piloting until it gets bored and spits it out in an entirely random direction. What's worse, by the time you repair your vehicle or heal up and point towards the direction you were initially headed, you could very well get spotted and have to go through the same process all over again. I spent 30 minutes and 2 batteries on an endzone run making my way to where I needed to go between repairing my Seatruck and moving a few feet before it stuck me into yet another attack animation. Remember the Reaper Leviathan animation from the first game? It was horrifying, specifically [i]because[/i] I remember it locking my Seamoth in its maw. From what I recall this happened only once to me but it established it as a major threat, and even though it never happened again I knew to steer clear of the Reapers. And the other threats, like the Ghost Leviathans, had no animations that I experienced at all - they'd glide by you mouth agape and deal their damage in passing, establishing them as dangerous without having to push the concept in your face. Instead, this creature comes out annoying and tedious to deal with after 10 minutes in the landscape they occupy because you can expect to get grappled frequently - AND THEY'RE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID. The fact that this enemy takes so much time away from the player and insists on being so aggressive pulls a lot of the wonder away from exploring the late-game environments since the longer you spend down there the better chance you have of getting attacked again.\n\nI couldn't complete a review without bringing up the game's lack of direction, either. When you start, the game highlights a few areas of importance and... that's basically it, that's all the guidance you get. From a few highlighted areas on your map, you have to navigate without so much as a map to help guide you to where you're supposed to be going. I don't need handholding, I managed to get through the original game just fine, but in some of the objectives [spoiler]like finding Al-An's body pieces[/spoiler] you are given such little direction on where to go you may not know how to progress. I resorted to using a light walkthrough with little guiding hints instead of outright step-by-step directions and I cannot emphasize how much it made the experience more enjoyable simply because it finally felt like I knew what I was doing again. But that job shouldn't fall on fans - if the game is done right, a walkthrough shouldn't be needed at all.\n\nThere are so many other things I could comment on - the reduced vehicle count (the Cyclops and Seamoth are removed, replaced with the Seatruck), the multiple useless blueprints (the pathfinder tool, the repulsion cannon, the thumper and multiple vehicle upgrades all felt like more trouble than they were worth investing in), stockpiling of materials that meant nothing (I had over 10 ion cubes stored in my locker since I found only one blueprint that utilized them in any meaningful way), lack of direction on where to find different materials (I didn't know where to find root pustules, for example), one of the late-game materials being nigh-invisible compared to the rest of the environment... (looking at you, Nickel - and yes, I used the mineral detector) I won't deny that I had fun playing Subnautica: Below Zero, but I would be doing a disservice if I didn't also say that by the very end I was also dying in frustration to complete the game and finish it so I could uninstall it. If you're looking for more Subnautica, I recommend modding the original with content the fans have released instead of trying to relive it playing this, as by the end all I could feel was relief that I could finally stop exploring this game centered on the concept of exploration.", "timestamp_created": 1685999054, "timestamp_updated": 1685999054, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 130, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852615058422088623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92013933": {"recommendationid": "92013933", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996982753", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3193, "last_played": 1621311757}, "language": "english", "review": "Is Below Zero as good as the first game?

The game gives you two, count them, [i]two[/i] waypoints that are explicit \u201cGo here next\u201d waypoints.  One is for the Delta Station, which you only get when you explore in the right direction and the second is given to you after an event at Delta station, and points at [i]several[/i] points of interest, not just one.  Other than that, there is a waypoint for another Alterra base, but you only get that one when you [i]very[/i] close to the base and one for a supply cache that contains nutrient blocks / water (mostly serves to give you a free beacon / beacon blueprint).  Finally, there are a number (5? 6?) beacons that are added over time that point you at \u201cAlien Artifacts\u201d, but these serve the same purpose as the lifepod beacons did in the first game \u2013 to point you at new biomes.  There are [i]many[/i] more alien artifacts that never get beacons (so you have to explore to find them) and while you get a map for the Alterra facilities on the planet fairly early on, [i]your[/i] location doesn\u2019t show on the map, so following it is\u2026  Difficult.  Not impossible, by any means, but its also something that could be ignored altogether very easily as its just a PDA entry.  The exploration in this game is on par with the prior game, in my book.\n[*]\u201dThe game is \u2018woke\u2019 \u2013 political correctness run amok!\u201d  First, indisputably \u201cUnknown Worlds Entertainment\u201d [i]is[/i] a highly progressive developer and has made the (gamer) news for firing someone over a tweet.  However, in my mind, this is irrelevant \u2013 the question at hand is [i]this game[/i] \u201cwoke\u201d \u2013 and the answer is no, in my opinion.  The protagonists is fixed as a non-white female, but the first game had a fixed white male protagonist, so\u2026  The PDA voice has a distinctively Indian accent while the first game had a generic \u201cAmerican\u201d accent, but\u2026  So?  Two, maybe three, PDAs reference a lesbian relationship, but\u2026  So?  Finally, Alterra is portrayed as a generic \u201cevil, greedy corperation\u201d, but that was in the first game, so\u2026  The game isn\u2019t preachy at all \u2013 all of the above are just treated as part of the world, not praiseworthy or unusual in any way.  I didn\u2019t note any soapboxing going on, so\u2026  I consider this false, but use your own judgement.\n[*]\u201dThe story is awful!\u201d  Ehhhh\u2026 This is an exaggeration, in my mind \u2013 my response to the story is best summarized as \u201cmeh\u201d.  It served the purpose of putting some structure and goal to drive exploration and that\u2019s about it.  In comparison to the first game, this is indeed awful \u2013 but in comparison to other survival / exploration games its about par on the course.  Imagine the first game if you stripped out all references to sentient aliens, but left everything else intact (the PDAs, the lifepods, the resources, and so forth).  In my opinion, the story in this game is on that level.\n[*]\u201dThe sense of discovery is gone \u2013 its too easy!\u201d  True, but (in my opinion) unavoidable.  While there are many new biomes to explore and they are all visually very appealing, you are very likely to find 80% of the blueprints in the game in the first 5 hours, and very likely [i]all[/i] the blueprints that you really need.  In particular, the Seaglide and Seatruck (replacement for the Seamoth) are all but force fed to you and as soon as you visit an Alterra base you\u2019ll get all the base building components that you need handed to you in one swell swoop.  But\u2026  The simple fact is that the vast majority of players of this game will have played the first one, and you simply can\u2019t recapture the excitement of building your first Seamoth / Seaglide / PRAWN suit / Cyclops.  However, the game doesn\u2019t even try, and that bothers some people.  The developers clearly intended this game to be something of a \u201cmasterwork\u201d version of Subnautica, intended to allow players to demonstrate their mastery of the game mechanics introduced in the first game, and on that level it succeeds.  But, inarguably, the sense of discovery is much reduced.\n[*]\u201dIts too short \u2013 you can finish it in 10 (or 5) hours\u201d  False, at least in my case \u2013 my first blind playthrough took ~30 hours to complete.  I think a large part of this is people who have played through the game in Early Access over the course of [i]two years[/i] forgetting that things that seems blantly obvious to them aren\u2019t obvious to blind players, even ones familiar with the first game.  Finding the ingredients for synthetic fibers (required for the Mark II depth module upgrades), for example, is trivial if you know where to go, but highly challenging otherwise, as is finding magnetite (needed for the scanner room range and HUD upgrades).  Finding the Alterra bases, even using the provided map as reference is challenging as well.  Based on my experience, I\u2019d expect fully blind playthroughs to take between 15 \u2013 40 hours, with luck being as important as anything else in determining total playtime.  It is definitely shorter than the first one, but lots of the time players spend in the first game is simply travelling \u201cback to base\u201d and / or \u201cbuilding a new base so you don\u2019t have to travel so far back to base\u201d.  The Lost River (and later biomes) [i]really[/i] add lots of travel time without actually adding much in the way of gameplay (in my opinion).\n[*]\u201dThe map is too small\u201d  Indisputably true \u2013 the map is much smaller.  But it is much [i]deeer[/i], in the sense that most biomes contain two distinct biomes (surface and deep) and some contain three (surface / deep / [i]really[/i] deep).  This is something that was only present in a few locations in the first game \u2013 the \u201cGrand Reef\u201d and \u201cDeep Grand Reef\u201d is the only example that comes to mind off hand.  The upshot is that you get a similar sense of exploration but with much less travel time to return to base \u2013 not a bad thing, in my opinion.[/list]\nTL;DR:  Not as good as the first game, but still worth a buy if you liked the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1621043832, "timestamp_updated": 1621043832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 482, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852520108222961426", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100874598": {"recommendationid": "100874598", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967244540", "num_games_owned": 566, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 1194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1194, "last_played": 1625468572}, "language": "english", "review": "It's okay.\n\nSadly it feels like a large step down from the original Subnautica, so if you're considering one or the other, just buy the original.

This game started out as DLC and that scope is reflected in the final product: lots of interesting new areas and creatures, but it is smaller and the land portion could have been ditched (not even replaced) without losing much. The story is good, but know that the larger cast (including NPCs!) gives a much different vibe than the lost-isolationist atmosphere that was a core part of the original.\n\nWhether you, a fan of the original, should get this largely boils down to if the player-against-the-world feeling of the first was the main reason you loved it or not. If it was, this might disappoint and you should wait for a discount. If not--or if you even hated the relative silence--then you'll get great enjoyment out of this.\n\n[h1]Thawing Out[/h1]\nI feel it's important to address the story immediately. The planet, the general mechanics, and most items are carry-overs from [i]Subnautica[/i], so the largest changes are the story and the environments. [i]Subnautica[/i] was an astounding game for these two reasons: the story there was largely optional, told through PDAs and delayed broadcasts, making it largely about the player surviving and trying to figure out how to leave. Each new biome you discovered was an absolute treat, from the features to the caverns to the critters (and those PDAs/broadcasts were helpful in guiding the player towards new areas.) \n\n[quote=warning]Oh, right, if you haven't already had it drilled into your head: the best experience for both this and the original is playing as blind as you possibly can. I avoid spoilers in this review but you're still better off reading only the tl;dr and skipping the rest of this review if you think you'll play it.[/quote]\n\nFor [i]Below Zero[/i] the story is both better and worse. There are actually two main stories here, which intersect but never really intertwine. It's possible to beat the game without seeing one story out, and possible to complete that story without beginning the ending-critical one. They have good beats and interesting characters, but the interactions you'll have as protagonist Robin Ayou gives a very different focus than the lone-survivor aspect of [i]Subnautica[/i]. The low-key dread is gone, and to fill its place there are discussions about humans and flavor voice logs between people who are no longer around. Even without her eventual companion and the one other NPC, Robin is rather chatty and the very early game has her talking to herself in order to prompt the player about what to do next. While I liked the story and dialog, this hand-holding felt annoying (especially considering my time spent in [i]Subnautica[/i]). Thankfully, it doesn't last too long and for players who want to skip the later dialog most of it seems to be \"optional\". \n\nAll environments in the game are new; the two exceptions would be a handful of smaller plants returning plus an equivalent to the Creepvine forest (though that still has unique changes). Many are just as beautifully crafted and awe-inspiring as the original... but there are fewer of them, and no in-game reason to return to half of them after an initial visit. A very large chunk of the playable area is taken up by an ice shelf, and about 20% of game time takes place on this. It's an obvious answer to \"where do we go from a game that's largely underwater\", but the entire shelf could have been cut with little loss. The leviathan-type creature that's there is simply annoying and the intended main method of traversal--the Snowfox--is difficult to control (and you get thrown from it whenever that creature appears, regardless of how close.) Despite being so huge, the biome variety is incredibly disappointing and it's quite easy to get lost. A few other biomes also feel like vast nothingness; the deepest two biomes, while initially astounding, completely lack internal variety except the one plot-point each that they contain.\n\nAll large creatures are new, with only some of the \"cannon fodder\" fish appearing in this side-quel. If you've played [i]Subnautica[/i] you already know how to use (and even mostly craft) 85% the tools and items you'll be using in the game. A great addition for those who love building bases is the \"Large Room\", where interior walls can be placed to section off rooms as desired.  For on the go, the only vehicle to carry over is my beloved PRAWN; the other two options are replaced by a modular Sea Truck. With sufficient modules, the Sea Truck makes a great home-away-from-home; it's an excellent addition despite some minor quibbles. Sadly I found the PRAWN less useful this time around; not that the functionality has changed, just that the scenarios that made it a go-to option in [i]Subnautica[/i] don't really apply here.\n\nBecause it's built on largely the same engine, [i]Below Zero[/i] has benefited from better execution: Even on my aging PC I experienced very little pop-in and the few bugs were annoying rather than game-breaking. There are still many areas where Robin will slide in because collision is too tight on some objects (such as rock piles) but I never got stuck in one like I did a few times in [i]Subnautica[/i]. The original game took me about 30 hours to complete and [i]Below Zero[/i] 25 hours, which included unnecessary sight-seeing (and wasting two hours right before the end of the game constructing a base that almost immediately became pointless.)\n\nI greatly enjoyed my time in [i]Below Zero[/i] and recommend it to both fans of the original and new-comers while I do believe it is overshadowed by the base game. (Making this more \"sub\" and less \"nautica\", I suppose.)  I bought the EA at release for a cheaper price but I would have felt fine paying the current $30 MSPR; seeing as how the base game is the same cost, though, I can't fault someone for waiting on a discount before diving into [i]Below Zero[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1625450563, "timestamp_updated": 1625450563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850736856460571289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87676581": {"recommendationid": "87676581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264731291", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1615176915}, "language": "english", "review": "Not exactly a bad game, but a pretty big step down from the first one.\n\nApart from all the other issues others have pointed out, this game simply does not offer the same sense of wonder and terror the first game have.

Here's what I think...\nGood: I really love the way they were able to remake the magical feel and preserve the beauty in the game like they did in the first game. Don't expect much as it's still in early access but for what it has brought out so far, really good quality. The sound design and voice acting is pretty well done too. Really great how they also didn't just reuse assets and creatures to just add into the game but also bringing some others back in a subtle way. I think the story they have planned and what's in the game right now has some good potential to be just as great as the original game's story but there's still room for development. Really curious though what they mean when they said the next update will change the story in a big way. I hope they don't start a new one. The characters in the game are starting to grow on me.\n\nBad: Not much except for some poor quality animations. There are a lot of bugs in some of the animations and actions but I believe they can be fixed. One of the vehicles has a somewhat broken camera and can be a little overpowered as it allows a better view of the world by ignoring lighting or acting like an x ray sometimes. Still don't know if it's intentional though as it's still in the game ever since the Sea Truck update came out. I don't really like the change in voice actors. I liked the younger, more playful-sounding Robin when the game first came out. The new voice doesn't fit her character well. The story I believe can use more development and have a more clear direction of what must happen first before anything else can happen. There are too many times when I don't really know for sure if this is the direction or event I should be going or triggering and if I messed up the order of the plot. The game also, I feel, has less ocean in the game (if that makes sense) than the first. I know it's early access but I hope they don't add too much game play where land is the main or majority location I have to be in. Subnautica was always a great game to me because it made the Ocean seem so beautiful and the things they created in the ocean were so majestic and filled with wonder. They can add land portions but I hope they also add more ocean in the game and I even hope you can go even deeper than in the first game (that might be asking for too much though). Another problem with that is that the movement on land is very wonky. It never felt that smooth in the first so I'm really worried the  new and additional bits of land game play will ruin the smoothness and will not make the game as enjoyable it should. There are also a lot of incomplete assets and blueprints. Some textures in some biomes also need some polishing and work.\n\nThat's really it.

I have read some complaints that it really isn't survival like the first game because you aren't \"stuck/stranded\" on the planet like the original, and I for one think that is a good thing for 2 reason: it is not a copy-paste/edit of the story of the first game, and the protagonists staying on the planet for more curiosity/scientific reasoning I think adds more, the character, like the player wants to know more about the planet and history.

Also, neither the story animation nor the audio for them seem to work, despite all the fixes I have tried from online sources, and the text that does show up doesn't lead to anything, for example: I get a  message saying I am near the leviathan and to check it out, but there is nothing there but a huge, empty cavern underground.

As of June 4th, 2020. I heard there was a story overhaul so I decided to stream myself going through the game again, and I have to say... It was improved, but not as much as I'd hoped. A lot of my early issues with this game were related to the content added being miserably bad. There was no immersion, no isolation, and it was a pain in the ass to play. I'm going to break this re-review down into story, gameplay, and tone, and we'll see where it gets us.\n\nFirstly, the story. BZ's original release had you living comfy in a base on the surface, with your sister pestering you about random crap. After you fall into the ocean during a storm and can't return to your base, your player character goes \"Nah don't come rescue me I'm good lol\" and you start the game with an ever-present space station orbiting above you and your sister constantly talking to you about needless garbage. In this game, you begin by going AWOL, launching to the planet in secret and crash landing. This is because your sister in this version of the story is dead, and you've come to investigate what happened to her. Already, this is an improvement. You are once again isolated, once again without help. It feels good to have that back, and I enjoy it a lot. Now for some of the issues. In BZ's initial storyline, you were guided to an alien base underwater and got an alien named Alan put in your head. This stays true in the revamped story, at least so far. Here's the issue with this. You now have a specific goal. Make Alan a new body and get him out of your head. While also finding out what happened to your sister, I guess. Maybe I did the events out of order, but nothing's stopping you from putting Alan in your head the SECOND you arrive on the planet. He's not all that hard to find if you just explore a bit, and you don't need any fancy equipment aside from maybe the seaglide. Having a constant voice in your head with a set mission in a game that's supposed to be about isolation and mystery is... A little underwhelming. I don't enjoy it and I wish it wasn't there. Your sister's death is enough of a story hook, I have no idea why the alien-in-my-head plot is still around.\n\nNext, the gameplay. This uses the same engine as Subnautica proper, so it's not all that different. I will say that the game has less pop-in and is all around better optimized, so that's a plus. My issues arise from the land segments. Yes, you get a vehicle to better traverse the land, however not until a decent bit into the story, as the place you find the fragments is pretty far away from where you start. And moving on land is... Clunky. It has never felt good, but thankfully you don't have to do it much in Subnautica. BZ is different, you do it a lot. Another thing I have to critique is the drive for exploration. BZ does give you drive to explore, but giving you an objective the minute you land discourages some of the starting exploration to some degree. It's also just... Dark as hell. Not like, tonally speaking, it's just dark. Nearly every underwater biome is extremely dark and hard to navigate, and it makes it worrying to want to explore more, because you don't have anything protecting you, and you can't see anything around you. I also ran into what I think is a leviathan early on, and unlike the telltale call of a Reaper, I didn't hear a peep from this one, it was just there goofing around in the water about 250 meters from the pod you start in. Having a bunch of dangerous stuff just messing around so close, when every biome feels hard to see in, makes exploring without a vehicle (which I still haven't found) painstaking. There's no \"Ah this is the place I need to go when I get a vehicle\", that's just the entire ocean.\n\nFinally, the tone. This is really the only place I think BZ does great. The roar of an ice worm constantly surrounding you while you're on the surface, a trail of alien lights guiding you deeper and deeper down, the beautifully crafted aesthetic of each biome... It's done incredibly well. Below Zero, for all its faults, is truly a gorgeous game with an air of mystery that I drank up with ease. My only real issue is that it gets somewhat samey, and the above ground segments are somewhat lacking due to being, well, above ground. Thankfully various caves and abandoned bases do add content, but honestly BZ's insistence on land exploration feels sort of off to me.\n\nIn conclusion: Do I think this is a good game? It's hard to say. In its current state? No, not really. I think it's a bit of a mess story-wise, its biomes are way too hard to navigate safely or confidently without a vehicle, which again, I still haven't found, and despite its gorgeous landscapes, I hardly want to go explore any of them because it's all so damned dark. So, do I recommend Subnautica: Below Zero? Have I changed my mind? No, no I have not. In its current state, I don't recommend it. Whether or not they fix their issues is up for debate, and personally I wouldn't put my faith in a game that had to have its entire story overhauled, and still has some of the same issues in said story from before. Wait for the game to be finished, and then check some reviews once it is.

The overly-abundant land sections were another.  \n\nIt's called SUBNAUTICA FFS.  Sub = beneath; Nautica = water.   I have 10 (better-made) on-land survival games in my Library.  I have **one** incredible underwater survival game.  I wanted two.  I got one-and-a-half. \n\nAn in-depth review would be 10 pages long and delve into the trials and tribulations of an early access development process handicapped by a global pandemic, a change in dev-team leadership, a change in Sound Designer, and a change in Lead Writer halfway through the development process (what a nightmare for the new writer! Here's a half-finished story we never liked (for some reason) - rewrite it using all the assets we've already created for the game - except the really exciting ones - which we're throwing in the trash). :facepalm:\n\nPersonally I can't help but factor in all the stuff I saw in early access (including some incredible set-pieces and cinematics - but also some frankly bizarre, slightly-unhinged writing from Subnautica's writer Tom Jubert).  \n\nThat said, [b]I think new players (including Subnautica players) will enjoy the game[/b]. \n\nMy initial feedback during early access reflected my doubts about whether Tom Jubert could pull this all together but now I think my doubts were misplaced.  Now I think the devs should have trusted Tom to pull it together and churn out yet another masterpiece of subtle philosophy mixed with mystery and wonder.\n\nDid Jill Murray (the new writer) ever play The Talos Principle?  IMHO Tom's writing in that game was his first game-writing masterpiece - and I'm sure it was why Subnautica's Lead Dev Charlie Cleveland wanted to hire him.  Jill could learn a lot from playing that game.   \n\nCompared to the first iteration this story is just flat-out boring.  The \"philosophy\" is childishly rammed down our throats and the wonder and mystery of the first game are practically non-existent. \n\n[b]The graphics are great - the game runs great - it sounds very good.  The characters and storywriting are just...meh.

ARE ... YOU?!?\" still gives me chills) I think it would have been better.\n\nAnd if a global pandemic hadn't thrown a huge wrench into the works in the middle of the game's development, I think it would have been better.\n\nIt's a good game - but it's no Subnautica.", "timestamp_created": 1621392392, "timestamp_updated": 1621394370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 346, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839021980762481689", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85126730": {"recommendationid": "85126730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064772769", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2447, "last_played": 1657999619}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a big fan of the original subnautica, I count it as one of my top 10 games of all time. When I found out there was going to be a sequel I was excited beyond belief, more subnautica! Unfortunately this game fell short of my expectations. I was going to wait to review it until the final release, but since the devs have stated the story is fully voiced, they are unlikely to change it at this point, just finish adding in the rest of the story they had planned.\n\nThis sequel falls incredibly short of the mark for a lot of reasons. The main reason being that it just does not live up to the storytelling of the first game. The original subnautica was a master class on how to tell immersive and engaging story. The story just exists in the game and it's up to you to find the snippets of story and progress. You're thrown into a world that you don't know completely alone with only one objective: survive.\n\nThe sequel takes that lesson, decides that engaging and immersive story simply isn't fun, and instead replaces it with a series of glorified fetch quests that place waypoints for you to swim to directly. There's no mystery, the main mystery is explained to you before you even start playing the game and then re-explained 5 or 6 times as if it's new information. I was expecting there to be more lore and interesting gameplay around the fetch quests, but there simply isn't. They're just \"swim here, scan thing\".\n\nThe zones are underwhelming and have completely lost the feel that the original game had. They're pretty and interesting for the first few minutes, but they fail to be engaging and offer resistance to the player. From the start of the game you can swim pretty much anywhere in the map with no fear at all. Few creatures are aggressive, and the ones who do come after you are so slow and dumb that they're not a threat at all. leviathans will not one shot you, nothing is lurking in the darkness to spook you. In my latest playthrough I think I only died once to a creature, and it was more of an annoyance than anything. The map feels small and there is a distinct lack of deep zones.\n\nThe vehicles provided to you are also somewhat lackluster, there is no cyclops, only the prawn suit and the seatruck which serves as the replacement for both the seamoth and the cyclops. There is essentially no reason to build out a sea truck as you will never be on extended gathering trips, everything is at the immediate surface. The seatruck is in my opinion less interesting and less fun than the cyclops, it serves as less of a mobile base and more just a vehicle. Additionally there is actually no reason to ever build a prawn suit, as the deepest point in the game can be reached by your seatruck.\n\nOverall, the game is not bad, just incredibly disappointing. If you're a fan of subnautica looking for more spooky ocean game, look elsewhere. I am a bit sad at what could've been when we got this game instead.

There is no epic endgame vehicle like the Cyclops, instead you get the much more compact Seatruck which is basically a Seamoth that can be upgraded to act as a mobile base. The hoverbike looks cool, but it's so fragile that you're better off just stomping around the land areas in the good old Prawn suit, which returns mostly unchanged.

However I think the game will eventually be better than the first one. EDIT: It isn't.\n\nFirst, the negatives. The new resource system is whack, instead of getting a chance at two different resources from a shale, sandstone, or limestone outcrop, you now find mineral deposits. Gold deposits give you titanium very frequently, despite being a GOLD deposit? It's nitpicky but if it ain't broke don't fix it. A lot of people are complaining about the fact there is now a voice-acted main character and an already established sense of security. I can definitely see why those are negatives, most players fell in love with the sense of being alone and out of place in the first game. You feel like there is no way to escape in Subnautica. In Subnautica: Below Zero, you are literally offered the chance to leave in the first 10 minutes but your character declines, the only reason this bothers me is that it is obvious her choice was made so that the game could continue. No sane person would choose to remain. I think removing this line would please a lot of people wanting to feel more isolated like the first game. Taking out the ability for your sister to help you at all would make me happy. The game also tells you what to do... a lot. The first game was a bit confusing at first because there was little direct guidance to the locations that progressed the story. This made it feel so much more impactful when you stumbled across an alien structure. I remember when I first found the Degasi mountain base and saw cave crawlers, it amazed me that there were humans before me on the planet, because I had no idea, nobody told me. I think that the experience gets a little watered down when you have somebody marking the locations of everything important and telling you to go there.\n\nSecond, my suggestions. What I would like to see in this game is a lot more basebuilding pieces when the game is released. I loved building cozy bases in the first game but there weren't many options for decor and rooms. I am the opposite of a thalassophobe and love feeling like my underwater base is my home. I would like to see lots of new creatures, new scary fish and leviathans, and new scary biomes like the Lost River. So far I haven't found anything as scary as the biomes and creatures from the first game. I would LOVE if the devs made good use of the voice acting and made the main character express terror when you enter the creepier biomes (hopefully to come) and encounter huge predators. It takes you out of the \"I'm gonna die here\" feeling when she is absent of any fear.\n\n Of course I know there is much to be added, and I am only including this sentence so nobody comments \"it's early access there's a lot to be done\". Most of my suggestions are things I hope show up in the final release, I'm not saying I expect more content out of a 7 month old early access game.\n\nEDIT: So now the game is released and looks like my points still stand. The story is even worse than it was in early access, and others have written better reviews than mine highlighting issues I did not think of since release. Though the story didn't have much hope to begin with since they replaced the \"figure it out yourself\" writing style that made the last game so great with some failed attempt at an \"emotional/epic thriller\" type story in this game that is meh at best. This game tries to be too different from the original, if you want to make a game that different it might as well not be released under the same series as the last game. Stupid changes have been made for no reason. The PDA voice actress is different from the last one, they replaced the original halfway through development with an Indian woman, for no reason other than maybe \"diversity\", the original voice was just the right amount of soulless computer/creepy feeling but the new one is just downright goofy. Going off the first game, this is the LAST series where stupid changes like that needed to be made, nobody asked for them and they just make the game feel THAT much more disconnected from the first game. It's bad enough they took away the main thing that made the first game so great, the ability to put yourself in the protag's shoes with zero handholding whatsoever in terms of story. Everything else is just icing on this turd of a game. This is a bigger fall from grace than EA. It would have been so easy to improve on the first game without gutting everything that made it Subnautica. As another review said \"Below Zero is one of those sequels where the original creator has no idea what people loved so much about their previous work.\" Don't waste your money, buy the first game and hope they don't screw up on their next try. I have a small sliver of hope that if they make another game they will maybe learn their lessons from this trainwreck.\n\nEDIT 2: I also just noticed that in their laziness they ripped off Soma. The underwater Alterra facilities are all denoted by a greek name and symbol just like the underwater Pathos facilities in Soma. Even the whole voice logs thing implying Alterra is a horrible corporation that mistreats employees  and exploring the abandoned research buildings is JUST LIKE Soma and Carthage Industries.", "timestamp_created": 1564476702, "timestamp_updated": 1621406969, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 525, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832273364067077637", "comment_count": 39, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 45116, "total_negative": 4678, "total_reviews": 49794}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwTB23i91+AE": "Mon Apr 22 23:40:19 2024"}}
