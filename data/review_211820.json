it's a 2d survival crafter sandbox set in space, and that's just a winning combo. and there's a LOT of mods, including new playable races, new planets, dungeons, plotlines- the modding scene is flush with good stuff.\n\nbut the journey it took to become that product is deeply, deeply sad. chucklefish screwed over so many artists and programmers. so many people had their passion exploited to make this game, unpaid and uncredited through the years. that's not even touching on how player-made mods were integrated into the base game without compensation, for little more than exposure. and in the end, so much content was stripped from the koala builds that this game is little more than an echo of what it could have been- a barren blank slate of an idea, filled with a half-dozen broken promises and unimplemented concepts. as it is now the game has no replayability and no deviation from a standard cookie cutter storyline.\n\nit makes me really sad, because i really did love this game! rampaging koala was full of intriguing plotlines, weird, dark worlds, and the seeds of a truly interesting idea. and then it just...flattened out. and then the truly heinous practices of chucklefish came to light. now the game has been fully abandoned, with no patch releases for nearly five years as of this review. if it were not for the dedicated players making new content where the devs refuse to, this game would have died in 2021.\n\nas much as i loved this game, as vibrant as the modding scene is and as much joy as it's brought me, i cannot recommend it in good conscience. if you're just coming to this game, then it WAS a promising offering- but it's a shell of its former self. it's unfinished, the devs suck, do not buy.", "timestamp_created": 1709977367, "timestamp_updated": 1709977367, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 187, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893348097801208496", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161280791": {"recommendationid": "161280791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271853603", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 3687, "last_played": 1713279341}, "language": "english", "review": "great game ruined by a terrible company, but nothing modders cant fix", "timestamp_created": 1711217819, "timestamp_updated": 1711217819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 126, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.88402402400970459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159630985": {"recommendationid": "159630985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232023024", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3021, "last_played": 1709387092}, "language": "english", "review": "Space terraria", "timestamp_created": 1709321686, "timestamp_updated": 1709321686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 96, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852048397064208984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157973920": {"recommendationid": "157973920", "author": {"steamid": "76561199117803983", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 83, "playtime_at_review": 7630, "last_played": 1713150154}, "language": "english", "review": "127 hours.\nI found out today that when transferring PC's I had accidentally deleted my main character file in this game. \nWhich is a weird way to start a review, but maybe, it's a chance to reflect on that character, a Novakid named Captain Orio, and I'll let that speak for itself...\nSignificant spoilers ahead:\n\nIn my time as Captain Orio, I have...\n - Made my living as a small farmer\n - Crafted an awesome cowboy hat, which I would wear through the rest of the game\n - Explored the most inhospitable planets the galaxy had to offer, just to say I did it\n - Put together a motley crew, of every species imaginable\n - Become the galaxy's Chosen One, finding and reuniting the heavily guarded artifacts of every species\n - Beat up a mean tentacle planet\n - Created a history museum filled with artifacts from my journeys\n - Become a Space Policeman and rid the galaxy of all manner of criminals\n\nThis game taught me to beat bosses harder than I ever thought I could.

[/h1]\n\n\n[i] \"That's it??\" [/i]\n\nI personally disliked the game's complexity when I first downloaded and launched the game.\nBut as I play through the campaign, pushing back hoards of mobs and enemies, grinding hours acquiring minerals and ores, upgrading my locomotive spaceship(Yes, my 1st character was Novakid, space yeehaw gang wya), fighting my way through The Ruin and eventually defeating it, I felt something.\nIt wasn't happiness or pleasure. Nor was it accomplishment or sadness.\n\nI was... appalled. The whole campaign gave me \"Thank you for playing\" style outro after less than 30 hours of main story gameplay.\n\n\n[i] \"Well, here we go again, I guess.\" [/i]\n\nI joined in Starbound quite late, and was lucky to find out there were more than just exploring and mining things.\nThe Bounty Hunter content was pretty neat, and the final boss fight experience was something I would've never expected to be in this game ever.\nAfter the final boss fight, the overall gameplay is just about the same with the original Starbound endgame content(if you can call it that haha). Searching for clues that may lead to the apprehended, fighting off the sidemen, capturing the boss and send them to space jail, repeat.\nBut something was still missing.\n\n\n[i] \"What else can I do?\" [/i]\n\nI was very young when I first got this game. You could say I was a juvenile who didn't know any better.\nAfter I was done with the campaign, I found out there were nothing else to do unless you get mods for extra contents.\nApparently the developers of Chucklefish had a scandal that eventually lead to the end of future for Starbound.\nI instantly turned the game off and decided to uninstall it. But as soon as my mouse cursor hovered over the [b] [UNINSTALL] [/b] button, I froze.\n\nI thought to myself, 'let's give it one more chance.'\nI logged into my Novakid world and digged out like 100 blocks under my wooden mansion.\nThen I put countless mannequins in there and started dressing them up with leftover clothes sets I had.\nI found out you could do archeological activities, digging out bones from fossils and jigsaw-puzzling them into a whole decorative block. I also found out that there are different weapon archetypes that may fuel my interest for collecting rare items. There were so many things to do beside just mining.\nTenant housing, farming, trading, electrical wiring, catching wild mobs in a p*keball(hi Nintendo), etc.\n\n\n[i] \"I can, and I will do it.\" [/i]\n\nSome of you might not relate to this, but I have not played Terraria. MInecraft? Never gotten a chance to kill an Ender Dragon in my single-player world. My PC is too crappy for any Souls game., so there's that.\nBut Starbound has a special place in my heart. How I felt looking at a working contraption I made after staying awake till 4 am on a summer vacation Tuesday when I was in high school could never be replaced.\nSome of you might say, \"Oh, they are nostalgia-maxxing.\"\nYes I am. Starbound is an old game. And everyone who played this game for at least a hundred hours have been playing for the past 4 years. I know that. \nBut at the same time, Starbound was a game that let me feel that 'Gen Z kid experiencing Notch-era-Minecraft for the first time' again. It wasn't just nostalgia. It reminded me of who I was and what I can be again.\nWhen I was a kid, I used to think about what I should become in future. What I could do to bring people happiness and joy.\nThat kid was lost for a very long time. And Starbound was the first game to help that kid to guide his way back to me.\nThe kid hasn't arrived yet, but I'm sure we'll meet each other soon enough.\n\n\n[i] \"That was it. What's next?\" [/i]\n\nSometimes we get lost in our own mind and world. Not everyone's North Star would be Starbound and neither I think it should be, but each of every one of you has enough luck in your life to find the North Star of your own. \nStarbound was my first ever North Star, I wonder what yours would be?\n\nBut many people are struggling to find how to achieve true success, going \"This is not my way\".\nHey, As the saying goes;\n[b] To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life. [/b]\nNot everything in life have to have meanings. When I boot the game, I often just travel to a random system and see what planets they have. Sitting on a bench I just pulled out of my backpack, enjoying the tunes.\nSit down, catch breath, get a cup of tea and look around you for a second.\nLearning to appreciate small things in life is the very first step to become a happy person.\n\nI wish your Stars in your heart has no Bounds of where they can be.\n\n-Xevet", "timestamp_created": 1712664747, "timestamp_updated": 1712664747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777597486972808838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158455050": {"recommendationid": "158455050", "author": {"steamid": "76561199178030016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 154, "last_played": 1707818182}, "language": "english", "review": "misleading. i was not bound to a star.", "timestamp_created": 1708098440, "timestamp_updated": 1708098440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 61, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738463759422302246", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159227061": {"recommendationid": "159227061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001325221", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1564, "last_played": 1708826458}, "language": "english", "review": "I dunno. It's good if you like decorating I guess.\n\nThere's no real sense of progression. Sure you'll upgrade your armour and weapons and move to a higher tier of environment, but all the enemies, all the tactics and frankly all the environments remain the same from start to finish. At hour 1 you're wandering the surface of a planet, using a spear to stab guys with guns. At hour 2 you're wandering the surface of a \"higher tier\" planet and the guys with guns take more spear stabs, then at hour 3 you have a better spear and the guys with guns take the same number of stabs as they did at hour 1. It's progression of a sort but leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nEverything is easy. But that doesn't make it quick. The whole game feels like one fetch quest after another. Maybe you like the idea of being a bounty hunter at first, but then you realise that the loop is just \"fly to planet > find guy with gun > kill guy with gun (easy) > fly back\" repeated again and again. It doesn't change. There are no hard fights.\n\nToo much of the game feels like errands and busywork. You're ready for the next \"leader\" bounty mission... but it doesn't unlock until you spend an hour flying from planet to planet killing low level minions that pose no challenge. You're ready for the next story boss... but you can't face them until you've explored the surface of a bunch of harmless planets first.\n\nAnd then you kill a story boss and... nothing changes.

Now it doesn't kill me.\nI'll fight one or two familiar enemies I've fought before but with higher stats.\nI'll dig into the center of the planet and mine out the T5 resource. This will not be hard. The environment will be the same.\nI'll make the T5 armour. I'll use whatever T5 weapon I found in a chest on the surface of some harmless planet, or maybe just the T5 weapons that dropped from the T4 boss.\nI'll fight the guys again. Now they feel exactly like the T4 enemies from an hour ago.\nI'll spend and hour exploring harmless planets looking for monkey/bird/lizard culture to scan. Mostly I'll run through familiar villages spam clicking the things and people until I'm told I can fight the T5 boss.\nI'll unlock and fight the T5 boss.

If that's your bag, it's a decent solo experience.\n\nThe bad:\n- Dated design that was \"abandoned\" (finished development) nearly a decade ago. Multiplayer is not stable enough for me.\n- Runs on one CPU core for both clients and dedicated servers, meaning performance can be a mixed bag. Doesn't engage the GPU for calculations, and won't ever.\n- Better content diversity and progression with mods, but struggles to maintain sync in certain areas when running the most popular mod (Frackin' Universe) on a dedicated server with resources to spare\u2014again, engine limitations are the culprit.\n\nThe ugly:\n- Will likely never see an engine update to bring it up to speed with modern or continously updated titles\n- Troubleshooting bugs is a nightmare with mods because many vanilla bugs still remain, and telling them apart can be tedious or a dead end\n- Really no reason to play it over Terraria apart from the space aesthetic since the maps it generates for planets aren't special in any way, just the same jumble of random dungeons and blocks vomited onto the appropriate biomes. In Terraria, you can walk left or right to do the same thing that Starbound requires you to fly a spaceship for.\n\nIn short, Starbound was a very ambitious idea that partially delivered on its promise. Unfortunately, after nearly a decade since its \"full release,\" it's far behind the times. Titles like Minecraft and Terraria continue to refine and innovate on everything from performance to content, but Starbound was declared \"finished\" and left to collect dust.\n\nThe game is better with mods, no doubt. Frackin' Universe, among others, add a layer of much-needed depth and incremental progression. But running these mods on a game engine that can only command a single CPU core\u2014and it only runs on the CPU, using the GPU for nothing but displaying pixels\u2014is a recipe for frustration.\n\nStarbound is a beloved game to many.

From being able to get a crew that can go on adventures with you, to bigger ships, and even a freaking MECH!\r\n\r\nBut there are a couple facets to this game that feel.. hollow. Half-assed. Unfinished.\r\nBeneath the surface, every planet is the same. Ore veins are small, even in the depths, and there are very few reasons to go down there - Everything you'd ever need is found on or near the surface. Rare items, raw materials, they all generate in containers found in villages. The only reason you'd go down underground is if you didn't get that mineshaft on the first world, or maybe you're building something. That's it.\r\n\r\nThe story is fairly simple, though it may take multiple villages and dungeons to complete just one of the research quests. Chucklefish could've done something more with the Occasus, like give them occasional structures to encounter on various planets, not just the uncommon ship.\r\n\r\nI do miss a few things from the old Betas. Planets of the same primary biome having random difficulty levels, the old unique weapons (i.e. the Star Cleaver), and Tentacle planets. And, like I said earlier, this game certainly has come a long way, but it's missing a decent amount of content.\r\n\r\nOne major gripe I have is how intensive this simple game is on the hardware. My computer should NOT be cooking itself after ten minutes of gameplay - and I've got a good cooling system in place! Modding is also rather limited, as you cannot really change much in terms of how the largely vacant underground generates, or add proper ship-to-ship combat systems.\r\n\r\nThis game also seems to have been abandoned by the devs shortly after the Bounty Hunter update.

I feel like there was a chance for the game to set a jubilant and bouncy sort of tone, but it took itself a little too seriously in this regard.\n\nRadiant Quests and NPC Dialogue - \nIn a space game, the whole point is that you get to interact with aliens and stuff, especially in an RPG like this, and yet all you can do is press 'E' to probe NPCs for small talk and that's it. The quest system is also really too simple and unrewarding, especially with the abundant nature of almost all craftables and resources you can acquire invalidating the value of the rewards you receive. \n\nMain Questline - \nA lot of people have talked about this, but basically, the entire main storyline is a tutorial. I'm not even joking. You spend ~15 or so main missions all the way until you make it to the final boss before you realize you were supposed to be building colonies and bases, but instead you've just been living on your ship the entire time. Too much of this game focuses on the questline and not on the core sandbox nature of the game, and by the time you ever confront this aspect of the game, you're hardly ready for it. Either you try out the sandbox stuff right in the beginning before learning you haven't unlocked 80% of the tools you need or want, or you try out after completing the story, and it feels pointless without any other side goals to be working towards. The game really should have focused more on a town-building aspect in my opinion.\n\n\nBut yeah, you can probably tell I really did enjoy the aesthetic of this game, and I also found other things of interest like through modding and multiplayer. However, I think this game suffers a lot from a core gameplay loop that expects you to both build and use the sandbox to its fullest extent, but also encourages endless exploration and nomadic playstyle too much. It pulls the game in two different directions that confuses the player, so to change this, they added a storyline that was primarily about boss-fighting and herodom: all well and good, but it didn't fix the primary issue. \n\nThis game could still be so much more, but it's been so long since the developers have been around and even they did not seem to realize what this game needed. Mods are wonderful, and apparently some level of the community persists and continues its work on this game, but there's only so much you can do with the main game. \n\nI know I am being very critical, but I just wanted to push out some of my main issues with the game, that I haven't seen other reviewers mention.", "timestamp_created": 1710845554, "timestamp_updated": 1710845554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160875457": {"recommendationid": "160875457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078316515", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 10287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10287, "last_played": 1710799967}, "language": "english", "review": "\udb40\udc21\udb40\udc21", "timestamp_created": 1710799506, "timestamp_updated": 1710799506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160179273": {"recommendationid": "160179273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307473268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 646, "last_played": 1709990438}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommended! 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1709988020, "timestamp_updated": 1709988020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157690720": {"recommendationid": "157690720", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023986535", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1182, "last_played": 1706778099}, "language": "english", "review": "this is fire i recommend this game just got do some google searches on some of the stuff because the game don't tell how to play after the basics", "timestamp_created": 1707189912, "timestamp_updated": 1707189912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157576342": {"recommendationid": "157576342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012916714", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 25357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25357, "last_played": 1504905412}, "language": "english", "review": "Played for 422 hours and had such high hopes for this game.

Then i discovered there were mods. Played an additional 350 hours.\r\nI've probably 'completed' the game about 8 times now, from the start to the finish of the story.\r\nI've like only played this game solo. I'd say that about 750 of my hours were alone... mainly because i have no friends and nobody i know likes this game.\r\nIn the end of my review, i'll recommend some mods for you to download, if you're considering buying the game, before playing Starbound, for my personal recommended experience.\r\nEnough about my experience; lets talk about game stuff.\r\n\r\n[b] Story [/b]\r\nWell... i guess it's okay, the usual \"you have to save the universe\" kinda thing. It's very short. If you speedrun, i'd assume you could complete the story in like 4 hours, give or take. Maybe even less.\r\n[b] Items/Equipment [/b]\r\nA really cool thing in this game is there are procedurally generated weapons. Each weapon looks different with different stats, which is honestly pretty cool, though about 98.55% of the time you'll get a really funky looking gun.\r\nAs for equipment... well... it's fine. I like to know which armor is [i] the best [/i] in the game. But here... there is like 3 endgame armors. They have different stats, but that's just my personal preference.\r\n[b] Environment [/b]\r\nI'd say that most of the biomes in here are kinda cool, though since i've played this game waaaay too much, i've basically memorized all the procedurally generated things.\r\nThe music is decent, some tracks are cool.\r\n[b] Progression [/b]\r\nWell, if you know what you're doing (like if you have 750 hours of experience), you can get the endgame armor in probably less then 4 hours. The one thing that i like and dislike at the same time are: Each of the races has a different ship, different armors and weapons for crafting. It's cool, but when you play alone, you'll either get stuck crafting only swords and hammers, or only guns.\r\n[b] Building [/b]\r\nIt's unique. If you know how to build in this game, you can make some cool structures, though as a first time player, it's really hard to. So, i recommend something: Try and copy designs of other buildings and sorta divert them. That really helped me build things that actually look like buildings.\r\n[b] Recommended Mods & Other [/b]\r\nSo, don't get angry at me for suggesting mods you might not like. I'm only suggesting these because i think i would love to have these when i first ever played, so you could like them too. But, if not, you can always choose not to download certain mods.\r\nAlso, when you get this game, you'll get 'Starbound: Unstable' which you can play as the unmodded version of Starbound.\r\n\r\n1. [i] Avali (Triage) Race Mod [/i]\r\nThis can make the Starbound universe feel a little more 'diverse'. Recommend getting the mod that makes them more friendly to humans (idk why they do, but for some reason the just hate humans for no reason, and to me, it's really not necessary, unless you like to walk around and suddenly have a guard walk up to you and say: \"We're watching you, scum.\") and i recommend getting the mod 'Avali sounds' that edits the hurt and talking sounds, otherwise they'll sound just like a human.\r\n2. [i] Draconis Race & Draconis Full Dragons Reskin [/i]\r\nIt adds more diversity, plus [spoiler] it has amazing endgame armor. [/spoiler] You can add other vanity-like things to the race, like spikes, accented wings, etc.\r\n3. [i] Protogen race [/i]\r\nMainly because [spoiler] there is a hidden NPC that sells OP armor, and sells THE BEST weapon in the game, [/spoiler] plus they have some nice sleek furniture, and for more diversity.\r\n4. [i] Swap Augments! [/i]\r\nI like this one. There are augments in the game that give you extra stats, but without this mod, if you already equipped one augment then equip another one, then the one that was equipped before gets destroyed.\r\n5. [i] Improved Swim Physics! [/i]\r\nThis makes going around underwater less of a pain.\r\n6. [i] Starbound Weapon Overhaul - Compatibility Version [/i] This makes the procedurally generated guns look like actual weapons rather then weird contraptions.\r\n7. [i] Mech Status Immunity Fix [/i]\r\nThis mod is nice because, before, if you entered a mech, then ALL your buffs would disappear. Now they wont with this mod.\r\n8. [i] Crew Customization + [/i]\r\nThis allows you to customize your crew with armor and weapons. It's a really nice QoL. This makes it so you don't have to grind for one crewmember that allows for customization.\r\n9. [i] Craftable Salvage Parts [/i]\r\nThis mod makes it so you don't have to grind for hours to upgrade your mech, which at points can be really boring and annoying.\r\n10. [i] Better Ship Animations [/i]\r\nIt's optional, but it adjusts the ships animation for when you travel to planets, to make it less weird and funky.\r\n\r\nMost of these mods will probably want other mods to make the game compatible with it, so just download those other ones with these ones.\r\nYou can download other mods too, though i wouldn't recommend downloading 100+ mods on your first hour of playing.\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nOther then that, i'd recommend this game.\r\nI have no experience mulitplayer, so can't really help there, but i have heard that the mechanics are really weird.", "timestamp_created": 1713465307, "timestamp_updated": 1713465307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159211824": {"recommendationid": "159211824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198995736027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3982, "last_played": 1659300728}, "language": "english", "review": "Seems fun looks fun until you find out that the game is the same thing over and over again trying to find artifacts scan the wall the vase and uh oh find a new planet your out of artifacts. the bosses are fun not worth the effort 4-10", "timestamp_created": 1708836467, "timestamp_updated": 1708836467, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517094016075134277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157745795": {"recommendationid": "157745795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198831608777", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 29171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "playtime_at_review": 28548, "last_played": 1712788332}, "language": "english", "review": "Horribly optimized.

In order to understand why this is, I must tell you my tale. \n\nCHAPTER 1: The Happy Times\nMy tale begins at the beta stages of this seemingly promising game, when the ugly design choices and painful gameplay pacing was balanced with an interesting and challenging gameplay structure that offered what felt like endless possibilities. Little by little, there was more content, fun mods, and a very solid multiplayer system. All in all, Starbound was on the up and up. It had survival mechanics, biomes, deep character development and a slowly growing backstory. I had a lot of fun playing it with friends and enjoying the satisfying gameplay loop of visiting other planets, finding cool stuff, and then bringing it back to our ever growing base full of memories and personal touches that added to a cool player made narrative. \n\nAnd I can pinpoint the exact moment when everything went to shit. \n\nChapter II: The Exact Moment When Everything Went To Shit\nAt some point, there was a patch. This patch proceeded to break everyone's mods, as is the telltale sign of crappy game developers (seriously, it's actually quite easy to preserve people's mods through various workarounds as far as modern computing goes). \n\nSee, up until this point, Starbound had a great gameplay mechanic that made the world feel more grounded. Namely, temperature. A realtime temperature system that required you to manage heat as an environmental resource. This resulted in gameplay that rewarded a slower crawl, and made you value your upgrades and spatial management. It was a fantastic feature because of how it really stimulated your creative problem solving skills. But then, a dark shadow loomed over the horizon... namely, focus groups. \n\nFirst, they came for the temperature system, but I said nothing, since I wasn't registered on the Starbound forum. Then they began to nerf the ship building, the biomes and little by little, the game was slowly being refurbished into a linear experience full of contrivances and shoehorned plot elements. Now you had to meet boolean requirements to do stuff, and the creativity was dead. All in an effort to appease idiots who like casual games on their horrible phones and tablets. \n\nChapter III: Conclusion\nObviously the warning signs were always there. The artstyle clearly speaks to a sort of primordial force of stupidity in its patronising efforts to constantly look cutesy in an upbeat corporate dystopia sort of way.

Your ship is just a cool personalizeable hub that's linked to player, with overworld map built in.\n\n[b] What i didn't like (but that's okay)[/b]\n- The whole universe is evenly populated and easily predictable. this makes game's world feel oversaturated and fake (at least on second or third playthrough). Planets either are completely barren (literal sandboxes), or are guaranteed to contain a few outposts and a few dungeons. [spoiler]There are no \"city\" planets like we see in the intro.[/spoiler] Some places that should at least feel special and unique, are rather common after some further exploration. However, i get why it's made that way - purely for fun factor. It's a sandboxy platformy crafty game after all.\n- While overall soundtrack is very good and really fits the game, it gets repetitive after a while due to game's pacing. And barren planets music gets boring after a first loop or so.\n\n[b] What i didn't like[/b]\n- The mech progression is painfully slow and grindy, unlike the whole other game.\n- Mechs feel too OP for the main game, like they should show up way after where they are.\n- The whole game progression is artificially slowed down by the need to craft or loot, but it is still relatively easy to overlevel your character and fly past certain areas and skip some content. Although on the other hand, it may be good for replayability.\n- There are some mechanics that make it really easy to abuse the game with no skill required.

They call you \"protector\". Now you as \"protector\" have to shoot everything that moves cause hell it's not obvious what is aggressive and what is not. Even that cute whitelisting thing. \r\n- Controls: i can't explain how many times i died because of movement controls being shit.\r\n- Gameplay: in prologue you start by being able only to walk, no running. I had to search the controls for a run button. There is none. Later on you switch to \"always run\" mode. WHY?!?! \r\n- UI: good luck playing on a big screen\\resolution and trying to read any text.

Bear this in mind in my review. Firstly: Terraria players will both like and dislike aspects of Starbound. Going into this game as a Terraria player, do yourself a favor: Don't compare the two. Beyond the digging and building there are very few similarities in gameplay. \n\nStarbound is a sandbox exploration game, with emphasis on Exploration. You're meant to explore and see the universe, and in a way that is structured far differently from other titles in the \"voxel\" genre. It excels in giving the player fun places to visit and a variety of things to do in said locations. Building is exceptionally well handled and there is a very wide array of content suited to this sort of gameplay, including being able (for a modest fee) to 3d print things you have already encountered in order to build to your liking with less hassles.\n\nCombat is passable, but not the core focus of the game. You *will* be fighting, and there are some rewarding and interesting dungeons and boss fights...but don't let that lure you into thinking the game is about fighting. Not the base vanilla product, at any rate.\n\nTiering is handled intuitively, with each new star type explored (again, in the vanilla product) opening up new ores that in turn lead to new armor, which takes you into the new tier of content. In fact, most \"tiering\" is loosely based on your gear. It's an interesting way to handle pacing, but at times may have you confused as there is little in-game to inform you of this. You are intended to find out on your own. If you like having your hand held like many games these days do, it will not happen here. Like Terraria, you need to figure out wtf the ores do on your own.\n\nThere are numerous sub-systems in play that add life to the universe (Mechs, Space Stations, with Bounty Hunting coming soon). Unfortunately, these sub-systems are probably the weakest link. The content for them is fine...but their integration doesn't connect directly to tiering in any logical way, and they play no overall purpose in the games narrative. You can completely ignore all of the mech content, and suffer nothing for it, for example. This gives the feeling of them being \"tacked on\" rather than implemented naturally. This is both a blessing and a curse. You aren't forced to use the content, but it makes it feel hollow and lacking.\n\nThere are all sorts of things to like, though: Atmosphere, a beautifully composed soundtrack that perfectly encapsulates the feel of the game, unrivaled building mechanics, fun gameplay and a variety of difficulties that give different sorts of players a very difference experience (Hardcore mode for those who love to punish themselves, Casual for those that are the opposite). The same sub-systems I mention above add a lot of fun despite their downsides, and when it comes to modding...\n\nThere are few games that allow you to modify this much with of product right out of the gates. Over the course of 5+ years my own mod has effectively rewritten most of the core game with few headaches along the way. Being able to rework almost (key word: almost) the entire product without access to the sourcecode is fantastic, and the devs are receptive to improvements to this modding capability.\n\n\nIn short:\n\nPros:\n\n- Tons of content\n- Billions upon billions of possible planets can generate\n- Building in this game is *awesome*\n- Intuitive and straightforward\n- Numerous interesting minigames\n- Randomly generated creatures\n- Randomly Generated quests\n- Soundtrack is amazing\n- Atmospheric\n- Nearly unrivaled modabilty\n- Play the game however you want (see first point in cons for exception) \n\n\nCons:\n\n- While you can play how you want, you must first complete some intro quests no matter how many times you've played the game, and no option to skip those initial \"learn to play\" bits. This means there is one mandatory dungeon every single time you play. You *can* skip the Introduction, however. \n- Sub-systems feel tacked-on rather than integrated\n- Meh UI\n- Somewhat shallow without mods after a playthrough\n- Mods are almost essential to tailor gameplay for your specific tastes\n\n\nDespite the cons, this game is largely what you make of it. 12k hours should give me some street-cred there.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1523197606, "timestamp_updated": 1523197606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 593, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.958756804466247559", "comment_count": 50, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28462231": {"recommendationid": "28462231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066855998", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 14219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8559, "last_played": 1612293281}, "language": "english", "review": "For people who like story, or fast, reaction-based gameplay, this game isnt for you.\nWith over 200 hours on this game, i have come to a conclusion.

Their only major falter was the lack of finalized updates. I would be lying if i said i didn't at least once or twice feel angry or ripped off by Chucklefish. After all its not the money we paid, but the promises we paid for. Development is slow, very slow.\n\nPROS:\n+You will probably spend at least 100> hours exploring and getting your gameplays worth.\n+Can capture any monster you find on a planet and use it as a pet (yes, its like Pokemon, but in space).\n+Procedurally generated weapons, very good ones too, you will be surprised at the variety of attacks and designs.\n+Building is easy, wiring is easy, painting is easy and there are hundreds upon hundreds of different blocks and decorations.\n+7 Starter races that are diverse and unique.\n+Modding support for this game is well maintained.\n+(near) Infinite planets that never have the same two types of monster or buildings.\n+Multiplayer through steam, easy to connect via the client (can be very laggy).\n+Professions are chosen by the player, you can play how you want HOWEVER some professions are blatantly more fun or better than others. The Farmer will never have that awesome shotgun the explorer does or the armor the miner has.\n+OST is amazing \n+Active devs, who also listen a fair bit to the community. Might even find them in the Discord or IIRC.\n+Customizability is insane, akin to Terraria's system (including dyes and social slots).\n+Liquid and Light dynamics are \"realistic\"\n+Supports .ABC Files (You can play actual music in game from websites such as LOTRO)\n+Boss fights are unique-ish\n\nSEMICONS: (Things that the devs are likely to fix soon, or will fix eventually, or may not be encountered by everyone)\n+/- Can feel a bit solitary, especially in singleplayer\n+/- Game is unoptimized and crashes on startup occasionally\n+/- Mods are sometimes undetected by the game alltogether and you might have to restart multiple times to get them working\n+/- Obligatory semicon about the bugs and rush to 1.0\n\nCONS:\n- AI can be pretty stupid\n- The story is average, and cuts off pretty quickly with very little relevance late game.\n- Some significant unbalance in both the bosses and weapons. (For their level, some are incredibly weak or easy, or very hard/OP)\n- The tutorial explains gameplay fundamentals but lacks out some smaller things that people might miss\n- APPLIES MAINLY TO BETA PLAYERS: If you played in beta, you will notice that a lot of content is totally gone or inconsistent, especially in tiered species weapons and the story bosses.\n- Penguin crewmates are a pain in the ass\n- No ship protection in multiplayer*\n- Besides farming, there is little incentive to actually build a planetary base.\n- Mining can get boring quickly, especially if you are used to Terraria's systems**\n- Game has a falloff point where you sit down and go \"well, what next\" (but that is quite some time later)\n- Some mechanics seem halfbaked, where its easy to see how to improve and you are frustrated that the devs let it sit there (some bad design choices and flaws)\n- Starting a new game on a server is almost impossible if the server is populated.\n- Seriously, the biggest con for this game are just design flaws. Like, the hotbar for example is arguably very unintuitive and some of the aspects are left out almost completely. You will be using a feature of the game and be scratching your head \"Why didn't they do ___ instead?\"\n- Techs are now simplified and ultimately nerfed and more boring\n- Only 6 tiers? Come on, where is the 10 we had before.***\n- So what are ship pets for there exactly? They do like to stand in front of my containers.\n- Options screen needs a bit of a rework (if you need to explain a UI, its not a good UI)\n- Wiring things in your ship can get cluttered and incredibly difficult if there are many tracks\n- Matter Manipulator customization is a joke\n\n*Any member of a party can steal or break things in your ship even still. People are divided between \"simply party with people you trust\" and \"just give us some bloody protection options\". Personally, protection options sound better because otherwise whats the point of public servers if you cant show off your ship a little bit? EDIT: After some more thought, ship protection options should just be a thing, honestly. The existence of multiplayer comes with some things you need to take for granted and one of those things are \"not everyone will be a decent or honest person\".\n\n** Okay lets clear this up: Starbound is NOT a Terraria copy, YES it does have elements and inspired features that Terraria did but honestly, whats the wrong in that? Imagine how hard it would be to make a game that is nothing like any other game you've ever played. Terraria arguably perfected some aspects of the genre and there is nothing wrong with following footsteps.\n\n*** Tiers are an iffy one, they sacrificed having 10 tiers of weapons and armor for having 6 more specialised ones; Ranged, Melee and Staffs. On top of that, where the hell are the tiered weapons for classes? They totally disappeared! In a sandbox game the idea is you have endless content and things to do - this doesn't just mean a million different blocktype, just give us some more depth and flexibility. (Should clarify, technically giving specialised class armor instead of more tiers is flexibility but it just feels cut short and i cant be the only one)\n\nLast time i played this game on a server with friends, we didnt mine, explore, pvp, build or do quests. We all sat in a ship and played \"guess the song\", if that isn't simultaneously the most concerning (gameplay wise) but coolest thing then what the hell is it.\n\nThe game's development could be described as a mix of \"one step forward, two steps back\" and \"missed opportunities\" because the thing is it's easily playable but frustrating.\n\n(removed score, decided it wasn't a good choice)\n\nWorth the money? YES...\nRuns on most computers? NO (as of right now, 1.0, which harbors some optimization problems)\n\nHonestly i want to love Starbound i really do. To me no matter what happens now it got far enough that i enjoyed it, but was constantly disappointed in the missed opportunities\n\n(25/7/16) Top review, didn't expect - gonna add a little more.(also edited grammar and reworded some stuff a little to better reflect my feelings_\n\nIf anyone from Chucklefish reads this, what ARE you doing? This game is confusing, because it obviously has potential (and lives up to some of it) but falls short at the silliest of things. Look at some community mods and ideas, people are screaming at you to add certain things or change stuff but it just goes overlooked. When you make a game it won't be exactly how you envisioned it to be but thats because the people who play it want some input too. You added skyrails and some other features - hell back in the day i helped get modular matter manipulators in the game but prime example, the \"modular\" Matter Manipulator has 12 upgrades and no actual customization. I don't want to devalue or dishearten your work but there is nothing as helpful as constructive criticism, because you seem to only take in the good things about the game and ignore much of the big criticisms. I would hate for this to be another \"let the modders deal with it\"\nAll that being said, good job thus far not abandoning or totally messing everything up, you do deserve praise for a lot of the work you have done and i won't discount that.", "timestamp_created": 1469354712, "timestamp_updated": 1606226431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 644, "votes_funny": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.937937378883361816", "comment_count": 38, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32414167": {"recommendationid": "32414167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138216589", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11669, "last_played": 1596240231}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Starbound, short and sweet it's a great game. But here are the very long reasons why: [/h1]\n( [i] Paragraphs in order: Storyline, Gameplay, Graphics, Setting and mods [/i] )\n\n[b] STORYLINE [/b]\nIn starbound, you play as a character of any of the six races about to graduate to a protector. This is stopped by a violent and mysterious force, which coerces you to escape in the first ship you find. As you look to repair your ship you are pulled into a rope of interesting and exciting quests to see what parts of the universe you can salvage before the same violent force rips it apart, just like it did to your home planet. \nPROS: [list]\n[*] Allows you to get a sandbox experience without feeling forced to do the story (there are ways to skip it)\n[*] Feels complete when you're done, main story line may end, but there are always tonnes of sidequests.\n[*] Easy to follow along if you don't take long breaks.\n[/list]\nCONS: [list]\n[*] Low curve, would appreciate more action spread through the scavenging of artifacts. My ideal would be adding more minibosses.\n\n\n[b]  GAMEPLAY [/b]\nAlthough it may seem daunting with all the crafting and vague mission information at first, it is not. A general idea is to get your ship furnished before doing the missions. Get some understanding of the crafting and the traveling. Generally, looking at the [i] starbound.wikia.com [/i] helps you with missions and obtaining items. The gameplay can shift between serene and action filled based completely on what the player wants. The serenity and action are respectively accompanied by multiple factors such as the music or dialogue. For the calmer experience, there is farming, cooking, building spectacular monuments, fishing and looking for easter eggs and pop culture references (which are spread out very frequently). As soon as you want action, you could do some hunting, exploring or doing missions in both the main storyline and ones you find in the settlements on the planets. The quests are also rewarding, with some giving gift bags and others offering to join your crew on your ship. The boss battles in this game are exciting and suits both casual and hardcore players, depending on how fast you decide to go through the story. The combat is smooth and is changeable depending on the players choice of weapons and armour. [b] the most important part, however [/b] is the free and easy multiplayer. You can play with friends through dedicated servers or through the steam overlay [i] join game feature [/i]\nPROS: [list]\n[*] Everything is fun, there is really not a whole lot of grinding for items or currency. during mining, for instance, the game throws dungeons and new underground biomes at you to keep it interesting.\n[*] Everything is a way to progress. After some calm farming you could sell the crops to progress, if you want, you can make food with the ingredients that can help you with different effects. \n[*] Combat is very good and easily fits any player.\n[/list]\nCONS: [list]\n[*] Some derpy issues such as settlement guards attacking you because their houses get striked by meteors.\n\n\n[b] GRAPHICS [/b] \n\"pixely\" graphics remind many of terraria, but the graphics designers have really done well, seeing as there are so many branches of weapons and clothes from all races and all different weapons, magical, firearms, spears, chakrams, you name it. Everything is very varied and all the mobs are very visually adapted to their biomes and planets. The bosses do a good job of showing their origins and the attacks fit their visuals. \nPROS: [list] \n[*] Modern but nostalgic\n[*] Well varied\n[*] Items and furniture convey their origins and use.\n[/list]\nCONS: [list]\n[*] Not a whole lot of underwhelming weapons that allow the legendaries to stand out.\n[*] They took away the feature of mobs having different colors depending on their planets to give slight notability to a seemingly average poptop or gleap. \n[/list]\n\n\n[b] SETTING [/b] \nThe setting can change depending on choice. Staying on a planet is accompanied by one of twelve songs by day and sixteen by night. Many who play this game, including me, love the music and it fits to different parts of everyday life. My personal favorite way to listen is through the title screen, but I know I should already have bought the OST on steam. In the game, during bossfights, there are nostalgic feeling battle-music that really sets you into the idea that your character is in danger. \nPROS: [list]\n[*] Amazing music that fits a serene or action-filled gameplay.\n[*] The immersion is helped so much by music.\n[/list] \nCONS: [list]\n[*] It's hard to get around to buying a five euro soundtrack. \n[/list]\n\n\n[b] MODS [/b]\nWhen you feel like you have completed everything you wish to have completed in starbound but crave more, fear not. There are hundreds of free mods to enrich your experience, post main-missions and during them. A noteable one is called  \"[i] [b] frackin universe [/b] [/i]\" The megamod is generally the biggest mod in all of starbound and adds dozens of new biomes and monsters along with hundreds of weapons, armors, tools, items and microdungeons. It also adds a whole new quest hub and a massive eldritch dungeon to explore. There are also things to help you collect things  you would normally have to work a bit harder for and very much more content. It feels like an entirely new game. Oh and did I mention? the mods are free. \n\n\n[b] SUMMARY [/b] \nAddictive game with smooth combat, interchangeable setting, easy multiplayer, cute graphics and free mods, some of which completely renew the game, to multiply the replay value tenfold. I have over two hundred (I know, casual hours) in this game and I don't plan on stopping, seeing as I have only slightly dipped my toes into the \"frackin' universe\" mod.\n[b] 9.5/10[/b] [i] Would definately recommend if you are willing to get past a slightly slow early game [/i]", "timestamp_created": 1497459277, "timestamp_updated": 1497474647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 370, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.935142338275909424", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51223748": {"recommendationid": "51223748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086396550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 51782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25477, "last_played": 1705029008}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing this for the past year or so and I 100% recommend it.

I had the highest level armor and weapon so powerful it could kill anything with one or two hits.  My rapid-firing high-damage assault rifle could hit birds at any range.  At that point the game had stopped being fun.  Even the extreme planets were too easy; meteor strikes were few and far between.\n\nBut now?  You can start a colony.  Weapons are no longer ridiculously powerful, and the accuracy of some guns has been reduced.  Soon there will be hoverbikes.  Hoverbikes?  Hell yeah.  Colonies?  You're kidding me.\n\nNope, not kidding.  Colonies.  Nothing like settling on a fiery planet, building a beautiful city inhabited by unique and endearing people, and watching it be obliterated by one giant meteor.  That taught me something... build underground.  So now I have my own little ragtag band of survivors, duking it out with nature.\n\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Epic gameplay, both at low and high levels\n[*] Beautiful atmosphere, covering a huge range of fantasy and science fiction\n[*] Creepy undertone; there are hints everywhere that there's some greater power behind all this\n[*] Bananas\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] The quests get tedious once you've gotten pretty far; it's eventually just \"get this\" and \"get that\".  Hopefully this will be fixed soon...\n[*] The races could use some more differences; while it is cool that they have specific armor, weapons, and ships, it would be much more interesting if there were race-specific abilities, even if they only affected the early game.\n[*] Still some balance issues with weapons, but this is much better than it used to be.\n[*] This is a personal pet peeve, but I really want some more high-level bows.  After a certain point they're no longer useful, as they just don't do enough damage.  If there were more bows to go with the top-level gear, I'd be in heaven.\n[/list]\n\nMy final rating: 9/10\nGreat game, but not perfect.  Keep in mind, Starbound is still in Beta.  I'm sure they'll get at least some of these things fixed before the game hits 1.0.\n\nOne more thing: I haven't yet explored all the game has to offer.  I'm sure there's tons more to see, and more problems too, but I haven't found any yet.\n\nEDIT: Nevermind about the bows, I just realized you can craft a Ferozium bow.", "timestamp_created": 1447118243, "timestamp_updated": 1449159251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 185, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919591248035430908", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14367023": {"recommendationid": "14367023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043960246", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 92879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41656, "last_played": 1640017644}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played Starbound since its Early Access days, and it is easily my favorite game in sandbox exploration/building genre.\n\nAmong the games of its genre, Starbound puts strongerest focus on exploration rather than fighting. Rather than adventuring in a single world, in Starbound you travel between different planets each not only belonging to a particular biome, but containing some of unique features from a fairly large list, from peaceful villages to dungeons filled with zealous guards. So you never know what you will find on each new planet you visit, which makes exploration very addictive: you will always want to explore \u201cjust one more planet\u201d!\n\nIn regard of building, Starbound offers one of largest (if not the largest) selections of both decorative and functional items to place in your house or base. It also has mechanics that allows you to populate your base with as many NPC as you like, potentially building a whole town with dozens residents.\n\nAnd uniquely among its genre, Starbound also has quests like one might expect of a RPG rather than a sandbox building game: a fairly long main quests and an infinite number of random quests provided by NPC in towns or those you've placed in your home or base yourself.\n\nOnly one aspect of Starbound is somewhat lacking: combat, or specifically, its difficulty. While you may encounter some difficulty if you are poorly equipped (especially at the very start), as long as you are equipped with a gear of the same tier as the planet you are exploring, you will likely have little difficulty fending off local wildlife. There is some difficulty during boss fights, but bosses are still easy as far as bosses go, and if you expect challenging battles that Terrarria or action games offer, you won't find them in Starbound. Some storyline and random dungeon can also offer some challenge, but there it mostly comes from traps or indestructable dungeon elements, like flamethrowers or laser beams, not enemies (in fact, random dungeons often have few to none enemies, and focus on making you avoid dangerous environment).\n\nSo, overall, the combat isn't that bad. Just don't expect constant challenge that Terraria or Edge of Space present.\n\nI fully recommend Starbound to anyone who likes sandbox games or want to give this genre a try.", "timestamp_created": 1423308634, "timestamp_updated": 1480081647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 350, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.918824613094329834", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66952578": {"recommendationid": "66952578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123814044", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 149294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 136711, "last_played": 1651324328}, "language": "english", "review": "I just wanted to thank the DEVs for this super game!\n\nNow, after 2000 hours of gameplay I decided to buy a 2nd piece of this game to support you!\n\nIt is still the best game for me and my son, we built so many things together since he was 5 years old, and he learned so much about the world and about sci-fi and fantasy.

[/h1]\n[b] The good: [/b]\nThis is starbound. The game that it currently is, is a space themed, construction and survival exploration game. Comparable to terraria, it has improved upon a lot of things from that such as the ability to use one block as a back wall and a forewall, there are more space related things like atmospheres (1) space creatures (2) space ships, a space story line etc. There are planets to discover (3), theres progress to be made through building a colony and adventuring through planets (4), Plenty of fun to be had with interesting tech mechanics (5) a very large assortment of vanity goods, and a nice multiplayer experience. The inventory feels not too full all the time as it is now catagorized into everything you need (such as an ore bag and a building materials bag etc), and it comes with a complete story which you'd have a hard time finding with such creative games (6).\n\n[b] The Bad: [/b]\n[list]\n[*]The game is rather short with only 6 tiers of progression.\n[*]You run around on planets and can easily move on to the next section by scraping the surface alone.\n[*]The armor balance for players is slightly higher than the game seems to want, it's so mind numbingly easy that a toddler could sit around with a stimpack and a med kit and outheal any damage coming at them.\n[*]It's so incredibly easy for other players to ruin the efforts of a server because the protection isnt in the game by default, in any way.\n[*]The game will get extremely laggy for many players when there are too many entities in one area of a world. (which should be something obvious, however I'm saying that it's taxing on higher end systems even)\n[*]It will consume many of your hours doing simple things like building, or gathering a crew/upgrading your ship/mining. (ok, this one isnt really bad, unless you hate that sort of thing.)\n[/list]\n\n[b] The Unforgivable: [/b]\n[i]this entire \"the unforgivable\" section will be gripes about features [b]removed[/b] from the game, they will not impact you if you do not know about what was in the past. I advise you to keep clear if you are fresh and have never had your hopes high for the game.[/i]\nAs much as I don't want to say this, I feel as though it has to be said, the game has been stripped of features. The justification for this is improved framerate, when honestly it is worse now. So I cannot and will not let it go. Lets start off with the numbers \n[list][*]1. They removed the heating system, and the complexity of atmospheres from the game. you now craft a survival pack that allows you to eventually traverse all territories, instead of how it was before, which was harsh and based on your selections. While this choice for sure makes the game easier, it takes out the fun survival part of the difficulty.\n[*]1a. They also oversimplified the hazardous environments, so it doesnt matter if you take cover, or build a fire to stay warm, you will always be suffering the consequences of a planet, no matter where you are, if you don't have the correct survival pack.\n[*]2. They drastically reduced the randomness of creatures that spawn on planets, there are now a total of 3 major variants of creatures, large, small, and flying and are trash monsters who have no meaningful attacks. There are now many pre generated creatures that inhabit every single planet in the game, and they are very common. I hope you enjoy going to the same 20 planets over and over again.\n[*]3. unrelated to the creatures but stemming from the random generation, planets now are even genned the same, and the color of planets is only based on the planet you're going to, which you will find out are very limited in number, it's not a mystery of what you're getting anymore, you go to an ocean planet, you've seen them all, you go to a starter planet, you've seen them all etc. the only thing that remains are the random dungeons generated in the planets themselves.\n[*]4. Adventuring is blindly easy, everything has been simplified down to looting all the surface boxes of a planet for \"EXTREMELY RARE\" matter manipulator upgrades and the ore the planet has that you want, along with tech tokens which allow you to buy whatever tech you want, never forcing you to try something out because it's your only option. [i]shrug[/i]\n[*]5. Techs. oh my god techs. They removed all the fun ones, removed all the flying ones, removed the mechs the cards and the interesting ones, and of course replaced the hazard protection ones with the survival pack. somehow, they took the worst tech of them all (the nearly useless morphball) and made it worse AND a focus at the same time (they removed the bomb feature and gave it trashy mobility options) (also I say this as a fan and a person who tried implementing 2 high tunnels in my bases for fun.)\nThe current state of techs involves head techs, body techs, and feet techs. They are painful. \n[*]5a. The morph ball is the head tech. and it has several variations, one that climbs walls (at the cost of moving like a fucking snail), one that does ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING (it makes you float to the top of water) and one that makes you spin dash like sonic (without the damage, honestly that would be too fun). imagine being forced to use the morphball tech and it having no real use, ever. thats exactly what it's like.\n[*]5b. The body tech. you remember the dash tech? the one that moved you several feet? that one will be your primary mobility tech, for 8 tech cards you can restore it to it's original state, being able to use it mid air, which is pretty ok. You can use it for a slightly-faster-than-running sprinting, which is pretty ok. and you can use it for a blink dash, which is completely useless and not a mobility option in the least. unless you like roleplaying tracer or something.\n[*]5c. The feet tech. Double jump! Thats good! triple jump! that..... ok because they're smaller hops. wall jump :O now you can be super meat boy..... but.... thats never useful in a game like this except if someone build a map for it. and the roc(ket) jump, which will give you a decent jump that will clear gaps and stop you mid air without fall damage.

Throughout my time playing this game, both online and off, I've found that it is pleasantly familiar and yet happily separate from similar titles of the same genre, offering a diverse story and fully functioning modification support for the PC Platform.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game itself has many items outside of its various Stories and Quests that allow a player to forge a Universe of their own making, with varying enemies, planets, explorative options and items to defeat, explore, identify and craft throughout their time in their 'World'.\n\n[b]Multiplayer[/b] is also well-integrated and allows players to expand this Universe to others, either working together or against each other in a bid to reach The Ark and defeat the Ruin.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nWhere do I begin? With variances included, full tracks and explorative segments there are [i]hours[/i] of symphonies to enjoy, relax to or run away from particularly awkward bosses all whilst praying to RNGesus. I have no qualms with the music developed for Starbound and find that each individual track fits it's given purpose and placement spectacularly well.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nWhile short, the main Starbound quest takes the player on an adventure that I haven't found so wonderfully executed across other mediums before. With few chapters and many advancement options, these large questlines allow this short story to span an era and gives the player more than enough time to develop their Universe while following them. The player in essence, is trying to save the Universe and avenge the Fallen whilst rebuilding colonies and establishing new dominions so that life might thrive where the Ruin would seek to take it. I've played through this story multiple times now and each one seemed different from the last and yet always as great as before.\n\n[h1]Playability[/h1]\nWith both Controller and K/M support Starbound supports the Player's platform of choice. The game itself has staggering physics (as much as a 2D game can!), an intuitive combat system and a steep, yet memorable learning curve for items much like its aforementioned competitors. I found Starbound easy to 'conquer' as such and was able to successfully introduce it to several friends who still play it months later.\n\n[h1]Personality[/h1]\nWhether you're working with the standard character list or some introduced via Modifications, Starbound offers the Player a chance to alter their game through the usage of different races that have different Combative and Utility abilities that can assist the player in their travels. These definitely make a difference and I fully recommend that players have some time on Easy running around to see which best fits their style!\n\n[h1]TL;DR?[/h1]\nStarbound is a fantastic game, with beautiful graphics, music and stories.

It exceeds expectations in so many areas, yet still manages to come up short in many others. It's a very ambitious game, that's for sure, it always has been. I remember the early days of this game, when it showed so much promise. There was no storyline, no scanning missions, nothing like that. It was just you, your ship, and the universe. You would progress by mining materials and beating bosses to upgrade your gear. It was very much \"Terraria in Space\". But now it's somewhat different. It grew into something different and established its own identity, both for better and for worse. \n\nIt offers a storyline that serves both as a narrative to give the player incentive to continue, as well as to streamline the process of progressing from system to system to help the player understand how the difficulty progression works. The narrative itself shows some promise at the beginning, but it ends up falling flat at the very end. As for the missions to guide the player through the story, well... It's just scanning items found in the cities of each of the races (aside from Novakid, for some reason). That's it. While I understand the reasoning behind this decision, it's just... not very fun at all. You're supposed to get that planet's \"Tier Mineral\" (Tungsten, Titanium, Solarium, Etc.) before taking on that tier's dungeon, which is why they have you do these missions, but I just feel like the scanning missions aren't any good. I feel like it would have been better if the mission was to just land on the planet, find a civilization and talk to an NPC, have another mission to gather a certain amount of that planet's \"Tier Mineral\", then allow the player to take on the next dungeon. At least, that's how I'd do it.\n\nAs for the exploration, it's utterly fantastic... at first. There's a sense of wonder and excitement jumping from planet to planet at the start, but it begins to wear off after you discover the same types of large structures over and over again on each planet. There's quite a bit of variety between the different types of planets, but when it comes to a single planet type, there really isn't too much to write home about, unless you're exploring underground, where you can find all sorts of weird structures and biomes.\n\nWhen it comes to performance... yikes. It's got some major issues in the optimization department. It has some strange stuttering and freezing issues at seemingly random points, though thankfully in my experience they've been very infrequent. However, this does not negate them entirely. Multiplayer is a bit of a mess too, especially when it comes to hosting modded dedicated servers. Thankfully, the community has made tools that makes this much easier, but it doesn't fix the fact that the multiplayer connectivity is very shaky, even with the best setup.\n\nDespite all of this... I still find myself wanting to play this game. Despite all my gripes above, despite me thinking that it has some really questionable design choices, and coming up short in several areas... I get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. The possibilities for construction are utterly astounding. There are so many block types and styles, you can build almost anything you can think of. The inventory system is pretty nice too. While it takes some getting used to, having things separated by item types allows for better organization, and makes the sheer number of items you can find a lot less intimidating. I think that above all else, though, the modding community is what makes this game exceptional. The sheer amount of variety and potential that is squeezed from this game with the mods is utterly astounding. People creating their own dungeons, races, storylines, planet types, progression systems, all sorts of things. It's absolutely insane how much the community has done with a concept like this.

I thought this game was going to suck.\nI read most of the bad reviews saying that \"Chucklefish has bad management\" and \"This is just another terraria clone.\"\nBut you know what?\nIt doesn't.\nAfter reading most of the bad reviews, I had already removed the game from my wishlist. Until a friend of mine said I needed to get this game, me being the open-world loving exploration enthusiast that I am. So I said, and I quote, \"Yeah, whatever mate.\"\nAnd I got it. And I played it. And oh god did I love it. \nWhen I play a video game, I try not to get caught up in the developer drama. There are a plethora of stories on this game page about how Chucklefish \"missed their chance\" at increasing their popularity, and how the hype \"waned out and died.\" I like to look past all of that. Same with Arkham Knight, the shitty PC port that it was. I played it, I liked it, and I didn't have to get caught up in all of that developer drama. And it's the exact same with Starbound.\nIf you look past the early access hell this game is going through, it's a really good game. It's fun to play around in, build in, and generally explore.\nAnd it would be telling a lie if I said that the whole few hundred billion or however many unique variations of planets there are fact didn't impress me.\n- Great music, although often repeats.\n- Tons of biomes on different planets to explore.\n- A surprisingly rich backstory, although the only way you could find this backstory is from randomly dropped codexes :(\n- Randomly generated temples, tombs, castles, villages, research facilities among others are always a blast to explore.\n- Surprisingly challenging for an open world platformer. (EDIT: That is, if you choose the normal mode.)\n- There is no story. Litterally. You're planet explodes, your ship is broken, you fix it, and do quests for people around an interstellar outpost. (Not a very impressive one, I might add.) (And I also imagine that Chucklefish will be expanding on the story as they go, if Starbound ever makes it out of EA.)\n- Randomly generated guns and swords are fun to collect. (also, the cosmetic armors are super awesome once you collect a full set.)\n- Easter eggs. Everywhere.\nIn conclusion, you should get Starbound if you like exploring cool looking planets, collecting unique and fun to use items, and overall having fun killing unique monsters, looting enemy bases (and maybe a few friendly ones along the way), screwing around and decking out your space ship (Also, did I mention the ships? There are eight tiers to a ship, and once you get to your eighth tier, it's a blast decorating it.).\nIf you play games for story, dialogue, immersion and sidequests with a lot of effort put into it, this isn't the game for you.\nYou can listen to the bad reviews if you want, but what I'm trying to say is that it's not as bad a game as they say it is, for the reasons listed above.\nBut overall, it's a great game, and I do recommend it.\nAnd it's not even finished yet!", "timestamp_created": 1451794555, "timestamp_updated": 1451794555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 285, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878204464912414551", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32204171": {"recommendationid": "32204171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112362227", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 17645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9461, "last_played": 1698352889}, "language": "english", "review": "Although it gets boring fast if you're alone,add in a few mods like Frackin' Universe,get a friend or two to play with you and you're really going to enjoy the game,I'd give it a 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1496683027, "timestamp_updated": 1496683027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 399, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.876687943935394287", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38243287": {"recommendationid": "38243287", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996745990", "num_games_owned": 668, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 19955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16438, "last_played": 1610897499}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been longing to create a review for this game for quite a while now, and so instead of waiting more and more, I'll write it now.\nBecause of my laziness, I'll be making this a con/pros review, explaining different parts a little more than just two words.\n\nPROS\n- Very high replayability (No matter how many times I go back to this game, I always find myself enjoying it as much as I have in a previous playthrough)\n\n- Compelling exploration (Almost everytime I land on a planet, I find myself discovering things I may have never seen before even after so many hours, both unique items or structures)\n\n- Character ability addons (As you progress through the game, more and more abilities are revealed to you allowing you to modify your character to traverse better depending on your play style)\n\n- Infinite planets (You'll never run out of planets to explore since the planets are basically infinite)\n\n- Many planet types, biomes and sizes (There's a huge amount of unique biomes you will run into when going through several planets, and the planet types add more atmosphere to it whether it'd be a planet mostly made up of water, or a planet with mass plantation for a more jungle-esque atmosphere. Planets also have different sizes, some being huge whereas some could be small)\n\n- Beautiful soundtrack (Every soundtrack in this game seems to fit wherever you hear it, the day themes, the night themes, and even the boss battle themes)\n\n- Great community (The community seems very nice on most of the forums I've visited, or even ingame. Members of the community even show off coordinates for unique planets or interesting things they've found in their playthrough, which means if you ever need a specific structure or item, there's almost always coordinates for a planet that has what you need provided by the community itself)\n\n- Amazing modding community and support (There are some very game changing or game improving mods out there which you can also mix and match with other mods. If you're looking for a sandbox experience with a lot of modding compatibility, this game is very good at doing that)\n\n- Great multiplayer (You can create a server for you and your friends without having to port forward or use other software to connect. On top of this, connection doesn't seem to be too big of an issue since I almost never notice anyone having bad ping or connection overall)\n\n- Randomly generated gear (Weapons you find in chests or from enemy drops always use randomly generated stats unless they're unique weapons)\n\n- Quests and side quests (The game has a lot of side quests along with the main quests. Each of these quests are rewarding in some way, some giving out bigger rewards and some smaller rewards)\n\n\nCONS\n- Limited story (Although the game itself has a main story, it isn't exactly the best. The story feels a little rushed and lacks depth, always feeling very straight forward or even a little random at some points. Along with this, some of the objectives you go through to continue the story feels like they're copy paste, meaning one objective feels like another objective you've already done just slightly changed. This game isn't very well suited for people looking for an interesting story)\n\n- Some modding issues (The game will often crash if two mods don't go well together, especially if they're both changing a feature at the same time. This can however be avoided as long as you don't subscribe to mods that aren't compatible with another mod or the version of your game)\n\n- Slow progression at the start (New players will often find themselves progressing very slowly at the start, and even players who are returning to the game may experience that the progression is quite slow at the start. The game requires you to go through a couple of chores at the start before you can do much)\n\n- Repetitive combat (Although combat can feel somewhat satisfying almost always, you'll realise that the combat is very repetitive mostly when it comes to melee weaponry. There aren't very many \"special\" attacks for melee weaponry or ranged weaponry, meaning you mostly just have to spam your left click on a target)\n\n- Re-used enemy sprites, or enemies in general (Every now and then when you start exploring a planet, some of the enemies you see have already appeared on a previous planet, and this seems to happen frequently with planet wildlife)\n\n\nThat's about all I can think of in my 270+ hours I've put into this game.\nIn conclusion, the game is amazing if you really like exploration, amazing community, sandbox-esque games, RNG type stuff, character development, and overall a game to come back to over and over again rather than a game heavily based on story and non-RNG elements.", "timestamp_created": 1513026197, "timestamp_updated": 1513529416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 140, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875542640686035156", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94353788": {"recommendationid": "94353788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044985557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 2732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1023, "last_played": 1624923695}, "language": "english", "review": "Reviews concerning the nature of a game's development are as relevant to a purchaser as the contents of the game. Flagging such reviews as this one as \"off-topic\" is such a disgusting attempt at censorship.\n\nBritish developer Chucklefish solicits members of its modding community, some of which are children, for the full legal transfer of their original, player-made content without financial compensation. Ex-developers and modders have come forward with this information, but much of it still hasn't reached the public. \n\nDamon Reece, lead writer of Necrobarista, worked on Starbound at age 16 for \"hundreds of hours without seeing any kind of monetary compensation\" over the span of two years. Founder of Igloosoft Games, Rho Watson, also corroborated Recee's story, shedding more light on her experience with Chucklefish's exploitative staff and management: \"Management's attitude was \"if you care so much, pay them out of your share,\" despite the fact that 1) they were earning 5x as much as me and 2) I'd been told at every turn that I wasn't part of the company and had no say in it.\" \n\nChucklefish's response to the unpaid Starbound developer's allegations follow: \n\n\"During this time both the core crew and community contributors were collaborating via a chat room and dedicated their time for free. Community contributors were under no obligation to create content, work to deadlines, or put in any particular number of hours. Everyone was credited or remunerated as per their agreement.\"\n\nWhat makes this statement egregious, is that a year after this controversy occurred, Chucklefish continues to behave exploitatively. RyuujinZERO, creator of the Avali mod, was solicited via Skype by Chucklefish to hand over his IP for nothing less than \"credit\" and \"exposure,\" being refused any form of financial compensation in the process.\n\nThe relationship between Chucklefish and its modding community is a very problematic one. The company has no qualms with profiting off of the labor of their customers, and will continue steadfast in this direction. This kind of behavior isn't ethical, nor is it worth supporting. \n\n[b] For this reason, I do not recommend the purchase of this title if you're just discovering it.

It was suppose to be more open, customizable, capable of replicating that Ultima Online feeling. It was going to be grittier. With a good storyline.\n\nThen they got famous, and big. They moved into the studio in the UK I believe and that's when it went downhill. The races were sanitized, everything was made generic. \nUSMC? - Humans and earth are now some generic space federation. Big Brother is no longer powerful, big ape is fake. Florans aren't so bad. Forget that whole feud they had with the fish people. They had a chance to make a believeable, dark world and fill it with interesting stuff to keep people around. Better server tools and cooperative tasks.\n\nThe biggest issue is they set artificial timelines they knew were going to be unrealistically. People were requesting refunds. They rushed development and kicked things out the door. Novakids were suppose to release at launch, for example. The stated post released. People started refunding again. They changed their mind and threw things together haphazardly. They completely renegged on goals too and pissed off the community:\n\n1) They were suppose to have space stations that you could build and your guild/etc would be able to work with. This was largely replaced with the space asteroid that you can't modify.\n\n2) Space Pokemon not in the game. Capturing creatures became a thing, but battling other players and stuff which seemed implied largely didn't happen. They're just cosmetic.\n\n3) When people bought the game, instead of using money to finish the game, chucklefish used the money to publish other games for other companies, and largely dropped this game. They literally took advantage of people's good faith to give themselves a leg up. This also includes other projects like wayward tide.\n\n4) Constantly gas-lighting people with the release date, changing information and telling people they were wrong to expect things that they themselves stated they should expect.  Including not letting people play early saying the game was unplayable, yet at the same time, letting Yogscast and crew playing the game on steam.\n\n5) Making this a steam-only release.\n\nAnd despite all this, years later, the game hasn't had a polish pass. The support of the game after release or even an attempt at making the game feel more complete was largely ignored. I enjoyed playing this game, and the modding community is great.

After all, Starbound is kind of like Terraria on steroids - it's bigger, and it actually has a quest component to it.\n\n[h1]Starbound vs. Terraria: Gameplay Differences[/h1]\n\nEven on the easiest setting, Starbound plays like Terraria Hardmode from the very beginning. There's a difference between 'hard' and 'obnoxious', though, and in my opinion, this game is in the 'hard' category. You'll have to get on your feet and learn how things work, but thankfully, this is easy to do as the game will guide you with a tip every time you discover a new item or action for the first time. \n\nIf you've already played Terraria, you'll know how to jump right in to Starbound. The game mechanics are practically identical when it comes to mining, taking items, building houses and fighting enemies. It's bascially \"another take on Terraria,\" as you'll see very quickly. \n\nStarbound has a bigger emphasis on food than Terraria. Food seemed nearly worthless after awhile in Terraria, but it is a necessity here -- especially on the harder tier, where you'll starve to death...this doesn't happen in the easiest mode, though. You'll start off finding and knowing about basic food, but different recipes will unlock as you discover other ingredients and make new items. Food not only increases health, but gives perks and stat boosts as well. Even on the easiest setting, food rots if you hold on to it for too long. \n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\n\nCombat is highly simplistic in Starbound, it is nothing more than hack & slash for the most part. Some monsters attack by nature, some don't, but the majority of them will simply chase you down and slam into you when attacked, making combat predictable and repetitive in this game. \n\nUnlike Terraria, you'll be able to access guns and other exotic items pretty quickly, unlike in Terraria where you have to complete a good portion of the game to unlock certain NPCs. For the most part - one handed swords swing quickly and allow you to use a shield in the other hand, but they are weak and will require many 'hits' to kill an enemy. Two-handed swords are slow, but do far more damage than a one-handed. Other weapons like axes and hammers require you to pull back the weapon with your mouse, and release to swing. Guns allow ranged attacks but are extremely weak and will require many shots to take an enemy down, but will allow you to do it from a safe distance. In the beginning, you'll want to stay far, far away from any enemy that has a gun - especially if it's a sniper rifle.\n\n[h1]Look & Feel[/h1]\n\nStarbound has the look and feel of an early 90s PC or SNES game, kind of like something made by Ocean or Sierra, as opposed to Terraria's more pixellated NES feel. Lots of quiet, soothing piano music. \n\nStarbound's \"monsters\" look like Pokemon rejects, which kind of gave the game its own characteristic. I prefer the huge range, style and diversity of Terraria's creatures more. Trees fall sideways when cut, and you'll be surprised when you see your first landslide when you're mining underground and hit a ceiling with loose rock or slime. This game has the same \"biome\" style regions as Terraria, where you'll venture from a forest to a jungle, or from a cavern to a slime pit, and eventually down to magma. Dig too far down and you'll fall prey to a long drop that leads directly to an infinite ocean of lava at the planet's core.\n\nStarbound's building mechanics are more simplistic than Terraria's for the simple reason of hammers: they allowed you to hit blocks into \"angles\" and make tons of different and unique designs, corners and slopes in Terraria. No such thing exists in Starbound, where you can only place items in square blocks. There's no \"corruption\" or \"crimson\" style event that you'll have to worry about in Starbound, so, create what you want and don't worry about what will happen to it mid-way through the game.\n\n\nFor the most part, you take take or steal almost everything you see in Starbound, just like you can in Terraria, except on main missions (for example, your first real mission, The Outpost, where all of the chairs/beds/consoles/etc are locked down and immobile). For items that you can't craft, you may come across blueprints which are one-use items that instantly add the item to your list of craftables, one you have the necessary tool to do so.\n\nWhen it comes to crafting, everything works pretty much the same between the two games. Craft a workbench-style item and it will allow you to create new items. In Starbound, you can upgrade these existing tool stations with specific materials to make better items. You'll find that in order to do this, better ore from outside your solar system is necessary.\n\n[h1]What I Liked The Most About Starbound[/h1]\n\nThere are a few things that set Starbound apart from Terraria in my mind - the game's universe seems bigger and more \"involved,\" because it simply is...you're no longer stranded on a single game world of small/medium/large that's created from the main menu, but an entire 'universe' is created for you when you first start a Starbound quest. You'll get your own spaceship, which can be decorated like a house, and will take you around the solar system without costing you any fuel. To see how big the game world is, zoom out of the solar system and take a look at the universe to see the other star systems and the planets in them. It's an exciting thing to figure out on your first play through.\n\nI like the increase in difficulty that Starbound has vs. Terraria - it's easy to adjust to, and it makes you appreciate the simpler things more. Getting a better weapon is a gigantic milestone in this game, since they are far more difficult to find than in Terraria, and random chests don't usually mean uber weapons are in them...but, mediocre ones, or weapons that are only marginally better at one thing, but worse at another (damage vs. speed). You won't be crafting better weapons and armor for quite awhile - at least, until you get the courage to leave the solar system - so, you'll spend a lot of time mining and looking for abandoned outposts.\n\nBeing able to build structures to your liking and rent them out to alien tenants really takes the game to a new level.\n\n[h1]What I Disliked The Most About Starbound[/h1]\n\nThe game has objectives and a questline for you to go through, which makes the game more interesting rather than Terraria's \"grind and get more powerful\", which becomes stale through time. While there are plenty of boilerplate \"fetch\" quests in Starbound, they'll force you to check out locations you haven't seen yet. \n\nLike all games with \"procedural\" quests and worlds, things get stale and unimpressive quickly. The random \"mix and match\" monsters in the game look ridiculous and have no real character. Random planets mix and match backdrops, trees and ground tiles which would seem to add diversity, but it kind of fails to do so.\n\nThe one thing that disappointed me are Starbound's \"parallax\" backdrops which look very infantile compared to the foreground objects - it's like having a children's cartoon backdrop in the background with foreground objects that are more serious and detailed, and it just doesn't \"fit.\" Many of the biomes in this game are flat out horrible...such as, trees with eyeballs growing on them, and others with wacky neon colors and stripes that look like they came out of that Beetlejuice cartoon from the late 80s. I would have really preferred a consistent, serious look for the game. \n\nOverall, if you loved Terraria but got tired of it, you won't want to miss this one - it's a bigger 'take' on Terraria with a lot of bonuses that keep the game interesting.

Then go another planet and scan more crap rinse and repeat till the final fight and that is it.. \n\nnow for MODDED game play i feel Starbound has up'ed it's game by leaps and bounds, there is a fantastic mod for this game called Frakin Universe, it over hulls the game by what i feel is 50x better then the vanilla version, adding new races to play as (also adding rascal stat buffs and debuffs for each race) , new start, new ships and even the option to custom build your ship, hundreds (if not more) of new weapons, armors, powers, and items, along with lots of new quest style missions, planets, bioms, monsters, boss's, it makes the game just SO much more fun to play.\nI played a full vanilla play through of Starbound and it took me about 40h of game play to unlock everything the game had to offer, i then put the FU mod on and started a new game and DAM 760+ hours in and i still feel like there is so much more i have not seen yet.. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes survival sandbox style games but also HIGHLY recommend playing with the Frakin Universe mod sense it's free to download and just makes the game better in every way.", "timestamp_created": 1650859590, "timestamp_updated": 1650859590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865916311740875244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69526212": {"recommendationid": "69526212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065334185", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 34502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17146, "last_played": 1675478480}, "language": "english", "review": "[i][b]tl;dr[/b] Terraria in space. Can't say it doesn't try, but it certainly feels like a game that doesn't quite know what to do with itself. Story is bland, repetitive mush, the core gameplay loop is unsatisfying, and the game runs abhorrently for being a 2D sprite-based game, but the huge array of blocks and furniture will keep builders entertained, and the combat is just good enough to be enjoyable. If you care about employee ethics however, Chucklefish has a very poor track record, and I can't recommend you buy this game if you don't like giving morally questionable devs your money.[/i]\n\nLemme first preface this by saying that I refuse to judge games based off how many mods they have. While it's great that Starbound has by far some of the best mod support of any block-based sandbox game, I'm reviewing only what Chucklefish made here, and what they made... It's a frustrating mixed bag. I can see little moments of brilliance that hint at how this game could've been so much more, and yet, as it is, it feels like it's lacking quite a bit.\n\nStarbound is a 2D Metroidvania-esque sandbox, taking a lot from Terraria--after all, Chucklefish was founded by and mostly consists of folks who previously worked on Terraria. You have a starship which is capable of travelling to any planet, asteroid field, or other notable celestial body in a solar system; you can travel to other star systems as well, but it costs Erchius Fuel to do so, which can be mined from moons (which happens to be an absolutely terrifying experience) or purchased at the Outpost, a hub of shops and quest-related stuff. The general gameplay loop is to mine for your current planet's top-shelf ore, craft a new tier of gear, craft a Protection Pack which lets you survive the next planet you have to go to, go to that planet, rinse and repeat.\n\nSo what makes this game feel so empty? The way I described this gameplay loop doesn't make it sound like a bad thing, right? Well... I think it has to do with the fact that you do this every single time with almost no variation. Terraria will shake things up constantly; you'll be mining only about 30% of the time, and the rest of that time is filled with god-knows-what. Starbound meanwhile gives you no real incentive to do anything but mine and get better gear; there are no unique NPC's with important items that you have to build houses for--only generic, randomly-generated ones. The main story does not at all help with this either, as it is almost as repetitive as this cycle of mining--scan items, teleport to dungeon (although the dungeons can admittedly be pretty neat), fight boss, repeat. This doesn't even begin to describe how uninspired the whole thing is as well, and its lack of cohesion; you mean to tell me this literal antithesis to a god that ate the Earth and the entire solar system for lunch can be easily defeated by some jackass with a glorified pickaxe and some machine pistols?\n\nSome other gripes while I'm at it... The game runs [i]horribly[/i]. I was on a Ryzen 5 3600X with 32GB of RAM at the time of writing and this game can [i]barely[/i] push 60FPS in ideal conditions. I get a \"gloriously\" cinematic 20-30FPS on my densely populated ship, and on top of this the game tends to hiccup like GTA V. Honestly, this game might run worse than Yandere Simulator; at least that game has an excuse because it's in 3D. This is a goddamn 2D sprite-based game and it's running about the same or even worse. There are mods to fix it--when doing a new playthrough with friends, we installed a modpack that included performance optimizations, and thanks to that as well as an upgrade to a Ryzen 9 5900X, I was actually able to lock the game at 60FPS for the first time ever. [i]But you shouldn't ever [b]need[/b] a $550 USD workstation CPU, just to make a 2D sprite-based sandbox from 2016 run at 60FPS.[/i]\n\nAnother thing I hate are the crafting times; they weren't in the game back when it was in beta. You are [i]forced[/i] to just sit there with the crafting window open and wait for it to finish; if you close the window you cancel the crafting process. Wanna do a large-scale crafting project? Have fun waiting for each one of the 999 blocks to craft, dipshit. Some crafting stations also can take as long as 10 seconds to craft, which is just utter lunacy. It was so unbearable that I got a mod specifically to remove the crafting timers.\n\nThere are some absolutely brilliant things Starbound does though which make me wish the game was better, however. Unlike the janky nightmare that is Minecraft's Redstone or the tedious (although less so thanks to the Grand Design) process that is Terraria's wiring, Starbound's is dead simple--select wiring tool, select host, select target, connect the two directly with an invisible wire. That's it. [i]That's all.[/i] Additionally, it's almost always possible to return to your ship at any time with the press of a button--a far cry from Terraria requiring you to have a Magic Mirror or quit and restart to quickly return home, and especially from Minecraft, which basically just says \"don't get lost in the first place then\" or forces you to take a lava bath if you have keepInventory on. Placing walls is far more intuitive than Terraria too; left-click to place the building material as a block, right-click to place it as a wall. This is such an enormous improvement from Terraria where I keep getting stuck with odd numbers of walls left meaning I can't convert them all back into blocks. Another cool thing is how all your characters share the same universe, meaning that it's totally possible to have them all converge on a single planet; it makes you feel like the universe is more alive. All in all, these quality-of-life tidbits make Starbound [i]the[/i] example for other block-based sandboxes to follow when it comes to these aspects.\n\nStarbound kinda feels like... If Bethesda made Terraria. Sure there's a lot to do on paper--in fact, there's an infinite amount of stuff to do on paper, thanks to repeatable quests. But all those quests are served to you by generic NPC's and are just one of the same few tasks repeated ad nauseam. The game feels unfocused, like it doesn't know what to do with itself, and it can't be motivated enough to really encourage you to do the myriad of things you actually can do in it.\n\nAnd yet I still got almost 300 hours out of it. And that's because if there's one thing Starbound is good at, it's being a creativity tool for builders. The enormous variety of blocks and furniture combined with the simplicity and effectiveness of the building system allows for some incredible constructions--although you'll need to motivate yourself to do so, as your only real motivation the game provides are generic NPC's and a pitiful amount of rent. The combat also happens to be [i]just[/i] good enough to be a decent time; while the standard weapons are cookie-cutter with randomized stats a la Borderlands (except the manufacturer doesn't even matter), some of the unique weapons are very enjoyable to mess around with.\n\nSo... Do I recommend Starbound? Sure. It's far more flawed than Minecraft and Terraria, yes. But if you're okay with making your own fun, and you can get into a zen mindset for the more mindless parts of its gameplay, Starbound will be a reasonably fun experience for you.\n\nBy the way... I should mention that the folks at Chucklefish aren't exactly good people, by... Any stretch of the imagination.

They added a story, that heavily slows down progress, that every time you add mods, becomes a longer task. They used mods that people created without crediting them in order to make this game bigger; never paying the developers for any of the things they created for this game. But worst of all, you can spend hundreds of hours in this game, report a bug or complain about it on the forums, just for some newbies to tell you that they haven't experienced the bug yet so they don't believe the bug exists. When I mentioned that cloud saves and proper backups are effectively the bare minimum for sandbox games on Steam, so that people do not lose their work, the community went apeshit and said that I had no idea what being a developer was like.\n\nHere's a link. https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloud\nNow, at one point a person told me that I couldn't understand how universe files take up so much space. I can. Why can't a person save their character and certain worlds onto a cloud, in the same way Terraria can? A lot of the more against-cloud people will say because it isn't the same. It takes too much space. In the storage, under the Starbound folder, there are individual files for each world. These files are less than 40KB a piece, for the most part. My character file for my character, similarly, less than 40KB. All of these individual files, sure, add up. But why can't I save the *individual* files, which are clearly present and are actually there? When I ask that, I get no answers. I get no real responses.\n\nI'm going to allow comments on this. The community is extremely toxic for whatever reason, and they don't understand video game development. They just know they like the mechanics of this game. They don't know that Starbound can be criticized for obvious flaws that should have been fixed, but weren't because Chucklefish preferred to steal mods than actually develop their game.\n\nMy review would change to positive, if they fixed this. But then again, this is a game where the primary solution I find for a lot of small issues (like searching why a bounty isn't letting me follow it to the next planet) lists deleting the character and universe folders to fix a small issue.

Nightly is the most glitched, as it's updated every midnight, so play nightly at your own risk. I play Unstable and they just gave it an update, the addition of quests has changed the game quite a bit, there are now quests as opposed to just 'get this ore, build this thing, repeat'.

Generic environments with generic dungeons and towns, repetitive and boring combat, shoehorned and unengaging story gates your progress constantly.\n\n\nLet me start this review off with a little nostalgia from my first experiences with the game. I played - and loved - the Koala builds. Every planet was different, with different creatures and different landscapes and colours. It was nice. I didn't know what I was going into, and that was great because each experience was a new one!\n\nHowever, I feel the direction the game's taken is downwards. Planets are now segregated into different types, and each one has essentially the same thing to expect.\nA lush planet has a mine and some ruins. A forest planet has a swamp and some frogs, maybe a few Avians. A snow planet has llamas and some monkeys.\nThis happens again and again and again, and while the terrain is varied and gives a hint of adventure to the \"exploration\", seeing the same rebel camp or monster-filled mine or generic temple over and over again gets boring, fast. Seriously, on every planet, you'll be sure to find the same thing in a different shape.\n\nThis is a weakness that demonstrates itself in spades when you begin to actually explore the universe.\n\nAdditionally, there's the problem of the combat system. Throughout the course of your exploration, you're constantly thrown the same preset enemy with the same preset fly-towards-you-and-do-damage-on-contact tactic. (I'm exaggerating here, but still, there is a shameless amount of monsters which simply run, hop or fly at you and deal damage as soon as they touch you.)\nMore creatures with mechanics like the Poptop, who come at you slow but do a lot of damage when they charge, would be a lot more fun, and would make the fighting more engaging than \"this creature runs at you and mobs you until you die, kill it\".\nThere is so much more that could be done with the system, and it shows with the complexity and variety of weaponry in the game, but the way that every monster attacks you is insultingly and unfittingly simplistic! It's also annoying to get cheap-killed on a regular basis, and degrades the gameplay significantly when it literally starts punishing you for daring to venture from your house on your starting planet.\n\nFinally, there's the problem of the story being shoehorned into everything you do. I don't know about you, but I play Starbound to build pretty things and venture out into the unknown. Unfortunately, the game forces you into the shoes of a superhero, and it constantly rubs me the wrong way.\nI couldn't give half a damn about the fate of the universe. I play this game to build and chill out. Maybe that's an incredibly shallow way to play a game, but it's just the way I play. Unfortunately, the way the devs have implemented the story is annoying and broken, disallowing you to actually explore, instead holding your hand like a gameplay-long tutorial level.\nI don't care for the story because it's inconvenient and slow to work through, gating your progress while never bothering to actually engage you outside of \"save the universe from Cthulu\".\n\nI don't think there's any more that I can say other than please, for the love of God, Chucklefish. Make the worlds more wild and varied. Add more building configurations. Make some biomes NOT spawn buildings as often - people don't need to live everywhere. Reduce the spawn rates of your preset creatures and work on the combat - it's boring and it starts to grate after a while.\nAnd, please, make the story optional. It's so painfully linear and shallow that it feels like I'm trying to read a children's book than play a game.\n\nPlease make this game fun again. I'm starting to get sick of installing mods and turning off monster spawning just to have a nice time.\n\n\nADDENDUM:\nAbout two weeks of experience with the game later, and my opinion hasn't changed - though I can certainly list out some good aspects of the game:\n\nBASE BUILDING\nThe wide range of blocks and items, and the option to have NPCs inhabit things you create, makes for a fun and relaxing to play. My only gripe is that the interactions are far too shallow, and the radiant quests have a very, very limited range.\n\nMODDING\nModding is absolutely amazing in this game, and is exactly as advertised. While confusing and frustrating occasionally, modding is incredibly flexible and often instantaneously satisfying.\nAlso, the ability to add mods to the game to flesh out your experience is rather pleasant.\nUnfortunately, it's the most fun I've had with the game thus far.\n\nIf something passes my mind, I'll add it to this addendum.

Think of it as you being compared to your brilliant cousin, that is Terraria, but you told your parents that you wanted to be an astrophysicist, not a best-seller fantasy novel writer. The difference being, Terraria fulfilled, or even surpassed, its parents expectations. While you, Starbound, are potentially stunted because you had to do odd jobs here and there, and kind of missed all the things that's required for you to be an aspiring astrophysicist.\n\nPositive things:\n\u2022 Starbound's art direction is visually pleasing. Thematically on point, and I have no qualms on the visual department. I like the pixel art, I like the ambiances, I like how they portray space and its inhabitants.\n\u2022 Simple narrative to follow, nothing too convoluted. It's much easier to digest or follow compared to its cousin. You're a Protectorate graduate, who just happened to have a sh*t luck. You begin your adventure with basically nothing but your matter manipulator. And you're kind of free to do whatever you want from the get go.\n\u2022 The music! Oh my God, the music! Curtis Schweitzer has absolutely made Starbound even grander that it should have been. Without his music, exploring barren planets would be boring as hell. The sound department is also on point!\n\u2022 The space is vast, random, and there are like more than thousands of planets to explore, with unique items, inhabitants, dungeons, and quests. This is where, I think, Starbound has the upper hand. The variety satisfies my thirst of exploring. And if you're considering mods, Frackin' Universe is one of the best to enhance your experience.\n\u2022 It's a sandbox game, you do whatever you want. You want to be a space-faring adventurer? Fine. You want to settle down on a red planet with cute critters? Fine. You want to be a landlord and collecting payments from NPCs who stay at your accommodations? Suit yourself. You want to explore Glitch Castle to relinquish the crown? Cool. Or you want to go to a speakeasy that's filled with sadistic penguins as regular patrons? Go for it. Or you just want to destroy a planet because you don't like the colour of the dirt? Do it.\n\u2022 So many decorative items to [strike]steal[/strike] collect! Use your matter manipulator to mine or copy them. You can also 3D print most of the furniture that you have encountered.\n\u2022 You can recruit NPCs as your crew member once you beat and spare them, or complete quests from them. They could help you in battle, as additional firepower or someone who could buff or heal you.\n\u2022 The ship customisation! My dream of having my own space ship and designate a room for my crew members to hangout with pinball machine, soda machine, car beds. I could even lease some of my rooms in my space ship to NPCs.\n\u2022 The puzzles in dungeons are quite fun, the boss battles are simplistic but also fun too.\n\u2022 Similar to Terraria, your friend could drop in and drop out very easy in this game when playing multiplayer.\n\nNegative things:\n\u2022 I don't know where to start, but a wasted potential is one of the glaring issues that I found in Starbound. This game could have been Chucklefish's own flagship Terraria-like. The basic stuffs are there, the lore are there, the mechanics are there. The game sorely needs support like how Re-Logic supported Terraria.\n\u2022 Some of the side quests feel fetchy, and that is the nature of randomly-generated quests.\n\u2022 This game sorely needs more variety.\n\u2022 If you have explored the game for more than 40-50 hours, you will feel that you have seen everything the game has to offer.\n\u2022 If you're coming from Terraria, this game would feel like a downgrade, not a side-grade.\n\nI have to highlight I loved the game in itself, not being compared to Terraria, but the similarities are there to be compared, and that's natural. I don't really like Terraria that much, I loved the progression, but always wishing Starbound had more care like Terraria is. I hope Chucklefish would revisit this game or make a sequel to it while addressing the issues that made Starbound feel inferior to its competitors.\n\nDo I recommend this game? It depends. Yes, if you haven't played Terraria and looking for a sandbox metroidvania exploration game. No, if you have played Terraria.

It is a game that truly does live up to the \"freeform gameplay\" tag that a lot of these kind of games claim. The universe is a huge, randomly generated place full of varied planets, moons, anomalies and other friendly (or not so friendly) other ships. It is playable in single-player and also via drop-in-out multiplayer and dedicated servers.\n\nProgression is a really well done mechanic in the game. There is no \"XP\" for tasks at all. You simply get better at doing the things you do by doing them - via better materials, tech and experience. This then allows you to take on greater challenges. The early game consists of \"survival\", where your ship is stranded, orbiting a planet. From here you must gather by mining, looting, exploring and dungeon crawling on the planet to make yourself better gear and establish a foothold. Once you have a base and a way of generating food you can then plan out your next big excursion. This area of the game gives you a good opportunity to explore the systems in place and mess around, without too much hassle. When you feel you are ready to experience the rest of the game you fix your ship and suddenly the game opens up into a much more massive and more complex being, which had me in awe. After that you are free to do whatever you want - you can go for the main quests or choose something else entirely. There is a main storyline, which centers around finding the [strike]infinity stones[/strike] artefacts of 5 different races. This can be tackled at your own pace. The game also offers side quests from planet inhabitants and also the many different species on the \"Outpost\" (an intergalactic shopping mall in space).\n\nYour character can be equipped with a variety of different \"tech\", enhancing their abilities. How about the ability to wall-run, double-jump, dash or even turn into a sticky \"ball\" that can climb up walls and onto ceilings? Your character is further customised with an extensive armour and clothing system, which adds to certain abilities and allows you to enhance the aspect of your character that you want. Melee, ranged, duel-wielding guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, flame-throwers, magical staffs - you name it it has it. Find a play-style that works for you and go nuts with it. The variety here is great.\n\nFairly early on in the game you are also given a Mech - which can be deployed on planets or in space. The mech is particularly useful when mining for ship fuel on moons where there is no atmosphere or boarding other ships and stations to loot, trade or attack. This, like with everything in the game can be upgraded and customised to your liking. Quests also give you access to hiring crew members, which in turn upgrade your ship and give you companions to help you on your travels.\n\nThe crafting and building systems are actually quite detailed. You are given a \"Matter Manipulator\" at the start of the game, which can be upgraded as you play. This is the basic tool you use for terraforming. Later on it can also be used to collect liquids, paint and lay wires to connect objects that interact with each-other. Planets can be changed to your liking - you can create bases, houses, farms or anything else your imagination comes up with. You can even make a business out of it: for example, you can turn your farm into a food business and ship off the food you make for profit or even create housing for the local inhabitants of the planets and become landlord to receive rent. You can even make a zoo, with the intent on harvesting rare materials. There really is so much you can do here that it's mind-boggling to come to terms with the scope. Thankfully, the intuitive building system makes it quick and easy to make things. As you learn additional blueprints and mine more advanced materials you can craft better and better things. Not just buildings either, but armour, weapons, bombs, tools, furniture and technology.\n\nSo, in summary: the game is great. There is an enormous amount of content that will keep you playing for hundreds of hours. Thanks to the addictive and intuitive mechanics in play, it will also keep you coming back for more. Build, craft, loot, explore, hunt, dungeon crawl, run a business empire - it has it all.\n\n[b]Jimbo Rating: 9/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1526283209, "timestamp_updated": 1526284891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858399868011474609", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57033102": {"recommendationid": "57033102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051525875", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 45300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38985, "last_played": 1694816947}, "language": "english", "review": "Terraria has for a long time been one of my favourite games, and if you like Terraria but are looking for a bit... more... then Starbound will have you covered.

While there are many similarities there are also many differences. Here is a list of them\n1. No map: Starbound does not give you any map to work with\n2. Space exploration:  Terraria leaves you to explore 1 world. Starbound however has many many worlds each with unique biomes, ores and craft materials that really reward exploration. \n3. Story oriented: Starbound in much more story oriented then Terraria.  Granted the story in starbound is not the most amazing thing, and sometimes it may feel like a very well designed fetch quest.  Regardless it is enough of a story to keep the game interesting and the first dungeon in particular is amazing.If you like Role Playing you will most likely enjoy the story.\n4 Mechs: Starbound provides an incredibly fun system for building mechs and provides several space exploration missions, where you fly you mech into an enemy ship or space station.  This can be very fun, the only draw back is that the only reason to build your mech is to make a stronger mech.  \n5: mods Integrated and ongoing mod support allows you to do just about anything you want.  I highly recommend Frackin Universe for the hours of content it adds tot he game.  But you can litterally do anything you want with the mods for starbound. you can make it so mechs can come on missions with you, you can add new weapons, new stories, give racial abilities, add races, anything.\n6: Better UI: I have enjoyed the UI in Starbound much mroe then the UI in Terraria.  (and I love Terraria)  it is very user friendly with several quality of life upgrades tot eh system used in Terraria. \n7 Races: starbound starts out with several very fun races, that are incredibly well designed and each have a unique cultures, the only draw back is they do not have special racial abilities.... but there is a mod for that.  Frackin races. \n8: a home ship: you are given a ship at the beggining of the game that you can slowly upgrade and make better and build inside make it your own unique thing. \n\nStarbound adds all of these fun things while also keeping some of the best aspects of Terraria such as well designed fun bosses (In my opinion beter designed bosses) , Wacky weapons, witty puns, detailed and love crafted world building, unique monsters and biomes, and a very fun multiplayer experience.\nWhile starbound started out on a rocky road it has quickly become one of my top 5 games of all time and I highly recomend it.", "timestamp_created": 1527175951, "timestamp_updated": 1527175951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 83, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85781097412109375", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35632320": {"recommendationid": "35632320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026336799", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 59394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56175, "last_played": 1673781046}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't beaten this game yet.", "timestamp_created": 1507700482, "timestamp_updated": 1507700482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 205, "votes_funny": 181, "weighted_vote_score": "0.856196999549865723", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156646864": {"recommendationid": "156646864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083293139", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2163, "last_played": 1706047360}, "language": "english", "review": "When I was in university, this game helped me to start talking to a person who is my husband now.

It has all of the building and mining aspects of Terraria, but the exploratory aspect of it is probably its greatest feature.  While the quests from the NPCs can get redundant after a while (\"go find my friend\", \"go kill this monster\", \"go bring me ore\", \"take this letter to my pal/put the chest they give you in a house/oh, and build me a house\") and the main storyline is fairly straightforward, it's really all about exploring the universe. \n\nThe main quests often send you to find objects and settlements scattered among the stars and, unless you're playing on a server with previously explored worlds, everything is new.  Everything is unexplored.  Sure, you have the option to put down teleportation devices or bookmark coordiates to certain planets, but unless you have a mod enabled that shows you what sort of settlements are on the world, it's anyone's guess what you can find!  The races are all different and have various \"themes\" to them, and searching through villages to find specific furniture pieces for quests is one big scavenger hunt.  The worlds themselves have different biomes and mini biomes, with certain structures appearing only on certain worlds.  The backgrounds and music changes for various biomes, too!  Finally, the map of stars is so massive that you could essentially play for *weeks* trying to visit every single star (not to mention all of the planets, moons, structures, and various cosmic bodies and anomalies within each star's system!).\n\nAnd the monsters.  Don't even get me started on the monsters.\n\nWord to the wise:  if it's cute, 90% of the time, it will try to kill you.  Literally, the amount of damage and bloodlust these things have seem to correlate directly to the ratio of adorableness.  The more you'd like to hug a specific monster, the more it will try to wear your skin as a coat!\n\nI REPEAT:  CUTE = DESTRUCTION AND DEATH\n\nThe good news is you can capture some of the monsters and sic them on your enemies.  Pets don't try to kill you.\n\n...Actually, a good portion of the fun in this game is trying to figure out what can kill you and how to overcome it.\n\n\n\nThe other, less dangerous part of the fun is making the worlds your own!  You can make colonies and build houses, grow crops, even corral livestock of animal products (yes, you can grow crops and flowers just like in Terraria or Stardew Valley, and your \"productive\" animals are insanely difficult to kill).\n\nFor those Animal Crossing fans out there, have you ever wanted to be your own Tom Nook and landlord over an entire plane of peasants?  Well, you can!  Simply build your own simple houses, add furniture, toss in a \"Colony Deed\" to attract a tenant, and Voila!  Instant members of your new colony!  Yes, they will pay you rent, too!  Though, what they pay you in differs every time, it seems (I have more throwing knives than the Addams Family thanks to my Floran tenants).  Certain furniture brings in certain tenants, including some special ones for specific sets.  \n\nPresently, I'm trying to make my own village of Cultists and summon the most tentacled Hylotl tenant I can so I have a whole colony dedicated to my love of H.P. Lovecraft.\n\n\n\n...Now, going back a step...yes, I will admit that playing the main story multiple times may get old.  And you WILL play the game multiple times to try out all of the races, because each race has a different ship type and pet on that ship (the patterns of the pets change each time, and there are dozens upon dozens of ways to make your character look unique).\n\nBecause of this, I suggest trying out mods.  The best ones are Fracking Universe (which has been worked on and updated almost since the game came out) and the race mods that  come with it.  You like dragons?  Well, how about dragons IN SPACE??  It also adds tons of  new missions to the game, as well as overhauls the races by giving them new traits (like have elemental affinities, making them able to eat only certain foods, giving them various skills when it comes to certain weapons).  It also adds new planets and biomes -- some with some very interesting atmospheres.\n\n(I'm looking at YOU, Insanity buff!)\n\nWith all of the new additions on top of the already myriad worlds to explore in the basic Starbound, there is enough content to keep you from ever getting bored with this game.\n\n\n\nThere is so much to explore in this game that you lose yourself in it.  I honestly cannot praise the game (and mod) makers enough for all of the effort they put into this.  It is a very beautiful, 2D world that I feel is an unsung classic.  There is a lot I haven't covered, like gathering crew members and dungeons and the gun-toting penguins, but those you are just going to have to find on your own.  Whether you choose to venture into your own single-player universe or go it multplayer on a server, you're going to have fun.  \n\nThanks for reading this.", "timestamp_created": 1534732946, "timestamp_updated": 1534732946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850921988487243652", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93143589": {"recommendationid": "93143589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247942134", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 18723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16971, "last_played": 1693096814}, "language": "english", "review": "Vanilla game: 2/10, bland, empty, not too much content.\n\nModded game: fucking 10/10, incredible, so much potential for fun and exploration, building, RP, etc. \nThe modding community for this game is unreal, one of the best modding communities I've ever seen for a game.

While many of these negative reviews do address issues with the game, I do not think they are giving Starbound enough credit.\n\n\"Starbound is space Terraria\"\nI do not think it is fair to compare Starbound and Terraria. Yes they are both 16-bit adventure/sandbox games, but each plays very differently. Terraria is more about the gameplay and having fun. Starbound is about the experience. This game throws you into a universe and gives your character a story. Each game is fun in its own way. (On a side note I actually like the combat in Starbound a bit better. Terraria's combat is too \"arcadey\" for me, but that is the appeal of the game for some people).\n\n\"Progression is too fast\"\nI got this game years ago when trying to progress through the game was like trying to swim through maple syrup while handcuffed. I would spend hours looking for enough fuel to jump to the next solar system. Now many people feel that progression is too easy. There is a fine balance between too fast and too slow and it is hard for developers to get it right the first time.\n\n\"Interesting things have been removed\"\nI agree with this to some extent. A while ago there was an update to starbound that added new food and farming mechanics but removed hunger. I was sad because I really liked hunger, but they added hunger back. The devs can always add back old things if they feel like the game needs it. Sure, a lot of cool content was removed, but does anyone mention all of the cool content that was added? Ship upgrading, the outpost, new combat mechanics, etc. Yeah some cool things have been removed, but far more ccol things have been added. Most importantly there is something called modding. If you want temperature back, someone has made a mod for it. Chucklefish has a vision for their game. They felt like Starbound did not need temperature, so they removed it. If you like temperature and feel like it would make the game better, you can add it. Modding is not meant to fix the game, but it can enhance it or alter it towards your specific tastes. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nIn the end I think people are more vocal about what is wrong with the game than what is right, and Starbound doesn't deserve that. Does anyone mention the amazing soundtrack or solid 16-bit graphics? Very few. Yes the game needs critizism, every game does. That is what allows a game to become better. Just remember that this game can be a great experience if you don't just focus on the bad.\n\nTL;DR\nThis game has issues but it also has many great things to offer. Look at more than just the negative reviews and you will find an amazing game.\n\n*Edited to clarify my comments about modding.", "timestamp_created": 1469721449, "timestamp_updated": 1469930003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 286, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850076258182525635", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123000172": {"recommendationid": "123000172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052225865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 126595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 126595, "last_played": 1624956563}, "language": "english", "review": "At times like this I wish there was an in between recommended and not recommended. I've spent 2,000 hours or so in this game, most of which coming from when it was first being developed, and at the time I had high hopes for it. There were a lot of promised features that were meant to be included as the game developed, and in time it became apparent that that just wasn't going to happen. It's been several years since the last update, and at the time of writing this I can safely say that Starbound isn't a bad game, but it definitely isn't that *good* of a game either.\n\n----=== Pros ===----\n[list]\n[*]The playable races. Starbound has six playable races in vanilla. All of which have their own unique set of armors, themed building materials, and furnishings. Mods can add even more playable races.\n[*]Procedural monsters are a fun way to make each planet feel like they have their own unique wildlife.\n[*]Procedural weapons make exploration surprising. You never know when you'll find something much better than what you're using hidden away.\n[*]Recruitable NPCs to take with you where ever is neat, some of the randomly generated designs they have can be really cute.\n[*]The ability to redecorate your ship by tearing down the walls and replacing them with something more suitable for your aesthetic is great. The ship decorating is one of my favorite parts.\n[*]Later game armors branching out into different sets to suit your playstyle is a nice. \n[*]The modding scene is huge. There are hundreds of addons that you can get to make your experience more exciting and more adventurous. It can make for many *many* hours of game play.\n[*]Building is handled very well. Any block can be used as walling. Certain block combinations can look really wonderful when used together to make a building.\n[/list]\n----=== Cons ===----\n[list]\n[*]The game is abandoned. Starbound hasn't been updated in years, and to this day the game is horribly optimized, with bugs that will never be fixed. Multiplayer has been unstable since the beginning, even more so with mods installed. The frame rate being unfixed makes playing with friend who have more or less frames than you a bad time.\n[*]Vanilla on it's own gets very stale rather quickly. There just aren't enough planet types to make exploring feel different. Starbound initially advertised a very large scale planetary adventure with atmospheres more alien in comparison to our own. In the latest build, most of the planets, aside from the alien and midnight worlds, simulate very earth like environments down to their colors. Most grass being green, most dirt being brown, the sky being blue. The universe just doesn't feel as alien as one might expect it to be.\n[*]The game relies way too heavily on modding to be entertaining. Many of the systems in Vanilla don't feel polished or very finished. The crew mates you can recruit were a great idea in theory, but in practice their AI and path-finding just isn't up to code for them to be very useful for exploration or otherwise. The bounty hunting system gets really repetitive much too quickly.\n[*]In the beginning, each race was meant to have their own story missions. Each of them starting with hints of something larger. The avian discovering the worship of Kluex being a conspiracy, to the floran tired of tribal life and wanting to learn, the human fleeing Earth during it's destruction. Each of the races had something deeply unique and interesting within the lore, most of which was much darker in earlier builds. For all of that to be replaced with standardized \"save the universe\" story just feels sad.\n[*]Racial traits were a planned feature that never made into vanilla, unless you want to count the novakid gun crafting and glow in the dark. Each of the races were meant to have strengths and weaknesses that changed how they played.\n[*]Most, if not of interesting planet generation is on the surface. There is no reason to go underground unless you need ores. On top of this, the structures on the surface of planets just aren't different enough from one another most of the time.\n[*]The addition of *unique* creatures makes planets, again, feel too similar to one another. Unique creatures are much more common than procedural creatures making more alien fauna on planets even less common.\n[*]Planet generation was never overhauled to fit the tighter platforming that came with launch, leaving many many steep hills that you're forced to dig through or build over. Vehicles are useless because of this as well.\n[*]Tech before launch was much more varied, most being very different from one another. This would be replaced with standardized techs that behave much too similarly to each other.\n[*]Only a small portion of the 60+ songs in the soundtrack is used in gameplay. Most planets sharing the same music with very few of the biome specific tracks being used.\n[*]Speaking of music, If a song on the planet's day time track list is playing and that same song is on the night time track list it will endlessly play until you leave the planet. This is a bug that has existed since alpha that has never been fixed, and is extremely grating after a while. You should not need to drop what you're doing just because you want to hear different music.\n[/list]\nThere is . . .  much much more that I probably should be mentioning here. However I'm going to be here all day if I include it all.\n\n---=== Conclusion ===---\nStarbound is a game that had potential. It can be fun to play with friends, assuming you all have similar frame rates. Mods are a great addition to the game, but they can't fix the bugs and optimization problems the game has. There was a lot that was promised when this game was being made, however only a handful of the features made it in with several new ones being added toward launch. A lot of said features not receiving polish or even being finished or being replaced with lesser, less iconic versions of what they were planned to be. In the end, Starbound is just an okay game.", "timestamp_created": 1664440212, "timestamp_updated": 1666830328, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 137, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.849167466163635254", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85410787": {"recommendationid": "85410787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044771025", "num_games_owned": 444, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 22065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16905, "last_played": 1703483125}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: The base game is good, modded it is amazing.\n\nPROS:\n- Extremely enjoyable survival mechanics\n- Infinitely large galaxy to explore\n- Great building experience\n- Customizable ships and characters\n- Amazing fun for co-op play\n\nCONS:\n- Shallow combat\n- Short and uninspired story mode\n- Monotonous dungeon instances\n- Clunky controls\n- Semi-poor optimization\n\nOn the surface, Starbound looks like a Terraria IN SPAAACE. While that may hold some merit in describing the game, it's survival features, sprawling universe, interesting creatures, and unique setting do make it stand out. Unfortunately, the game is not without its flaws. It's shallow combat experience, boring dungeons, and clunky controls can be a minor nuisance (seriously, I hate dropping through platforms in this game), but where the game really has issues is with the story missions and optimization.\n\nThe optimization of the game does not prove to be an issue until you start building large communities, or complex bases. At that point, the game starts to have FPS issues, and stutter frequently. Compared to a contemporary like Terraria, which I've never ever seen a frame rate drop, it is sub par. If you're crazy like me and wanted to recreate Coruscant, you will be left disappointed.\n\nThe story missions are not great either. Very uninspired, a lot of fetch quests, and generally you'll be left feeling a little hollow at the end of it all. Yet, there is a solution.\n\nThe game has a diverse modding community with lots of expansion options, and even a complete overhaul that I personally find to be necessary to maximize your game experience. With these mods, or even looking past the blemishes on the base game, it is well worth the full price. I have played countless hours with my brother, friends, and even got a copy for my Girlfriend and she loved every minute of it. \n\nThe building system in this game is great, and logic circuits can make for some fun contraptions. Additionally, I think the building system does have a leg up on contemporaries since you don't need to build separate back walls for your bases. It's just generally fun to build and explore, and you'll find yourself getting more wrapped up in the universe than the story of the game.\n\nSo just get it already.

minecraft you have to remember your coordinates and pray you can make it back without dying unless you want to loose the whole reason you left your home to begin with. terraria you can go infinately in any direction but the problem is you will eventually need to turn back and i know ppl like myself...thats a really long treck back.\n\nstarbound pretty much has given you the vehicle to your dreams. your spaceship can be your home, the universe is your sandbox. want an ice castle? build it. want a giant tree in a sea of tentacle monsters? build it. want a base at the center of the earth where only the monsters that dwell dare approach? do it man its your world(s).\n\nwhen you explore in this game you dont have to worry *oh man am i gonna get lost?* nope. not at all. planets loop back around giving you a sense of the finiteness of a true planet. there is a center to each planet. there are multiple biomes to each planet *though i feel the poison biome needs to back up a bit. its in every planet and the tiny pools are a pain to avoid* ive run into tentacle planets, ice planets, forrests, jungles. ive run into brain planets people, its pretty intense. \n\nmechanics? oh yeah.\njumping in this game doesnt slow or speed you up but when you find a planet with low gravity it changes your perspective of movement. trust me the first time will take you for a ride. there are also things in this game called tech which of any other game would pretty much be special moves but they can open up whole new worlds for you. some techs can let you fly, some just let you move faster. some give you an awesome mechs and others give you the ability to make travel systems. \nfighting mechanics in this game play alot like terraria in the sense that your mouse controls where you shoot, your mouse controls the direction you face and swing and the weapons decide the type of attack you do.\ndid i say its like terraria? oh my its such an upgrade in fighting mechanics. your weapons alone can be so many variations to speed, swing type and secondary abilities. ive played this game for a few weeks now and ive found lightning, fire, poison, knockback, explosions?! and thats just swords!! i havent even started on guns yet!\nguns. the backbone of range. currently there are no recepies to make guns in the game as it stands but the guns are hillariously different. your friend can find a gun that shoots bullets, pretty fast speed and all, you on the other hand may find a bazooka that shoots lazer missiles that light up the sky and explode in blue glowy goodness. each gun has the potential to have different colors to different abilities. the ammo types alone make guns rediculous. i found a gun just the other day that shot stick mines, they fire pretty fast, stuck to walls, and exploded on impact. it was rediculous. \n\nsoundtrack.\noh my the sound track in this game just makes you feel like you really are on an adventure. i will say that there isnt MUCH music as of yet but it is very appropriate when it does play. you get certain music at night, certain music in day. when youre underwanter the music muffles itself so you know, when youre to low in the world the music stops so you know just how deep  you are. battle music is intense, but needs more variation. considering this is only beta and they have this well orchestrated music im dying to see what they do with it\n\nnow on to dungeons.\nhave you ever just walked around and thought *huh this place is pretty barren, i feel like the only person on this planet* starbound can do that, but with a reason. dungeons in this game can be as small as a little trapped apex hut all the way down to a subterranian military base. you can find tombs, bases, ruins, hell i found a dungeon after running into an outhouse all by itself in the field and noticed....is that a sewer down there? indeed it was explorers. packed with poo monsters and sewage blocks. i found that absolutely hillarious.\n\nnpcs. \nas it stands now there arent that many things to do with npcs though you will find in later levels having a chef in your home will be useful since it can sometimes be hard to farm up the necessary food to make the items you need to survive. you cant sell right now but they intend to add that into the game *thank god* and make more functions for ncps. more personality, more function, more life. to put it bluntly i ran into an avian temple with friendly npcs and i climbed all the way to the top. at the top of this building there were two avian saying *im not ready for this* *i thought i had stealed myself for this* they were preparing to jump from the ledge in an act the lore explained simply as \"fly or die\" thats right. the lore in the game actualy is presented by the races that spawn. i found that little story in a book i found in a city of avians, read it, then ran into them afterwards and was astounded by the depth of these people. currently there arent really that many races cities finished but the ones that are are huge. races have their own dungeons as well which can be pretty fun to explore and understand more about them.\n\nbosses and enemies.\nthe enemies in this game litterally are never the same. they can look similar but never the same. the fun part about this is not all monsters will come up to attack you, some are friendly. the actual fun part about this is that cute little squirrel looking creature over there will come to rip your eyes out but the giant spikey girrafe will leave you alone and go about its business. never judge monsters by their appearance, they will always surprise you and their attacks in some cases can be pretty devastating. flying monsters are a pain even with guns sometimes as they can move pretty fast and have pretty hard hitting attacks but little hp. the only thing about them that i find lacking is the attack functions compared to the variety of monsters. most will always charge, few have attacks other than that and they are usually pretty predictable.\nbosses. there are only a few bosses in this game and truely they dont pose much of a threat given the right amount of preperation. the problem i find with this is you spend ALL that time getting resources and then when that fight comes up its just like fighting any other monster just way bigger and harder hitting. i would like to see these bosses upgraded in some way or at least the ones implimented later add in some other features. and to my second point there arent enough boss monsters YET for the entire progression of the game. i suspect they plan to add in bosses for each teir of gear *currently stops at 10* which will be amazing but i hope they make the monsters a little harder to handle giving you a senese of progression. \n\nBUILDING!!!\nas many people who have played minecraft and terraria there is a certain time when you want to settle down and just build a home. fantastic idea. the building in this game is actualy very similar to that of terraria. you have foreground and background to play with. the only real gripe i have about this game so far in this aspect is you cant craft alot of materials to build. you are kinda stuck right now with cobblestone wood and sand for the most part and other terrain materials you pick up as you gather, but the other materials like castle blocks and tomb stones maybe even just some fancy bricks all come from cities and take a HUGE amount of time just to break. now i dont want to be able to make the special stones from dungeons, thats just giving me the game, but there needs to be more than you can make in the ways of craftable building blocks for a player, even if its just by schematic, im cool with this. \nthe smal little decorations you can remake by adding to your 3d printer on your ship and to me, thats good. it keeps my crafting window clean and free of junk that i wanted to store but not see every day....", "timestamp_created": 1389654272,

Every game has its cons StarBound is on the lighter side.\n\n[olist]\n    [*] Quests get repeatative and boring.\n    [*]  Very hard to fight boss battles without friends, It requires alot of progress and items to solo one.\n    [*] Minor Bugs- Sometimes the planet has invisible walls and theres nothing beyond them.\n    [*] Barely any ingame tutorials on how to upgrade,craft and locate items.\n    [*] Some of the achievments require a very very very long time to get.\n    [*] Glitches are a thing in this game and its annoying.\n[/olist]\n\n[h1] My Conclusion [/h1]\n\nI say that StarBound is a fun time with friends. Theres alot of stuff to do its never boring. I also feel the need to address that StarBound is not a Terraria in space. I have played them both. The feel of StarBound is completely different and even after the main story theres alot of quests and upgrading to do.\n\nHowever, I'd say the most important tip is to not focus on the game's \"story\". You have to do a few of the story quests to be able to leave your starting system, but past that, don't worry too much about it. Let yourself get sucked into the game and get distracted doing whatever interests you.\n\nMoreover, Starbound is a game suited for people that like to build, explore and create their own little adventures. If you take the time to enjoy its univers and all the different concepts it has to offer, then you'll get a plesant and enjoyable experience.\n\nLastly, I will like to reccomend StarBound for anyone who enjoys exploration games as this is not a bad one. This review is my opinion you can have your own towards the game. I was never into these types of games and became truely addicted. I just had to write a massive reivew. Price wise the game in not very expensive as recent games cost alot compared to this. If you plan on trying the game pick it up on sale or even get a 4-pack to give out to friends like i did. I'd say StarBound is a great time with friends and most negative reviews are years old when the game was in early access. \n\nA 8/10 fun,simple and easy to pick and play.\n\n[quote=author] Satan Claus\t[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1497383684, "timestamp_updated": 1511504543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.844824492931365967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55631195": {"recommendationid": "55631195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017846924", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 8985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8980, "last_played": 1697425503}, "language": "english", "review": "It had potential, but then devs axed good features and made it more \"casual\"\n\nLook, it was promising to be like this: Hot planets, cold planets, biohazard planets.

A lot of the mechanics are a bit broken; for example you need to get fuel from special \"fuel moons\"; but the economy isn't balanced so pretty quickly you can ignore all of these moons and just buy all the fuel you need. (apparently because they weren't developed by a single person/team but rather a disjointed group, RE: see point 0).

And that's all. Official updates eventually killed the game - what was once a unique experience for each playthrough ended up being an extremely streamlined and repetitive incident.\n\nI once loved Starbound. Honestly. I remember playing it with my friends - we would meet in one of our spaceships to play Zelda songs in our recently found instruments and to show off our new skills, and then we would descent into unknown planets to look out for NPC villages... Man, those were the days. This game was [b]REALLY[/b] good in the past, giving players freedom to advance on their own or settle down as they wish.\n\nBut then the story nation attacked. And now most core aspects of the game are hard-locked behind a boring and dull story progression which will make most casual players give up.\n\nStarbound went through several game advancement changes during its development, but it was never so linear as it turned out to be in the [b]Cheerful Giraffe[/b] version back in 2016. It should have been named the Lethiferous Giraffe instead, considering that on that very release this unholy forbidden story arc was added. Starbound has currently [b]ZERO[/b] replayability - you'll unlock skills in the same order, craft stuff in the same order, visit the same planets, do the same quests, have the same adventure over and over, over and over and over and over and over and over...\n\nMost beta players complained about the released changes.

To this day, we call disappointment with a game due to too much playtime in Early Access \"Starbound Effect\". But perhaps that's for the best - even if you've only playing this now, this game still has it's fair share of problems.\n\nCredit where it's due: the game's art style is lovely, the music is great, the concept is good and there are some pretty interesting ideas at work here. But here's the problem: it's just not very fun to play. 180 hours came mostly from Early Access play and then two earnest attempts to play it after launch. Never got particularly far.\n\nI'll elaborate more, both on good and the bad. But mostly the bad.\n\n[h1]The Original No Man's Sky[/h1]\nWhen NMS was getting hyped into the outer orbit, I was watching with a raised eyebrow: it looked exactly like what Starbound was promising a few years back, except in 3D. So I wasn't too surprised when NMS didn't turn out too great, because again, Starbound also didn't.\n\nI remember saying: \"Starbound is the messiah of gaming, the game to end all games!\" I mean, Terraria with space exploration and fantasy races? Infinite worlds to explore? Well... technically, that's all true. But Starbound suffers from the same general problem as NMS, and many other games besides.\n\n[b]Procedural generation cannot create meaningful content.[/b]\n\nHuman brains are pattern-finding machines. We can easily tell when something's been jumbled together from pieces that you've seen before, with similar patterns. And because of that, all monsters feel the same; all terrain is the same hills, recoloured. There are bespoke, handcrafted elements - and those are very nice, amazing even. But it's all ruined when you end up finding the same Floran village again and again, the same Apex outpost, the same Glitch keep.\n\n[h1]Progressing to Nowhere[/h1]\nAnd you have to visit all those places, because in order to progress with the story, you have to visit places with settlements and scan objects belonging to different races/cultures. This sounds like a pretty solid idea for a plot, if it wasn't for the sameyness... but that's not the only problem.\n\nThe combat doesn't feel very meaningful. There are different kinds of weapons, stats, buffs and whatnot... but everything feels very haphazardly cobbled together without any idea of balance. Some pieces of gear are just so much better than others, and a lot of stuff you'll find is complete garbage. Enemies also feel either too easy or too hard. This is mostly because different planets simply offer different 'tiers', kind of like level zones, and you can tell which one it is based on the star colour and planet type.\n\nOf course, in order to progress to harder planet types you need stuff to keep yourself alive, such as a better space suit. And in order to craft it you need specific materials, found in other, a bit less difficult places. You get the idea. It's actually a bit like in Terraria - to beat this boss you need at least this tier of gear. But here it just doesn't feel as good. Not sure why.\n\n[h1]Bonfire with Friends[/h1]\nSo the game is not very good. But there are two things it's actually quite amazing at. One - building and customisation. There are so many different building blocks in this game, so many different objects to decorate your settlements. Different kinds of crops which you can use to cook different meals. Different outfits, hairstyles, even idle body poses. If building is what you like, then oh boy, does this game have building. It's all optional, too - you can become a space landlord, building colonies and getting rent money from your tenants. \n\nAnd two - hanging out with your friends. After you've built your base you can get together with your mates and play instruments, sit down, go for a nice walk, have a chat. It feels incredibly cozy, with the fantastic atmopshere and nice music. The instruments part is particularly memorable; even if it was rather annoying at the time, I'll always remember the goddamn robot playing the first 10 seconds of \"Jingle Bells\" on the accordion as me and another friend crossed the desert. Or the flower dude crying because our house is \"not gay enough\" (gay here meaning pretty/fancy) as it was still a work in progress. We made it gay enough later on, with a nice balcony, so he stopped crying. Or, or! Mining shirtless with the boys out of a barebones house because all our items fell into lava...\n\nThose two things are probably why I have those 180 hours on record.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nEven after all these years, the game feels unfinished. But I think its main problem is that it doesn't focus on what it does best - handcrafted content. If this game's world was static and bespoke, it would've been a lot better, in my opinion at least. \n\nI hear a lot about mods, that they make the game better. Maybe they do, I haven't tried. I don't think that a game that needs mods to stop being bad can be called a good one. If you have some friends and you really liked Terraria, then it probably can't hurt to check this one out. But overall, the game simply fizzles out rather early on; it's illusion falls apart.

We should be fair with Starbound. I will bs nobody.\nFirst off, I am a supporter from back when it was on Early Access.\nThe game has been dramatically changed since then.\nI had to play through the whole game again, since my savegame was not compatible with V1 but who cares really?\n\nSo, what IS Starbound?\nWell it started as an open world sandbox game. KEEP THAT IN MIND PLEASE.\nSo, since then a lot of stuff were added.\nWe got a great set of unlockable technology upgrades, so you can craft gradually stuff you are gonna need.\nThe game introduces you gradually to its universe with a set of missions, to do some essential things.\nThe whole tutorial is the lore of the game. Yup! A sandbox with lore as tutorial, how do you like that?\nOne step before going against the final boss, you know you are ready to explore whatever you want.\nWhat a great idea! You also carry a codex, where you can collect a lot of wrriten stuff, like journals, stories etc etc, very rewarding for readers.\nYou can collect various stuff, like bugs, fish, fossils, and make collections out of them.\n\nRandomly (?) generated quests occur all the time, with always interesting rewards and not useless stuff.\nChallenges are available and a lot of stuff to do.\n\nYou can farm, you can have your own pets... what else can I say about this awesome game?\n\nOh! The world!\nWell basically you start on a solar system. Then you go outside of it to another star. Stars are solar systems with planets inside them. Imagine that stars are generated gradually as you move through the universe map. And believe me, there are LOTS of stars, full of planets to explore.\n\nFavorite changes (for early access users that wanna see what's new):\nA] The pixel compressor has no penalty.\nB] The fuel gathering became an interesting challenge instead of a freaking boring process.\nC] Optimized not to lag.\n \nSo let's see:\n\nGraphics: 90% Fantastic pixel art \nSound: 90% Great music but too emotional for my taste. Still great.\nGameplay: 90% It is very polished, the game seldom lags even on my old PC\nReplayability value: 90% With so many races, I bet this can be played many many times.\nValue for money: 90%  I played 300 hours already, including the time before V1 was released.\nScenario: 70% Interesting scenario, but that's it. <<< This is considered an EXTRA on a sandbox game.\n\nDo I recommend this?\nWell yes. It is a great game, just don't take it for an RPG.\nIt is a sandbox.", "timestamp_created": 1474583789, "timestamp_updated": 1474583789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832120537757873535", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31763409": {"recommendationid": "31763409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090189496", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 10985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6055, "last_played": 1590613408}, "language": "english", "review": "Starbound is everything that No Man's Sky isn't.", "timestamp_created": 1494829726, "timestamp_updated": 1494829726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 384, "votes_funny": 176, "weighted_vote_score": "0.831944823265075684", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129118993": {"recommendationid": "129118993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085078768", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 14832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13968, "last_played": 1672618792}, "language": "english", "review": "Starbound is a 2D survival-sandbox game that centers around driving around in a starship base and beaming from planet to planet to gather materials, advance the story, or build more permanent settlements. It has some very nifty takes on the genre, generating a galaxy with quadrillions of planets to visit, each with a host of biomes and aliens before No Man's Sky was a thing. Plus, you can play as a space furry, that's always a plus in my book.\n\nUnfortunately, this game is slow, in a lot of senses. It's slow in the sense that the main story is padded out in a way that's unfriendly to the player, it's slow in that most of the secondary tasks and achievements are even more of a grind than the main story, and slow in the sense that it's poorly optimized. The optimization is probably the easiest to explain - the whole game runs on the CPU, and only on one core, and in addition to that there's a memory leak you can regularly encounter in gameplay that makes things grind to a halt.\n\nI would recommend not going for the achievements if you choose to play this game, as well as getting a decent amount of mods to make things as efficient as they feel they should be. You can get mods to make crafting instant, or to remove the screen transitions that quickly add up as you beam from place to place with your ship's teleporter, or even skip the entire storyline that feels tacked on and adds little to the gameplay aside from a few really cool pre-made dungeons, but nothing can be done to fix the slowdowns caused by the poor optimization.\n\nThere's one more thing that people may want to consider before buying this game. Around 2019 word got out that a dozen voluntary contributors were exploited during Starbound's development, logging hundreds of hours with no compensation, many of them in their teenage years. A bunch of people who used to work with Chucklefish came out to confirm this happened, and it falls at the hands of company director Finn Brice, who also harassed nearly everyone else working there. I know it doesn't matter to everyone, but when looking at the worlds of this game, it pains me to think that people went through hell to get this game together and they weren't even given what they deserved in the end.", "timestamp_created": 1671825616, "timestamp_updated": 1671825616, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 227, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.831156432628631592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "7915080": {"recommendationid": "7915080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037413515", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1472642622}, "language": "english", "review": "Only a beta, but first impression seems good.

There's lots of extra bits and bobs bolted onto it, but you shouldn't pick this game up unless you want to embrace the ambience of going to a strange alien world, exploring it and taking its resources, and then leaving to find another planet, knowing you won't be back.\n\nThink No Man's Sky and you're right on the nose. No wonder this game has received such a divisive reception - Starbound looks like Terraria, talks like Terraria, and then it does something entirely different. Instead of creating a single world that's yours and shaping it into your fortress, your home, your...whatever - this is the lonely wandering experience of No Man's Sky, where you can build bases and get attached to places, but you always need to move on.\n\nUnfortunately - and here's the biggest problem with the game - it has this beautiful premise, but it locks all of that exploration behind deeply painful content gating. My first few hours with this game were spent playing Terraria: I had to dig almost to the bottom of the starter planet, find some ore to unlock the main hub of the game, get told that if I wanted my ship fixed I had to fight a boss, and promptly discovered that because I hadn't spent hours crafting better gear I couldn't win.\n\nSo I nearly quit.\n\nInstead I went mod-diving, hoping the community had fixed the game, and lo: they did. Frackin' Universe is the big overhaul mod that makes the game far more friendly, but there are other fixes as well: enabling teleporting anywhere, making chests hold more/be sortable by type, letting me add in custom races and more - the quality of life, the sheer amount of content in the game.... it fleshed it out.\n\nNow I can't put Starbound down, because when I started over, I had better access to everything I needed to progress. I was also enticed by the promise of more things to craft, more things to do, more - everything! Mods didn't fix that initial grind with mining down to get those core fragments I needed to progress in the main quest, but they did make it far more fun and bearable, and once you're over that hump - the universe opens up to you.\n\nNow I explore planets and visit alien villages and find maps to secret dungeons and I'm aiming to cook everything in the game, and I've built a teleporter that lets me come back to my own favorite planet, so I can work on building the base there. Now I'm looking for rare plants on exotic planets and upgrading my mecha and so much more.\n\nIt's No Man's Sky but 2D and stuffed with crazy amounts of content, with genuinely fun combat (shields are so much fun) and that lovely ambience of finding a little pond on an alien world and sitting next to it and watching the rain fall. Of finding a ruined prison still staffed with mad guards, and holing up in a cell and hoping they won't bust in before I can heal up. Of finding an Avian temple complete with lava pit at the bottom. Of - well. There's a lot here, and I won't be done for a long time.\n\nHighly, highly recommended.

Critical analysis of:[/i]\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n[h1][b]Starbound[/b][/h1]\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[b]Note: Positive recommendation due in large part to development starting to come together well. I do not think you should buy this game at this moment, but you should watch.[/b]\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\nWait for release, and perhaps a little while after! See how the final stages of development goes! Make sure implementations of vital features and the way they intertwine are up to your par! Things have been improving, accelerating, and shaping up a lot lately...but you never know what one thing could ruin it all for you as an individual. As always, be wise with your money.\n\nDo I at this point think release (or a few big updates after) will be worth your money? Yes. Do I think that it could also potentially be held back by a poorly implemented feature or two? Quite possibly. So if you have already purchased starbound...maybe it will soon be time to give it another go! But if you haven't...hold on to your wallets for just a little longer.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[h1][b]In-depth Feature Critiques:[/b][/h1]\n\n[h1][b]The Beginning:[/b][/h1]\nYou start out on a pretty planet, with a lush, colorful, friendly background. The terrain is usually mild in variation, making navigation fairly simple and quick. You are outright forced to dig down to the bottom of the planet--gathering ore along the way for gear--to acquire core fragments so you can fix your ship and go elsewhere.\n\nNow, this may sound pretty annoying--and it is, however, many steps have been taken to make it a relatively quick and easy process. There are more caves and tunnels, making digging down to the bottom easier, as well as ore deposits that can be broken up to get a decent amount of a certain ore type. Underground sub-dungeons can potentially provide interesting loot, or just a needed change of scenery or some pixels.\n\n[h1][b]The Planets and Exploration:[/b][/h1]\nUpon gaining the ability to venture further, you may wonder just how good the new sights will be. The answer to this question: a mixed bag. Many planets seem boring and pointless, just a new color or different dungeon/settlement type. Maybe a cool biome or two...maybe a bunch of annoying biomes. Maybe there's no good loot. Maybe ore generation makes your desired type hard to find. To make matters worse, certain planet types tied to getting through the later tier are by nature incapable of being fun and unique. Ocean planets, for example. Mostly water atm.\n\nOn the other hand, it is very possible to stumble upon a planet with cool terrain, a cool settlement or dungeon with good loot, awesome looking background parallax and kickass trees, and an abundance of ore. Regardless, there needs to be more unique elements and reward/incentive to exploration. Things to make individual planets stand out and be special. Rare biome or dungeon variations, a strangely safe and beautiful planet of a dangerous harsh biome type, a different day/night cycle time, dangerous creatures and minibosses.\n\n[h1][b]The Combat and Creatures:[/b][/h1]\nCombat in starbound is fairly well setup. Weapons have unique properties and styles that generally enable you to fight however you want. Monsters now have better tells and more sensible windups, so blocking, dodging, parrying, and tanking are now all viable options. Since monsters are mostly generated off screen, and generally stay there, the end result is that combat often feels like a chore you do to get that one creature with that one annoying attack to stop impeding your horizontal progress around a planet.\n\n[i]There is much room for improvement in that regard:[/i]\n\nLoot should be more rewarding, fun, or varied. Monsters should seek you out and display unique behaviors. Perhaps some herd up, or fight in small roaming packs, or try to avoid you. Even if nothing at all is done to make it more engaging and fun, rather than like a popup when trying to surf the net, the spawning needs to be tweaked. I would like to see hardcaps on the amount of creatures that can spawn within a set distance of each other, or while you are busy killing other mobs, or how quickly it will populate the area past your sight with new monsters when you've just slaughtered five so you can finally resume moving forward.\n\n[h1][b]The Functional Mechanics and Building:[/b][/h1]\nThey actually nailed this one. The matter manipulator is not only a lore-friendly tool, but an essential one. It is a way to have an item bound to your character at all times, not taking up inventory or hotbar space, that offers a big improvement on the utility found in most sandboxes. Digging and placing blocks can be precise, with ugprades to speed and tiles covered, the size of which can be adjusted on the fly. You can remove and relocate liquids, and building is quick and easy as well, thanks to the handy ability for your matter manipulator to hightlight relevant blocks. As a protip: You can even use it to help search for buried ore in the dark!\n\nBuilding is quite good. There are many objects and styles of blocks to play around with, and you can now colonize planets and rent out rooms of your design to NPCs. The building materials chosen for this process directly effect what you will get. This gives more purpose to the various biomes, and the exploration of them, because there are tenant NPCs that are based specifically on certain biome types. This was also very well done. Unfortunately, the availability of unique and varied building blocks in terms of aesthetics is limited. Aside from stone, many can only be scavenged from settlements or dungeons, no less! There are plenty of blocks that will end up having 100 recolors, as well, due to the nature of their planet, like sand and dirt. So why is there not a similar change in color and style not found in wallpapers on settlements, the color of bricks used in temples, and so on? Maybe one day.\n\nThe utility of the sci-fi exploration sandbox genre typing doesn't end there. A ship AI personal to your race is a clever way to dispense introductions to the game and quests, tips, and inform you if you try to do something like pay for an upgrade with too few materials. There are many other instances of starbound's mechanics being very well designed, so the foundation is strong.\n\n[h1][b]======================================[/b][/h1]\n[b]I've maxed out on space to the point where I can't even finish the following section. For those who want to read the rest, I threw up a silly wordpress site: [url=https://fakersrealreviews.wordpress.com]here[/url][/b]\n[h1][b]======================================[/b][/h1]\n\n[h1][b]The Sandbox, Progression, and Professions:[/b][/h1]\nThis one is a bit more difficult to comment on, because it's in a pretty heavy state of flux lately, and especially going forward from here, so I'll cover the basics from where it has been to where it is going. Back in my day, when we had to walk to school uphill in the snow, 10 miles, both ways...you could simply load up your ship with coal and take off to the great unknown. This was pretty cool, but honestly, from a design standpoint it did allow you to exhaust content quickly and kill off the novelty of the sights to see. The starmap at this point branched out with similar planets, and you had to unlock the next tier to see new types.
