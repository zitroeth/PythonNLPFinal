But at this stage (April 2024), after all these hours of gameplay (190 hrs), I got frustrated by the constant resource farming and the lack of PvE content. \n\nOn PvP rush server I spend half of my game time, there was a setup of extra resources gathered, but it is pvp-stressful experience and the game is not oriented on defensive-base-building that I would like. By the time I had a decent base setup, a group of 3 end-level players would definitely manage to rade it because of equipment and no advanced base-defense game mechanics... Actually, the pvp is diminished into a top-down competitive shooter with resource rush-gathering and tech-tree crafting elements.\n\nOn PvE server, the gameplay was more to my type of preference. You can design an nice-looking village base, BUT there is no need for base protection or defense walls etc, since no Environment Elements (monsters etc) are going to attack it. The exploration and 'points of interest' elements are REALY minimal (especially compared to other craft-survival games), and the only actual goal is to collect the resources to advance the build and technology tree. ... But the farming needed at the official servers settings is TOO much for me. And running around the map just to gather the same thing over and over and over got me fed up... \n\nSo, after hundred of hours I am quitting the game feeling more frustrated than fulfilled/entertained. (Lots of my game-play time was during me sleeping on the keyboard.)\n\nBUT, I recommend the game, since it will offer you a lot of hours of satisfaction at start-to-mid gameplay, and if you are fun of PvE opportunities you could find a nice gem of a game on Cryofall.

It's a bit like an idle game in that things have countdown timers.  A perfect example is farming.  It takes 2-3 hours after planting to be able to harvest.  But if you can only play, say, 1-2 hours every night, by the time the next night rolls around your harvest has rotted because you didn't harvest it fast enough.The timers in the game are such that if you can only play once a day for less than 3 hours per session, the game really isn't for you because you'll constantly be losing things to rot.  Harvest a bunch of food? Well, it'll rot before you can come back the next day.Another good example of decay timers not working well is power.  If you max out the power generator with charcoal and have several things for power storage, it'll last a few days.  But if you miss more than 2-3 days then you lose power and anything you have in storage rots.It's to the point now where I no longer want to play because I've progressed to the point where the game demands too much time and every time I login I just end up re-doing old work and don't really move forward.The decay timers are just not optimized for casual players.

This game is a season based multiplayer game where you build and construct a base camp with the intent of eventually building a rocket to escape the planet. It is not a game that is designed to be played \"sandbox\" forever like Minecraft, it's not procedural generated like Factorio. It's a persistent map for the season then a wipe comes and you do it again starting from zero.\n\nEach season last 6 weeks since that's about the amount of time a player needs to get to the very end of everything and have nothing left to do. There are 20 different skills that your character learns over the course of the game and as you level them up you become *better* at doing the task the skill is related to.  You use the exp you get (known as Learning Points) in order to advance through the tech tree and branch out into various different subsets of technology. From the ability to construct more technologically advanced crafting stations to being able to create better weapons and armor, to being able to build up your own farm and cook the crops into meals that provide subtle stat bonuses to building vehicles to get around the world faster to finally building Mechs to take down the event bosses that spawn every 5-6 hours.  At first you'll have to pick and choose what you want to branch into but eventually you'll know everything and can do it all.\n\nThere are various events that happen which can be like mini contests even on PvE servers in order to get bonus loot to make your character stronger in spite of not having certain technologies. There are also enemy based events where rare mobs spawn that provide even rarer loot to finally having the event bosses where you'll need to group up with other players in order to bring them down for the rarest of all the items to make the best mech in the game as well as get the ingredients you need to complete your rocket.\n\n\n\nAs a side note I find that people who dislike this game do not understand the origins of the game therefore compare it to games that it has similarities to rather than comparing it to what it actually *is*. This game was originally designed as a season based PvP game. \n\nAnd while they created a separate PvE version of the game but,  they had to add/subtract/adjust  the content of the game as PvE plays entirely different from PvP.  They ended up adding in the event \"bosses\" as a means of end game challenge for those players as well as a the means to build the rocket to provide a \"conclusion\" to the game in spite of the fact that there really wasn't meant to be one. \n\nIn the beginning they only wiped the PvE servers during a major patch update but, as they approached version 1.0 they settled on a 6 week server wipe for that as well as by the time you get that far in the interest in the game drops off exponentially as it becomes a situation where you have a stockpile of resources but no use for them. A game with nothing to do it in it is going to have a massive player drop off so the server wipes are a way of allow the game to maintain a state of 'freshness' to it without getting stale.\n\nFinally, after all of that was complete they decided on creating single player servers where the player can adjust the game how they see fit to play solo even though the game isn't designed around solo game play and is in fact crippled *if* you play it that way. \n\nTL:DR\n\nCryofall is a good multiplayer game that was literally designed with PvP in mind. If you play it in any other way your mileage and enjoyment will vary the further you go away from the original premise of the game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1640207233, "timestamp_updated": 1640207233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 152, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.901063799858093262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118789463": {"recommendationid": "118789463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080305553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4902, "last_played": 1658561434}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not a single player game PvE as is it was built as a multiplayer PvP.

In which the robots have a storage system for you to explore and store resources, after all the map is quite large. But where is a slightly larger variety of vehicles? For example, a motorcycle, car, among others that would fit the theme very well.\n\n2: A simple item rotation system. Too bad not being able to simply turn an item, workbench, furnace, anything you want, to some different position for the aesthetics of your construction to be optimal.\n\n3: Lacks a bit of variety in enemies across the map. With such a big map, it could have more diversity. There are about 20 monsters or so and everything else is almost a copy with a slightly different design or a different color. Almost everyone has the same play, they run after you and you shoot them during the run.\n\n4: The defense against projectiles that equipment gives is not as useful in PvE, it seems that it was made almost exclusively for PvP, which is kind of frustrating, since many players only play PvE with few players. It should for example have some humanoid monsters with equipment and weapons and so on.\n\n5: There are no caves, dungeons or anything remotely similar to that. Kinda bland, since any game of the same theme has these aspects.\n\n6: Some systems do not make much sense, such as equipment repair. It could be from another method, like for example to repair a piece of equipment you need to use half the resources you would use to create a new one or something like that.\n\n7: Equipment and items in general break very easily. For example, a specific weapon that every 2 shots loses 1% of durability, that is, with 200 shots the weapon breaks and you need to make a new one completely from scratch. You farm a lot to make a weapon that will be broken in 1 or 2 days hunting something and then you will have to farm again to make the same weapon again.\n\nI could number other things that make it seem like they haven't been inserted yet, making the game seem unfinished, however, when asking in some forum or social network about the game, if it's abandoned and without updates or when things like that will be implemented, the developers rudely say something like \"Why would I need to insert something?

I played purely PvE; I have no need to join a server just to spend my leisure time with preteens mispelling racial slurs.  Other reviewers have touched on the toxic PvP playerbase.\n\nThe game is very grindy at the mid-to-end tiers.  You will spend almost every moment farming resources to repair your equipment, which degrades at a phenomenal rate.\n\nBecause the game is aimed at PvP, there's really no \"base-building\" in the way you might think of.  You're limited in scope, because the map is (relatively) small and there needs to be room for other players.  You can build (optional) walls, and set up your resource farming equipment inside, but really that's about it.\n\nThe biggest downside is the \"decay\"... a mechanic put in obviously to free up land for other players.  It makes sense to a degree, but it means that there's no setting down roots.  If you take a week off to play another game your base will be gone when you come back.  So why would you come back?  And that directly leads to:\n\nSmall player base.  The server I'm on is a ghost town.

Have I gotten 15 hours of enjoyment for $13? Yes. Is this a great game though? No.\nOne of the things you'll start to realize is that the lack of automation makes it painful if you're playing by yourself or just with a friend. Unless you cheat in materials you'll find the inordinate amount of time you'll spend just trying to make plastic (dump canisters in, move them to the refinery etc) and especially making bullets and guns becomes a downright chore. There's no easy repair system either (you can kind of tinker two almost broken things together to get a little more life, but it's still a significant chore).\n\nThis game seems to be designed for specialization to an extent (someone makes food, someone farms ore etc) and you buy the other things people are making. That's at least how I can see this game working. Someone is a dedicated plastic man who sells plastic, someone else makes bullets etc. this model doesn't work if you're playing by yourself though.\n\nFor setting up a multiplayer server it takes a few minutes.\nI'm playing on an old i5 4th gen processor and a 1660ti. Even running the server with a friend did not have a meaningful impact on the game performance.\n\nFirst, go here: https://wiki.atomictorch.com/CryoFall/Server/Setup and it has the instructions as well as a link to the standalone server software.\n\nA few extra things you'll need to know ahead of time to self-host:\n1) for windows, you'll need to download .Net 5.0. You can get that here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0 and on the right side will be the desktop runtime (don't bother downloading with the SDK)\n2) you'll need to know your external ip address (you can google \"What's my IP address\" and it will tell you). That's the ip address of your modem/router that faces the internet. This is the address that your friend will type in to connect to you.\n3) you'll need to know your computer's internal ip address (the ip address that your computer actually has on your internal network. You can find that out by opening a command prompt and typing ipconfig)\n4) you'll need some familiarity with configuring your router if you have one (the ip address to configure it is usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 type those into your web browser and you'll need to log in and look in the Advanced menu and read about \"port forwarding\". Basically port forwarding is how when someone connects to your outside ip address, your router knows to send it to your computer on the internal network. You'll forward UDP 6000 to your computer's ip address you got from the ipconfig command.\n5) follow the instructions on the website\n6) profit!\n\nYou don't need a computer science degree to set it up but you will have to read a bit to get things going  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nSo yeah, you may have to learn about your router, and your two different ip addresses (if you've got a local router which most people likely do). and a little bit of console commands to start a dotnet 5.0 server.", "timestamp_created": 1619941525, "timestamp_updated": 1620547811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.752672910690307617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93650411": {"recommendationid": "93650411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184467346", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7463, "last_played": 1624050402}, "language": "english", "review": "This may come across toxic but will be the most useful review you will need to read before buying this game. Me and my teammate joined the Cryosmall EU duo server. As of right now we are the number one faction on the server and have sunk 110 hours past two weeks into the game already. (More like under a week) This game requires a stupid amount of time and has so many issues. I hope the developers read this and fix the issues.\n\nFirst issue is the game itself is dead. Player base is low because of how long the game is. The wipe on this server is  a month. New players do not have much choice in what to join or what day the wipe is at. If you do not have a lot of time and a consistent team do not play this game. The game is flawed in a lot of ways from the sheer amount of mats grinding you have to do. We are playing on a 2.5x gather rate server and I cannot imagine it without. The game runs on Tiers 1-5 after a wipe has happened which unlock over a week period. \n\nTier 1 - Pretty Degen but easy enough and simple.\nTier 2 - The best part of the game with not a lot to do but better combat and overall a lot more fun.\nTier 3 - Gets a little more grindy but still is not the worst. You have to start doing a lot more here but it\u2019s fairly competitive after the fact that combat now lasts under 10 seconds if you are against more than 1. \nTier 4 - This is where we are at now. And it is pure cancer. The game makes you do a million things here. Which cost way too many materials and is too long to achieve. \nTier 5 - No clue but probably fucked.\n\nDo not play this game in its current state. It is not newbie friendly and even with 200-man hours into the game this week we are still struggling to do much. Raiding is broken as the cost of making bombs to raiding bunker design bases causes it to be too costly and unraidable. The material crafting needs so much more balancing as all of  a sudden one item becomes obsolete and the next becomes needed in every recipe. In this state no one should purchase or buy this game. It becomes very shit quick and requires you to spend 10/h plus a day to achieve anything. Many game issues including glitches with shields and walls and a lot of unregistering hits on certain objects such as players etc. The game also has the highest mob density out of anything I have ever seen. You will consistently be attacked. \n\nDo not buy this game :)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1623541174, "timestamp_updated": 1623541174, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749560415744781494", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66291617": {"recommendationid": "66291617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126314642", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3898, "last_played": 1588126689}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as i like this game, and the grind that comes with it. i simply can't recommend it.\n  it is indeed a lot of fun but after weeks of gathering resources and building, those that play it 24/7 simply drop in raid everything and blow you out of the water. either online or offline. raiding can make the grind a little quicker by farming other players if you are smart. but since I've purchased the game its been nothing but grind for weeks and than lose everything in a matter of minutes.

For myself in personal opinion, they need some sort of time limit to servers. those of us that only have a few hours a day can enjoy a server that has a 2 hour/day you can play on the server. others that have all day to play can play on a unlimited time on a different server. they have to implement something to separate these different types of players cause other than that it becomes a gamebreaker. \n\n  However this is indeed a fantastic game\n", "timestamp_created": 1585692807, "timestamp_updated": 1585692807, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748263359069824219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68466817": {"recommendationid": "68466817", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967203702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 1364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 665, "last_played": 1602430760}, "language": "english", "review": "Well I had got so bored with survival games.

I had spent a lot of money recently on games I thought I WOULD like, only to find that I didn't.\nEvery few years a game comes along that can change players perceptions.

That will not happen, at least until the PVE Official servers are launched, but all you need to do is to join a Community Server. Check the rules of the server and see what suits you best. For example, I play on a server where griefing and KoS are not tolerated, and raiding is not permitted. What that means is that an old guy like me can play in peace, not having to look over his shoulder all the time, and not worrying that the next time I log in my base will have been raided.

Grind whatever you want.\n\n- Skill leveling system, while grindy, is the absolute best thing this game has going for it.\n\n- Building feels like you're accomplishing something, but be aware you can't rotate where you place things i.e. chests. Sounds like it won't annoy you, but it will. Trust me.\n\n- Radiation zones are fun, raiding is fun.\n\n- Game has a ton of potential if they make the necessary adjustments.\n\nCons:\n\n- The number one problem with this game is the imbalance in grind for reward. You can grind the worst grind to raid someone (modern bombs), use tons of hours/days/weeks of mats to get into the most well defended base, and get absolutely nothing important out of it because everyone can hide their most important items (gear, weapons, bombs) in their land claim on their property. Even if you use a ton of bombs to blow up this land claim, you don't get the contents. Also, the land claim doesn't even get destroyed immediately, I think it takes like 36 hours or something. Makes raiding absolutely not worth the grind. \n\nI think the developers justify this by saying you can't store crafting mats in your land claim, but that doesn't matter. I'd rather grind the mats myself than pour everything into bombs and not be able to get endgame gear for it. Where is the incentive? This game needs PVP to keep people around, and I think this is what makes most players realize once you're at the very end game..there is no point. Until the land claim system is adjusted, I don't think I can recommend this game.\n\n- EXTREMELY grindy. I don't know if you've noticed how many times i've said grind yet. Luckily for me, i'm used to grinding Korean mmos, but playing this game on a standard server is just not worth it. CryoSmall is probably the saving grace of this game, play on that server for 2x loot/learning points and at least SOME other players/activity (although you will feel alone most of the time).\n\n- Normal official servers have a raid window, which means if you play on degenerate gamer hours (aka, late nights/early mornings), you cannot raid after midnight PST (at least on the official America server). However, you can start it right before the raid window closes and keep it open into the night as long as you smack a wall/the land claim/etc once every 10ish minutes.\n\n- Ping is really annoying to deal with, and considering how few people play this, your best ping server can be absolutely dead with no reason to play.\n\n- Animal/mob AI is lacking and easy to just kite creatures into walls/trees. Things stay in the same place. The game doesn't feel \"alive\" because of this.\n\n- Rocks/trees/plants/etc will eat bullets when trying to shoot things. Mildly annoying when killing animals, absolutely infuriating when trying to kill another player.\n\n- Map is the same every time. If you play on a server that wipes frequently, everyone already knows the best spots to live on and could progress faster than a first time player.", "timestamp_created": 1571915054, "timestamp_updated": 1571915054, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726166009902954102", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120728291": {"recommendationid": "120728291", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962264417", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 2057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2055, "last_played": 1660776405}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried, I really did, which annoys me as on paper this game should be amazing. This is a game with some excellent systems in place but finding itself heavily wrapped in a failed execution. The game looks good with a nice art style though. Unfortunately this doesn't make up for how boring it is. I'm a fan of grind games when done well, but this is just grind for grinds sake. The PvP server is slightly better in this regard in that it's sped up 5x, which really should be the normal pace to stop so many people quitting so fast.\n\nI'll summarise this game in an easy analogy. This game has fishing. The fishing it has is the same as early 2000's WoW fishing. You click, you stare blankly for 10 seconds, you click. Despite there being a million better fishing systems since then, this is what they went for. I also don't get why the fishing splash is almost inaudible at 100% being just barely able to hear the splash, any notification from the rest of my system wakes my neighbours up 2 doors down and YT can't go any lower and still too loud?! Expand this fishing issue to everything else in the game and you understand what this game is, not good. So much so I don't even think a huge amount of Mods can resolve it. This game IS the fishing.\n\nWeapons are boring. The crafting is the ultra dull type crafting, hold click to gather, click to craft, this covers most of the game. The amount of time you'll spend slowly trudging through the world is ridiculous to start until you get the hoverboard. Getting that pragmium solo will see you die many, many times, and have to corpse run for 20+ minutes each time, I'm sure some people find holding Shift+Direction for that long fun, but sadly that's not me. AI is the worst and doesn't even have path finding, getting stuck on anything in a straight line to you?!\n\nNow, for the good systems in the skills and research, there's a load of rubbish. I eat some tomatoes and become nauseous for 5 mins?! Same with any fruit or veg. Now I need anti nausea meds which are just tedious to gather and craft for when you just want some raw fruit and veg. I don't remember the last time I got ill from a few tomatoes, or anyone for that matter so this just seems broken to me. Also if I'm out hunting and used \"too many\" meds - 4 - barely enough to fill HP back up I get medicine sick leaving me trapped in the middle of a volcano stuck between invisible heat walls for 10 minutes unable to heal hoping that mobs don't respawn as I can't move (I really don't want another corpse run at this point...). Really fun design here. I found night time is so frequent it feels like it's almost always night as it's so annoying to always need batteries or oil for, another thing you need to constantly grind. The craft system is very \"cool\", but actually working inside of it means a ridiculous amount of grinding materials and tiers upon tiers of crafting. Any other game that does this has some type of automation, but not here.

It strikes the perfect balance between PvP/raiding games such as Rust and resource management games like Factorio. \n\nMy biggest gripe with raid/clan based games (*cough* Rust) is the fact that you can log off and when you get back on, everything is almost always gone. Offline raiding is nearly impossible in this game due to the \"S.H.I.E.L.D.\" function, which makes your base unraidable but simultaneously unusable for when you're offline. Raids are forced to occur when at least one member of the defenders is online (or nobody in the defenders has been online in ~2 days), which creates a wonderful raiding experience. You never feel robbed in defeat, because you did the best you could, and weren't simply absent. Your base is still probably usable as it is extremely expensive and pointless to destroy machinery, and most of your direct value comes from said machinery. \n\nThe progression feels solid, and while I believe it could use a little bit of a speed boost on the grind, it is mostly enjoyable. Ammunition is a bit expensive, and I honestly believe you should get about 50% more ammo from the resources it currently takes. I haven't been able to experience too much combat, but from what I've seen it feels fun, and being lower in tech level doesn't necessarily mean you can't win in a fight (although I can't recommend taking on a Behemoth mech with a crossbow...). People are generally not toxic, and asking for advice, even on the cutthroat PvP servers, you'll almost always get an answer.\n\nThe game is being developed very consistently, and the devs appear to be quite open to ideas and suggestions. Many features from the most recent update are ones that make the game significantly more fun and accessible.\n\nWhat I'm basically trying to say is that this game has a surprisingly small playerbase for how good it is, and it's absolutely worth giving a try during the free demo. 8 hours of time is plenty to decide if you want to buy the game, which I did so at around hour 6.", "timestamp_created": 1600505098, "timestamp_updated": 1600505098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724047601222991943", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84176713": {"recommendationid": "84176713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085146539", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1626230612}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit: They added single player, thank you.\n\nGreat game, but no solo play / single player built in.

The game is very sterotypically German which means balance comes at the price of fun or \"casual play\" which rightfully should be the target market of any game which isn't labeled as hardcore. Trying to find that middleground without the use of difficulty settings is a relatively popular trap in which these type of games fall into and I fear Cryofall has done just that. Also, like many German games, the storyline is non-existent giving it a score of 0 for creativity. \n\nThe demo and current price of ~\u00a35 make this game a pretty big steal. In the time of 8 hours of demo you are going to experience some really good, albeit slightly grindy, gameplay which will probably make you want to buy the game before the demo time is over. If my review was solely based on that area of gameplay this was a pretty good. After that period though the game really falls off around the area of Tier 3 technologies. \n\nThe tier 3 tech and beyond feels like jumping off a cliff in terms of convoluted design comprising of several \"incorrect\" choices of technologies to research at the very point where your your gain of 'Learning points' (currency required to purchase new tech) goes from too much to too few. Up until this point there was a semi-structured tutorial which led you to explore the map and point you towards techs and making you feel like you should just unlock everything. This is suddenly met with a collosal ramp up in quest difficulty requiring you to get a radiation suit in the Tier 3 tech tree. Problem is techs are getting gradually more expensive as you climb the tech trees and now techs require other techs in order to be researched. \n\nAs a new player I can't help but feel I met this moment with a big sigh as I embarked on what ending up being a further 4 hours of mindless grinding/crafting to get this LP and spend it tech trees I had no immediate interest in to get this single technology to do a quest in what still feels like the tutorial. \n\nRight now there are simply far too many things stopping you from learning the game because if you go down a wrong path of tech you are punished massively for it, as LP takes time to acquire....a LOT of time. I have yet to mention that the servers are wiped with every major patch so your incentive to farm out all of these things right now should or is 0 as every hour you put into farming materials or LP, without learning anything new I might add, will simply be erased.  \n\nLastly it leads me to the decay system. Probably the most obtuse system there is and absolutely should not exist on PvE servers on such a low timer of 16 hours. I simply cannot agree to a system in which I am punished for not logging into the game. It completely removes any chance of the game being casual-friendly which is, and should be the target of any non-purposefully hardcore or elite game. I understand I can make my own server or play on a privately ran server with that option disabled but..really? There's nowhere near enough active players for this to even come into existence. It's purely a remedy to a problem that doesn't exist. The timer should be at the very least 3-5 days or just have a \"delete my base and let me start over\" button.\n\nAll this to say I will still actively play the game but, it falls short of a game I could recommend for play past the 8hr demo.", "timestamp_created": 1604878152, "timestamp_updated": 1604878152, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71617591381072998", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92251630": {"recommendationid": "92251630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033148519", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1000, "last_played": 1621423185}, "language": "english", "review": "too grindy for single player", "timestamp_created": 1621424141, "timestamp_updated": 1621424141, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715158343315124512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50316361": {"recommendationid": "50316361", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963611058", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6116, "last_played": 1595012763}, "language": "english", "review": "It has great potential but at the current version after unlocking Tier 3 Techs it becomes a massive grind. And as other PVP-Games, when you are not capable of playing several hours a day you won't get very far.

So essentially if you need to unlock t3/t4 techs you need 250/500 LP and will only retain 50-100lp on death. So you won't venture far outside because of the fear of loosing hours of lp grind.\n- toxic raid mechanics - if you get raided you will probably loose everything. Some small \"safe\" storage in the claim blocks can't be raided but that barely helps for a player who can't play 24/7. \n- ressource blocking of other people groups and camping essential loot areas (radtowns)\n- less skill needed only the bigger gun, armor or more people \n- many players that come from rust and so the community starting to get toxic fast\n- highlevel groups get bored eventually and will bomb/raid/grief others just 4 fun\n- dummy techs that unlock nothing but a small text that you can advance further into the research tree\n\nIf you have the time and like hours of tedious grinding?

We increased base value of retained LP (after death) as well as increasing the total value, but more importantly we removed ALL empty technology nodes making progression in the game much faster.\n- Raiding has been completely changed. Basically all of the rules have been rewritten from scratch. There is now raiding window to encourage online raiding, there is less space to store items inside land claims, chests are unlocked by default and bombs damage is restored. On there other hand there is now also newbie protection to make it easier to start on already populated server and build your first base. But the biggest change is separation of PvP and PvE. These are now completely separated and players can choose which type of servers to join.\n- Resource blocking has also been changed. Now there is contesting mechanic to ensure that there is actual competition rather than claiming resources based on pure luck. Plus other ways to gain access to oil and lithium have been rebalanced to make them more viable.\n- Regarding the community in general, I would disagree, but even then - there are also amazing community servers that people can join. Some have regular events and many are heavily moderated to ensure positive atmosphere.\n- End game has also been balanced to encourage advanced players to attack players at their own level or above. There is now simply zero reason to attack new players. Plus even the most advanced players can't get too relaxed or they will immediately lose their dominant position thanks to the new PvP balance.\n- And finally the empty tech nodes - as I mentioned before we were able to completely remove them!\n\nYou can find the list of updates in the \"news\" section of CryoFall here and also, please just wait a little bit until the May update is released too.

This creates a strong tension or disagreement between the game's mechanics.\n*The combat is overly simple, especially with AI mobs- there are functionally only three kinds of weapon (melee, projectile, projectile explosive), and there are no techniques or methods integrated to the game to make it operate on a more complex level.\n*The Learning Point system provides Learning Points to spend in response to all sorts of actions- mining, fighting, crafting, eating foods, et cetera- but Learning Points are only spent gaining the ability to craft new things.  This means that play doesn't meaningfully change with advancement, particularly combined with the previous point.\n*The skill system only provides progression in the form of percentage efficiency- time spent on actions, quantity of health and stamina, or amount of resources gained from resource nodes- and so doesn't meaningfully change gameplay other than the amount of time it takes to get things done and raw character endurance.\n\n\nMost of all, as the player on our group PvE server who did the most base construction and management, base management is overflowing with busywork and poorly staged.  \n\nFor example, on the initial stage of running a power grid through gasoline rather than harvested coal and wood, you need to provide burnables to oil extractors and refineries to power them, jerrycans to extractors to fill, move jerrycans manually from extractors to refineries to refine the oil, provide jerrycans to the refineries to fill with gasoline and mineral oil, empty some of those jerrycans into barrels to store resources, move jerrycans from refineries to gas power plants so they can have enough gas to keep running, and pull the empty jerrycans from the gas power plants to put them in the oil extractors.\n\nThe lack of a fluid or other resource moving system means that players are constantly personally ferrying resources between buildings, especially since running any sort of resource development through the electrical grid consumes huge amounts of electricity compared to the expectable production of that resource development.\n\n\n\nThis game has a lot of potential to be good, but right now, most of that is just potential.  The systems and construction of this game suggests a promising game with some refinement early in a beta or early access cycle, but it just isn't really finished yet and certainly isn't polished.\n\nWith time and updates, I might eventually recommend this game, but right now, I would recommend against buying it except on significant sale, and even then question how much interest you actually have in playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1622148451, "timestamp_updated": 1622148451, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.70522993803024292", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107346161": {"recommendationid": "107346161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198931208891", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2834, "last_played": 1641524181}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is good but their is too much grinding and most the players are jerks that will kill anything that moves which is what makes it a no for me.

PVP dependent. \n\nThe good: Cryofall has a lot of potential. (Famous last words for indie games, right?) There are systems here that IF implemented well, could make for a fantastic game. The progression system is workable, and the point rewards for experiencing things makes it rewarding to explore and try different things. There's a lot to build and craft, and of course, there's multiplayer!\n\nThe bad: The game relies on that multiplayer, and more specifically the threat of PVP raids, to provide any sense of tension. If you're playing solo or coop with friends, the PVE experience is grindy...and that's about it. There's no real threat. Most all the enemies behave the exact same way. They just sit there until you get within their view range, and then they look at you. If you get closer at that point, they will start running towards you. Otherwise enemies just have different skins.  That makes for a pretty boring solo experience.  So yeah, the devs are relying on those PVP raiders to be your antagonists in this. There's also just a crazy amount of.....walking...and grinding. Also, I know they did it for multiplayer pvp again, but the whole \"can only build base buildings while in the area of influence of your control point\" thing really sucks, especially in solo/coop play, and really hampers creativity. Not to mention upgrading the control point only expands your influence by ONE tile in each direction. Doesn't really feel worth the investment.\n\nOverall, if the devs tightened up the tech tree and balanced it out a bit to reward speccing in certain directions, made a big balance check to costs/speed/grindyness of things, and did a COMPLETE overhaul to the way enemies are handled, I think they'd have a winner on their hands.  As it stands, I wish I could put a \"meh\" instead of a thumbs down, but at the end of the day if I have to pick if it's worth the money or not as a non-PVP gamer, I'd say no.", "timestamp_created": 1703818959, "timestamp_updated": 1703818959, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699334323406219482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74423626": {"recommendationid": "74423626", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999322380", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 192, "playtime_forever": 13912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1709279982}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this is one of the best craft and explore game ever.

There are too many issues with the game, and it feels like the devs dropped the ball a bit on this one, because the potential is definitely there. The only reason I have the hours I do and completed the game is because I made some new friends in a server and logged in to play with them. The game itself wasn't a big draw for me.\n\nFor starters, the character/enemy art is fairly questionable. It's this weird mix of realistic and cartoony that is a bit hard to like. It only works well for the environmental art and item art, that's it. This is actually probably the single thing that actually stopped me from trying the game to begin with, just because it wasn't really hooking me in.\n\nNext, is the actual progression. The progression system is decent overall, but there are some things that don't make a lot of sense. The weapon balancing is a bit weird, and certain endgame weapons feel a lot weaker than they should be. There are also a lot of mid-grade stepping stone type technologies that require too many resources to be worth investing in, making it so that a lot of things get ignored and unbuilt in favor of waiting to unlock the better version of it. There's also a tremendous midgame reliance on lithium, which you can only get in great quantities by building multiple lithium extractors and waiting overnight. There is no real way to meaningfully gather them in game. It feels like an artificial way to slow the pace of progress in the game.\n\nNext, there are the boring environments and enemies. Most of the enemies you find are just reskins of one another, including snakes which are literally just a different color in each biome. This is a game set on an alien world, and they made almost no effort to come up with some interesting enemies to fight. There is barely any reason to visit the other biomes for anything other than to check some first time boxes off.\n\nFinally, there is the lack of content. The first half of the game involves a lot of exploration of the map, but the second half of the game involves doing the same handful of map events over and over, and then repeatedly going to the desert to mine a single late game resource and kill things for LP (which you use to unlock tech). This gets extremely boring and repetitive because there is nothing else to do, and no other ways to progress the late game. There are some ruins you can explore, sure, but you barely get anything useful from them. Most of it is junk. You end up spending more time traveling by ruin hunting that doing anything useful.\n\n[b]So, how can the devs fix this?[/b]\n[olist]\n[*]Settle on cartoony or realistic for the art. Balloon-shaped wolves isn't really working for the game. \n[*]Lower the cost of intermediate tech, or remove them from the game altogether. \n[*]Add multiple new resources that are required for mid game and late game progression similar to pragmium and make them exclusive to each biome in the game except for the meadows. I would also add at least one more biome. \n[*]Add 5-10 new enemies, and spread them to each biome. Each enemy should have movement and attacks that aren't just run in a straight line and melee, and half of them should present a dangerous threat and be limited to the harder biomes. These enemies should also be alien or robotic in origin, rather than random earth animals. \n[*]Ruins need to have some new unique enemies, need to be made much larger, and also need to have unique loot required for progression that you can only find in them. This will make them more interesting and give players more of a reason to make the trek to them.\n[*]Add some mini-bosses to the game to fight with interesting loot drops to make them worth fighting.\n[/olist]", "timestamp_created": 1675112384, "timestamp_updated": 1675112384, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688759684562683105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149551475": {"recommendationid": "149551475", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976867030", "num_games_owned": 900, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 2123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2123, "last_played": 1699140077}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: I only played PvE.\n\nFirst hours are fun then it's just an endless grind.

I would probably be more likely to buy themed packs of skins, but individually, they cost too much for what you get.  \n\nIf you get it on sale, like I did, I definitely recommend it.

PvP are pretty much a full-fledged game at this point, PvE however still needs some late game contents. Download the demo and try it for 8 hrs and judge it for yourself.\n\n[h1] Long version [/h1] \n[b] GRAPHICS : [/b] I gotta be honest, my first impression of Cryofall is not that great. The character and animation felt kind of \"cheap\", like the type of designs you often sees in Freemium mobile games. There's a variety of avatar faces to choose from, but they all have the same default \"idle\" expression. They're by no means \"ugly\", just a tad bit uninspired. The environmental, structure and creature designs however, looks great. You can tell the artist puts a lot of time and effort into it, plus the character design started to grow on me after a couple of hours of gameplay. So, eh. It's alright.\n\n[b] GAMEPLAY : [/b] An easy way to describe this game is \"2D Rust\". I've never played Rust before, so I can't really draw the comparison. The leveling system in this game however, kind of reminds me more of Age of Empires. You start with sticks and stones, craft tools, make better tools and advance your base, sort of like Age of Empire's progression of Stone Age > Iron Age. The leveling system is a lot deeper than what I expected, with a massive technology tree that branches out and intertwines with each other. The way to actually advance the technology however, is quite grindy once you reach the mid-stage of the game, particularly around Tier-3 (there are 4 tiers in total). The game offers enough to keep you busy, from gathering resources to hunting and foraging and farming and building....but even with all those contents you're still gonna feel the grind, especially when playing solo. My advice : Start with PvE, treat it as a long tutorial and getting use to it, once you reach T3 you're more or less prepared to enter PvP and team up with other players. \n\n[b] CONTENT : [/b] I'm surprised that this is an Early Access game, because in my opinion the game is pretty much ready for launch. If I really have to add what I want to see being add into the game, it's an actual campaign mode with stories and lore that would make me feel attached to the world. Late-game content is also really needed especially for solo players. Maybe some kind of boss fight, or challenging weather systems to keep the game fresh. There is a small area in the map that the developers purposely locked out from players, so I'm sure they're cooking up something for us in the future. \n\n[b] PLAYTIME : [/b] I got this game during early March, and in less than a month I'm already clocking in 200 hours. So I definitely got my moneys worth. Cryofall has a real time clock system, meaning that time still goes on even after you log out. Your crops will either, your food will perish, and everybody else in your server are still playing and progressing when you're not playing it. Plus, your structure will slowly disappear after a few days of inactivity, so you're almost always playing the game daily just so that you don't loose progression. This might be a burden to some players that likes to play whenever they like, but if you're on board with the gameplay loop, it's not really that hard to maintain. \n\n[b] PERFORMANCE : [/b] Works perfectly on my low spec 5 years old computer, little to no loading time. No complains here.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]  A highly enjoyable game with an addictive gameplay loop (if this is your type of genre), with enough content to keep you playing. Has the potential to be grindy once you reach mid to late game, but by then you've probably played long enough to get your money's worth. Download the demo, try it out yourself (preferably with friends) for 8 hours, then you'll have an idea on weather or not it's your cup of tea.", "timestamp_created": 1586282678, "timestamp_updated": 1586283147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676932573318481445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95681102": {"recommendationid": "95681102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024311695", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5637, "last_played": 1709002465}, "language": "english", "review": "you spend so much time farming to build your place but if your life gets busy or have an issue you cant log in for a bit everything you did and farmed so many hours is gone.

Meanwhile, this will enable us to make PvP even more engaging. This will allow players to separate based on their preferences: either brutal PvP or relaxed PvE.\n\nAfter that we plan to introduce a complete overhaul to the entire game with new electricity system. This update will include almost a hundred new technologies for buildings and items which would make it possible for us to reduce the LP grind, since the total amount of content will be much bigger, so progression speed can be increased even further (LP gain to unlock new technologies).\n\nAs for toxic community - I think it really depends on the particular servers.

Say 'hi' to your neighbours when you get a chance and if they're asshats then move before you get too established. The map is big (took about four hours for me to walk around the outline of the pangaea though I was collecting stuff and crafting along the way, so not rushing).\n\nTwo weeks playing and I've only died twice (within the same hour by two idiot friends who both pretended to be friendly to shoot me in the back), while playing solo.\n\nThe developers are very active both in Discord and in-game, and working diligently to fix issues, get the optimum servers for their players, and listen to input from players about suggestions for the future of the game. \n\nIt isn't too deep right now for it's content in regards to crafting. But even grinding full time you'll be looking at roughly 3 weeks to complete all tech trees.\n\nCurrently (April 30/19), the bombs are nerfed, so now is the best time to build a bit of a base and try out some things without having to worry too much about getting destroyed (once you have stone + iron doors at least). If you leave for longer than your land claim, don't log back in expecting your base to still be standing. It only takes a second to log in and have your base timer reset, no different than any of these games. If you no-show for days, then someone is going to take your stuff.\n\nI really enjoy having the developer actually come into the game, so you have the ability to mention things that are off currently about balancing, or to suggest things that could help in the future, and get their feedback while you play. Nice to see their commitment to the game, and involvement with the community.\n\nPVE is available on Community servers, it will be brought in on official servers in Mid-May.\n\nSome players complain a bunch about dying repeatedly but they're usually is a good cause for their dying (kosing others, or trying to, staying around highly contested resource areas where they're guaranteed to run into pkers looking for an easy score, or being insulting in chat and so getting what they deserve). The map is big, if you have issue with certain players move somewhere else away from them.

So, I am not repeating what the guy has already said. \n\nI have read that this game was originally designed as a pvp game. I would say that is a very ambitious attempt, actually too ambitious. As a pve game, however, it does have some values. There are a lot of interesting things, say animals, alien species, plants, ... to be explored on the map. The map is fixed for every game (I suppose it is because the game was originally designed fro pvp) which limits its replayability as a pve game. The basic setting of this game is good. So, you just happen to be a survivor on a big island/planet where there are different regions, each with different fauna and flora, some tame and edible, some hostile and poisonous. You know nothing about anything, not even the map of the island. So, you basically start as a hunter-gatherer. As a pve exploration and survival game, it is undoubted interesting. \n\nSome people say it is a farming game. Yes, but you farm for some specific purposes. This game is quest based. Finishing a quest allows you to gain learning points to learn survival and other technologies to finish some new quests. Say, a region have high radio activities, so you need to learn the technology to get there in order to fulfill some quests that may require you to kill some mutated animals in that region. But eventually, you goal is to leave the planet.\n\nI played like 20 hours without finishing the game as a single player, then joined one of the public pvp servers. It was brutal cause the setting was such that you already have some resources and knowledge (up to level 4 knowledge) to begin with and each farming action will give you like 10x (I actually don't know exactly) the amount at the normal setting. The worst part for an inexperienced player is that many of the pvp players are seriously experienced. Given all the pre-loaded resources, they crafted everything, especially weapons and armors, overnight. So, even though you joined a server 1 or 2 days late, you will be doomed cause there is no more farming. You basically just build your base asap and start fighting, killing, and looting. \n\nThe pve game, however, is a lot more fun for inexperienced or less experienced players, cause you can really enjoy planning, designing, exploring, ... while learning how to play this game at your own pace. This makes me wonder why the developer wanted this game to be an online pvp game. All the commerce, decoration, ..., knowledge in the game become totally useless. Who will even attempt to farm outside your own base when you will be killed and looted right after you have finished farming? So, my guess is, you just form the largest clan and you will absolutely dominate this game. \n\nI have played expensive online war games before. Games like Vikings War of Clan do have wars between clans. But eventually most clans in a kingdom must cooperate because they have kvk (kingdom vs kingdom events). The pvp version of this game is just getting your clan done and building your base asap (which skipped more than 10 to 20 days of a normal pve game) and getting ready to kick other people out of this game. Kill-loot is what the pvp game is all about. \n\nSo, my bottom line is if you play this game as a single player, buy it when it is on sale. If you like killing-looting pvp games, it is ok, but not great.

However, once you do, it becomes clear that the entirety of the rest of the time you spend in this game - after the first hour or so - will be tedious grinding to learn enough LP (learning points) to progress in the tech tree, so that you can make anything cool and enjoy the game. \n\nThere are also some asinine design decisions that block having much fun with this game. Once you create a land claim (an expandable space for your base), if  you log out anywhere except that land claim for too long, both your character and all of your items and your entire base get deleted. Ostensibly to \"save space.\" On servers that only support about 200 people. Where there's more than enough room on the map for all of them. On top of that, the game will not stop you from making a second land claim and even makes it appear like you can have more than one active at a time. You can't. \n\nAll advanced tech in the game - anything more than a 1940s level - takes countless hours of grinding for uncommon materials and learning points, too.

In Early Access the game was very playable and enjoyable. Once I had reached the top of the tech, I put the game aside to await the release. I recently started playing again to see how the released version compared, and although I did not see any noticeable differences (except the single player mode option), I was also pleased to see it was still very playable and enjoyable. \n\nThe basics first \u2013 in the game you can forage, farm, craft, build, research, and fight. Not really revolutionary or original concepts. But I love these kind of games, and am always interested to see how a game can stand out with new innovations to these old concepts. \n\nThe user interface is very easy to pick up \u2013 barely any learning curve to the game at all. Yet the game still contains enough depth to keep experienced gamers interested. The only real issue in usability that I hit was when I needed to figure out how to destroy a land claim I no longer wanted \u2013 quick search on google and the solution? Craft and use a crowbar. \n\nThere is a fair bit of grinding in the game, but as you research newer technologies, the grinding becomes more automated or easier to accomplish. Almost every technology in the game is to \u201cmake life simpler\u201d for the player in one way or another. I found the grinding was sufficient that researching new technologies felt gratifying and rewarding, yet not enough that it felt tedious \u2013 a very nice balance many similar games have not achieved. \n\nI found the tech in the research to be innovative and unique to this game, yet intuitive and easy to figure out and enjoy. \n\nOriginally CryoFall was only online which made me cautious to try it. I have disliked many MMOs due to overcrowding, the simple inability to join certain tasks/quests due to a lack of level or experience in the game, or how the skills in many MMOs are gained on a timer instead of any meaningful reason.\n\nAs such I was originally reluctant to try CryoFall. But I was pleasantly surprised. Unlike those MMOs, Cryofall allows you to be a part of the entire game from the moment you start. You may want to get better gear before taking on some tasks, but you are not prevented from trying. In fact, I found the lack of restraints provides a natural mechanism for the forming of comradeship in the game, joining with other players to explore and take on harder tasks. In some ways it reminded me of the natural mechanism of comradeship that the old Ultima Online used (for those as old as me and remember UO).\n\n\nLike any game, there are things that you may want to consider before buying:\n\nThis game is about grinding. If you don\u2019t like grinding games, this game is not for you.\n\nAlthough the research is well balanced, I found that it could have been more extensive. Once you hit the top of the research, there are some bosses to go beat which will entertain you for another hour or two, but really there isn\u2019t much more to do in the game.\n\nThere is no filter on the chat. I was a bit surprised as it\u2019s been ages since I\u2019ve seen a chat in an MMO that didn\u2019t have some kind of filtering mechanism. There is an option to not use the chat, but a great deal of the game is lost without the ability to communicate with the other players. The foul language that popped up on occasion didn\u2019t bother me, but if foul language really annoys you, this isn\u2019t the game for you. \n\nThe servers are reset when a new major update is released. Everything in the world, including your character, will disappear and you\u2019ll have to start again from scratch. The servers are not reset often, but just be aware that it does happen and you\u2019ll lose all your progress.\n\nTo help with overcrowding the world, your bases will start to degrade after a certain period of time. Although I understand the reason behind it, it does make it tough to go on a holiday for month, or to take a break from the game without losing all of your progress.\n\nThere was a recent update which added the ability to play the game in single player mode. I have not tried it, but I think a lot of the fun in the game would be lost without the multiplayer aspect.\n\nOverall, I found CryoFall very enjoyable and playable, and would recommend it as long as you\u2019re ok with the above \u201cissues\u201d.\n", "timestamp_created": 1634193810, "timestamp_updated": 1634193810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627947151660919189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130378261": {"recommendationid": "130378261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050656495", "num_games_owned": 862, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4959, "last_played": 1672697480}, "language": "english", "review": "77.7 hours of grind, 5 hours of content", "timestamp_created": 1673124192, "timestamp_updated": 1673124192, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627248585224151611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84836222": {"recommendationid": "84836222", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977790310", "num_games_owned": 1050, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1633765873}, "language": "english", "review": "So since the developers implemented a way to play in Singleplayer with your own rates and no base decay, suddenly the game is fun again.
