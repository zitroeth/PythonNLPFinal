The king gets to set taxes that other players pay as they gather materials, high taxes really motivate people to overthrow the king, but also make it a lot harder for to collect materials.\n- Proximity voicechat\n- When you log out you turn into a \"Sleeper\", ie your avatar is replaced with a guy in a sleeping bag and people can kill you if they can reach you. So log out in the safety of your territory or find a really good hiding place.\n- You can tie people up with rope and imprison them or send them to the gallows\n- You can make crossbows, bows, siege equipment\n- Weapons, armor, and blocks are all tiered (wood, leather, stone, iron, steel | dirt, grass, clay, wood, stone, stone slab)\n\nWhat I don't like about it\n- The combat is like Chivalry - good thing is you can block and there is a stamina bar. But many fights end up as run around the person hitting or kiting. You can choose which way you swing horizontally, but it's purpose is more so you don't hit a wall or tree while you swing. No directional blocking.\n- Very little inventory space and the containers chests are quite small too.\n\nNot many negatives. I've only had one game breaking bug occur in 14 hours. A couple smaller bugs. It's a fun game and for $20 bucks I've already got my moneys worth.\n\nToday two knuckleheads tried to break down my gate. I stood on my wall shooting arrows at them. One guy managed to doublejump (it's possible to do against blocks) on to my wall and began running around my base. I ran behind him slashing him with my 2h steel axe. After he was dealt with I went back to the 2nd guy still hacking away at my gate and asking him to leave. He demanded a fair fight so I obliged and engaged him in a duel.

No, you should not buy this game, and here's a short explanation why you shouldn't.\n\nFirst, let me clarify that I'm not some squeaker that bought this game last week with daddy's credit card. I've played this game since alpha 5. I've witnessed the rise and fall of trolling hackers with admin-like abilities, and I remember the beginning of the Asian Invasion of torch jumpers. I've played/enjoyed/wasted over 1000 hours on this game.\n\nReasons Why You Shouldn't Purchase This Game:\n\n1. Scenario: You play the game for 4 hours building a modest base with sound security. You log for the evening. The next day, you find that you are dead and your base is completely gone. You deduce that your base was raided while you were offline. You are angry, but you decide to build another base. The previous scenario happens another 3 or 4 times over the next week. Base building starts to seem trivial.\n\nThe Devs solution to this problem is some sort of totem system that protects your crest and a small portion of your base while you are offline. That's almost akin to putting a bandaid on a broken leg. The problem lies with who is playing on the server, and by who, I mean region or more specifically, time zone. For example, if people from a completely different time zone (think China) play on a North American server consistently, the vast majority of people will be offline when the vast majority of the opposing time zone(r)s are on. This creates a raid imbalance of sorts. The solution would be region locking the serves. The Devs are trying to solve this is a round about way by booting people with high pings, but i'm sure there will be ways around that which leads me to my next point.\n\n2. Combat System: If you and the person you are fighting have a ping of 100ms or less, PvP is quite enjoyable. But, if you're fighting someone with a 200ms + ping (and yes this happens on a daily basis - that whole region thing again), the player with the high ping has a great advantage over you. Imagine getting headshot from 20 meters away.\n\n3. Seige Equipment: At this point, siege equipment no longer seems balanced. An average person with a trebuchet can destroy a decent base with thick walls in about 5 minutes. There was a time when a good castle could last a week or maybe 2. Nowadays, a castle usually doesn't survive one siege attempt.\n\n4. Player Base: Any way you cut it, the player base is shrinking. Thus, servers have been shutdown. If seems that if this trend continues, this game will not survive.

However, in this case, I feel it is only fair to let people know a thing or two.\n\nWhat ROK is right now, is the end result.      In that point, the dev's have been honest when they said they won't be adding or changing anything from now on. \n\nThis game has been abandoned.       The dev's will try to tell you otherwise, which just makes them look delusional.\n\nThis game had potential,  but was let down big time.      I can safely say the game was running better in Alpha 6 than after \"Release\".\n\nFor peope finding that hard to believe and want to know more;  read on.    \n-I won't mention cheats, eventhough it was the dev's fault not even thinking about any sort of anti-cheat for a CLIENT-based game.  Hacks were running hot in this game and made many players quit, but almost every online game out there gets those.-\n\n- The only things added during the 1 year Early Access Alpha worth mentioning:    \n\n+Ping protected Servers: ( important as this game runs client side based, which basically means,  the higher your ping, the more you lag, the more advantage you have)\n\n+Siege damage adjustment: (So building which took 30hours to build won't be shot to pieces in 15minutes)\n\n+ Crest Totems: (so people can't destroy the totem if crested, and therefore not just put the entire base in their pocket, instead of raiding)\n\nTime between server wipes increased to around 1 Month, from previous 7days.\n\n+A second map.\n\n+A very small change to the guild system, which still is useless.\n\n-Fishing and Farming  ( Fishing being very important for a PvP-Building game apparently)\n\nThats it.    Also worth mentioning these things have taken close to a year to be added. \n\nAnd there has been no improvment to the King System, or any end game content added.\n\nEverything else, like flute tunes and flower dresses can hardly be called content.\n\nNone of the game mechanics or end game content the EA playerbase wanted and suggested was done.\n\n\nThe base game still is the same as at start.  Nothing other has changed from EA launch.  Just more lag.\n\nYou say \"oh wait they are still doing bug fixes and performance updates every other month\"\n\nGame breaking bugs and glitches have taken more than half a year to even be addressed (Like the popular \"bag on head wall glitch\" )\n\nThere still is game breaking glitches in the game  (item duping for example)\n\nThese often don't get fixed, just altered.   And every time there is a patch, new bugs appear and performance gets a little worse.\n\n\nI myself had some great fun with this game and hoped for improvment until \"Releas\" announcement.   But after it has become clear that the game will never improve, (when they announced months before \"Release\" that Fishing and Farming will be the only things they will implement)  there is nothing that would make me install this game ever again.    Waste of time at the best.\n\nIn my personal opinion and from what I have seen here, CodeHatch are a bunch of amateurs.\n\nNot even the top pinned forum thread \"Community Suggestions\" has been unpinned or deleted.  After close to a year saying nothing will be added anymore.       - This isn't just laziness,   it is to make people, checking out the forum before buying the game, think that it is still being worked on.\n\n\nOnly a matter of time until this low populated game is fully dead.\n\nGreat potential turned into great failure.\n\nEdit: Still the same mess and the only people getting banned are the ones who mention the dupes still in the game.

Offering a new twist on the RPG/Sandbox survival. The block building was interesting and tier based, allowing players to upgrade their first structure into castle like bases. This game is truly a one of a kind game. The combat system similar to chivilary was hilarious and made for fun and intense battles. One of the funniest things about this game was its capture system. Ropes or chains could be used to capture an enemy and if done correctly would send your victim ragdolling behind your feet as you dragged them to a torture or holding device such as a guillotine or pillory/cage. Alongside that was an in-game voice com system that lead to loads of roleplay and shenanigans. All in all this was one of the funniest and most enjoyable games I have ever played. Huge wars, Raiding, Reigning, Trading, Mining, Fighting, Trapping, Sieging, Capturing, Hunting, Gathering, Empires, Kings, Taxes, Roleplay, Leveling, Building, Crafting. This game had so much to offer. Unfortunately in early access the devolpers clearly dropped the game and stopped coming out with new content. Because this game relies almost entirely on having a large community of players such as games like (Rust,Scum) it eventually died out. Going from 1000's of players online to under 50.

I see a campfire and some dancing figures in the distance. I run towards them, hoping to make new friends and explore the world together.\n\nI approach them, cautiously. My time in DayZ has left me a little gun-shy in these survival games. They spammed a few wave emotes, so I came in closer and thought I'd join them.\n\nQueue Admiral Ackbar, \"IT'S A TRAP!\" One of them tossed several spears into my chest while the other clubbed me into submission. \n\nWell played, you savages. \n\nSpawn 2:\n\nDecide to completely avoid the beach area, and attempt to find shelter with the high king. Surely, he would not deny shelter to a loyal citizen of his kingdom. I run to the bridge, not seeing a single soul on my way there.\n\nI hop over their little hedge fence with little effort. It was cute though. So, +1 point for aesthetically-pleasing, but -1 point for lack of actual defensive-usefulness. \n\nI was greeted by the king's loyal guards, fully decked out in metal armor and weapons. I un-equip my club-like-thing, and yell into my mic, \"I am here to serve my king! Long may he reign!\" \n\nOne was walking around me, judging me, and seeing if I would be a problem. The other one equipped this long, brown item into his hands. \"My word, good sir, that is a fine rope you have there!\"\n\nNext thing I know, I am a ragdoll, completely left to the whim of my capturer. The laughter I brushed off early, should have been my early warning. He took me to their stockade, and locked me in. I was helpless. More laughter. \n\nThen, the one guard equipped the largest axe I have seen in game yet. And proceeded to chop my head off, despite my pleas against such an idea. I then heard them say, \"Leave his body, as a warning to the rest.\" \n\nBefore I respawned, I saw the king apologize for his guard's poor behavior, and said he was \"new\" and \"still in training.\" Followed by a strange term that must be for the upper echelon's of royalty in game. He used \"lol\". Surely, he meant \"Lots of Luck\" in my future lives. God bless him. Long may he reign, indeed. \n\nSpawn 3:\n\nSpawn on beach. Run inland, not towards castle. I find a huge wooden shelter that must have taken hours to build. I find a stray block on one wall, and jump into their base. Nothing fancy inside. But wait...\n\nA man in inside this base. He is sleeping. Had this been one of my first 2 spawns, I may have gone, \"Oh, my word. This is your fort. My apologies.\" And then promptly left. \n\nBut this was not my first spawn. And this was not my second spawn. Third time's the charm, eh?\n\nI equip the beginning club, and proceed to bash this poor man's head in. His blood had lined the walls of his establishment. I loot his corpse/bag thing.\n\nJesus, this man was packing. Armor, food, water, weapons. He had it all. Unfortunate that he had to die this way. Oh well. Should have checked to see if he was truly safe before bedding himself. I took all his stuff. I equipped the armor and sword, and then hopped back outside.\n\nAnother armor-equipped man came running past shortly after. He complimented me. \"That's a nice house you have there.\"\n\nWhy yes, yes it is. \n\nI am learning.\nI am evolving. \nSoon, all your bases are belong to me. \n\nI am Sir Gruffles, and this...\nThis is only the beginning.\n\nTL;DR: Died horribly in first 2 spawns. Learned from mistakes, killed sleeping man, and took his loot in third life.\n\n10/10: Can't wait to play again.\n\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nSpawn 4:\nMy knowledge is growing. I ran to an open field, built a hatchet, and began farming wood.\nBuilt a workstation and a campfire, and let it be open to all who approach for their use.\nMet some nice peasants, who seemed friendly enough. I taught them the ways of the craft.\n\nWe built armor, fed on the meat of sheep and rabbits, and defended our little plot of land against several attempts of savagery. It turns out, they were no savages. They were knights in disguise! Sent by his royal doucheness to stop any and all attempts at overthrowing him! \n\nIt was this, that sparked the revolution. We were a peaceful unit, thrown into the hell that is war. And he would pay dearly. We formed a guild, with me as its leader (probably cause I had a bit more knowledge of crafting than the others, and I was tallest). We were known throughout the land as, Band of Sirs. \n\nWe upgraded our benches and fires, until we could work with iron. We crafted better armor, and real weapons! The revolution was at hand!\n\nWe waited for the cover of nightfall to make the approach on the castle. With weapons in hand, my brothers and I stormed the bridge! There was no resistance at first....until we were faced with the worst enemy possible...a wooden wall and gate. We started striking the door with all our might, in an attempt to break it down.\n\nApparently, the king was right behind it! Because he and his 2 guards were laughing at our attempts to get through... The next thing we knew, they were on top of their post and their defense began. The rain of the javelins! My main were getting pierced with their wooden spikes of death. Our blood was creating a lake of death and despair the likes of which this realm has never withnessed. \n\nBut we also planted some of our own javelins firmly into the nads of our dear king! But he got cocky after that! With the king sword in hand, he jumped from that safety of his gate, right into the middle of my guild!\n\nApparently, his highness' sword is rather....long....and hurty. With one swing of his weapon, the first of my men perished. He fought to his dying breath. The other 2 of my men yelled out in pain, yet continued to throw spears into the king. I unsheated my iron sword and engaged!\n\nI parryed the next swing of his sword, and took a swing of my own. It connected! The king was bleeding! We had hope! Until his highness ran past me, and cut down another member of my guild. The next thing I knew, the last member of my guild was also dead. It was just me and the king. \nI lasted longer than I thought I would. I parryed many of his swings. Alas, my stamina was too low to maintain a proper defense. I would fall, alongside my brothers. \n\nUpon death, the king declared he was one more swing from my sword away from death. He honored our brave attempts at overthrowing him, but making taxes 0% for a day. Well played, your majesty. For now.\n\nSpawn 5 in comments :D\n\nWhile Spawn 5 story is def worth a read, here's a TL;DR:\n\nSaid F IT to strategy. Ran to gate again. Found traitor from guild as gate guard. King saw us with nothing, said we werent a threat, and let us in. Bashed another sleeping guard's head in. Took armor and weapons. Started usurping. One guard and traitor came to stop me. Traitor yells out \"ITS A DOUBLE CROSS!\" And attacked other guard! We double teamed him and killed him! THE KING WAS HAVING CONNECTION ISSUES! I usurped again and I became the new king!\n\nALL HAIL KING GRUFFLES!\n\nLong may I reign.\n\nI thank the men of Band of Sirs for their loyalty and sacrifice. You will not be forgotten.\n\n(3/24/15) Uploaded 2 highlights to Twitch channel and YouTube. Spawns 4 & 5 are shown. Hope you all can get a few more laughs from them ^.^.

An island with a throne. An objective of becoming the King. What I expected was a Game of Thrones with guilds of players working together to capture territory and to install their leader as King. Backstabbing and intrigue. And lone wolfs just trying to survive amidst it all. What I actually got was Lord of the Flies reenacted by the inmates of Aylesbury Young Offenders Institute.\n\nI started off, found some abandoned half destroyed ruin in a forest at the edge of the island and started building it up. Repaired the walls. Built new facilities inside. Got killed finding resources but I learned from it. Built iron doors. Built a stone outer wall. Things were going great!\n\nYou use crests to mark territory, and I had a basic leather one in my base. This makes it so players cannot remove blocks from your house so if they want in they have to force entry.\n\nI had acquired the resources for an iron one which marks a wider amount of space so I could have a big thick stone wall around my base for protection. Unfortunately you can only have 1 crest at a time even if it's in your own territory so to replace the crest I had to remove my previous one and place a new one, accepting 10 minutes of complete vulnerability until it remarked the territory.\n\nSo I remove my crest and put the new iron one down. At that moment 10 (not kidding) japanese players in iron armour came storming over, tore down my walls and took my items while I hid in my panic room. Stepping out I noticed the devestation and ina fury ran out in my steel armour with ym steel greatsword. Naturally this didn't end well for me\n\nI was then informed that these people are hackers who ruin the game for everyone and scrolling down through the reviews I noticed that this is a common problem.\n\nYou know, up until that point I would have given this game another glowing review. But the destruction of hours and hours of my hard work have left me in an understandably bitter mood and the developers attitude towards the hacking problem doesn't help.\n\nSo 8/10 before the hack and 0/10 post-hack due to the game being unplayable. DO NOT BUY!\n\nEdit: Against my better judgement I decided to give this game another try. Spent hours building a new base and then a new patch was released, wiping the servers and destroying my work. So I spent many more hours building another base, had to answer the phone while I was out finding resources and since your character goes to sleep in the game when you log out I logged back in to find I had been killed while I was away having a life. Got back to my base to find 2 lovely chaps had not only taken over my base but had also built a prison outside and put someone in it. Now my base was made out of wood with a top tier iron door outside. For a new player with limited access to resources (and since the stone quarry is swarming with heavily armed players looking for newbies to kill) this is basically the best I could achieve. I even put my crest inside the walls so they would have to tear them down to find it if they wanted to take over. Naturally this didn't stop these 2, whether it was hacks or high level equipment they somehow got in, found and destroyed my crest. Since the walls seemed intact they either rebuilt them exactly or they simply hacked it, most likely the latter.\n\nTried to force entry into my own home and they both came out. My attacks passed through them doing no damage and eventually I died. Please for the love of god DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!\n\nFinal Edit:\n\nSo after I pulled myself together I decided to give it one final try with two objectives, retake my base and be crowned as Queen!\n\nI made a new base nearby my old one, gathered my power there then forced entry and retook it, leaving the miserable gits who took it handcuffed and sealed in a cobblestone box.\n\nWith that unpleasantness out of the way I turned my attention towards the throne at which point the server promptly shut down, one of about 2/3 of all the servers that were shut down!\n\nSo I joined another server, built a new base, then when I logged back in later all traces of my base had vanished and I was now playing as a fat bald man....\n\nSensing a pattern I decided not to bother building anything anymore since between server wipes, game breaking errors, servers shutting down and high level players you are lucky if anything you build lasts a few hours.\n\nSomeone had built a cobblestone wall on the bridge to the castle but I was able to get around it by building a skybridge. Passing through there I was immediately ganged up on and killed by 2 steel clad people. The only other 2 people on the server. Apparently they just wait there with the patience of the ancients for someone to log in, get through or around their stone wall, and then get killed by them both.\n\nSo I jumped servers and found a castle with a massive wall on it and a lot of player activity. I decided to get around this by gathering many cheap blocks and building a staircase behind the castle up to the top, no mean feat since the rock the castle stands on must be about 200 blocks tall! Fortunately I didn't need to waste much time on this because I ran into a bug where every approx 5 minutes my screen goes black forcing me to log out and in again, and if I was in the sea I drop to 40 fathoms below it and drown before I can get back up again\n\nNext server had nothing on the bridge but a couple of steel clad foul mouthed kiddies. After getting massacred the first time I came up with a plan. I made a bed and ran past them, placed it down behind a rock then did an Obi Wan and lowered my club as they slaughtered me with cries of noob and nigerian.\n\nSo they ran off back to the front of the bridge to await their next victim while I respawned at the bed. I then spent 45 minutes clubbing my way through the wooden wall they had built to block entrance to the castle and seized the throne before they could get back to stop me! At that moment I felt something like overcoming an especially tough boss in Dark Souls!\n\nI think I know now why the game ended up so far from it's vision. The game trailers give a fair amount of attention to the presences of ropes, shackles, cages and torture devices, which are clearly present for the sake of bullying and griefing. Of course these things do exist in the Medieval era and I gave it little thought. But when a bully watches that trailer they will be drawn to the game by the promise of these griefing tools.\n\nIn practice they lack the patience to craft the necessary facilities to produce these things, and simply travel in gangs attacking lone players and destroying their work with their clubs. What's more the game artwork displays caracatures of bloated troll like men acting like monkeys and the in-game character customisation option not only allows for exaggerated anatomy, but the pvp meta is of a pitch black midget with maximum size arms for the smallest target to hit with the longest reach. In the end the game advertising appeals to exactly these sorts of people who drive away everyone else and leave the community a toxic cesspool.\n\nSo I suppose in the end this game is like Dark Souls meets Lord of the Flies, except the hollows are obscenity spewing bullying ganging adolescents, and the bosses are server wipes, servers closing and game breaking bugs. That all said, I'm glad I can finally uninstall this ordeal with peace of mind that I didn't let it break me :)", "timestamp_created": 1432819536, "timestamp_updated": 1433080685, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1136, "votes_funny": 448, "weighted_vote_score": "0.856344401836395264", "comment_count": 161, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17111237": {"recommendationid": "17111237", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969754412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 13305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13072, "last_played": 1437884895}, "language": "english", "review": "With almost 200 hours in game I'll say that the concept is great and very fun at times.  However, unless you are online 24/7 or have an international guild, you cannot maintain a base.  My friends and I have build good multi layered cobblestone+ bases that are completely leveled when we log off and go to sleep.  A steel crest with 6 layers of cobblestone will not prevent it.\n\nThe developers need to come up with a solution for the middle of the night base destruction.  For instance, in real life if you were asleep, and someone attacks your base, you'd wake up.  But when you log off the game and go to bed, you're screwed.  There is no balance for this.  It's simply not fun to spend a week gathering stone, iron and wood to build one of the strongest bases in the game just to have it all wiped out because someone else doesn't go to bed the same time you do.  \n\nIdeas:\n\n1.  How about Once a person logs off, the block hit-points are incrementally increased by a factor of 120.  Each hour you are offline they decrease by a factor of 5.  So blocks with normal hitpoints of 3000 would have 360,000 for the first hour - 180,000 hit-points 6 hours later and 3,000 hitpoints after 24 hours.  This would help both the legitimate seasoned players as well as the new players defend against griefers and midnight attackers.  \n\n2.  Implement a killcam so if your base is leveled in the middle of the night, you can at least see who did it and how they did it.  I have a sneaking suspicion the last base level was not legit and possibly a hack.  My friend said they used gunpowder kegs (which is currently disabled in this version of the game.)  But there's no way to know because there's no telling what happened.  Hint: even in medieval times people would know who leveled a town.  Why not in this game?\n\nSo unless you like gathering resources and building bases just to have them destroyed immediately I can't recommend this game in it's current state.\n", "timestamp_created": 1437242596, "timestamp_updated": 1437242596, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 374, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851917266845703125", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14908418": {"recommendationid": "14908418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043709457", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 7911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4757, "last_played": 1516500248}, "language": "english", "review": "- Spawn in with a wood stick\n- Befriend a pack of wild midgets who claim themselves as the \"Ungos\"\n- Travel with the Ungo Tribe until one of them screams \"REVOLUTION!\"\n- Go to the King's Palace and somehow take down a guard in full steel\n- I pick up his armor and weapon\n- Go to the throne where the king is sitting\n- The Ungos try to kill the king, but they are no match for his mighty sword\n- Scream \"YOU TYRANT!\"\n- Get into heated battle with King\n- Right before I slay the tyranous King, he jumps off of the ledge trying to fall into water\n- Spills his royal blood on the rocks and falls into the ocean where he drowns\n- I go up to the throne with my newfound pride\n- Claim the throne, and name the realm \"The Ungo Lands\"\n- The Ungos reunite with me, and for their loyalty I give them taxed equipment to make them my royal knights\n- Ungo Tribesmen start building defenses for me\n- I tax the citizens 20% (highest amount of tax)\n- A revolution spurs to which my Ungos put down immediately with the swift action of their steel battle axes\n- I recruit 4 more people to be my knights and I dress them in full steel armor\n- Become an evil king and pillage my people's lands\n- Loyalist group arises favoring the previous king\n- \"The War of Two Swords\" occurs\n- Destroy their castle and lands while freeing their PoWs and putting them into my army\n- Get assassinated in my sleep, the Ungo Leader assumes the throne and exiles me\n\nI now wonder if my revolution was to put down a tyrannical king, or to make another one.\n\nUPDATE:\nOriginally, this game was the bee's knees; exactly how I imagined it to be. However, as the game's age went from a day old (bought the game on day 2 of release) to a week old to two weeks old...people started cracking the code and made *dun dun dun* hacking clients.\n\nTo be honest, even though this game is Early Access it doesn't give the developers an excuse to not implement an anti-hack system. I know that they didn't expect this game to blow up as it has, but on the same token if I were a game developer I would add VAC or EAC before releasing.\nI haven't seen many hackers (quite frankly only speed hackers) but I have gone AFK to find my home that I spent 3 hours on (people that say they spent 10 hours on a house are overexagerating, 3 hours is sufficient for a good home) and my inventory completely ravaged and destroyed. This was due to a hacker.\n\nIf any of you that are reading this are very well experienced into video games (i.e. 4+ years) you would know that \"hackers\" are 12 year old kids that think they're anonymoose for searching up \"reign of kings hacks\" on Google and downloading something off of MPGH. Well, the real hackers (the ones who code the hacks) are usually 20 years plus, and probably make those downloadable files full of trojans, so fear not; the prepubescents and little kids are probably ruining their Dad's desktop. However, with the many hacks available, and not every single one being malicious, it's hard for all hackers to see problems with their computer in the future, so no justice will come their way. There will always be hackers if there is a malfunction in the game. The fix? Don't play the game for another week or so. If Code}{atch doesn't implement anti-cheat within the week, drop the game and never buy from them again, as this would be their second strike. I will personally be wiping my story above and making my review negative if they don't add anti-cheat.\n\nTo the hackers out there, hacking a video game and ruining another's good time and $20.00 is usually a sign of extreme insecurity, boredom (means you have no friends if you're hacking a game like this), and jerkking off for the rest of your life. Just don't.

The building is simple (mine craft style), combat can be fun (think chivalry but a dumber version of it) and it looks ok enough for the price. \n\nProblem is the game just feels incomplete. Hackers run rampant across the worlds, combat is buggy at the best of times (hence the \u201ccan be fun\u201d), there are many exploits that have been around since the start and it is over all unbalanced. \n\nOn a more personal note the development started taking a weird turn towards the last 5 months when they though it was a good idea to add things like fishing and farming to a castle build/siege and sword fighting game. There are many other glaring issues and features that could have been looked at. Also there is no real benefit to doing either of these when you can kill and cook wild animals or just live off berries (which I did constantly). \n\nAt the end of the day after the population went from thousands to hundreds they slapped a done badge on it and called it a day.

I do however recommend you do your research on ANY developer before personally supporting them in an Early Access title. If their past issues put a huge red flag up for you I do not blame you and I recommend you look elsewhere regardless of the games current state.\n\nThat being said let's critque the actual current build of the game. I am writing this on 3/11/2015 and have had press access for around a week now.\n\nCrafting: Crafting is really well done and the amount of things you can craft right now is honestly amazing for an early access title. Pretty much everything you see in the world alive/dead can be used for some sort of recipe. There is siege weapons, torture weapons, and a decent selection of major building blocks for castle/house creation. Another HUGE plus is that crafting stations like fireplaces and benches are able to be picked up which makes moving very easy.\n\nThe World: Although quite small the world does feel well thought out. There is some absolutely beautiful scenery in this game and I find certain parts of the world hold rarer resources (for example one side of the map may have an abundance of rocks but no flax to be found). I like that it makes moving pretty much needed.\n\nCombat: Having only tested combat once I am definitely not a guru on this subject but it did feel quite decent, latency definitely affects projectiles quite drastically and might be an issue for some people expecting super smooth combat. Overall with melee I had no major complaints but it can be improved.\n\nBuilding: Building just fine, my only complaint is if you misplace a block theres no delete option and you have to sit there for 5 minutes whacking it to get rid of it so take you time placing them. This would also make rearranging a nightmare.\n\nPolitics: Politics atleast right now seem very basic with one king ruler who can impose a tax and claim the land name. You also get a crown and very decent sword. I did not see any way to form a guild so I cannot mention much about that now.\n\nGathering: Gathering in this game is very well done. Upgraded or gathering-focused weapons yield more per hit and the way trees fall and break is very rewarding, you visually can see how much is left in a resource and it makes gathering kind of enjoyable.\n\nSurvival: This is where I think this game went a little wrong. I don't see the need for survival mechanics personally. It is very hard at the start unless you have a good spawn point with an abundance of berries. I would rather see future developement focus on political warfare and creation aspects, I feel survival will feel more like a nuisance than fun for most casual players.\n\nSever Size: Currently the server size is EXTREMELY small to keep with the map size I assume (I think it's 28 players). This is a huge downside to me, when it comes to medieval warfare you want huge battles with 100's of people. I definitely hope they plan on expanding the map and increasing the server size in the future.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my time and I think this game had great potential but it's very hard to judge in it's current state how it will play out as a political controlling type game.

If you are looking for a medieval combat game, I would recommend Chivalry: Medeival Warfare. And if you are looking for a survival game with base building and very similar features to this, I would recommend Rust (even though I have not put many hours into Rust since that major update while back)\n\nedit:\nThe fact that you need at minimum a 64-bit computer with an Intel core i5, a full 6GB of RAM and a GPU that appears no where near as low as I would expect for something that looks visually this unappealing. My computer is well over the recommended requirements and I got horrendous amounts of lag when looking at certain areas (not even on the top graphics settings).\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI would not recommend this game or any of the developers work.\nThis game along with many other survival games (often made simply in unity, and with assets taken from the unity asset store) has [b]\"POTENTIAL\"[/b] and with what Steam is becoming now, potential just doesn't seem good enough for anything in my opinion.\n\nWarning this bit starts to rant more on what gets into steam!\n\nThere are a large amount of games being greenlit as jokes e.g. Grass Simulator. (Who at steam allowed that crap to get into steam after it being greenlit???)\n\nVALVE, WHERE IS YOUR CONTENT MODERATION?! Where have your standards gone?\n\n- Sinister Sloth Minister (John Key of New Zealand)\n\nedit 2 (if some of this does not make sense read comments):\nI will now point out, survival games would not be my favourite genre (my favourite would be story rich and in-depth games), I do however continue to play the DayZ mod for ArmA II (I would compare Reign of Kings to Rust but I have not played Rust all too much sinch it's major update a while ago, so I am not in a position to compare the two) and for me Reign of Kings does not live up to the same enjoyment, exploration and accomplisment as DayZ does.\nYes Reign of Kings does have very unique features (the taxing system and it trys to bring a large amount of roleplay to the game, but unfortunatly I was not able to see this), these bring the game a great deal of potential but unfortunatly it just wasn't executed as well as it could have been.\n\nThis is entirely my opinion. Feel free to share yours, but please don't go all fanboy on me though ;)\n\nedit 3 (so many edits :D. Some positive points! Also this might be messy as I am tired and hungry :P):\nAs MrJoe has pointed out in a comment, I was incorrect with some of my claims about game updates and content updates (there was one a few days ago).\nMrJoe also points out that Reign of Kings is in a much better state than other Alphas on Steam (main reason why I am not so fond of Steam's \"Early Access\") like DayZ standalone.\nAs I have not played much of this game [Reign of Kings] for a while, I have been told this game has been changing in each update.\n\nI may not recommend this game in it's current state as there are other survival games that are in a better state than this. But I will revisit this review much later to determine whether this game deserves my recommendation or now.\n\nAlso there are many negative reviews based around their experiences playing the game (e.g. blah blah, base raided and everything lost, blah blah), I would like to address these reviews. These people are all talking about gameplay issues, in this games state this is going to be an issue for [b]some[/b] people due to the game not being fully balanced (gameplay issues with safe zones, clan flag (I think it's called that, can't remember the name off the top of my head) and other bugs).

So, here's a classic steam review story! :) \n\n*REAL REVIEW BELOW\n\n~Spawned on a beach, looked around and didn't see anyone. I then discovered I had a club and decided to run around.\n\n~Stumbled upon two lads in sleeping bags. \n\n~Killed two lads in sleeping bags with said newly discovered club.\n\n~Spent about an hour running around until I finally reached the far end of the map...WAAAAAY away from the kings \n\n~Spent another 4 hours building my base. After I fortified my cabin with a few walls of logs I decided I was safe and it was time to recruite a teamate! So me and this guy met up near the castle and I lead him back to the base.\n\n~On the way he sees a guy, captures him, throws a dungeon on the ground and tells me to place it so we can capture him. Now, at this time I had no idea you could even do that and I pretty much shit myself when my new recruit put this guy in the cage and he came on the VOIP screaming for freedom and mercy. Yeah, we left him there LOL. \n\n~We FINALLY get back to the base, build his house on top of mine, build a tower right next to that and place a dungeon inside. We then gear up in iron armor and equip a few ropes.\n\n~We run waaay back to the castle to look for a couple of prisoners and what do you know! We spot a guy and as soon as he sees us he bolts up the hill towards the bridge so naturally as predators we follow him. Unfortunatly for them he leads us to his friend and we end up capturing both of them. \n\n~Long story short, me and some stranger spent about 30 minutes dragging these guys through the forest back to our base on the other side of the map with them spamming the voice keys the whole time and occasionaly demanding we kill them. Eventually one got away but we locked the other in the cage. 10/10 Would capture people again.\n\n\n[h1][b]REAL REVIEW![/b][/h1]\n\nReign Of Kings is a medieval themed sandbox game with crafting, building, and much much more. You start as a lone peasant living in the king's land, paying the king's taxes. From here you can pretty much do anything right away, although you do start naked with only a wooden club so you might want to get started with chopping those trees. \n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n~You can capture people\n~Yes...literally, you can drag them around the map by a rope and when you feel like it lock them in a cage...or kill them\n~This game has fucking guillotines and death traps to kill your prisoners in! >:)))\n~Beautiful game, great lighting and foilage. made for some great sunrises\n~Combat is good, nice and smooth. If you get your range right and kite you can win most fights. \n~Tons and tons to craft. Various building materials, upgrades, weapons, tools, etc\n~Weapon choice is decent, both meele weapons and projectiles are in the game\n~Plenty of wild life! Finally! A game that got it right! So far every time I've went out to hunt...guess what? I've hunted.

To be honest they have made some improvements to the game. Not really anything groundbreaking or worthy of being mentioned, but they changed a few things.\n\nBut that being said the game is filled with cheating issues still and with only 2 maps that don't even have random recource generation it's kind of pathetic.\n\nGood luck enjoying the public servers. 1st 2 hours, I build a nice little camp, have some walls started and out of no where 3 guys appeared and killed me and then proceeded to tear down my entire place and take everything I owned. But determined to persevere I pushed on and started anew, convinced that I was in a location not many would travel through. I'm minding my own business when I just die. No one is nearby, just die. So I try to contact an admin, next thing I know I'm banned. No reason given, just banned.\n\nWell determined to still enjoy this game a little bit more I move to private custom servers. They are a little better, some of the servers honor the non kos rules but some don't even have admins in game so many are running amok and the larger servers are pretty much entirely russian so no chance of communication there. So I start my own private locked server and after getting it all set up I set out to build a giant castle in the middle of the new map... I get about an hour into it and the game drops to the desktop and the server disapeared as well...

You can try and report them to Game Developers, but to this day they've done nothing.\n\n-Server issues; On the majority of the servers, people will constantly teleport around due to poor networking serverside. (Most people reading will think it's due to your internet connection. No, it's not. It's legitimately poor networking... Don't believe? Then buy the game and refund it within the week.)\n\n-Low Population; Due to the issues stated above most of the population is chinese hackers. The best chance of having a fun experience is going onto a custom server or starting your own hoping to attract the sparse playerbase. (Maybe this will change with the sale for $1.99)\n\nFrom all the issues I've stated above, the style of combat and the janky feel of the game It's really not worth the buy. It has a great concept to it and would be really fun to play if those things were fixed (mainly hacking and server networking). All in all, if you've got money burning a hole in your pocket buy it but don't expect much. If you're looking for a quality sandbox game with a similar core gameplay concept, take a look at \"rust\" or a game coming out soon called \"Chronicles of Elyria\".\n\nAnyways, If you found this review helpful feel free to give a thumbs up.

Give me a chance to improve the experience for you.\n\nAgain - The Viking Saga is the servers name.\n\nThanks for reading!", "timestamp_created": 1427450141, "timestamp_updated": 1701599096, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750008940696716309", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41099074": {"recommendationid": "41099074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065822346", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 8042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7797, "last_played": 1527787648}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is realy fun if you play with friends!\nBut i will not recommend buying this game the devs have abandoned the game, they took the cash they made and ran away with it", "timestamp_created": 1522205000, "timestamp_updated": 1522205000, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.74957740306854248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83348239": {"recommendationid": "83348239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067648477", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 38980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37866, "last_played": 1671941992}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel it's finally time to give this game it's fair review. Too bad that I'm so many years late to the party for reviews, as I started back in Dec 2015 when it was released. Also, my time played is accurate - over 631 hours of fun in this game. Is it fun to this day? No. \n\nIf you want to keep reading, then here we go! \n\nPros:\n- Open world with lots of space, easy to build on a ton of terrain\n- Plenty of nodes and areas for harvest, easy to get situated without dying\n- Getting steel armor is cake, as well as the best weapons. Just get that oil!\n- Combat (used to be) is pretty fun\n- Building elaborate bases with convoluted entrances are super fun\n- You can throw your friends in a cage, but they might have a butt rock \n\nCons\n- Players lag, constantly, and make fighting nearly impossible as you clip through each other, and half your hits aren't registering\n- Hackers from China (seriously, lots of Chinese hackers) as I watched a guy just walk into my base. Shot him in the head, as he laughed at me and threw me in a cage. Good thing I had a butt rock...\n- Outrageously toxic community: I've tried to enjoy this game multiple times with many random people, but most end with super betrayal (because a ton of people suck)\n- Dead servers: it's just that, all servers have a super low population\n- Abandoned by devs, thanks Codehatch. \n\nHonestly, for the price of the game ($20 at the time) I also bought it for 5 friends so we could play, and I got my monies worth, that's for sure. Hundreds of hours with friends taking over the king's throne, building up to take down terribly evil & toxic neighbors (always the best part). \n\nI absolutely regret nothing. However, the game is dead and it's no longer playable.
