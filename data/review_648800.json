I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

However, once you progress through the first 2-3 hours of the game, the survival aspect goes out of the window & it is nearly impossible to run out of food or water unless you're a smooth brain. \n\nIf you like the creative part of building a raft, you will love this game, however you might not like the grind for resources to get your raft where you want it. If you're this sort of player, play creative. \n\nThe story is completely pointless & may as well not be a part of the game. I played this during early access & the starting of the story intrigued me, i wondered how the world came to be this way & wanted to find out more as soon as I could.

"language": "english", "review": "\"Raft\" is a mesmerizing voyage into the heart of survival gaming, where players are cast adrift upon a vast, endless ocean, armed with nothing but a humble raft and their wits. Developed by Redbeet Interactive, this game offers an immersive experience that seamlessly blends exploration, crafting, and survival mechanics into a single captivating adventure.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment you set foot (or rather, paddle) onto your tiny raft, you're immediately engulfed in a sense of both tranquility and urgency. The shimmering blue expanse stretches out endlessly in every direction, punctuated only by scattered debris and the occasional island on the horizon. It's a beautifully desolate world that manages to be both serene and foreboding at the same time.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of \"Raft\" is its simplicity. The premise is straightforward: survive. Yet, within this seemingly simple framework lies a wealth of depth and complexity. Every decision feels meaningful, every resource precious. Whether it's scavenging for scraps to expand your raft, purifying seawater to quench your thirst, or fending off hungry sharks, every action you take is a step towards either survival or demise.\r\n\r\nThe crafting system in \"Raft\" is both intuitive and rewarding. As you gather resources from the ocean's surface, you'll gradually unlock new blueprints and recipes, allowing you to construct everything from simple tools to elaborate shelters. The sense of progression is palpable, as your once-humble raft transforms into a bustling floating fortress, complete with gardens, workshops, and even livestock.\r\n\r\nHowever, perhaps the most compelling aspect of \"Raft\" is its cooperative multiplayer mode. Sailing the high seas with friends adds an entirely new dimension to the experience, transforming the game from a solitary struggle for survival into a shared journey of discovery and camaraderie. Whether you're working together to fend off shark attacks or embarking on daring expeditions to uncharted islands, the cooperative multiplayer mode elevates \"Raft\" to new heights of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nVisually, \"Raft\" is a feast for the eyes. The vibrant colors of the ocean, the dynamic weather effects, and the meticulous attention to detail make for a truly immersive and visually stunning experience. The sound design, too, is impeccable, with the gentle lapping of waves and the distant cry of seagulls serving to further enhance the game's sense of atmosphere and immersion.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Raft\" is a triumph of survival gaming, offering players a captivating blend of exploration, crafting, and camaraderie against the backdrop of a vast and unforgiving ocean. With its intuitive gameplay mechanics, stunning visuals, and cooperative multiplayer mode, \"Raft\" is a must-play for anyone seeking adventure on the high seas.

It's pretty, you can turn motion sickness on which was very helpful! This game has been around for years so that's exactly how it feels.\nClunky-ness, fishing to buy things at the little shops is neat, decent beginner-learning puzzles.\n\nSpoilery:\nEvery time we came across Olaf we were able to either hit him within melee or shoot him with arrows and you can't kill him which was frustrating. The end where he simply falls and gets tangled on a light, and then you still can't kill him? 'Something something human life is precious something' bs was not for us. Writing felt weak once you get to Utopia. Maybe they were trying to adhere to kids perspective, which fair, for an age rating makes sense. We just personally weren't thrilled about it, so that was a big con at the end that kinda left it feeling stale and meh.\nIf you don't care about the story at all then you'll probably enjoy the rest

But the terrible story is almost enough to... ahem... sink the game entirely. \n\nIt's a little grindy (your character has to drink 100 gallons of water and eat 453 fish a day to survive), it could use a few more materials to play with, and it leaves some of the best items behind the curtain until basically the end of the game. But it's got a solid gameplay loop, it's fun to play, especially with a friend, and the sense of freedom as you navigate the sea is fantastic. The act of actually playing Raft is pretty enjoyable.\n\nThe game's main problem is the story. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed the story locations and (some of) the puzzles and changes of pace they brought to the table. But the story itself is... well, it's terrible. Remember when you wrote your first creative-writing piece in fifth grade? The one about aliens and dolphins where you misspelled every third word and ran out of ideas halfway through? Yeah, it's significantly worse than that. \n\nThe characters are irritating, the acting is worse, and the ending is maybe the worst thing that's happened to me in gaming since Disco Elysium in terms of sheer magnitude of disappointment. It's really bad.\n\nRaft is fortunate that the rest of the game is just compelling enough to keep you in the boat (heh) for the 20-30 hours it takes to finish.

I loved the music and the relaxing sounds of the water, building the Raft from a tiny 4x4 into a steamship with 6 bio fuel devices, three decks, a farm, a corral for 7 pets, and advanced water purification systems and automatic plant watering systems.\n\nLove the tiles that automatically catch debris and the ability to see the coral reef through them. At night, it is mesmerizing with a long row of them.  The game's aesthetics are very satisfying.\n\nThe Shark was annoying at first, but later, his head became an important source of bio fuel. I took great pleasure in taking him out, which delays his threat for a couple of minutes.\n\nLoved figuring out the radar and navigation system and the compass. \nOne of us did most of the building while I cared for the crops, animals, and cooked.  The birds nests gave us a source of feathers and when they were annoying, another source of food. \n\nI was sad when we finished and like to visit Raft to enjoy the relaxing and lovely sounds of sailing.

I bought this game on October 22, 2022 and have had it for 2 years. After a few days of the game running smoothly, I noticed the quality occurring poorly so I tried restarting my computer and messing with the quality so maybe I can get a relevant experience, but with less graphical enjoyment. This did not work. I have been trying to research this game and realized it was about 6 years old. I did purchase this because I saw Denis Daily play and complete a series and I wanted to do the same in my experience. I would like to mention that my computer had the right updates and features to run this game like Denis Daily\u2019s would. To this day my cloud status of this game still is up to date with updates of this game, but it does not seem or appear so. To this day I do recall they have a discord server for this game, but the developer does not seem to care anymore. This was unfortunate and very sad for me to conclude because I saw much potential and fun for this game. I would not recommend this game for people who are buying it just because how old the game is. I cannot refund the product any longer. Waste of $19.99. I believe the developer has produced new games to play and never updates this game any longer just because they created it such a while ago. (Also just to point out, when I was playing the game, very little resources spawned making the game impossible, also, when traveling on islands there is this stupid seagull that kills you it's just a stupid update). (Very little resources made the game basically impossible and really boring just to die). I am disappointed and dissatisfied with the $19.99 I spent on this. I don't want to be too harsh with this product because it was a great game 6 years ago, but I hate this game and it hurts me to see $19.99 go to waste on a game like this. (Sometimes, people pay, like Raft, You-Tubers like Denis Daily to play their game and it gets a lot of good feedback because someone known on the YouTube platform plays their game. Such as fans of these You-Tubers will purchase the game themselves because it looks exciting or intriguing. Just like how I did*). (This game was a good game 8 years ago, and now is a terrible 8 years later.) (*Tip for beginners on Steam*: What I find frustrating with Steam is that they produce and sell games that are around 6-8 years old and overprice the games, so when you buy it, it is a poor experience.) (Something frustrating about Raft is that there is only one character for single player and one character for multiplayer.) (*My rating: 1/5*)  \u2661\u272a\u2606\u2605 Go watch Denis Daily!

Love it/hate it.  It's a great mechanic to keep the pressure on.  Although the pressure lessens greatly as you move towards \"end game\" (more on this later).   Some people in the forums have complained that the shark is to trope-y and furthers a \"harmful\" stereotype about sharks.  I can see this easily being remedied with other nemesis creatures stopping by (giant squid anyone?).\n\nBuilding the raft is fun.  It sort of reminds me of the old school Minecraft skyblock variant.  \n\n\n[b]The not so good[/b]\nInventory management is a chore.\n\nGetting to the \"end game\" is gratifying, but after that the both the reason for continuing on and the replay value tanks.  I'm assuming the devs are planning for content beyond the current end-game stage to remedy this.\n\nThe shark returns too quickly after death.  I think it should also be more difficult to kill the shark so the reward (a longer break from shark harrassment) should increase with the risk.\n\nIt bothered me that I couldn't build on islands.  It also bothered me that I couldn't create a \"skiff\" (second raft) for excursions.  Everything in this game must be attached to the starting raft.\n\nIt's odd that all the sea life, except the shark and the odd clam, is not visible in the water.

Yeah, you know, I would:  If you can play it with a person.  And maybe on easy.  Definitely on easy on your own.\n\nListen, listen, I know.  You're a proud gamer, you don't play crap on easy.  I get it.  My save game is called \"easy mode offends me\".  And yet, there it is, that's what I did.\n\nBasically, there's not a lot of dangerous foes for the most part, not until much, much later in the game anyway.  I mean, there's a shark, yeah, so you stay on the raft and stab him in his sharky face when he tries to nibble on your raft.  (And then lure him into shallow water, throw bait and repeatedly poke him with sharp sticks until he expires from deathpoke.)\n\nSo, really, the challenge is mostly in managing your hunger and thirst.  On normal, especially early in the game, it feels like all you're doing is boiling little thimblesful of water and cooking the tiniest sardines while your character is on the cusp of dying from gothic faminethirst.  It's kinda tedious, frankly.  So on easy, that gets turned down.  The shark will still shark you as hard as ever, the sardines are just as tiny and the thimbles of water still fail to slake your thirst, but the thirst and hunger meters deplete less quickly so you actually have time to go do other things.\n\nIt's a pretty good coop implementation.  My bestest gaming buddy (who is also my wife and reads these things--hello!) and I sort of appreciate the slow wafting across the ocean, scavenging flotsam, building up a bigger raft and inventing sharper pokesticks to fend off things.  Playing this with somebody is nice because the game is stupendously lonely otherwise. It's just you, the ocean, tiny atolls and occasionally the detritus of somebody who was there years ago and is no longer.\n\nRventually, when you have enough technology and you're not purely at the whims of the ocean, a plot starts to reveal itself, with places to explore.  We love exploring.\n\nSo in the end, or if you were looking for one of those fashionable TL;DRs, this is a slow-paced game but can be kind of relaxing for the most part, appreciating the ocean, fishing up the tiniest sardines, and slowly wafting to the next adventure.", "timestamp_created": 1602028906, "timestamp_updated": 1602028906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1020, "votes_funny": 206, "weighted_vote_score": "0.948381960391998291", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97738361": {"recommendationid": "97738361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006301588", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4701, "last_played": 1656683000}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay is beautiful, creative, and I enjoyed it.

The survival elements are fairly simple and I find them well-tuned, and islands have become more and more exciting to explore as the game development has progressed. There's even a storyline now which is pretty cool the first time you experience it. There's an excellent balance between the peaceful sea-faring and island exploring and occasionally battling. With the most recent story based updates the game has really expanded, although it's still unfinished and development seems very slow. \n\n[h1]Bring a \"friend\" as shark bait[/h1]\n\nThe biggest benefit of Raft to me is the seamless co-op. Hosted on a local machine, your friends can drop in or out of your game effortlessly and help you. If you should want to let them progress without you, which I have done a few times, you can easily send them the file to load. It's not quite as good as it being persistently online, but it's easy enough. I played around 40 hours with my husband and a friend and we pulled together, assigning jobs and positions, working as a team to explore the ocean and the land, baiting the shark away from the others, tucking unconscious bodies into bed, you know, all the sorts of things friends do for each other.\n\n[h1]Chest Wars[/h1]\n\nHowever, I will warn you that your friendships will be sorely tested when it comes to storage. I cannot tell you how frustrating it was to sort every chest into specific categories, painstakingly labelled with signs, and then find that my husband had dropped wood into my seed box, or scuba gear into my food box. In the end I told him not to touch any of the boxes except the one with his name on it. It staved off divorce. I also got yelled at a few times for re-arranging the rooms, but really, these guys have no interior design skills! Look I'm type A okay, I need order on my boat, even in the apocalypse.\n\n[h1]What's bad?[/h1]\n\nThe main drawback is that the development is slower than me running a marathon with ankle weights on. It's getting there, but no one knows when it'll pass the finish line and you're just hoping it doesn't have a heart attack en route. I'm patiently waiting, but I do wish the full experience was ready. It's come a long way from release, but I can't help but feel there's still a ways to go.\n\nDespite the snail-like development, I've really enjoyed my time spent on the game and eagerly look forward to coming back to it next patch, so it gets a thumbs up from me.\n\n\ud83d\udc96 If you find the reviews of an old Welsh lady interesting, please follow  [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url]. \ud83d\udc96\n\nUpdating because I just nominated this for the Steam Awards \"Labor of Love\" award, and also I'm cheeky and want the badge for editing a review.

Raft is a survival game in which, rather than fight zombies or demons, you have to deal with...a lot of water, aka the ocean. Discover the story left behind as you explore uncharted seas.\n\n[h1]Control and Map Design[/h1]\nRaft plays out in a way that can be praised and criticized simultaneously. It gives freedom in approaching base creation and exploring the islands it features, resulting in a good experience in the long run. However, it has some design choices that can leave it feeling rather tedious and damage the game's pace.\n\nFor example, exploring an island is always thrilling; players must move around the land while keeping tabs on their Raft. Otherwise, they could lose it. Animals on land can be dangerous but offer a good amount of food for the long term, making them an attractive high-risk, high-reward hunt. Likewise, expanding the Raft is rewarding, too, as the player can grow crops, upgrade their items and, most importantly, have a comfortable space to move around.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2987956821\n\nConversely, the fact that certain materials can only be obtained by specific tools or that they can get monotonous in the long run hampers some of the possibilities Raft looks to offer. Islands start to look and feel the same, while the Progression of the Raft can be determined by how many players are playing. One to two players can result in dull, slow growth in contrast to four to eight players, which makes the grinding of materials more bearable.\n\n[h1] Strong Points[/h1]\nThe strong point of Raft is that the game visuals are mesmerizing, while the gameplay can be engaging if done right. It is a game that is both challenging and fun, where most troubles have a temporal solution rather than a permanent one until you reach a certain point. The ocean looks beautiful and comes alive as waves threaten to swallow your Raft or put you in reach of the shark to bite.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2987957250\n\nFighting the shark on itself offers some degree of ingenuity regarding gameplay. One player can distract it while other attacks or timing attacks correctly on certain sections can stop the shark mid-attack. If confrontation is not your forte, you can use shark bait to get rid of the shark for a while. These options in dealing with problems allow a good amount of freedom for the player to consider their approach to situations.\n\n[h1] Art Design and Visuals [/h1]\nThe visuals of Raft are excellent, with the ocean looking vibrant both from the outside and the inside. The islands offer ecosystems on land and sea, as numerous animals live in both areas. You can find giant birds throwing rocks at you or a group of fish to collect. It is not the most pretty game out there, but it indeed commits to making the aspect of being stranded in a Raft appealing visually.\n\n[h1]Sound, Replayability and Performance[/h1]\nThere is no voice acting, nor does the narrative demand lengthy sessions. Raft is all about making your own story of survival, and the sound effects are solid. Rain, waves, and water movement all have a noise that immerses you more, and I found my experience at best during solid tides in the deepest part of the ocean. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2987957514\n\nReplayability-wise, the game is as infinite as you want to play it. Rather than being a game you replay after beating it, however, this title seems more in line with having a long run on a server. If the player desires, there is a narrative to follow, but there is enough room to make gigantic constructions on the water so that the Raft looks more like a city.\n\n My specs are RTX 2060, 36 GB of ram, Intel Core i7-11700K - Core i7 11th Gen Rocket Lake 8-Core 3.6 GHz LGA 1200. on High settings, the FPS was between 60 to 90 at all times. \n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TH][H3]Pros[/H3][/TH]\n[TH][H3]Cons[/H3][/TH]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]\n[list]\n[*] Raft offers a unique survival experience, face the ocean!\n[*] High risk-High reward gameplay that begs to explore the depths.\n[*] Visually charming with how the seas are portrayed along the islands.\n\n[/list]\n[/TD]\n[TD]\n[list]\n[*] Progression can sometimes be dull and tedious, especially at the start.\n[*] Some design choices, such as limited freedom by specific tool usage, counter each other.\n\n[/list]\n[/TD]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1] Conclusion[/h1]\nRaft is a beautiful survival game that, while at times can feel like an unfinished beta of sorts, adds something unique to the survival genre. Fight the ocean as you look to survive being stranded, lack of food or water, or being eaten by sharks! I recommend the game if you enjoy survival games and have at least three other friends to play with.\n\n8/10  GREAT\n\nIf you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/", "timestamp_created": 1686865273, "timestamp_updated": 1687120349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 238, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.917825400829315186", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78102588": {"recommendationid": "78102588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140727299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 33500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5516, "last_played": 1683417877}, "language": "english", "review": "Ahoy there, Mateys!

update: Finished the game with two friends. All the earlier points still apply (maybe not the \"grim story\" bit - the later chapters are more easy-going than the first few), the play-through was lots of fun and quite literally a journey. I'd say this is what makes Raft different from the other \"Build & Survive\" games - your base camp is mobile, so you get to build permanent stuff AND explore places at the same time. Thumbs up!\n\nThe start can be very misleading for the impatient among us: it might seem like your only goal is to throw the hook around and gather junk. It isn't. Once you expand your raft and get the basic needs (water and food) somewhat covered, the game will slowly start expanding before you, and it usually manages to offer some nice surprises as it does.\n\nIt also has the best first-person base-building system I've ever seen so far (coming from a person scarred for life by vanilla Fallout 4 base-building). If you want to place something somewhere, you usually can, or there is a clever way of doing so.\n\nThe story (at the time I'm typing this, only the first Chapter was released) is... okay, considering it's revealed to you by means of notes, static objects and locations.

No minutes are spent wasting your time.\n+ You always have to keep yourself alive (by managing food and water, also repairing your raft) and that adds to the \"survival\" genre of the game.\n+ Biggest pro about it is the feel and look of the game. It has a cartoony art style which fits everything really well.\n+ The game is fun while playing alone and it's even more fun while playing with a friend/friends.\n+ You can build your raft however you want to with the blocks and items provided.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Although the game keeps you immersed, it has a brutal end which I reached in about 6 hours while playing with my friend.\n- You can keep playing after the ending and build/expand your raft into a huge ship but as the game is now there is not enough content and replay value. \n-There are some bugs and glitches but its nothing unexpected from a game that's in early development.\n\n [i]All in all, I recommend the game, even in its early stages, because I truly believe that with the right support the developers can shape this game into a beautiful story with enough content to keep you playing for longer than a few hours![/i]", "timestamp_created": 1529176846, "timestamp_updated": 1529177454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 236, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894998669624328613", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105443161": {"recommendationid": "105443161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392402150", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 606, "last_played": 1626151537}, "language": "english", "review": "prettyyyy epic game,\nthe crafting in this game is just so realistic. \nfor example, i found an old pringles can and combined it with two sponges, a rubber glove, and a rubberband", "timestamp_created": 1638933647, "timestamp_updated": 1638933647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 196, "votes_funny": 363, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892669856548309326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116088126": {"recommendationid": "116088126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162507431", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2291, "last_played": 1689421476}, "language": "english", "review": "1. launch game\n2. wait for your friends\n3. realise your friends dont like this game anymore\n4. contemplate your loneliness \n5. decide whether to play alone \n6. close game\n7. go cry in a corner", "timestamp_created": 1653660193, "timestamp_updated": 1653660193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3188, "votes_funny": 1274, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892653048038482666", "comment_count": 57, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144133570": {"recommendationid": "144133570", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101399866", "num_games_owned": 947, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1701022005}, "language": "english", "review": "1. launch game\n2. wait for your friends\n3. realise your friends dont like this game anymore\n4. contemplate your loneliness\n5. decide whether to play alone\n6. close game\n7. go cry in a corner", "timestamp_created": 1691969948, "timestamp_updated": 1691969948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 402, "votes_funny": 159, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892172276973724365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118839444": {"recommendationid": "118839444", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122635730", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 431, "last_played": 1659065756}, "language": "english", "review": "wood float on water", "timestamp_created": 1657868991, "timestamp_updated": 1657868991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 350, "votes_funny": 133, "weighted_vote_score": "0.890926599502563477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76315095": {"recommendationid": "76315095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176545497", "num_games_owned": 749, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 3875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2664, "last_played": 1625757142}, "language": "english", "review": "Rest in Peace Gavin, my beloved goat who died of starvation. \nI'm sorry for not feeding you.

really worth it.\nRaft is a survival game which puts us in the middle of the ocean. You'll immediately notice the small-sized raft you're on. We have to start collecting materials from the sea immediately (planks, palm tree leaves, plastic etc.) to be able to expand our boat otherwise we'll perish thanks to the shark swimming the closest.\n\nThings are getting interesting when our raft is big enough for us to sleep on a bed, build a grill for preparing food or a purifier for cleaning salt water and even have a research table close by to come up with new plans. Once a new material is found (e.g. ore or copper from the depths of the sea) it can be added to all plans requiring it as a prerequisite. Later on we can start growing our own vegetables, plant our own flowers or trees and can start building our own pieces of furniture to make accommodation feel more comfortable.\n\nAnchoring will be important in case we wish to explore the islands we find. Vegetation on these masses of land can be quite lush but we should also pay attention to the precious ore or junk found underwater. Spear and bow will be at our disposal to fight the shark that is lurking close to us at all times. Those with a more strategic approach can use fish as bait to lure the creature away.\n\nCrafting and exploring with a friend is a joy in this game. There are some glitches here and there and there are many more things to be added  but Raft still offers many hours of playtime in its current state. It isn't a very pretty game but it has acceptable graphics - day-night cycle happens quite often and looks nice. After all, there's an achievement that makes it a must to be ashore for over a year!\n\nIf you liked The Forest and you are not seasick pick this one up when on sale.", "timestamp_created":

Adding fish underwater with vast reefs would make the game more appealing. \n\n6. Be able to access storage if someone else is using it aswell. It sucks waiting in line !\n\n7. Add character customize hair color, facial features and clothes.\n\n8. Be able to make mutiple different rafts so that mutiplayers can split off into different teams.\n\n9.

Jarrizard's Pros and Cons Review ![/b]\n\n[i]While the game is decent enough to be played with friends on a night out, I wouldn't recommend it at full price. It shows promise, the game as it is now is just lacking and unpolished. There's not much to do. You'll find yourself always focused on food and water. Crafting more stuff to make it easier to get food and water etc.. Maybe it'll change overtime when more updates are rolled in. [/i]\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Overall look and atmosphere of the game is nice. Relaxing too.\n+ Constantly updated by the developers.\n+ Better with friends. Multiplayer support.\n+ Enough freedom on how you choose to build your raft.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Unrealistic thirst and hunger. It felt like a chore catering to your character's needs than actually surviving.\n- Unimmersive environments. Islands are random gen and sometimes there's no way to reach the top where you can get most of the resources from.\n- Bad creature AI. The shark attacks at fixed interval and rate. Too predictable and not fun. Usually, they're just there to hinder your progress on whatever you're building.\n- No physics. If a foundation breaks everything above that breaks along with it. \n- Lack of content. Depending on how fast you progress you can see what the game is trying to offer in 5-10 hours. \n- While the soundtrack is good. It becomes repetitive because the loop is too short and it gets boring as you spend most of your time in-game without music. Even the sound effects are recycled over and over.\n\n[b]!

I was skeptical because I typically don't enjoy survival games, and later realized I had mistaken this game for Stranded Deep, which is a farce of a game.\n\nStarting off was confusing, I struggled to even figure out how to purify water, but fast forward one day and I'm having a blast. I naturally donned the coat of master architect in our group and was in charge of designing our raft layout. Took us a while to even realize there's a story in the game and that's when things really took off.\n\nI don't think it's your typical survival game and that's likely why I loved it. The combat is limited and usually initiated by choice, and the health/hunger/thirst management is fairly forgiving and straightforward unlike my previous experiences with survival games.\n\nI really like how the game has a relaxing sailing phase where you can chat with friends and kick back, and then eventually you reach an island and go all Christopher Columbus on it.", "timestamp_created": 1659987932, "timestamp_updated": 1659989361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 108, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874149560928344727", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150553542": {"recommendationid": "150553542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076108318", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1584, "last_played": 1703704258}, "language": "english", "review": "me rafter\nluv me raft\nluv me sail\nluv me hook\nluv me sea\nhate shark, not racist, just don't like 'em\nsimple as", "timestamp_created": 1700581583, "timestamp_updated": 1700581583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 216, "votes_funny": 153, "weighted_vote_score": "0.8741455078125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117299430": {"recommendationid": "117299430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162934057", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 50866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25493, "last_played": 1711990861}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\nAudio is actually good, but the noise of the bees can get annoying after a while once you unlock them so I marked it down 1 notch for that.\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\nIt was hard to choose between easy to learn/hard to master and actual brain usage just because the learning curve in the beginning is a bit steep. There's no tutorial or guidance so figuring out what you need to do in the beginning can be a bit intensive (and you will die... a lot...) unless you get into the community and ask questions/look for tips. Once I got into the community and figured out how the game worked it was like \"oh I'm dumb. How did I not notice this?\" cause its actually really simple but not necessarily intuitive. Oh, and build a spear and extra hook as soon as you can... like earlier than you think you'll need one. thank me later.\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\nOk, so there's literally NO grind to complete the story. If you just go story island to story island and make the minimum pit stops in between you can complete the whole story without a drop of real grind. However, if you want to take your time and build a really cool raft and really get into the crafting and building aspects of the game (which is my favorite part) then you will need to grind for resources. The minimum is there to survive and complete the story, but any extras you're gonna need to grind for. That said, the grind is actually pretty enjoyable. Gathering resources can actually be pretty relaxing so even though its grind, its enjoyable grind.\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\nGreat story and the story islands are super interesting and fun to explore. Being able to go back to story islands and they respawn resources so you get to explore again is also a nice little feature. Granted, the stuff is in the same place but what the stuff is changes. \n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 To infinity and beyond\nIf you just wanna rush through the story, speed runners do it in about 2-3 hours. But, if you like to just build and build and explore the time is limitless. I'm close to 500 hours and the bulk is on a single save. Even when the story is over, you can keep on playing as long as you want which is great. Then there's creative mode which lets you just build - no supplies or grind needed. If you like building, its really limitless.\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\nHonestly, the dev's could charge more and I'd still say worth the price. Its early access but definitely doesn't feel like early access. 100% worth the price, no steam sale needed.\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2611 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\nSome bugs can be annoying (like on occasion you might get stuck on a charging hog - that's probably the most annoying) but there aren't any major major bugs and the dev team does a great job when a bug comes up at trying to fix it and address it. Then there are some bugs (like the floating floor trick) that started as bugs but now its become so widely used that people don't even want it fixed (for the most recent update people literally said please don't fix this bug). So yes, some annoying ones but they don't really take away from the game so don't let those couple of glitches scare you off!\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2611 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2610 10\n\nOverall I give this game an 8/10 just because of the few glitches that can be annoying and because of the learning curve with no tutorial or instructions. The community has been great at stepping in and trying to guide new players though, so if you buy be sure and check out the community page and/or the raft discord if you have any trouble. Once you get the hang of it, the fun is pretty limitless between just working on a main save and creative mode and then even speed running if you're into that. There's also a very active mod community so you'll find a lot of stuff to do.

I actually did the same with [i]The Forest[/i] several years ago (there I simply forgot to replay the game when version 1.0 came out; my review is based on version 0.08).\n\nRaft is a survival game which puts us in the middle of the ocean. You'll immediately notice the small-sized raft you're on. We have to start collecting materials from the sea immediately (planks, palm tree leaves, plastic etc.) to be able to expand our boat otherwise we'll perish thanks to the shark swimming the closest.\n\nThings are getting interesting when our raft is big enough for us to sleep on a bed, build a grill for preparing food or a purifier for cleaning salt water and even have a research table close by to come up with new plans. Once a new material is found (e.g. ore or copper from the depths of the sea) it can be added to all plans requiring it as a prerequisite. Later on we can start growing our own vegetables, plant our own flowers or trees and can start building our own pieces of furniture to make accommodation feel more comfortable.\n\nAnchoring will be important in case we wish to explore the islands we find. Vegetation on these masses of land can be quite lush but we should also pay attention to the precious ore or junk found underwater. Spear and bow will be at our disposal to fight the shark that is lurking close to us at all times. Those with a more strategic approach can use fish as bait to lure the creature away.\n\nCrafting and exploring with a friend is a joy in this game. There are some glitches here and there and there are many more things to be added (most notably an endgame content or even a story explaining who we are and how come we're drifting on sea) but Raft still offers many hours of playtime in its current state. It isn't a very pretty game but it has acceptable graphics - day-night cycle happens quite often and looks nice.

It was more a proof of concept. Fast forward almost 3 years and 2 chapters later and we've got a pretty solid survival game.\n\nGraphically, it's nothing visually stunning but it looks good working within the boundaries of the Unity engine. This may also be the reason for it's biggest downside, being I generally only get around 30-40 frames per second max at any given time and as low as 14 frames per second at the later stages in the game having such a large raft and visiting large islands. I'm hopeful this is something that will be rectified once the game leaves Early Access though.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2462090262\n\nGameplay wise, it's what you'd expect from a survival/sandbox game.

The story, graphics and game play is child friendly, and easy to master. I have had no issues on the default difficulty, in thriving and building my raft into a boat. I even have a grand piano on the top deck. \n\nThe story is difficult to follow. This is due to audio issues, where the game seems to have trouble knowing what sounds take priority, and it is not consistent which choice is made. I fiddled with the audio, having to turn most things down by over fifty percent, to better hear the voices, while sometimes having to turn the audio down, because the voice audio becomes abruptly loud. In all, this is not a make or break, and only impacts the story aspects. All but the voice audio was fine. The music is relaxing and well chosen.\n\nThe game play feels a little dated, having to rely heavily on a micromanaging method of having items in the specific interaction. Overall, the game played nice, and controlling the raft and using the equipment is fantastic. It is the crafting or combined tools being used, that the rules become inconsistent. What might have worked for most things, will not always work for all things, even if the process is exactly the same.\n\nThe graphics are great, but require frequent reloading. After prolonged play, the water levels seem to overcome the raft, in a time played equals higher water levels. Not sure what causes this, but it becomes quite comically bad. I left the game on overnight, to see how it would turn out, and I was not disappointed. The bottom deck was nearly completely submerged, with waves starting to show on the deck above it. This is fixed with a reloading of the game. The game is pleasant to view up to that point. \n\nOverall, Raft is a fantastic game, with issues that are present but do not overtake the experience.

There's nothing around you but blue sea and the garbage floating in it. You have nothing to help you except for a hook made of trash and the four pontoons you're standing on. And you have the constant threat of death, both from lack of food and water, and from the ever-present shark circling below your raft.\n\nSo you start hooking garbage. You learn how to make things. You protect and expand your raft, you fix damage, you navigate, you learn to survive. You have fun, in short. Eventually you bump into islands, find new components and crafting materials, and the complexity of what you can make expands. Soon you can sail to the islands you choose to, and that's when you enter the midgame.\n\nThe midgame of Raft consists of travelling between story islands (rather than randomly encountered ones), exploring them, and collecting the tier 2 materials and recipes found there. This is where the cracks start to show, both in story and gameplay. The setting - that the entire world is flooded to the point where only a few skyscrapers and islands show above the water - is already ridiculous, and the characters and behaviors that exist within that setting are, frankly, silly, but we'll get to that in the endgame.\n\nIt's the gameplay that begins to be a problem. In almost all survival crafting games there is a rule: as complexity increases so to does automation. This means that, as it takes more complex and rare items and materials to craft the next thing, the previously made things become easier to make, often via automation. This stops the player from feeling overwhelmed; it's very easy to lose track of what you need to be collecting and when, especially when equipment degrades with use, so automating low-tier items helps prevent that.\n\nRaft has zero automation, and everything you equip degrades constantly. This is [b]exhausting[/b]. You can set up automatic collection of tier 1 materials, but no there is no automatic crafting to replace broken equipment, and neither tier 2 or 3 materials can be collected any way but manually. Moving into the endgame and tier 3 recipes and materials is where this issue really shows.\n\nTier 3 ore can only be found with a metal detector. Islands have either 1 or 2-3 metal detector areas within them. You only have a 50% chance of even finding an item that can be tier 3 ore with each dig. You need dozens of ore to craft the tier 3 equipment you'll need. Obviously, this takes an absurd amount of time, but the truly painful part is that, while you're searching for it, all your other equipment is actively breaking, meaning you still need to manually collect all the tier 2 materials [i]and[/i] manually craft every single thing you need.\n\nIt is literally not worth your time to bother.\n\nThankfully, you don't need tier 3 equipment to finish the game, but sadly the game ends with a wet fart. The climax the story is building to, the culmination of years of development, is a villain who is angry that people turned luxury apartments into living quarters and farms. [b]Yes, you read that right[/b]: the final boss of the game takes over the last human settlement and jails everyone because he is mad that luxury apartments are being used to keep humanity alive.\n\nThis is, of course, meant to be a commentary one greed and shortsightedness, etc, but it's so pathetically blunt that the message simply doesn't land. Not helping is the fact that this final boss has a northern European accent that is so ridiculous to hear as an english speaker that all his threats just sound hilarious. He literally sounds as if Goldmember from the Austin Powers movies was threatening you with death. That'd be fine in a comedy, but Raft takes its setting seriously. \n\nIt's just a really, truly pathetic end to the game.\n\nAll told, Raft is very much a mixed bag. It absolutely nails its ridiculous setting, especially in the early game which is very fun, but the mid- and end-game gameplay failures make it a chore to finish, and the story being completely unimpactful doesn't help. \n\nI still recommend it, but not unreservedly.\n\nP.S.: Raft has an active modding community that has worked hard to counteract some of the criticisms in this review.

I found it in [i]Raft[/i].\n\nYou start on a 2x2 square raft about the size of four wood pallets roped together. In the middle of an endless ocean. Hungry, thirsty and harassed by a shark who is determined to eat what little of a raft you have out from under you, then eat you too.\n\nThe first half hour is brutal. I spend my first three hours restarting a half-dozen times as I struggled and failed to survive. Or made stupid mistakes. Once I built a water purifier, a little cooking pot and a sail, and had gotten past that initial period of panicked survival, the game became a glorious time gathering resources, researching, crafting and eventually building my beautiful little yacht where my Maya lives out her days with Tala* sailing the tropical seas and occasionally plundering islands for their riches.\n\nPast that first panic-survival period, this game becomes a delightfully chill experience. The sea is full of refuse, and fishing it out of the water is your primary source of resources. There are over a dozen hand-crafted islands, most of which are small, that are procedurally placed around you as you travel.  They have an abundance of resources, both on land and in the reefs below, that you will need to gather to flourish. I got more than my money's worth in hours of enjoyment before I even started the story. \n\nWhile you get the blueprints early, it takes a while before you are ready to build the receiver and associated antennas. Once you do, and you start following the signals, the story really begins. The coordinates you get will lead you to unique locations, each with its own challenges and lore. The notes you find are voice-acted, and I loved them. Especially Detto.\n\nYour raft is your mobile base. You can expand, upgrade and customize it in many ways. (But be warned: you cannot build a new one from scratch. So don't die the same way I did on my first try... by getting overly excited when I saw my first island and jumping on it without anchoring my raft. If you lose it, you cannot just build a new one.)\n\nThe environments are beautiful. The enemy types are limited, but most are an enjoyable challenge. Combat, while simple, feels good in this game. But the biggest standout has to be the music. The music is [i]so good[/i]. So chill and relaxing... and it just makes me feel happy. I could easily listen to it all day.\n\nThe game has a lot of QoL features. I give an especially hearty [b]thank you[/b] to the devs for including a motion sickness mode that drastically reduces the rocking of the raft, especially during rain. \n\nAny negatives are scarce and minor. it is silly that you have to cut down trees to get their fruit. All plants grown from seeds should produce at least one seed when harvested. I wish certain things stacked in inventory which do not (like shark bait). After over a hundred hours, I added in a few mods to my game. Nothing game-changing (save perhaps for a mod that makes sure seeds drop), but a small number of little improvements (such as being able to mirror-build engines) that I think were overlooked in the design.\n\nI have played long after having completed the story. And I continue to come back to the game and play it more even after starting other games. It is just such a calm and enjoyable way to spend a weekend or evening. I absolutely recommend this game.\n\nRaft is practically perfect.\n\n\n*[spoiler]Tala is one of the alternate playable characters you unlock during the game. While these characters don't actually appear on your raft with you, their introduction is phrased as if they are joining you on your raft.[/spoiler]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1666559526, "timestamp_updated": 1666559526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852392435073852539", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74689062": {"recommendationid": "74689062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014163253", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 389, "playtime_forever": 3576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2140, "last_played": 1608787092}, "language": "english", "review": "[u][b]-Quick Review-[/b][/u]\nRaft is a survival game where you think the scariest thing you're going to fight is a shark, but after a few hours of gameplay you quickly discover you're more worried about everything else and the shark feels like your friend.\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b]\u00a0I purchased this game to play with my brothers, so I waited for a steam sale and grabbed it for both siblings and myself.\n...Oh, I'm supposed to talk about the game's story here?\n\nYou're on a raft in a post apocalyptic world, you uncover more about why you're in the ocean, or why the world is flooded by picking up various scrapped pieces of paper from key islands of interest.\n\nThe story is interesting [i](all read through extra tidbits)[/i], but I am a fan of the classic Minecraft/don't start/survival theme of *Toss you into the nonsense* Good luck, figure out how to swim on your own! [i](Unrelated side note: I am grateful I didn't learn to swim from this method, i would have drown at age 6)[/i]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2146440508\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] Here's the repeating gameloop in text format: Toss hook, pull in debris x15. Craft a thing for water.\nResume Tossing Hook and pulling debris x15. Craft a thing for food.\nToss hook, pull in debris... Craft. Gather, Craft, Gather, Craft.\n\nYou can frame it two ways: \"Man, that's boring\", or \"Man that's Cathartic\". Depending on how you respond, you should already know if you're interested in playing.\n\n...That being said, teaming up with friends makes the process a thousand times more entertaining.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2153076589\n\nYou're mostly fighting against the Shark and the Seagulls while you try to build your raft, Occasionally the teethy jerk will attack one of your rafts platforms, it's your job to give him a good poke in the face to make him go away... And other then being chased out of the water... the shark is kind of forgettable... Until he attacks you while you're harvesting underwater and for a split second you remember you're actually terrified of sharks IRL.\n\nThere's a lot of ways you can build your raft... but you'll starve for resources [i](And maybe even literally for food or dehydration)[/i] for awhile before you kind of stabilize and then set sail on an ocean sweeping expedition where you explore the vast blue expanse!\n\nWe didn't get any bonus points for creativity in our raft design, I dubbed it the \"SS Aircraft Carrier\". But the raft is kind of always in flux as we add new rooms and get new items to place down in it.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] At 22 hours in raft at the time of this review, I think it's safe to say I/We have thoroughly enjoyed what Raft has to offer.\nThere is something to be said about teamwork and having good Zen with the people on your raft... or, 'ya know, threaten to take the raft and leave your friends on a desert island.\n\nThere's still a few achievements for me to track down, and we have yet to encounter a few of the animals in the game... so we're not done yet. And looking forward to more content being added to the game soon!\n\nThanks for Reading! If you'd like a bit more of a visual example of the game [i](and want to hear the dulcet tones of my obnoxious voice)[/i] feel free to check out my Youtube video on My thoughts on Raft.
