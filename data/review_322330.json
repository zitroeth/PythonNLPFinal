well... it's the same!\nMany discount period, fair price, great quality, many different things, you will never found simple swap color here, never.\nYou even earn 1 random skin each day if you start the game, and can have 8 more just by playing the game, and it reset each week, that mean 15 skins each week for the most motivated players!\nTo be honest, I know some studio or games that rewards players with cosmetics etc, but not like this, not with this quality!\n\nAnd again, the price! \nWhen I see what they sell to us and the price...\nFortnite, Apex, etc\nWTF! selling a swap color skin for 10$ or more! special skins and... whatever... and most of the time it's limited in time, they use players fear and feeling, after all we are all the same and sometime we surrender in front or the fear of loosing a unique opportunity on a game that we spend many hours each week, or even days for some players.\n\nAnd it's always at a crazy cost! even when there is a discount!\nFor a single character skin, it's around 10-15$ at least, sometime more, and for something who doesn't cost so much work\n(not the fault of the Dev or Artist behind the cosmetics, it's publisher fault, or people who have the lead about this, so I don't blame them.)\n\nAnd Klei ? it's always different, you will have hard time to find 2 similar skin for the same character, and a full skin for a single character, without any discount, is 2.39\u20ac (maybe not 2.39 in US $, but lower, I don't know)\nI don't say that it's nothing because money is money, it's never free.\nEven a big Bundle with tonnes of stuff in it, with a skin for every characters etc, it will not cost that much.\n\nMaybe you want to complain about some character locked behind a paywall? forcing players to spend money to play them?\nWell, you could try, but a single character can be buy in the in-game shop for 5\u20ac, with a full skin for him at the same time, and their is what they called \"deluxe chest\" for less than 10\u20ac with the unlock character you want + 3 skin for him. (regular price without discount)\nAnd there is only 4 locked character, so... it's not that a big deal.\n\nHo, I was close to forget to tell that everything that you can see on steam as DLC is in the in-game shop too.\n[b]But[/b]!...\nIn the in-game shop, every character skin bundle are available in stand alone, or in other bundle (with more, or less stuff of the same collection, with a few exception)\n[b]And[/b]!...\nEvery Skin you buy, or earn as reward for playing or daily connection, with the exception of Twitch Drop (yes there is special skin as Twitch drop after each update or close too.\nAll of this can be recycle in some sort of in-game money, that you can use to craft anything you want.\nSo, for example, if you was lucky and drop half of the part of a skin, you can just craft what is missing.\nAnd the Rarity/Resources ratio is very simple, it's a factor of 3.\n3 blue Item give you what you need to make a blue item.\nAnd for the rarity above, same, etc\nAnd in the other way 1 blue item give enough resources to make a single one from the previous rarity, that mean that, if you want to craft something above blue rarity, with blue recycled item, you need 9 of them, that it, and it's not that much.\n([u]info:[/u] there is nothing like special reward for daily connection for X consecutive days <3 I hate this sort of things, so thx Klei!)\n\nI know that I didn't talk about the game directly, nothing about the game-play, the characters, the Arts (who are really great), etc\nAnyone can see in less than 5 minutes looking at the screenshot or any game-play video to understand the artistic quality of the game.\n\nThe Lore is Deep, Cryptic in the good way, somehow like what is done with the soul's series and the game will stay interesting since your first noob hours, until 100 hours, and more.\nThere is so much content, too much? Nha! Never!\n\nOverall, this review was more focused on the business model of the game, somehow, of a game released 8 years ago (or even more if we take Don't Starve original release date), and who still have updates, event, content, and the game is better and better update after update, like No Man Sky (just an example of longevity)\n\n\n[h3]After all, all of this could be resume, at least for me, like this:[/h3]\n\nWe all know big company, big studio, who release the famous AAA games that so many people wait each years, games who will cost 60 or even 70$, with Denuvo, sometime even poor PC optimization (I don't complain about bugs, it's normal).\nBut since many years now, what is really exiting, games where I spend most of my time when I can, they aren't from theses studios, it's not games from Bethesda, Ubisoft, EA, Bioware, Xbox, Sony, Blizzard (xD), Sega, Nintendo, etc...\n\nI'm not saying that there isn't good AAA games, it's just not the same and, It's my personal opinion, I think that all the big studio we loved in the past, and who became Triple A studio has been somehow changed, not corrupted, but they doesn't feel as close as before to the players community. Too much abusive price, too much loot box, too much games with cut content at the release that should be in the game, and sell later as dlc.\nIn a few words, people who control theses studio are more focus on money and pleasing their shareholders than making a good game. It's not because the Dev are corrupted and greedy, they just aren't free as before.\n\nAnd so, I'm looking somewhere else, and found a new generation of studio who grow more and more, since many years now, that I called [b]iii[/b], the Triple I games Studios, with an I for Indy if it wasn't enough obvious :p\nThere is a lot of good indy and very good indy studios or even solo dev who are making fantastic games.\n\nBut for me, only a few of them are a big step above every others, they always stay close to their community, they share with players and don't hide things in the dark, they are honest, fair, in their price and with us. \nThey tell when something bad happen and doesn't hide when they was wrong, they know when they wrong and need to make a step back.\nAnd the quality of their games is indisputable!\nLarian is one of them, as Supergiant Games, Coffee Stain Studios, Red Hook, Motion Twin, and even if a lot of people will not agree with me, I'm thinking that CD Projekt Red is on of them too.\nThe only real exception would be from software.\nYes, the list is bigger but I'm reaching the limit of the maximum number of characters for this review!\n\nAnd so what? [b]Klei[/b] is one of them, a studio that we can thrust, so give this game a chance, or 2nd, even a 3rd one!\n\nThanks for your time ;)", "timestamp_created": 1711869817, "timestamp_updated": 1711869817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161757782": {"recommendationid": "161757782", "author": {"steamid": "76561199133194214", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 362, "last_played": 1711590485}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game but the pigs are racist", "timestamp_created": 1711748471, "timestamp_updated": 1711748486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161696472": {"recommendationid": "161696472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868731241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 431, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1713499051}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1711681784, "timestamp_updated": 1711681784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161554981": {"recommendationid": "161554981", "author": {"steamid": "76561199078648708", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1828, "last_played": 1711508461}, "language": "english", "review": "this is the gamest game in gaming games", "timestamp_created": 1711508111, "timestamp_updated": 1711508111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161550874": {"recommendationid": "161550874", "author": {"steamid": "76561199308229480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2042, "last_played": 1684886424}, "language": "english", "review": "i starved. good game", "timestamp_created": 1711502769, "timestamp_updated": 1711502769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161506056": {"recommendationid": "161506056", "author": {"steamid": "76561199490097022", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "playtime_at_review": 3592, "last_played": 1713707123}, "language": "english", "review": "everything in this game tries to/will kill you", "timestamp_created": 1711459130, "timestamp_updated": 1711459130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161493560": {"recommendationid": "161493560", "author": {"steamid": "76561199539250727", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 368, "last_played": 1704346367}, "language": "english", "review": "Add more food to the game", "timestamp_created": 1711442938, "timestamp_updated": 1711442938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161443547": {"recommendationid": "161443547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183815423", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 7990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7990, "last_played": 1691894904}, "language": "english", "review": "Hard to master, everything is deadly.

Starve drives me mad like few games ever do. It provided me with dozens of exhilarating brushes with death, but padded those unforgettable moments with long stretches of tedious busy work. It's the type of game where you can spend hours mining the environment, outfitting your character, and fortifying your home base, only to have your slice of paradise shattered by a terrifying, nearly-unstoppable shadow beast invasion. It's a roguelike at heart, meaning that death is inevitable, and once you die, it's truly game over. Don't Starve will never, ever hold your hand, and I both love it and hate it for that.\n\nKlei Entertainment's stylish take on Minecraft's formula through the lense of a roguelike drops you into the gorgeous wild and immediately abandons you to figure out how to survive on your own. Some adventurers will view this freedom as a liberating canvas on which they can express their patience, creativity, and bravery, but this complete lack of direction or goals beyond simply staying alive prevented me from ever really bonding with Don't Starve.", "timestamp_created": 1711885415, "timestamp_updated": 1711885415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158779441": {"recommendationid": "158779441", "author": {"steamid": "76561199498435937", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6122, "last_played": 1708409431}, "language": "english", "review": "roguelike brings mining n crafting to another level, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1708403702, "timestamp_updated": 1708403702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158040661": {"recommendationid": "158040661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805789460", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1659440584}, "language": "english", "review": "Steam hosts \"Don't Starve Together\" as an immersive survival experience that thrives on collaboration and strategy.

When its night time make sure you are nearby a fire.\nAlways carry MIN 12 grass, 12 logs, 20 sticks. and lots of food.\nStay away from wes, everyone hates him for a reason, dont try to be \"unique\" \nDo NOT pick up the carrots until theres 3 days left for winter. Thank me later. \nIf you dont secure your server, some willow main will join and burn your base down. Secure your server ALWAYS. Or kick any willow mains that joins the game. \nDeerclops usually arrives at 20 something days of winter in the game. When you hear his breath, run out of your base as quickly as possible. \nFind pig king and chester before day 10. Build your base nearby the pig king. Be aware of pigs if you play as Wortox, Wurt or webber. \nDo NOT stay in the base ALL THE TIME. Ofcourse you will die of starvation if you stay there! Dont be scared to explore, make mini bases in every biom you discover. \nMake a science machine, speed craft Backpack and spear. Then tore down the machine with a hammer. It will boost you before you settle down with the main base. \n\nAnd please, be cooperative with your friends. \n\n[spoiler]Don't be scared to use mods, i recommend Display Attack Range, Wormhole Marks [DST], Increased Stack Size, Ad Shovel, Craft Pot, Camera Tweaks, Boss Indicators, Finder, Global Positions, Minimap HUD, Display Food Values, Show me (origin) and Combined Status.[/spoiler]\n\nHave fun!", "timestamp_created": 1620073589, "timestamp_updated": 1620073589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 983, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.94933629035949707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13423510": {"recommendationid": "13423510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105055018", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 33028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16528, "last_played": 1692651712}, "language": "english", "review": "UPDATE: This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct. Sorry for this inconvience.\n\n\n\nWhen I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends. Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends.\n\nStarting off:\nOnce you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and Endless\n\nSurvival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets.\n\nWilderness:  When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp. Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died. Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying.\n\nEndless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes. When you join the server you spawn in from a \"Jury-Rigged Portal\" And begin surviving. If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character. You can respawn if you haunt one of the following. (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the \"Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart\" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points. You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)\n\nOnce you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night. Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not. And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i.e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst).\n\nCharacters -\n\nWilson:\n\nPros -\n\nGrows a beard\n\nCons - None.\n\nWilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter.\n\nWillow:\n\nPros -\n\nDoesn't Take fire damage\nStarts with a lighter (Infinte torch)\n\nCons -\n\nWhen on low sanity Will cause lots of forest fires\nCan Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops.\n\nWillow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST. But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server. She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag.\n\nWolfgang:\n\nPros -\n\nGets stronger on a full stomach\nHas more hp\n\nCons - \n\n1.5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomach\nMoves and deals less damage at a smaller stomach\nLoses more sanity in Night / Afternoon\n\nAh, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener. Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only \"Power up\" to full stomach when in need. Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast.\n\nWendy:\n\nPros -\n\nHas a ghost sister\nDoesn't lose much sanity in dark\n\nCons -\n\nDoes -.25% Less damage than all characters\nLoses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail in\n\nWendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game. Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon. As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower. She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower. But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her. If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it. If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it.\n\nWX78:\n\nPros - \n\nCan eat ANY Food that is spoiled /  Stale and take no penalty.\nCan be charged by lightning\nCan eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten.\n\nCons -\n\nTakes Damage in the rain\nStarts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)\n\nWX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella. If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0.25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds. If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking. But can be benifical if you use if effectively.\n\nWickerbottom:\n\nPro -\n\nStarts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked.\nAble to craft her own books\nStarts off with 2 Papyrus.\n\nCons -\n\nCan't Sleep\nTakes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale food\n\nWickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine. Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up. With the abiliy to make your own books  you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity. And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population.\n\nThe Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review.\n\nOver all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players.\n\nEDIT: YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY.

Last time in hospital she still hope that she could get better and make it back home before this Winter's Feast. And I promised to buy some skin for her Wendy as Christmas present... \n\nObviously, I won't play this game anymore. But yes. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\nThis is a great game, sharing with family and friends. Specially someone you love.\nTreasure the moment. Treasure the time. Dont Starve Alone....

So...\nDear The Strangers, New friends and Friends of old (her friends mostly)\n\n1) Thank you for reading and warm comments.\n\n2) If you looking for friendship, or someone to play DST with... I'm not going back to play this game. It's too hurtful for me to do so. I still gonna open it once i a while because i afraid Klei would delete the World I created with her. But it will be simply turn on and off.\n\n3) Since i gave her this account in 2017, I don't know how many friends she had made? Via Discord, via facebook, via other social media sites? If you are friends of old, want to know what happened to her. Contact me on her social media sites, her phone number and Discord.\nI'm currently taking care of her facebook account and update it once in a while for her friends and family. \n\nHer facebook ID: toidentusaohoa\n\nIf you have question about her sudden death also her sickness --> ask me on FB private message. I will happy to reply to you all.\n\n4) A friend of her pm the other day, very upset because there still people think this is fake story, even joke on that. He asked me to delete the rude comment, and lock comment box off.\nBut I said \"NO\" ... \nI already lost her. That was the most hurtful thing happen to me. There's nothing in this world could hurt me more than that. Haters gonna hate, people doubt what they dont understand and that the basic instinct of human. I won't mind at all. Mostly kids or who inexperience with life and lost. \n\n---- Jan 12, 2023 - Update ---- \nShould listen to her friend to lock the comment box off.

I'm not gonna go after them. \nIf you want justice, you go and report them yourself \n\n- Dont Add friend me on steam. Unlike her, who's very friendly. I'm an introvert, almost 40 years old man, I prefer solitude and seeking no attentions.\n- Dont be rude and leave hateful comment if you dont know anything. I'm not gonna delete your comment. The next person will see it and they will judge.\n- I'm not force you to give award and I dont care about points. \n\n6) This review is the Third and maybe the last I ever written.\nTo show appreciation to Klei, helping me to find a perfect Gaming Girl, and had her for 5 years.

But that is because I played the original game and have a good understanding of the basics and intermediate gameplay. For the uninitiated it can be a long dark perilous road to making it past the first winter. I however highly recommend buying this game and the single player version. With no in-game tutorial and no real tooltips you find yourself googling and asking other players for advice on how to deal with daily life. Everything kills you, especially your friends.

They hardly ever disappoint their audience, and if you don't like something, and you tell them about it politely, you'll get a reply explaining things.\nThere are a lot of survival games nowadays, but DST is unique. There is no manual, it is a sink or swim game. And you die at first, over and over again. But there is something about being afraid of the dark that they tapped into. When you first start playing you fear nightfall because in DST, as in it's predecessor Don't Starve, there really ARE things out there that will kill you when night falls. Of course, other things are happily trying to kill you in the daylight, too.\nThere is a lot of fun in the game, and Klei's programmers have a wicked sense of humour and a love of punning!\nThis game has got better and better over the years. Since December of 2014 the Don't Starve universe has consumed a huge amount of my time and I still play one or other version every day.\nAnd I still die!

Yes, absolutely, whole-heartedly. My game time alone should clarify that. I have basically two games that I play and periodically cycle through, and this is one of them.\u2028\u2028\n\nThis is going to be partly a DST review, partly a DS/DST comparison. For clarity, I\u2019ll say now that when I write DST I mean Don\u2019t Starve Together, while when I write DS I mean Don\u2019t Starve (its single player-only counterpart).\u2028\n\nDS was the first to be created, and when DST was born a few years later, it was [b]initially not much more than a multiplayer version of DS[/b] and its DLC Reign of Giants (which in DST is included for free). However, it [b]soon acquired a spirit of its own[/b] with [b]A New Reign[/b], a first update chain which introduced many new bosses and items, and [b]Return of Them[/b], a still-ongoing update chain which introduces sea content, with new surface and underground biomes and mechanics: one of the main points in favour of buying DST over DS is that it is more \u201cpolished\u201d and receives [b]monthly updates[/b] by Klei, while DS is essentially a complete game. The developers are in close touch with the community, and listen to what players have to say: if an update is perceived as faulty in some way by a majority of users, Klei listens and \u201cfixes\u201d things to a better state.\nHowever, [b]DS has some things that DST doesn\u2019t have[/b]: [b]tougher survival[/b] for those who like more challenge (food is harder to obtain, and coping with harsh seasons like Winter and Summer is considerably harder), [b]Adventure Mode[/b] (what sometimes people refer to when they say \u201cbeating Don\u2019t Starve\u201d: it is both challenging and fun), and [b]Shipwrecked and Hamlet[/b], two DLCs that, according to Klei, won\u2019t be integrated into DST: while Return of Them may sound similar in concept to Shipwrecked, they are actually very different settings. So, if one plans to mainly play alone, and enjoys a hardcore survival game, I\u2019d say get DS, not DST: in DST: both mechanics and survival options (especially food) are more lenient towards players. For base-building, however, DST has more options, including skinned objects (I\u2019ll delve into this later).\u2028\u2028\n\nSo, who is DST for? There's something for everyone: those who like [b]base-building[/b] will be satisfied; those who like [b]rushing[/b] goals in as little time as possible will be satisfied; those who like [b]fighting[/b] powerful bosses will be satisfied.\n\u2028In my experience, DST is much easier with others than alone, because it is possible to split tasks between different players and do things more quickly. Bosses are also much easier, so I usually play with others when I want to chill out and have some fun, and alone when I want some more challenge. \n\nFor what concerns [b]customisation[/b] of gameplay, DST is rich for what concerns food, but lacking in other fields. This may be a pity for a few people, like me, but it doesn\u2019t affect enjoyability of the game that much, so I think it\u2019s a secondary aspect. However, I would still like to go into it. \n\u2028[b]Food-wise, it definitely shines[/b]: I personally feed mainly on stone fruits, other people are the meatballs-meatballs-meatballs kind, others still like to feed their character with their favourite food, benefitting from the extra 15 hunger points that it grants. The character of Warly needs varied foods as part of his gameplay, and Warly players are quite fond of this challenge.\u2028\n[b]Equipment-wise, it doesn\u2019t shine as much[/b]. There are basically six pieces of armour that are worth crafting: log suit, football helmet, marble suit, nightmare armour, thulecite suit and thulecite crown. Players end up using mainly football helmets and log suits, with the occasional marble suits: this is because the other ones are not cheap, especially thulecite equipment. Before end-game, when one usually has an excess of nightmare fuel and thulecite (the two ingredients needed for the nightmare armour and the thulecite suit/crown), people will only use log suits/football helmets/marble armours. If one considers that thulecite equipment actually protects less than marble equipment (90% of thulecite vs 95% of marble), which means that a character wearing marble can withstand two times the hits of a character wearing thulecite, it can seem like a waste to use these materials for armour (it is true, however, that the thulecite crown has some interesting bonuses).\u2028\nThis is due to the fact that unlike other games, DST (and DS) [b]lack a true tier progression system[/b]: you\u2019ll build a science machine, and then an alchemy engine, and later a prestihatitor and a shadow manipulator, but very valuable weapons and armour can already be crafted from the alchemy engine, which I can usually acquire within the first 10 days of (relaxed) play and which for me usually marks a plateau of technological development. \u2028\nSo, while for food you\u2019ll see different players eat differently, in the early-mid game all players will fight the dragonfly with log suits/football helmets and a ham bat; all players will fight the bee queen with beekeeper hats; all players will try to acquire a tam o shanter for sanity, etc. [it may be argued that many foods are good for restoring sanity, and sure, I use them too, but I never saw anyone completely ditch the tam to rely solely on food for their sanity]\nTo survive harsh seasons, like summer and winter, different options are available, and evenly spread among different players: thermal stones (summer and winter), eyebrellas (summer), beefalo hats (winter), tam o shanters (winter), but even this is a quite small customisation pool if compared to other games.\u2028\n\nI previously mentioned [b]cosmetic skins[/b]: they are a feature exclusive to DST (not present in any way in DS), which allows to dress characters in different ways, and build structures with different appearances. This means that [b]skins don\u2019t affect gameplay in any way[/b]: differently-dressed characters will have no bonuses and differently-skinned structures will work in exactly the same way as their basic counterpart, so skins are just a way to look prettier or make a prettier base.\u2028\nThere is [b]one (partial) exception: DLC characters[/b] (Wortox, Wurt and Wormwood). They actually provide differences in gameplay, but like most skins they can be either bought or \u201cweaved\u201d for free: once a day, upon logging into the game, each player receives one free cosmetic skin, and while playing, each week, a total of 8 other skins can be acquired, for a total of 15 skins per week. It is possible to [b]exchange these skins for spool to spend in getting other skins or the DLC characters[/b], and I think this is a good way of handling things: no one has to actually buy anything with real money, besides the game, but for those who want to support Klei and the game\u2019s development, there is the option of buying skins.\n\u2028On top of the 15 drops per week, concomitantly with the game update Klei usually releases extra skins that can be acquired for free (no spool, no money) by watching game streams on Twitch.\n\nOne last comment goes to the [b]modding community[/b]: it is rich both in DS and DST, and in DST it often allows to bring past events back (\u201cThe Forge\u201d, \u201cThe Gorge,\u201d and even \u201cYear of the gobbler/varg/pig/carrat\u201d). I have already been long enough, so I will link a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/322330/discussions/0/2569816316384639091/#c2569816316386864113]discussion post[/url] in the forum in which I highlighted some very relevant mods for both DS and DST, in case anyone is interested (please, refer to the link I sent, instead of going to the top of the page and read the version that is marked as answer to the thread.

One person could be a complete and utter warlord trying to defeat all the bosses the game has to offer, while another could just be trying to recruit all the pigs they see and give them unique hats; extraordinarily, both of these playstyles can coexist with each other in this game. \nThe first few hours of the game are infuriating. You die so many times that you might give up on playing it entirely. Then you come back and look at guides to get good. Then you keep dying until you stop dying, and now you suddenly have a hundred hours into the game; even with that, you're still finding out new ways to play the game and get better at not dying. You still somehow die anyways, because this game's few core mechanics are so well-done that ignoring one of them may or may not come back to bite you in the rear.\nThe only thing that really separates the newbies and the veterans in this game is the amount of knowledge they have in the game, and yet the game has so many ways to be played and further optimized that there really isn't a definitive way to even say who's the most professional at not starving and who isn't.\n\nAll things considered, saying that the game is \"pretty good\" might be an understatement. It's so good that it probably made me forget to not starve in real life at one point.\nPersonally, I may have played this game too much. But one of my personal favorite things about this game is that even though the sandbox part of the game is encouraged at some points, it isn't crucial to the experience; it's made my own goal of being an all-conquering war god very enjoyable. The fighting is quite simplistic, but with how the enemies and bosses of the game are designed, it's probably for the best that fighting is simple; one trip-up can cost you your entire game, and the way the bosses challenge your knowledge of the game makes for battles that have made me have a heart attack a few times -- looking at you, Misery Toadstool.\n\nIn addition to all of that, there's a cherry on top of the cherry, too; the developers of this game are great. They respect the community, and use their criticisms to make the game better -- they even let the spiders wear hats!\n\nSo, yeah. Good game. Good devs too.

So this review is mostly directed to those who also haven't played the original game.\n\nThe Art style and the humor of the game are great. I love every little detail about it. The dark setting and humor really make the game quite enjoyable. Our first attempts to survive failed all around day 5. We couldn't stop there though. We improved and so we discovered more and more of the game. Even now we live in a world on day 43 and still I am learning new stuff. The terrain generation gives you plenty of random things to play with.\n\nAs for the multiplayer  performance. We never had the server crash on us. I never had a client crash.

Thinking it was just a wolf, I grabbed my spear and armor, wolves weren't anything to worry about. \n\nExcept the ground shook the closer it came, rattling every item on the map until this amalgamation of horror came onto the screen; giant antlers protruded out from above a single wide eye, every exhale this creature took gathered in a fog from it's mouth hole, every single stomp from a gigantic hoof sent rows of jagged ice along the ground like piston. \n\nWhen my friend came back from the bathroom, everything was gone. He died instantly, unable to move or defend himself from the Deerclops, a sad ghost who could only haunt my already dwindling sanity through the duration of the very short fight. The Deerclops knew how to get me too, chasing me around my own camp until the fire inevitably went out, unable to throw anything into the fire for fear that the behemoth creature would kill me instantly just as he did my defenseless friend. Blind now in the darkness, all I could do was run around some more in a desperate attempt to find my fire pit before Charlie bore down on me, snuffling out the last vestiges of health I had before it was all over. \n\nWhat happened?!

Cons\nthe game goes a bit too fast sometimes. what sould have taken around 100 days turns into something you do in the first month. aswell, food (although still a problem) is nearly non-existant when you have someone that gathers rabbits and berries in the morning. this goes for health aswell, as bees seem to be someone's top priority. if you are not dumb, or take something on too tough for you, you will never die.

If you are wanting to buy this game, but you intend to only play it by yourself, then I strongly suggest you stop now, don't get this game, and get the original Don't Starve along with its DLCs instead. If you still want to get this game, then I'm just going to say that there is a lot to learn about this game and you'll need to know stuff about the original Don't Starve as well. \n\nYou don't need to know the plot of the original game to know what Don't Starve is about. Even though it is a sequel in a way, you don't need to know what happened. Basically, you're going to be dropped into a world and you are going to have only one goal, survive as long as you can. There is a lore to the game, and it is an incredibly rich lore that should definitely get some sort of attention because it's really interesting and ever so more expanding. The world is already interesting enough with the kind of creatures it holds and what each of the playable characters can do, but it's that lore that does make this world all the much the better once you know it. \n\nRight off the bat, the game spews charm from it. From character and monster designs, to the artstyle, the old vintage look, and even down the music which sounds like what you would imagine the world would have. I can sit on the main menu of this game for hours to listen to the theme. \n\nYou'll have 12 characters to pick and choose who you'll play as, each one with different stats and different abilities that make them stand out from each other. For players who have already played Don't Starve, you won't have to worry about these characters needing to be unlocked, they're all unlocked right out of the gate. Also for players who have played Don't Starve, the characters have changed a bit in order to be a bit more balanced for multiplayer. Each character fits a different play style so you'll never feel as though you're playing as the same character, and you can feel the differences with each character and you'll find someone with a playstyle who you'll enjoy playing as the most.\n\nThis game is not easy and if you are new, you'll probably not survive for very long in it especially if you do not know what to do. The game is not going to teach you anything, you'll either have to learn to survive as you play, learn from other players, or research about the game. At no point are you ever going to be safe. You'll have to eat to keep yourself from starving, find ways to restore your character's sanity so that way you don't go insane and be attacked by shadow creatures, fire can spread and destroy precious resources, some resources can't respawn, some creatures will attack and try to kill you, and there will be a pack of hounds that will randomly come after you as you go through each day. Even changing seasons will be a hazard as you'll either have to survive the cold of winter, the storms of spring, or the heat of summer. It may be hard to get into first, but once you get a grasp of the game and how it plays, it feels so satisifying to be able to survive longer than you used to. You'll need to craft items to survive and even craft items to craft even more items and you'll need as much as you can and know exactly what you need to survive for so long.\n\nThe one thing that stands about this game over the original Don't Starve is that this one has online multiplayer where you can play up to 6 other people. You can play by yourself, but it won't be easier than playing with others unless you have mods supported by the Steam Workshop. If you're going to play this game with others, I highly recommend playing with friends. \n\nIf there is one thing I can say about this game is that it will get reptitive. Once you get the hang of the game, it's just a matter of surviving as long as you can and if you are able to learn the game to the point where you know everything about it, you'll have nearly nothing to worry about. \n\nIf you want a challenging survival game and one that you can play with friends, this game is definitely for you and I can highly recommend it to others. Even though it can get repetitive after a while, I still find it to be a fun game where you'll always have to be doing something to survive and keep going, and with the developers continuing to add more stuff to the game and showing a great passion for it, I can see it being supported for a long time.", "timestamp_created": 1509856904, "timestamp_updated": 1512233970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.856386661529541016", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65556954": {"recommendationid": "65556954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105590548", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1998, "last_played": 1585394850}, "language": "english", "review": "It takes a while to understand the game if you have no prior knowledge about it.

Keep in mind, that this was way before any of the DLCs for that game came out. But something about the game kept drawing me back in\u2026 \n\nEventually, I said to myself \u201cThis is a good game, but it\u2019d definitely be cool if I could play with friends\u2026\u201d Sometime after that, Klei announced Don\u2019t Starve Together, and over the years, this game kept delivering and delivering. From cool events, to nice exclusive Twitch unlockables, and, just last week, officially updated the game to have a crossover with Terraria!\n\nIn this game, players are put into a randomly generated world with different biomes and set pieces. There\u2019s also seasons (summer, fall, winter, spring) and each season effects the world in various ways. For example, winter is dangerous because without proper supplies or a base, you may freeze to death. Food is also more scarce. In Spring, food tends to grow faster due to the temperature being ideal, and rain has a tendency to be very common. Unprepared players may also end up with a Lureplant growing in their base too during spring. Each season brings it\u2019s own boss, and challenges.\n\nIf you get tired of exploring the surface, you can travel underground into the caves and discover a whole new world of weirdness that The Constant (the name of the world/realm the player is in) has in store. From Spelunking Monkeys, to glowing colorful mushroom trees, and even dangerous ruins.\n\nThis game is very fun, especially when you have friends. Klei has spent years and years on this game, and they keep adding more to it. That being said, especially with the new Terraria stuff, I really wish I could nominate this game and Terraria together for the \u201cLabor of Love\u201d Steam Award, but it\u2019s so unfair that I can only select games from this year, as I\u2019d love to nominate Terraria for \u201cBetter With Friends.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings for Don\u2019t Starve Together, as each update, we get more lore, and things get even more epic.", "timestamp_created": 1637792115, "timestamp_updated": 1637803634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855482220649719238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31414335": {"recommendationid": "31414335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248397806", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 18992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8993, "last_played": 1692727765}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing survival game that is updated quite frequently.
