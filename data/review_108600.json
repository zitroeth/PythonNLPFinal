(Crazy lore unlocks below!)\"\n\nProject Zomboid is one of those titles that will remain in Early Access forever. But it is that way for a reason... It is one of the oldest EA titles (alongside Minecraft, which has since graduated from EA) to still be in development today, started by four people and a dream.\n\nPZ is known for its authentic sandbox experience. If you play with default settings, electricity and water will eventually shut off. Loot across the vast map will run out. To get to the endgame, you must plan for ALL eventualities by setting up rain barrels, farms, and discover renewable resources/methods to sustain yourself... while dealing with the growing zombie threat. NPCs aren't in yet, but vehicles have been delivered and have completely changed the game. I expect NPCs to also make a similar lasting impact (or maybe they end up becoming convenient loot boxes, who knows).\n\nPZ allows you to fully customize your experience. You can set zombies as traditional shamblers, fast movers, etc... Loot can be set to replenish over time. There's A LOT of settings to choose from if you're into that kind of thing. There's even an AI director to keep the pacing just right. No matter what kind of emergent gameplay or roleplaying experience you want to have, PZ will make it possible for you.\n\nPZ has great modding support and a greater modding community, extending the game in every direction. Indie Stone also incorporates some of them into the base game, which is very pragmatic because of the sheer scope it's trying to achieve. Some modders even get hired, which is what Valve does. A powerful move when used correctly. That's not to say that everything is perfect, because mods can just as quickly fall apart when the game inevitably changes.\n\nThe biggest drawback is the clunky UI, as the learning curve is frustrating especially when you're being chased by zombies with permadeath enabled. This issue cannot be solved until there is a major overhaul along with good keybindings, but this won't be easy because of the simulation aspect AND there is no point until the game is feature complete. You can play around the bad UI to some extent by re-organizing your inventory and using other tricks to get by... But all of it ALWAYS goes out the window once you're being chased with permadeath on.\n\nNow, let's talk about the troubled development of PZ... Or rather, how Indie Stone has pulled through some of the most difficult setbacks in the indie business. Their sheer resilience cannot be overstated because Indie Stone is not some AAA studio and never has been. It's four ordinary humans starting out with barely any money and only passion.\n\nBefore PZ was first released as a tech demo on June 2011 under Patch 0.1.4c, Paypal limited their account permanently, stopping withdrawals for 180 days to protect against chargebacks (otherwise Paypal was liable for refunds). So Indie Stone tried Google Checkout, but Google became suspicious of them selling \"donations\". There was no \"pay what you want\" option on Google Checkout at the time, so Indie Stone had used a list of pre-order options where you could also add \u00a35, \u00a310, and \u00a315 donations alongside the base game. This might not sound like a big deal, but Indie Stone had all of their development funds (hereafter referred to as \"war chest\") tied up in an uncertain state, held hostage by Google AND Paypal. Having most of their war chest (and rent money) locked up in an UNCERTAIN state made PZ's future VERY uncertain. Google also waited a month into the pre-orders before doing this, and there were zero guarantees that Indie Stone would ever see those funds again. Google was obviously contacted (a Herculean feat as there wasn't any reliable way to get a hold of them because they were actively avoiding getting into end-user support), but only gave this vague reply: \"We advise buyers to contact sellers directly to resolve any order-related issues.\" Can you see how screwed Indie Stone was now? It was insane, and their forums were on fire. The situation was solved via legal loopholes, but at the time, it could have been the end of PZ.\n\nNext, PZ was leaked and copies started spreading as the game received attention. Not a bad thing, right? But pirates created an auto-updating version using Indie Stone's cloud-based servers and it always re-downloaded the latest version even if you had it. A massive hole was now burning through their war chest as Indie Stone needed to pay for bandwidth used by each individual download, and end-user pirates were spamming it to check for updates. Indie Stone is the gigachad archetype recommending users to try out their game via piracy before buying it, and until it became an actual roadblock to delivering their product, they had no issues turning a blind eye to it. This was solved swiftly by going full manual and eventually selling PZ through Steam and GOG. Now, you may be thinking... So... What's the problem? There was no such thing as Early Access titles on Steam in 2011, because the Greenlight initiative started in 2012! Any of you guys remember that!? So until then, they had to \"deal with it\", slowing sales and growth. In 2011, games selling in the EA state wasn't common yet because there weren't any reliable platforms to distribute them.\n\nOn October 15, 2011, they experienced a devastating break-in. Chris Simpson and Andy Hodgetts had moved into a new apartment and had personal possessions and their laptops, containing six weeks of code, stolen. This almost broke them AND the player base because the current AND next update no longer existed. What about backups? As I understand it, their ISP (Virgin) hadn't set anything up yet, so they were using mobile Internet to get online for now, which makes regular online backups not feasible. They backed up data across all of their PCs, which is the next best thing. Imagine being a team of four who had finally climbed various hurdles towards success and then getting all of your legs taken out instantly. Again, they're ordinary people like you and I, not some AAA studio. It was their \"Great Depression\", and sentiments were at an all-time low across the board because it would greatly extend development times while online comments humiliated them.\n\nDespite all of this, and the constant negative feedback, Indie Stone never gave up. It's now 2024, and they're still going strong. Haters often don't realize how small the team was, or they're used to the fast \"asset flips\" Unreal Engine is capable of. But this is all indie, and the main ingredient is love, and in its current state, I'm ready to write the review while giving you some crazy lore unlocks in the process.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm a PZ loremaster... I'm just a degen gamer who bought it back in Feb 2014. Before then, I pirated this game to try it. I was one of the end-user pirates spamming the update button. I've been there when multiplayer and vehicles were just a promise... So I get it if you don't believe in the game. But I do, and I seriously think this is the best zombie survival sandbox simulation on the market because I was there when it was a mere public tech demo. I've gifted several copies to my friends.\n\nIndie Stone has the special type of resilience that will get them through anything. Their process is slow, but the result is good despite the sheer epic scope they're trying to deliver. Since then, there have been games like DayZ, but PZ is the only one that offers the most authentic zombie survival sandbox simulation experience.\n\nYou can watch their presentation on their woes, back when they were still a team of four and not the thirty (or so) today: https://youtu.be/HYgPI0qkdU4 (search: zomboid rezzed how not to make a game)\n\nHighlights:\n@ 16:16 - getting around Google Checkout\n@ 22:50 - getting burgled\n\nThanks for reading, this was a long one (but not as long as their development time, amirite?).", "timestamp_created": 1712043257, "timestamp_updated": 1712348453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867075622081756592", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159999305": {"recommendationid": "159999305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021922521", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 113371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 294, "playtime_at_review": 112302, "last_played": 1713312660}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played a lot of hours in this game, not exactly all are played as I have left the game running idle for many hours or forgot to close it. I wish Steam tracked \"active\" hours versus just sitting there paused, but anyway that is a rant for another time.\n\nHere are some of my pros and cons to the game as it currently stands from a long time player:\n\nPros\nHighly Customizable Goals/Objectives\nYou can make this game be anything you want. If you want to be a survival versus zombies you can do that, if you want it to be survival versus other players you can do that! If you want to RP as a survivor in the PZ world you can do that. The options are endless!!\nRealistic Thought/Activities\nYou can drive vehicles in the game, and while driving you can't craft. Jumping through broken windows can injure you. These are things you should know/expect to happen when performing them and it is a lot of fun to see this implemented.\nMod Support\nCountless mods to add whatever you want in the game that doesn't come wrapped with the vanilla product. If you want to fight zombies with a large spoon, guess what, there is a mod for it. There has never been a time that someone has asked \"Is this in the game?\" and my response, \"There is a mod for it\" has failed.\nLearning Curve Is Steep - Base Game\nThis game has a massive learning curve, and I thrive on that so it is a personal pro for me, but not everyone wants to do that. But again, it is highly customizable so I find this as just an added feature from the base game having such a learning curve.\nGreat Price\nVery affordable for what it offers and I would challenge any other company to make the same type of game and charge the same amount. I have been a gamer for over 30 years, and I haven't seen it. However, if someone knows one I would love to learn about it.\n\nCons:\nEnd-Game Is Very Limited\nWhile I mentioned it as a plus that you can have some highly customizable goals/objectives, once those are accomplished the game doesn't offer much. You have to accept that basically there is no end-game/roll credit scenario, the ending is up to you and sometimes the race to complete your goals might not take very long. This is a problem of all survival games in one sense or another, but it is a problem of the genre versus this game in particular I feel.\nCritical Bugs/RNG\nSome people will experience bugs that will end their game and it isn't their fault. I have seen screenshots and experienced issues where my character just up and died while walking down a set of stairs before. This has happened on MP a lot, some of my friends die from desync issues. This is something the dev team is aware of and working on in regards to MP, but these are problems you could encounter. RNG can also stack against you, you might be looking for supplies and hop into an alarmed building after being injured. You might find a cool weapon right off the bad or not find one for many days making you struggle tremendously. RNG is a major factor in encountering the bugs as well.\nUpdate Roll-Outs\nThe game is developed by a small team, and so they are slow at making updates. Not everyone has the money to throw around like some big AAA companies, TIS is very much an Indie Company and so they don't have crazy resources so expect slow delays. Some people are impatient, and I can be at times but it is a fact of life you will encounter.\n\nThese are my thoughts from a long time player, I love playing this game and I enjoy hearing others having fun with it as well. It is a game that can be really great to play because of the elements and things you can do in it. However, expect some issues that may or may not end your game too early that is not your fault.", "timestamp_created": 1709764629, "timestamp_updated": 1709764822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865275919437408447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158706354": {"recommendationid": "158706354", "author": {"steamid": "76561199214215289", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 444, "playtime_at_review": 620, "last_played": 1713796068}, "language": "english", "review": ">spawn in\n>go outside of house\n>gets bitten by a zombie\n>die\nwould do this for another 100 hours", "timestamp_created": 1708335138, "timestamp_updated": 1708335138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 172, "votes_funny": 87, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857165515422821045", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159362649": {"recommendationid": "159362649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079118128", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 45916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45047, "last_played": 1710259404}, "language": "english", "review": "The raccoon mocks me.

But even kings have room for improvement, and for me, it was learning how to connect generators.\n\n[h2]I cannot hammer in enough how INVINCIBLE I thought I was...[/h2]\n\nI scoured every inch of the nearby town, raiding every store and flipping through every book, desperate to find the elusive magazine that held the key to my upgrade. And just when I thought I'd searched everywhere, I realized my gas supply was dwindling. With the pumps useless without electricity, my gas-guzzling van was devouring fuel faster than I could find it.\n\nDetermined to solve both problems, I embarked on an expedition, gathering every last drop of gasoline and stocking up on supplies. Confident in my ability to handle the zombie hordes, I set out into the desolate cities and roads, ready to conquer whatever challenges came my way.\n\nAfter what felt like days of pitstops and unwelcomed visits to abandoned homes, I stumbled upon a trailer park, a potential treasure trove in this barren wasteland. Excited by the prospect of finding what I needed, I approached an old Survivor's trailer home, hoping it held the magazine I sought. But as I pried off the boarded-up window and dispatched a couple of zombies lurking outside, I was unprepared for what awaited me inside. \n\n[h2] When I initially peeked In, all I saw were a couple zeds... [/h2]\n\nInstead of the two zombies I expected, I was met with a mini horde, swarming me within the cramped home like hungry vultures. Panic surged through me as they closed in, their grasping hands reaching for me with deadly intent. In a desperate attempt to fend them off, I frantically mashed the space bar, trying to shove them away but with each shove my character strained harder, to exhausted to push any more... it was futile.\n\nAs the zombies overwhelmed me, tearing through flesh and bone with savage efficiency, I could only watch in horror as everything I'd worked so hard for was torn apart before my eyes. \"This is how you died,\" is how the game started I didn't expect these words to ring true so soon..\n\nHeartbroken and defeated, I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of my failure. But in that moment of despair, a spark of determination ignited within me. \"I won't make that mistake again,\" I vowed, steeling myself for the challenges that lay ahead.\n\nAnd with that, I returned to the menu, ready to dive back into the fray (in a new world with a new character of course).

See that little \"Early Access\" tag? It's a lie and an excuse for laziness. No game should be in EA for 11 years, just call it a live service game and quit yanking people. Even Ark fans called BS on the 10-year EA tag.\n\nMaybe the devs would have better luck getting content out \"at a respectable pace\" if they got the fuck off Reddit for a little bit, but hey, who's to know. All I know is I see certain devs alarmingly active on the Reddit assuring people struggling with their game not running that it's definitely user-error and not the fact their 11 year old spaghetti flavored legacy-code is garbage and breaks apart at the seems constantly.\n\nGame is just \"aight\" vanilla but mods are essential to making it more than a walking simulator and the devs know and rely on that.\n\n6/10, I'm gonna play it but I refuse to just ignore shitty behavior from dev teams.

Developed by Indie Stone, this game has been in Early Access for years, but it's a shining example of how a committed indie team can create something truly special.\n\nAt its core, Project Zomboid is about survival. You'll scavenge for supplies, fortify safehouses, interact with other survivors (if you're lucky), and, of course, fight off hordes of zombies. What sets this game apart is its commitment to realism. You'll need to manage hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and mental health, all while dealing with injuries, illnesses, and the ever-present threat of the undead.\n\nThe game's isometric perspective and retro-style graphics might seem simplistic at first glance, but don't be fooled\u2014this is a game with surprising depth. Every decision matters, from choosing where to scavenge to deciding whether to engage in combat or sneak past zombies. The game world is expansive and open-ended, allowing for emergent gameplay experiences that keep you coming back for more.\n\nOne of the standout features of Project Zomboid is its multiplayer mode. Surviving with friends (or strangers) adds a whole new dimension to the experience. Cooperation becomes essential, and the thrill of exploring together or defending a base as a team is unparalleled.\n\nAnother impressive aspect of Project Zomboid is its modding community. The game supports extensive modding, allowing players to customize and expand their gameplay experience in countless ways. This commitment to modding has kept the game fresh and engaging for years, with a dedicated community contributing new content regularly.\n\nWhile Project Zomboid is still technically in Early Access, the level of polish and content is already impressive. The developers continue to release updates and improvements, addressing community feedback and refining the game further.\n\nIn summary, Project Zomboid is a must-play for anyone who loves survival games or the zombie apocalypse genre. It's a game that rewards strategic thinking, careful planning, and adaptability. Whether you're a lone survivor braving the undead alone or part of a group fighting to rebuild society, Project Zomboid offers an immersive and challenging experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end.

undead. Your mission is simple: survive. But don't be fooled by the simplicity \u2013 this game is anything but easy.\n\nWhat sets Project Zomboid apart is its focus on realism. Every decision you make, from scavenging for supplies to fortifying your safehouse, carries weight. With death being permanent for the character you're playing, one wrong move could spell the end.\n\nCrafting is key in this game, allowing you to create weapons and shelters to stay alive. The dynamic weather and day/night cycle keep you on your toes, forcing you to adapt your survival strategies.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect adds depth, whether you're teaming up with friends or competing for resources. While visually minimalist, the game's atmosphere draws you in, immersing you in the struggle to survive.\n\nIn short, Project Zomboid is a challenging and immersive survival experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Whether you're a seasoned survivor or new to the genre, this game promises endless opportunities for exploration and discovery in a world overrun by the undead.", "timestamp_created": 1712651500,

The gameplay and mechanics are well-crafted, featuring a realistic food system, water management, health concerns, and various other elements that immerse you in the game world. Graphics are not the main focus here; it's all about the gameplay.\n\nLet's delve into the gameplay itself: Project Zomboid offers a unique experience. Set in Kentucky, the game starts with your character spawning in one of four towns. You have a wide array of traits, skills, and roles to choose from at the beginning.\n\nOnce spawned, your goal is to survive amidst hordes of zombies, managing resources and dealing with injuries. The concept is classic, but the execution is what stands out. You can engage in activities like cooking, mechanics, and more, adding depth to the gameplay. The game doesn't have a definitive end; it continues indefinitely until your character meets an unfortunate demise due to a mistake.\n\nPros:\n\n-Realistic mechanics that add depth to the gameplay\n-Expansive map with plenty of loot and suitable locations for bases\n-Unique combat system and healing mechanics\n-Features wildlife, including raccoons\n-Advanced AI for zombies\n-Impressive physics engine\n-Every action you take can have consequences for your character's well-being\n-Strong community support with numerous mods available to enhance the experience\n\nCons:\n\n-Losing all skills upon death can be frustrating, especially after investing hours into the game\n-The game is still in development after 11-12 years, which may raise concerns about its -completion\n-Lack of NPC system (although there are mods available)\n-Gameplay can become repetitive after extended play sessions\n-Lack of a clear ending or resolution; some players may desire more closure or progression options\n\nIn conclusion, with only 15 hours of playtime (and approximately 50 hours overall, not counting time on Steam), I believe Project Zomboid is a fantastic game.

Even if you go into sandbox mode and change up settings to make the game way more forgiving- such as by enabling easy cars, halving the zombie population, weakening the zombies, etc. You will still be faced with excruciating challenge. \r\n\r\nHowever, once you get the basics down and understand what you can do and what is possible- the best areas for what- how to approach certain events and otherwise, you will be able to deal with most situations this game throws at you.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty curve is immense, it starts off hard and drops in difficulty as you get better gear, only to ramp back up again when you've got a horde coming at you, or perhaps a helicopter flew by, and now everything in the mile radius is on you. \r\n\r\nThe biggest thing is the unforgiving nature of PZ- you can spend hours upon hours working on a character and getting their skills up only to die and lose all of your progress. (This is tragic)\r\n\r\nDon't let that dissuade you- keep pushing and moving, maybe even reduce the population and weaken the zombies even more. Once you know this games core mechanics, you can choose how difficult you want the game in all totality. \r\n\r\nThis game is realistic- (somewhat)- You've got a whole bunch of things to look out for- whether that'd be your anxiety, hunger, temperature, or sickness- this game will throw everything a zombie apocalypse would have at you- in your mere human flesh. This, truly is, the story of how you die.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER- the biggest problem with this game is middle to late game content. Eventually, you run out of things to do, you can expand and build up your base to whatever size you wish, learn recipes for electrical traps and whatnot- but eventually you will reach a phase in the game where you simply have nothing to worry about- you've got everything you could want in MASS abundance at your base, you've got enough rain collectors and farmland for you to not need to venture off anywhere, you collected every single car in the game, you've developed your base to become as great as it could be- and now your at a standstill of having nothing else to do- the challenge is gone, and this game loses its brutality... Just like real life.\r\n\r\nHowever- I've heard about The Survivors that existed prior to my gameplay, and that will exist hopefully soon after this review- That will add enough middle game content to keep the player well occupied, especially since it is in one way or another, a narrative generator- Somewhat like Rimworld set in the zombie apocalypse. \r\n\r\nHowever, as for late game- I can only wish there was a quest system or even just a SUPER grindy-focused campaign that has an 'end'. It would make the late game just all the more bearable. I also believe there needs to be more incentive to leave base once its developed enough to be self-sustainable, something that isn't renewable and unfarmable, something you HAVE to go out for. Many would say that it'd lie in ammunition for weapons- but you could opt out of long range and go for melee and it'll work just fine enough to keep the zombies away from your base. Sure, we go out every once in a while for a supply run but it is of so little requirement that it just makes the game dry out into a stalemate of a game.\r\n\r\nOverall, a wonderful survival game that lacks a few features to complete the experience. \r\n7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1709589608, "timestamp_updated": 1709589608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159859929": {"recommendationid": "159859929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137097120", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1321, "last_played": 1711073131}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1709579644, "timestamp_updated": 1709579644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159854029": {"recommendationid": "159854029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068847537", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 27605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24731, "last_played": 1711568004}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game if you have the patience to learn the mechanics.

It doesn't matter:\n- If you make the same survivor each time\n- If you use the same spawn point\n- If you think you've got all the game skills you need on lock down\n\nYou can be the most mighty of players and you can still find yourself in hairy situations that keep you in survivor mode. Good luck and bad luck are still gonna getcha.\n\nI wholeheartedly appreciate the work that has gone into the multiplayer process. I'm super excited for animals and npcs in the future (as I've been along with early access for a long time). The graphics can be toned down for weak machines (which I used to have personally) and the workshop is a wild west of potentials if you want to mod up. You can shift difficulties and so many aspects of a sandbox game to make it a chill time or a 27 Days later time.\n\nThe workshop mods I appreciate the most? New towns and places. I love exploring.\nThe pranks I love most as a server host? Changing shambling zombies to sprinters on days no one is expecting it. Your friends will scream when zombies come at them full tilt. Lets call it the \"I guess you guys are too comfortable\" days.\n\nI've played 1046 hours so far at this moment of review and I'm going to keep stacking on those hours ongoing.

(Personal Experience)\n\n-combat\n flows well and their is a decent variety fo strategies to deal with varying zomboid herd sizes. \n\n-base building\nwhile not a mechanic I personally use often I will say it gives you a great objective when trying to fix up a little house or if your building a small compound!\n\n-resource management\nOne of the key aspects of the game that can either be Brain rot easy or insanely hard, It all depends on what you are doing in game!\n\n-moodles\nmoodles are a hit or miss thing for me, after about 20 hours I began playing with a few mods that make my management a bit better and easier to keep up on, however I know several people who play without these mods and are able to play perfectly fine, You do you boo.\n\n-Stats and skills\nSometimes gaining certain skills or stats can be REALLY tedious, but most of the time its actually quite easy to pull off long term. (I personally recommend Firefighter or burgler for new players as they have great starting for both stats and skills)\n\n-The zomboids\nAh, The Zomboid. The coolest part of the game and what makes it a zombie survival game! Zomoid's can range in difficulty depending on what you do in the customization menu but the best way to describe them is this.\n>Walkers\nWalkers are the slowest possible zomboid in the vanilla game and are very similar too walking dead zombies\n>shamblers\nShamblers are slightly stronger and faster then the walkers and are easily underestimated as you may be able to outpace them but they are relentless in that they will follow you for quite some time. \n>Sprinters\nsprinters are by far the \"scariest zomboid\" as they are the strongest zomboid and will quite literally sprint at you the moment you are spotted, even the most seasoned veterans of the game find trouble in handling even one of these things. \n\nProject Zomboid is by far my favorite survival game and with a price point of just 10 dollars and a VERY dedicated development team and fleshed out modding scene you will always find a reason to come back to project zomboid!", "timestamp_created": 1708989285, "timestamp_updated": 1708989285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159353117": {"recommendationid": "159353117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085836296", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 14012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 93, "playtime_at_review": 13651, "last_played": 1713637521}, "language": "english", "review": "Over all a great game\n- Replay-ability cuts out at about 150 hours depending on skill level\n- The workshop is essential to make this game last any longer than 100 Hours\n- Difficulty does not scale, rather it changes the whole dynamic and play-styles", "timestamp_created": 1708986071, "timestamp_updated": 1708986071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159351907": {"recommendationid": "159351907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370877252", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 20889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19059, "last_played": 1712366559}, "language": "english", "review": "As a citizen in the state of Kentucky, this game is literally what it\u2019s like living here.", "timestamp_created": 1708984600, "timestamp_updated": 1708984600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159341893": {"recommendationid": "159341893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198928504904", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2311, "playtime_at_review": 3958, "last_played": 1713384857}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good game, mods are improving it even more.\n\nShotgun goes brrr", "timestamp_created": 1708973351, "timestamp_updated": 1708973351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159338247": {"recommendationid": "159338247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059788915", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3636, "last_played": 1711165495}, "language": "english", "review": "good soup", "timestamp_created": 1708969402, "timestamp_updated": 1708969402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159336414": {"recommendationid": "159336414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064091327", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 25044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 154, "playtime_at_review": 15353, "last_played": 1713018474}, "language": "english", "review": "I have a very interesting beginning relationship with this game.

Cut to Jan. of this year when I thought, maybe I just need to give it more time, bought, downloaded and still hated it, went to refund again, but last minute for some reason I pulled that request and gave it one last try. As you can see from my playtime, I fell in love. tbh this is probably the best game I've ever played, to the extend that if I was to make a game this would probably be it. I've never really been a fan of players saying \"give the game time it gets better\" but I will say with this game, if the controls bother you, or specific aspects feel off, etc, give it time it really does get better and I actually now think the controls are pretty damn good. There is literally nothing IMHO out there like this, its truly a gem and I cant recommend it enough.

I'm also very wary of early access. Project Zomboid broke the mold in both cases.\n\nMost survival games that I've played, even ones with consistent elements of danger, have felt like chore simulators. Project Zomboid's implementation of survival mechanics is something else entirely, however. The slow shamblers of Romero films, which Zomboid's default settings are based on, are the ultimate persistence hunters. Here, the survival aspects enhance this. They aren't just a chore. They're what makes the game worth coming back to.\n\nThe game has an incredible number of customization options, and that's before taking user created mods into consideration. \n\nIt's also incredibly in depth. Let me give you an example:\nMy current character is living out of his car - The back seats are filled with canned food, ammunition for his guns, books on survival basics and more. Last night he pulled into what I thought was a middle of nowhere gas station on the back roads of Kentucky. It was getting late, he needed to refill his water bottles, refuel his car, and maybe find something to eat in the gas station before finding somewhere to get some sleep. There was one or two zombies lurking outside the station, but - no biggie, I figured he'd just quickly pop them with his rifle and be on his way. Shouldn't be too many out there.\n\nIf I'd driven just a little bit further down the road, I'd have seen the larger parking lot of a nearby diner, the street that turned into a tightly packed cul-de-sac. Two shots rang out, the gas station's pumps began to hum to life as he started refueling his car... And a horde lurched around the fence into view. He hopped in his car and sped off, dead limbs catching in the wheel well and nearly grinding them to a halt. One of the headlights went out from the impact, the other had a dead bulb from before he ever found the car. The sun was setting, it was getting dark, and speeding off down the road he slammed into a tree.\n\nThe engine won't turn over now, his wrist is broken - so even if he's a crack shot with a rifle it won't be much use for him. He's got one bottle of water left, and nothing he might need to start repairing his engine. It's going to be a long walk back to town in the morning, a town I know now is swarming with zombies, and just in the hopes of finding some basic supplies alongside, hopefully, a wrench, a book on mechanics, and maybe a vhs tape that will cover the basics of car repair.\n\nThere are other survival games out there. I've tried a lot of them, even if survival games aren't my bag - because I've been looking for the authentic zombie apocalypse experience. None of them come close to the kind of considerations and decision making that come up in Project Zomboid.\nIs it worth 20$? Definitely. Honestly, even in early access I think it's already well worth more.", "timestamp_created": 1707621555, "timestamp_updated": 1707621555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158034784": {"recommendationid": "158034784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801144862", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 2007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2007, "last_played": 1687173686}, "language": "english", "review": "The elites don't want you to know this but the zombies are free you can take them home.

There's a lot built into the game already, with far more variability coming in the future. The game keeps track of your calorie intake as well as your protein intake for keeping track of your weight and your ability to build muscle respectively.\n\nThe game also keeps track of your clothing and the protection and insulation it's providing each part of your character's body. Some clothing is more protective than others. Some clothing is better insulated than others. You can even use a needle and thread to repair holes or add protective patches to your clothing. The protection stat can literally prevent you from being bitten or scratched by zombies when they do land an attack on you, which can lead to infections and death. Even zombification, where your character will continue to roam that world file as a zombie.\n\nInsulation determines how well your clothing traps heat to keep your character warm. In the hotter months, more protection is always good, but can and will lead to you overheating and increasing how much water you need to drink. In the colder/rainier months, you want to bundle up with good insulation and try your best to stay indoors while it's raining/snowing.\n\nRunning around outside during storms, specifically getting really wet on a windy day, can lead to your character catching a cold. This will make you cough and sneeze uncontrollably unless you're carrying a handkerchief. Which merely muffles the sounds when they're made. Coughing/Sneezing will attract zombies nearby.\n\nYou can fully build your own bases all around the map. You can get generators, which run on gasoline, in many garages and other places. Place one OUTSIDE of your base and fuel it up to provide your base with power. You can also build barrels for catching rain, which can be used to provide water to sinks or clothes washers. If you have a washing machine, you'll also need to have electricity running to operate it. You could even throw in a clothes dryer to mostly automate your laundry-cleaning duties.\n\nWith your own base, you could even try farming and planting some of the seeds that you can find scattered around the map in various places. That's assuming you want to settle down and work out of a base. Instead, you can find a nice car/truck/van and try to look inside or around the vehicle for a key. With the right tools and skill level, or the Burglar class selected at character creation, you can hotwire a car and start it that way.\n\nDon't forget that cars still need fuel though. So you should plan on siphoning gas out of any other vehicles in the area just to top up for exploring. Eventually, you're going to want to find one of the several gas stations scattered around the map. Once the electricity goes out, you'll need to place a generator at the gas station to power the gas pumps.\n\nWith a decent vehicle that isn't too damaged, you're ready to start venturing outside of the town you started in. Most of it's wilderness, but there are a lot of other towns and small settlements as well. Your best bet is to pick a road and stick to it until you find something. Don't forget to make use of any maps you find as well. They can often point the way to survivor caches with food and weapons.\n\nI could actually type out several more large paragraphs explaining mechanics I haven't even touched on, but this should be enough to convince anyone who's interested in what the game has to offer. There's plenty more to discover in the game and the next few builds will be expanding on pretty much all of what I've mentioned already. Not to mention adding entirely new things into the game like NPCs with their own A.I. controlling them. They'll be completely overhauling the class systems and making them play more of a part during mid to late game while also adding in a new crafting system revolving around some of those classes.\n\nNeedless to say, the game is amazing and it's only ever improving. If anything I said interested you, definitely give the game a shot.

A single scratch from a zombie might kill you and a single bite certainly will.\n\nOther things that some people might not like:\n* There is no goal other than \"survive\". There is no ending other than death. This is a game about the journey, not the destination.\n* This game is meant to be played with mods. Don't get me wrong, the vanilla experience is still worth it but it's nowhere near of what you can get with a hundred of mods.\n\nIf that did not scare you then just buy it. The game is awesome and easily one of the best that I ever played. It has a huge map (google it now), lots of gameplay mechanics, vehicles, tons of loot, crafting, movable furniture, the list goes on and on. Better yet, the game feels very differently, depending on whether you are playing it solo, in co-op, or on a public server. In single player it is a lonely, depressing experience. You are the only one alive, the civilization is collapsing, howling wind and dead bodies are your only company. The game is the same in multiplayer but if you are not alone, your home base will feel more cozy than ever, very much like a true home.

You get various advantages to choose from, which must be offset by disadvantages, so that your character ends up being thoroughly balanced. The game mechanics itself may seem simple at first, with the process of killing a zombie not requiring much skill, but there is a fair bit of survival instinct that must be employed if you wish to avoid alerting all the zombies in the area and being quickly overwhelmed.\n\nThe survival portion is huge and forces you to stay constantly aware of multiple factors at a time. Breaking into a window can result in broken glass that cuts you, and if that cut goes untreated, can become infected and develop into something much more dangerous. Food can replenish your hunger but stale food can adversely affect your happiness levels. Failing to clean up blood after killing zombies can attract more zombies and result in a horde, and so on.

The game has come leaps and bounds and is easily the best zombie survival sim out there. The detail and thought put into this game is incredible and the fact that it has not been abandoned after so many years proves (to me) that the devs really just want a perfect game on full release. It has public/private multiplayer, split screen, mod support, and they listen to the community fairly well. As slow as it has come along it beats the feeling of grand promise followed by the swift inability to deliver anything and have the devs just abandon the project..\r\n\r\nOn the downsides PZ can feel empty and a bit repetitive after 100+ hours or so, or getting into the late game on a character. If it was not for mods or multiplayer that time could very easily be less in its current state. That being said it really depends on your RP experience/interest and if you are the type who likes to set goals for yourself in a game.

In multiplayer the experience is even better, if you play with people you know, and you group to survive together.\r\nThe modding community is big and very productive, and it's deeply embraced by the developers (in the coming 42 version you'll be able to download and install mods directly from inside the game).\r\n\r\nIf you tried this game and found it too hard, try this: create a new game and just pick the first weapon you can find and start killing zombies. Don't do anything else. Don't fear being bitten or killed. When dead, rinse and repeat. When you're confortable dealing with a small horde (10 to 15 zombies), then you can start a proper game.

expectations.\nIt is highly immersive, has a very real and compelling zombie narrative which can be further improved with mods of course that not only change the way the game can be played but it has a especially given the game a fresh take with the quality of life content it provides.\n\nSecondly it is a super hardcore experience even if sandbox settings are tweaked to be easier, Because of the perma-Death you feel like every action has consequences like in real life.\neven after my 200 plus hours ive still been learning new things/mechanics in the game.\nI have died many times but recently my play styles have changed and id have to say that the base building is satisfying.\nLiterally any item can be placed in the world that is picked up to make bases etc really feel alive and at home for your character.\n\nThirdly Death in the game is only the beginning......For example you can pick up from where you left off as a new character with the draw back being that you lose all skills acquired from your previous character.\nIf you liked to be highly immersed in a Zombie apocalypse then this is the game for you.\nIf you want to hate life and yourself tweak settings in sand box to give the desired out come but with that said i recommend playing the game first in its intended way so you can truly appreciate the progression of your character and most of all yourself as the player.\n\nLastly its like you are the director of a movie and your character is the protagonist thats destined to die, even from over confidents or from becoming to complacent.\ni could go on and on about the pros and cons but as it stands the many pros of this game is overpowering in comparison to the cons so i cant recommend this game enough.\nwith the Multiplayer its another story though, id definitely play with some friends or join the many communities available.\nits the most awful thing to see your best friends or your character whos been alive for over a week if you make it that far die from turning in to the undead then having to either kill or run from them.\n\n (PS) Using the betas sections on the game will give you a bunch of different game versions.If i was you playing on the build 41_78_7 is the way to go, well at least until the build 42 comes out anyway.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1706519757, "timestamp_updated": 1706701361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

You'll eventually die to nonsense even if you're a good player, such as doors on a car not shutting but there is no animation to warn you *shakes fist at sky*.\n\nSo ultimately the game is a test of how long you can be alone. While there is multiplayer, that format has issues which can be just as challenging to get over as the loneliness in single player such as desync (screen will turn black and freeze until things load) and zombie count limitations.\n\nWhen you decide to buy or not buy this game, completely ignore any promises from the developers on what is coming \"soon.\" There is no soon, as they have decided to take as long as they want to develop their game. That is their prerogative, but as a consumer you should be informed on what that means. They have been promising animals and npcs for 10 years. TEN YEARS. The title of the game is \"project\" for a reason and it is never going to leave early access. NEVER. I've lost confidence in the studio's ability to ever be able to overhaul their existing code (imagine working on the same code for over a decade and NOT having it become spaghetti). Just on the basis that every UI in the game is different it should be obvious to everyone they don't have a solid code base.\n\nSo if you want to challenge yourself for a few hundred hours solo or forever in modded multiplayer, know that these have their limitations and there is no update coming from the developers in a realistic time period to address those issues. Play the game for what it is today with its faults, or don't.

"review": "Touted positively by many, but a massive unexpected letdown.\n\nRating: 3/10\n\nI had fairly high hopes for Project Zomboid after hearing nothing but praises from its community; most, if not all of them, mentioned the freedom and uniqueness of gameplay this zombie survival game delivers. However, after trying very hard to get into the game and trying to like it, I discovered it just has too many rough edges that hinder enjoyment.\n\nFirst of all, the balancing of the game is all over the place. Never have I played a zombie game or a zombie survival game where the zombies absolutely annoy the hell out of me. The zombies have a vision range of a NASA telescope and hearing of a mutant X-men. It isn't the kind of enjoyable challenge but more a \"stack all the unbalanced odds against you\" type of frustrating challenge that leaves you wanting to play a better zombie survival experience. The \"combat\" is extremely one-sided and drags out too long.\n\nThe game has multiple issues with bugs and performance problems as well. You'd expect that the developers, after leaving this game in early access for almost a few years now, would have ironed out most of the things and be soon to be released in full. But some segments of the game seem like they were designed in the alpha stages of the game. In addition, the various frame drops in a game that has sprite graphics are simply unacceptable.\n\nThe UI has got to be one of the worst I have ever experienced in a game. Clunky, unintuitive, and counterproductive. Managing inventory, gear, and resources is an absolute chore. The UI is so clunky that you may get lost in it; it takes up the whole screen and has barely any transparency, so you may unknowingly get bitten by a zombie just because the UI is taking up half the screen and blocking your field of view.\n\nOverall, a massive letdown. I have a high tolerance for janky games, but never have I felt I wasted money more on a video game product than Project Zomboid.", "timestamp_created": 1710323602, "timestamp_updated": 1710323602,

This is to the games credit as it has been a long time since a game made me tense. It has a dedicated modding community and the game functions very well. Things to consider: the controls take some getting used to and it highly recommended you start with highlighted targeting as you learn the game. Also, don't get too attached to anything as death is permanent (short of backup saves) and you will be punished for early mistakes. Heavily punished.\r\n\r\nAbout the settings: it is recommended that you lower the zombie count early on and slowly increase the difficulty as you progress. If you start off too hard, the game will be very frustrating. Sometimes it will feel like it's the game's fault, but that's rarely the case. More often the not, the game is working as intended and it was you, the player, who was either too confident or careless. \r\n\r\nGraphically... it's decent. The style works well for the game, but I think it could benefit from a rotating camera. I\r\n\r\nLoot: There's a lot of it. It can be frustrating to deal with the loot since there is such a variety of it and you won't know what the use is until later. Likely after abandoning it in some container you can't remember. \r\n\r\nSolid 8/10. Highly recommended for those who want a \"realistic\" zombie survival simulator.

The mini jumpscares send shivers down my spine because they're so unexpected like peeking down a window whose curtains are open. \n\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2611 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2611 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2611 10", "timestamp_created": 1710911248, "timestamp_updated": 1710911248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160558016": {"recommendationid": "160558016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170424651", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 780, "last_played": 1710474531}, "language": "english", "review": "I only play for like 15 min at a time because my firends play. its really not that fun. a burger takes literally 3002 ingredients to make and im just tryna cook for the homies.

I keep coming back to it and can't play more than 45 min or so at a clip. It's an exercise in tedium. It tries to be ultra realistic which I get but it ends up being a contrived experience and tedious to do things that should be easier.  If I'm standing next to sink and I need to wash bandages why does it use my water bottle?? Now I have to refill my water bottle. That's just one example. \n \nCombat is still terrible. Trying to control the survivor is jank and awkward. How did they not figure this out by now? You bleed so easy when you get hit and you bleed out so fast. Bandages are easy enough to make but you'll be changing them at least once and it's more micromanagement. God forbid you even find bandages. You'll be making them from other objects like clothing.  \n\nHunger? Every fucking 5 min of gameplay my character is hungry and trying to eat anything is a process. Where are the can openers?? Have fun finding one. Meanwhile, in reality every kitchen in the world has at least one but no, not your kitchen. In fact, you own nothing but 6 cans of food (with no can opener??), one tissue, and the clothing on your back. You neighbor? Owns a total of 4 items. Where did everyone's tools go?? Zombies eat tools, most people don't realize that. Shouldn't there be more cars around? Did people leave town or turn into zombies?? You have to choose one or the other. What is the narrative in this game? It's been 10 years of \"early access\". Bro, add some sort of narrative already.  \n\nCarry weight?? With a backpack I get 12.5 pounds. I can carry like 6 cans of food and some clothing. Have fun looting and running back and forth back and forth back and forth. \n\nSkills?? Have fun grinding those out while you die way too easily. What a dumb game balance. \n\nMy last attempt was on the \"Build\" difficulty setting, which was suppose to be relaxed and focused on building and crafting. Well, I started with zero tools, both neighbors had zero tools, and there were no crafting materials other than furniture to be disassembled. I still had to fight a bunch of zombies near my house and on the second day my house had like 7 zombies waiting out back. Keeping in mind I found zero weapons. Can't I rip a leg off a table?

I've lived a thousand lives and felt the touch of death so many times, now I'm only surprised when it doesn't come swiftly.\n\nWhat I've learned is that death isn't failure, no, it's a sweet release.  Make no mistake, I've survived for a long time, built impregnable safehouses with self-sustaining crops, high above where any zombie could reach.  But that is simply a different kind of death, death in the form of boredom, but it is a death all the same.  It makes sense though, doesn't it?  You are the last person on Earth, the world is filled with endless zombies, there is no happy ending to all of this.\n\nBut the point isn't to survive, the point is to create your own tale, make a snapshot of experiences that are memorable.  This game is really just an analogy for life and death, compressed into a few hours at a time, and how you choose to spend your time reflects on your personality.  How will you keep death at bay?  Will you build walls, will you hide, will you run as far away as you can, or will you pick up an axe and try to fight it?

On top of my exhaustion, I'm blinded by the absence of light. But I can't stop now.\n\nI've been walking for almost an entire day - although in my current state, this feels more like an eternity. My weary footsteps echo through the desolate, darkly moonlit roads. My previous safehouse was overwhelmed by a straggling horde the day before. I ran, only with a small bugout bag I could salvage while I drowned in desperation and fear.\n\nFinally, I stumble upon a new city, utterly fatigued, parched, and famished. Lost in the suffocating darkness, I desperately search for refuge, until my bleary eyes catch sight of a looming dark silhouette - a mansion, cloaked by the deepest shadow of the night.\n\nFeeling the walls in the dark, I am blessed with luck. This feels like an utter disrespect to the oppressive darkness around me. I managed to grasp the doorknob on my first attempt - and it is unlocked. Fumbling blindly, I confirm that every entry point on the ground floor remains sealed shut. Denying myself of solace, fearful of prying eyes or ears, I determine that my only sanctuary lies on the mansion's upper floor.\n\nI enter the suite, seeking shelter behind a fortress of barricaded doors and windows - the house's entrance, the bedroom's threshold, and ultimately, the final barrier of the bathroom door. Within those confines, I hope for the slightest reminiscence of peace, a fleeting moment of respite from the encroaching chaos outside. I pray that all these barriers that confine me within are enough for me to wake up from my slumber and muster the remaining of my dwindling vigor, in the chance that my new sanctuary is breached by the looming.\n\nWith every ounce of strength left in my battered, punished body, I hasten towards my coveted sanctuary, yearning for a sip of the last water drops from the city water supply and eating the remains of my canned dog food.\n\nAs I push open the bathroom door, the last portal to my salvation, fate unveils its malevolent mockery against me. I am not the only one who sought refuge within these walls. Another soul had the same idea before, sealing both our fates. Long ago, someone met their demise in this very room. Now, their lifeless corpse stands motionless, a grim sentinel guarding this bathroom. A puppet of chance, devoid of purpose, waiting for an unsuspecting prey - a perfectly set trap, just like a mousetrap anticipates its unwitting mouse.\n\nI swing the door open, a gateway to either salvation or damnation. But in my exhausted state, my famished and sleepless body is unable to react swiftly enough. The reanimated corpse lunges at me, its rotten fangs sinking deep into my jugular.", "timestamp_created": 1640069344, "timestamp_updated": 1683930981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 582, "votes_funny": 160, "weighted_vote_score": "0.969723522663116455", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146999033": {"recommendationid": "146999033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060363374", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 24052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4778, "last_played": 1699160382}, "language": "english", "review": "Yesterday i found a woman dead in a living room next to a bottle of half empty bleach.

87111, "last_played": 1708035493}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, its time for the review. What is Project Zomboid? Is it a mix of Runescape and the Sims with a dash of zombie apocalypse?  Is it Day Z mixed with Stardew Valley where every neighbor is trying to marry their teeth into your jugular? I'm glad to report that its all of these things. With the inclusion of Project Zomboid's most recent Build 41.60 Experimental Multiplayer update, the game has taken the formula, and cranked it up to 11. 11,000. I have spent 1430 hours in Singleplayer, visiting each spot in this massive recreation of KY, learning, dying, and repeating, each time coming closer to the question the devs originally sought to answer, \"Would you survive in a zombie apocalypse?\" The answer turns out to be a resounding no. Every run cut short by careless mistakes, overconfidence, and lack of preparation. This games mechanics run deep, and if you adopt the mindset of \"can I do this in real life?\" You'll begin to do well in KY's abusive apocalypse landscape. Lets look at some of my favorite aspects:\n\n- Sandbox settings.\nYou can alter every facet of the game world, from the day you start on (full 365 days a year to choose from, 4 seasons), the type of zombies and how many of them you want in your nightmare scenario, how much loot spawns, the chance the house you're looting is locked, if it has a house alarm, if it is a special loot house. It's all here and what I mentioned isn't even a fraction of the settings you can change. \n\n-Kentucky.\nThe map in this game is based loosely on the real world locations of various towns and cities of Kentucky. The games map has never felt this complete with 41.60. Louisville has been inserted into the world and boy, is it MASSIVE. Louisville truly feels like endgame content, as my group of 5 fought their way into the exclusion zone in the middle of a thunderstorm, guns blazing and only half of us made it into the center of the city and we lost our supplies to the horde. Every run feels fresh because of the versatility of the map. You can plan, build, farm, craft, camp, fish, forage, cook, become a car mechanic, Rambo your way down Muldraugh's strip, and create your ultimate scenario no matter where you end up. \n\n-Mods\nSpeaking with some mod developers and first hand creating my own mod with the help of the community, I can say that making mods in this game is fairly easy. Not to say that making a complicated mod is easy, and you can see with Autotsars mods, KI5's, iBrRus, Blackbeard, Azakaela and many other creators I haven't mentioned, are a staple to the community and Project Zomboid would not be the same without them. The list of content creators for this game is large and I expect to only increase as this game becomes more popular. Seriously, play this game vanilla, then try out some mods to add to the immersion of the game, you won't regret it.\n\n-MULTIPLAYER\nFinally. The big one. The multiplayer of Project Zomboid is not necessarily new, but it is a new inclusion of build 41.60. If you haven't enrolled in Build 41 already, then we are not playing the same game. The features this build brings far outweigh any reason to play the stable branch anymore. I played 12 hours of MP recently and DAMN. Just DAMN. Our first group of 12 tore through West Point, created a base on the outskirts of town, prepped for a journey to Louisville, and got slaughtered in Valley Station. We raided hardware stores, supermarkets, bookstores, shooting ranges, and car lots. Making the final push to greatness is without a doubt, far more enjoyable with friends. Hell, I never even met my group before we started, but we all became friends by the end of our survival. Most mods work with MP and while PvP and a few desync issues need to be ironed out, the potential Multiplayer brings to the game and its roleplaying implications will be quintessential to the success of itself in the coming years.\n\n-Cons\n+ Here is where I lay out some of the problems I have with the game. But if you have already seen how many hours I've played, you know this list is short enough. The development progress in this game is slow. The team behind it is small, but growing every year. The devs truly care, but they also do not care to release content before they think it is ready. That means waiting months for updates, and often a year for bigger updates. Luckily, the dev team has been transparent about the development with the community and there's a biweekly newsletter that lets everyone know what they're up to. If you want constant updates that bring fresh content to the game every week, this game may not be for you. If you like watching a game bloom from inception and grow into something special, this game is right up your alley. In the meantime, the community has mods for your every whim, so it's never been a huge issue for me. It's modding scene is beginning to rival Skyrim's or Minecraft's. \n\n+ The bugs in this game have been consistent for a while. While every update seems to squash a few dozen, a handful pop up from time to time, including zombies that flip on the ground, lag when driving fast vehicles and audio related bugs, missing or broken textures. Nothing that has ever been game breaking, but unfortunately, were immersion breaking. The devs have trackers and generally respond well to issues the community has, but again, you may have to wait a while until your specific issue may get fixed. \n\n+Vanilla content/Feature creep. When comparing my vanilla games to my modded games, the modded games always are superior. Some mods I can't imagine playing without now. The devs have done a great job setting up the foundation of the game, it now just needs some polish in some areas. Vanilla guns need more variety. The selection is weak and pistols, shotguns, and rifles are all fine in the beginning, but can become a detriment when facing hordes in the late game. The game does not include enough full auto weapons to handle these scenarios efficiently, but mods once again solve this issue. Throwing grenades and molotovs in this game is also absolute trash. These systems haven't been touched in ages, and with more content to soon follow, one wonders if the devs will ever revisit these sections again... Blacksmithing is mentioned in the game files, but has not been implemented yet. Car armor has yet to be implemented as well, and all of these things I'm mentioning ask the question, have the devs extended too far? I guess we will find out.\n\n+Hardware specs. As the game begins to mature and add more features, lower spec machines are being left behind. You may begin to experience lag if you fall below the recommended specs and it doesn't look like that trend will change anytime soon. There are enough options to keep the FPS high, but I feel soon that wont be enough. If you are lower spec, I would try out the free demo in the Steam store to figure out if this game is right for you.\n\nFinal thoughts/ TL:DR:\nIf you didn't read any of that, then you don't need me to convince you. Buy this game. Its 14.99. That's the price of a craft beer 6 pack. This is the best RPG I have EVER played and my most played game time.

I hope it helps with your troubles:\n\n\ud83d\udd38First of all, Zomboid is not about \"grab a gun and kill hordes of zombies\", your ultimate purpose is to survive as long as possible. \n\ud83d\udd38Always use custom sandbox settings, design your Zomboid world however you like. You won't find some game mechanics fun. \n\ud83d\udd38Play sneaky and cowardly. Avoid crowds, and act cautious and quick. Loot everywhere. Don't try to take everything. Try to crouch when moving around instead of running all the time. And please don\u2019t run! Think you are some ninja and everyone tries to kill you. \n\ud83d\udd38If you start to default, you won\u2019t have any problems regarding food and water for at least the first 20 days.\n\ud83d\udd38Start in Rosewood if it is your first game as it should be less crowded and smaller while West Point is the most crowded and largest one. \n\ud83d\udd38Before you level up your related skill, always read the book of that skill first. The books are named beginner (1-2 levels), intermediate (3-4), advanced (5-6), expert (7-8), mastery (9-10).\n\ud83d\udd38How to gain experience for skills:\n\u2013 Carpentry: dismantle wooden furniture, doors, etc with a hammer and a saw. \n\u2013 Electricity: dismantle electronic devices, watches, televisions, etc with a screwdriver. \n\u2013 Metalworking: dismantle metal furniture, metal doors, sinks, etc which requires a propane torch and welder mask. \n\u2013 Mechanic: dismantling car parts that you may find on the roads requires a jack, lug wrench, and wrench. \n\u2013 First Aid: Go to the forest nearby, start to run and hurt yourself, and bandage your injuries (you can craft basic bandages from clothes). The remaining skills are arguably not important to me.\n\ud83d\udd38There are levels that have a chance to become infected IF you have been bitten by a freaking zombie. Scratched has a chance of 7 percent of zombification and laceration has 25 percent. If it says \u201cbitten\u201d in your health status (Q), then you have several days before being another motherfucker (there is no cure).\n\ud83d\udd38Use guns as the last resort. Guns are pretty useless in this game except shotguns. They attract zombies a lot and might trigger a horde. Try to use good melee weapons such as baseball bat, crowbar, axe, hunting knife, machete, and katana.\n\ud83d\udd38Most of the players in Project Zomboid including experienced people die in closed areas. So, be careful when you are in a house, apartments, or a large building.\n\ud83d\udd38There are useful traits that you should have some of them in the character creating menu: fast learner, eagle-eyed, dextrous, keen hearing, organized, and lucky. For bad traits: weak stomach, slow reader (since you can fast-forward), slow healer, smoker (need to find cigarettes), high thirst, fear of blood.\n\ud83d\udd38You can get extra skill points by watching Life and Living channel on TV. Check for the program time for each day in the Zomboid\u2019s wiki. It is very important as it boosts your skills like hell.\n\ud83d\udd38After around 14 days later, there will be no electricity. So you will need a generator and also a \u201cHow to use generators\u201d manual to use the generator correctly. It requires gasoline.

Especially if you liked state of decay and wanted a little more. Also word going around that a story campaign will be put in as well.\n\nWith amazing details like food degradation and injury/ illness/ exposure to cold and heat/ mood debuffs/ weapon durability/ character encumberance/ sound and light attraction of the zombies this game can be a nice challenge on the nice open maps. \nIt isn't an FPS but it plays great and has similar controls to an FPS.\n\nJust remember this is Early Access and there are some bugs and such.

"language": "english", "review": "Alright Ima be absolutely clear, This game is Not for e\u035fv\u035fe\u035fr\u035fy\u035fo\u035fn\u035fe\u035f.\nhave you read that properly? Now lets proceed.\n\nThe game is for a very niche audience, mostly for those who appreciate the little details and very atmospheric tone in an absolutely giant map that would take around a in-game day (Bout an hour) to walk to the next nearest significant town, the loot can be as scarce or abundant as you want should you wish to mess about in the settings, The multiplayer is pretty good but can be awkward or janky/slightly buggy with a server with many mods or high player count, I should also add that bugs are hard to find unless you are really trying hard to find them, personally I haven't found any game breaking bugs and if there are any you'd probably have to go out of your way to find them. \n(I wouldn't trust the cars tho, multiplayer does strange things alright?)\n\nThe game has been in early access for an admittedly longer time most would like and still isn't done yet, but do not let that dissuade you from trying it out as there is many activities and shenanigans you can find yourself in, such as spawning in a house, accidentally pressing Q and find yourself fighting a rather large group of your friendly next door neighbours with a spoon. Or modding the absolute s!&% out of the world and live in an overgrown ruined city with scarce resources and a horrific deadly winter, or just messing around with friends in the detailed zomboid infested state of Kentucky.\n\nI'd like to point out that the game is very friendly to modders, with the workshop filled to the brim with an abundance of fun, stupid \u207d\u1d57\u02b0\u1d49 \u1d48\u1d49\u1da0\u1d49\u1d9c\u1d43\u1d57\u1da6\u207f\u1d4d \u1d50\u1d52\u1d48\u207e and hardcore addons for those who feel the game doesn't have spice for their taste, If the guns are subpar in your opinion, There be a mod for that, if you dont feel the car mechanics are complex enough yep there's a mod for it, the combat feels too clunky for you? then I'd frankly just have to diagnose you with a serious case of skill issue lol, I mean seriously it's just holding right click and hitting the poor zomboid with a crowbar or something of the like.\n\nLet me be absolutely clear, this is not a average \"shoot em all up\" kinda zombie game, its a isometric survival simulator that forces you out of your comfort zone and actually treats its zombies like zombies and gives them the proper respect they're deserve, meaning they are numerous and legitimately dangerous, you will be thrown into sticky situations whether by starvation, bathroom zombie raves you weren't invited to, and the cold and desperate cruelty of winter, with the fun being there is little to no hand holding, you simply exist to exist in this world, with no goals other than making your own tale on how you inevitably died to a blunder you've made in a unfair world, be it a bite you've got from a looting run by a random zomboid or going through a broken window a story up and getting a nearly life ending leg fracture. \n\nThe game tells you \"This is how you died.\" and lives up to that statement, at the end of your tale, you will die, this is simply how the cookie inevitably crumbles, all of your characters time spent alive, your time looting from the remnants of Knox country, your countless near death experiences will fade, either by swiftly being taken by the horde or struggle enduringly to hold on until making a tragic blunder. Then, before you know it you've become a new character, one with an entirely different backstory and traits, searching your old broken down safe house and finding a familiar figure banging on the door, turned into a hollowed out body without a soul in it. \n\nThis is a hard game, you W\u0332i\u0332l\u0332l\u0332 die at every stage of your play through at some point even if you are a veteran at this game, some might find this game flawed but then this game might simply not for you, some may be angry at the unfairness of this game and want to go out action packed guns blazing like all the other average zombie games out there, but I should remind you that the game is only as fair to you as you want it to be, don't be like the people who leave negative reviews if the game simply is too hard or not their type, after all, you have full control over the rules the world abides by, This is the proper sandbox experience after all.\n\n\nedit: why is everyone liking this, it aint even that good.", "timestamp_created": 1688362809, "timestamp_updated": 1690829620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 303, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932266891002655029", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148397935": {"recommendationid": "148397935", "author": {"steamid": "76561199261584931", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 21921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1197, "playtime_at_review": 7919, "last_played": 1713137270}, "language": "english", "review": "- I spawn\n- I loot\n- I run around\n- I find melee weapon\n- I kill zombie\n- I find horde of zombies\n- I kill horde\n- I get bit from behind while looting a house\n- I die\n- I respawn\n - I find gun\n- I go to my old body\n- EmotionalMoment.jpeg\n- Kill him and take his loot\n- Kill everything\n- Come back 2 days later and bury the body\n- Get bit from behind while burying the body\n\nGood game, would cry over a fictional character again 12/10", "timestamp_created": 1697565014, "timestamp_updated": 1697565014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 438, "votes_funny": 134, "weighted_vote_score": "0.930943071842193604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96071852": {"recommendationid": "96071852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131790572", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 29148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7368, "last_played": 1692623526}, "language": "english", "review": "If you get bitten.

You start with a certain amount of points to spend on traits and once they're spent or you don't have enough anymore to get any additional traits, that's it. Well, not exactly. There are also negative traits (smoker, clumsy, asthmatic etc.) that will grant you additional points but they obviously come with a cost. You might make more sound, can't sprint long distances or you'll need to smoke often otherwise your character might become unhappy if you don't.\n\nSeeing that i already mentioned skills, there are quite a lot of them ranging from sprinting, to carpentry , mechanics, trapping, foraging and so on. Each one can be leveled up the more you do that thing - so, sprinting often will slowly increase your sprinting skill, building or disassembling furniture will level your carpentry skill.\nYou can also find books throughout the world that, once read, will help you level up your skills quicker.\nYou can also find other readables that'll help you or give you recipes.\n\nI mentioned happiness of my character, \"What's that about?\" you ask? Well, as with most survival games, you need to manage the needs of your character, shown as little \"moodles\" in-game. Hunger, thirst, health are the most obvious ones but you can also become unhappy, bored, too warm, too cold or you panic, among others.\nThese \"moodles\" can influence your actions, making you slower, decreasing your damage, slow down healing and so on.\nEach \"moodle\" can be countered by certain actions obviously. So, if you're unhappy, you can read stuff that makes you happy, drink (though that can come with it's own downsides) or eat chocolate - just like in real life :D\n\nBut enough of traits, moodles, the bigger threat are the zombies. They're the slow type, but they're relentless and can become a big issue in larger numbers. You can either fight them with melee weapons, find ranged weapons like pistols or rifles or you can try sneaking around and avoid them wherever you can.\nBut you can't do that all the time, and you probably want a safe space, so you can either build one your own, though that's probably not an option right away, or you can break into any of the houses around you and prepare it.\nFirst thing should probably ber to close the curtains, you don't want to be seen by outside zombies, right?\nYou can also board up the doors and windows, which will make it harder for zombies to just break in, cause if they bang too long on a window, it'll break.\nYou found a house with multiple storeys? How about setting up a climbing rope out of a window in the upper storey as a safety exit?\n\nAs you can see, the amount of things you can do in Projekt Zomboid are quite big and at first, it can be intimidating. Especially when you don't know (yet) what to prioritize and where to focus.\nThe game also doesn't tell you what to do, you do have a survival guide that gives you the most basic tipps, but apart from that you're thrown into the world and you're left on your own, which isn't necessarily a negative, it's great to find things out your own, but it can be tough as well - there is a great PZwiki though if you want to look up certain things.\n\nAs you might already have guessed, the game is pretty complex and detailed, but it never feels unfair or illogical. I once smashed a window open to a house that was locked and immediately cut myself. Bleeding, i jumped through the window, cutting myself even worse through the broken window glassleft in the window and also laying on the ground. LEaving a bloodtrail, i frantically searched the house for bandages, took off some sheets from the windows, ripped them apart and  made a makeshift bandage that stopped the bleeding and my health from going down.\nMy noise attracted zombies though, so i fled. Exhausting myself from sprinting, i could barely walk now and was very slow, trying to get into any car i found, though most of them were either locked or out of gas.\nFinally i found one, drove away to a farmhouse that looked like a nice spot for a base, i was so happy i got careless. Rummaging through the house, i opened a door and a zombie jumped me, bit my neck and that was basically my death sentence.\nI killed the zombie, found a shotgun with some ammo and went outside going down with guns blazing.\n\nMy next character certainly lived longer and was more cautious.\nBut it's these things that make the game great, the details, the love and care put into the game these game - it's fantastic. Every item and clothing is showing on your character, it gets dirty, you see if your clothes has holes in them, oyu leave blood trails if you're wounded, you can disassemble a whole car, from windows, to tires, the radio inside, brakes, engine.\nThe music is fantastic too, all the little sound effects are great from hearing all kinds of animals in the wild, to the scuffling zombies all around you, some banging on doors and windows, the little scary sound effects playing when a zombie jumps you or turns up around the corner.\n\nI could probably go on and on about the agme and it's details, gameplay etc. but if you're even remotely interested in zombie-survival games you might want to give this one a chance.\nYeah, it might not have state-of-the-art, shiny 3D graphics and it can be quite tough at times, but that's not to it's detriment. On the contrary, it has charme, fantastic gameplay, lots of details and a love and care put into it that you can almost feel.", "timestamp_created": 1664358767, "timestamp_updated": 1664358767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 307, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.930380344390869141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108638309": {"recommendationid": "108638309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055828895", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 16843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9496, "last_played": 1701809942}, "language": "english", "review": "fell down the 2s floor with a refrigerator and died 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1642966926, "timestamp_updated": 1642966926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 334, "votes_funny": 235, "weighted_vote_score": "0.930184900760650635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98920558": {"recommendationid": "98920558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374396390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 852, "last_played": 1694084276}, "language": "english", "review": "we need 41 online mode", "timestamp_created": 1630991945, "timestamp_updated": 1630991945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 251, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929522395133972168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107654413": {"recommendationid": "107654413", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961371180", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5127, "last_played": 1708197432}, "language": "english", "review": "This story is based on real events that happened in a multiplayer game:\n\nNight 3 and 4 at the mall - I was making great progress in the mall. It started to get quieter and I started to feel safe. Clearing it with that shotgun and ammo that I found was so satisfying. Thought it did nearly get me killed. My shotgun jammed just as I was going to kill a zombie at point blank range. Luckily I could hit the zombie in the face with it and distanced myself again.\n\nWhile I was looting the BBQ store, I found the holy grail that we have been looking for quite some time. It's the magazine that teaches us how to use generators. In my enthusiasm I radioed back home, shouting with joy. \n\nCh\u00e9, Anvi and Peet were chuffed and told me to rest there one more night. Come dawn they were going to head towards me and fetch me  by car.\nI was exhausted but exited to see my friends again so I went back to my tent. I made sure I barricaded the storage room I was camped in and put the shotgun next to my sleeping bag. I actually slept really well since the first time in ages.\n \nThe next day we all were chatting and laughing on the walkietalkies while they were heading to the mall. For the very first time in ages, I really felt alive. Anvi souped up one of the cars making him drive like a speed demon. It was funny but also nerve wrecking to hear him nearly kill himself while swerving out of the away from the zombies while racing the rest of the crew.\n\nWhen they arrived the mood was still joyful. Perhaps I was too optimistic and gave them a false sense of security. We put the magazine and some supplies I gathered in the trunk of the car. We decided to do a quick look before we left. We all to separate parts of the mall trying to find some more valuable loot.\nIt wasn't long before we could hear screaming and shouting coming from the south side of the mall. It was Anvi, he got boxed in on the escalator and was panicking and screaming for helm. I ran there as fast as I could, and readied my shotgun. Just as I walked around the corner I saw that my friend was being mauled and eaten by the undead. I was filled with rage and started to blast them. Perhaps I could still save him.\n\nThe zombies around him were dead, though not much was left of him. I couldn't bare the sight, so I turned around and tried to find the rest of my friends. I heard another groan and looked behind my shoulder. It was Anvi he was shambeling towards me while almost tripping over his own intestines. I couldn't shoot him, even though he turned into a zed.\n\nI started to run to my other friends and saw Ch\u00e9, he saw my grim look and didn't ask any questions. Just as we made eye contact we heard more screams of pain. Before we could react and figure out where he was they stopped. We eventually found his eaten corpse with his duffel bag just behind the counter with the popcorn machine. The zeds were no where to be seen.\n\nWe fled to the car and drove back to our base. We didn't say a word during this ride. I felt terrible and very guilty. It's because of me and my stupid idea of living in the mall, that my friends are gone. I shouldn't have stayed there for so long and shouldn't have said it was safe.\nI'm going to drink that bottle of bourbon I found and hopefully drown my sorrows.\nTomorrow will be another day in this hell infested world and I cannot let it consume me too.", "timestamp_created": 1641720225, "timestamp_updated": 1641720475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 663, "votes_funny": 82, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929345905780792236", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124360092": {"recommendationid": "124360092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195602282", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 91142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 598, "playtime_at_review": 66000, "last_played": 1713734531}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally survived my 2nd day!", "timestamp_created": 1666686659, "timestamp_updated": 1666686659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 356, "votes_funny": 267, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929272890090942383", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104518527": {"recommendationid": "104518527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204465365", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 378237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3035, "playtime_at_review": 289545, "last_played": 1713683687}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent homeless lumberjack simulator.", "timestamp_created": 1638097780, "timestamp_updated": 1638097780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 644, "votes_funny": 264, "weighted_vote_score": "0.927874326705932617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108792289": {"recommendationid": "108792289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198451518293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 4917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1095, "last_played": 1709003290}, "language": "english", "review": "I started off in multiplayer.

There's so much I want to say, that I could write pages and pages on this game.\n\nLet's just start with this: Zombies are popular enemies in games, because they enable lazy developers. You don't need a story, but if you want one you can just rip off any established zombie lore. Your AI can be barebones with zombies that just path to the nearest player and attack once they get into melee. The lack of sophistication isn't a bug, it's a feature, and so what if the path-finding is easily exploited and there's no strategy at all.  They're zombies. They're supposed to be stupid.\n\nThen you just give the player a gun, send wave after wave of zombies at the player and throw your shitty game up on Steam and hope someone buys it for $2.50 because they want trading cards.\n\n[b]This is not one of those games.[/b]\n\nThis is a game that puts monumental amounts of effort into every tiny aspect of the game.  It is the most immersive zombie game I've ever played, and the fact that it accomplishes that in an isometric 3rd person perspective is nothing short of amazing. The way it limits your view to the direction your character is looking is done incredibly well, and it even plays with that system a bit, adjusting the viewing angle depending on your character's traits, health, and the visual conditions.  \n\nThe Zombie AI is great.  It's basic and exploitable by design which offers a ton of opportunities to master it. For example, if you have a horde of zombies on you, you can lead them through a house.  Some will follow you, some will get stuck on furniture, some will lose interest and start bashing windows.  Or perhaps you want to lure them over a low fence to trip them up and slow them down to give you some space to lose them.   Or maybe if you saw the horde coming, so you snuck up to the edge of their vision and let a few spot you to pull them off and take them on in small numbers at a time. \n\nThis leads to a combat system that isn't based around twitch aiming or muscle memory, but rather a decision making based combat system.  Where, when and how you fight matters a lot more than which weapon you have or what your character's stats are.  An obese weakling can kill 100s of zombies under the right circumstances and a god-like character with max stats can die to a single zombie sneaking up behind them.\n\nIt's things like this that really give the game the most authentic zombie experience I've played.  Wading into zombies to try to kill them will just result in you joining them instead.  Using a combination of stealth, distraction, and discretion is the best way to survive.\n\nAdding to the immersion is how in depth each of the games systems are.  Everything from constructing a wall to making a potato salad lands in the sweet zone of being complex enough to be interesting but not so complex as to be overwhelming. \n\nBut the really amazing thing about PZ is how layered the experience is. \n\nAt first, you're just going house to house, killing zombies and raiding pantries for food.  Eventually you master the combat system and positioning. You'll live long enough for your character to experience exhaustion and fatigue and eventually you'll learn to master those systems, too. You'll move onto base building and die to the helicopter the first time it happens. Then you live long enough for water and power to fail. Then you get to the point where all the easy places to loot are looted and you have to decide to try riskier places, or perhaps work on making your own food via farming, foraging, or trapping. Survive that long, and the season will begin to change and with it, new problems. Long term nutrition starts to matter, as even if you are satisfying your character's hunger, they may be losing weight every day and in danger of wasting away. Then winter hits. Survive the winter and you can survive anything.  \n\nNow the sandbox is open to you.  Do you want to max every stat? Build the ultimate base? Master mechanics and build the ultimate zombie killing vehicle? Or perhaps take back your hometown from the undead, no matter how long it takes?  It's up to you.  Just don't get too cocky, because no matter what you've built and how many zombies you've killed, you are always 1 bite away from joining their ranks.\n\nAnd even then, there's more.  Try challenge runs with negative traits, or crank up zombie numbers and infection chances, or even enable sprinters, if you dare. Dive into steam workshop and download mods to change the game or add new content. Go online and survive with friends, or try your hand at a public server and cooperate and compete with other survivors. \n\nThere's always another challenge to take on. \n\nAll in all, Project Zomboid is a superb game, but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out some flaws.  The game is still very much in early access development. There are a few things about it and it's systems that are a bit wonky as a result.  A big criticism is how slow skills level, although in custom sandbox mode you can add an xp multiplier if you want to.  \n\nAlso some skills like carpentry are well fleshed out and feel vital, whereas electronics feels almost forgotten and there's very little reason to advance in it. There aren't any huge bugs I've encountered, but sometimes the interface can be a bit odd.  There's also a lack of polish sometimes, like for example there are no animations for sitting in a chair or sleeping in a bed. \n\nBut all in all, the rest of the game is so fun, so satisfying that it's easy to overlook these things, especially because this is a $15 game by an indy developer, not a $60 +micro-transactions AAA title.", "timestamp_created": 1630491031, "timestamp_updated": 1653442700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 268, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926435232162475586", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128242425": {"recommendationid": "128242425", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092994644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 6745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6435, "last_played": 1695951263}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played 100 hours of this game on saves which never made it past 60 days for the following: \n\n1.

"language": "english", "review": "Played this game multiplayer with two friends for the first time today, I had played a bit of single player, and neither of my friends had played yet. This all took place over the course of a roughly 5 1/2 hour play session;\n\nDawn of the first day: Friend 1\u2019s first character, Jonny Johnson, dies in the time it takes me to make my character.\nI find Friend 2 being chased by a horde, we go to jump a fence but I\u2019m tired and carrying too much to climb it (big fence), so I run through a house and lose the horde before walking all the way around the big fence (this takes about 5 minutes real time), I finally get to the other side and don\u2019t see Friend 2. Apparently she jumped back over the fence to stick with me and is now corned by the same horde I had lost. I go all the way back (another 5 minute walk) and find her hiding in a house, most of zombies had wandered away. Friend 2 had been Scratched by a zombie (7% chance of her turning), Lacerated by a zombie (25% chance of turning) and had a deep wound on her hand from climbing through a broken window. She had removed the glass shard but had no bandages and was bleeding. I bandaged her and we went to meet up with Friend 1, who I had found before Friend 2, and was sitting locked in an upstairs bathroom reading a book while all this was happening. We walked for a full day before finding a house we were gonna call home, but we discovered it didn\u2019t have a medicine cabinet, so we left. (can't live without one)\nShortly after sundown we arrived at a trailer park, where we killed a single zombie inside a trailer and stayed there for the night. Friends 1 and 2 spent all night doing push-ups and squats while I read and cooked us some stir-fry. In the morning we exited the trailer to discover a horde of 15 zombies in the front yard. We ran back inside and climbed out a window on the back of the trailer to lose them. But Friend 2 had dropped most of her stuff to not be overweight while exercising, so we circled around to the front of the trailer and attacked the zombies from behind. We managed to take them all down without any of us getting hurt and retrieved Friend 2\u2019s loot from inside the trailer.\n\nWe had reached the edge of civilization so we headed back north into the suburbs, by noon we had found a safe house to settle in. That night I decide to loot the rest of the neighborhood before it gets dark. Friends 1 and 2 stay at the house. I loot the first house without issue, clearing out the few zombies inside. I approach the second house on the street and open one of the windows. I set off a house alarm. I stand in the front yard to see if any zombies heard the alarm and are coming. After 30 seconds I see 3 round the corner of the fence, I breathe a sigh of relief and begin to fight the zombies. After I take out the first one, a group of 5 more zombies come around the corner, then another 5. I think \u201cThis is more than I can handle, I should lead them away so they don\u2019t corner Friends 1 and 2.\u201d As I run past the zombies, in the direction they came from, I pass the fence to see another 10 to 15 zombies shambling towards the alarm. I get their attention and attempt to lead them into the woods to the north-east. After a few minutes of running in the woods I lose them. I had been attempting to type to Friends 1 and 2 during this time but was unknowingly on proximity text chat. I walk through the woods to the fence behind our house and climb over into our backyard.\n\nThe next day, me and Friend 1 decide to go loot a storage facility we passed on Day 2 but didn\u2019t loot because Friend 2 was in agony from combined injuries and exercise fatigue, and Friend 1 was a bit sore. \nHalf-way to the storage facility, we come across a group of 6 zombies, only double what I had cleared on my own the previous day, and far less than what we had taken out as a group, so we engage. Only one of the zombies agro onto me and the other 5 go for Friend 1. He gets overwhelmed and hit 3 times by the zombies. I had knocked the one I was fighting to the ground so I shift my attention to helping Friend 1. I pull 2 of them off him and get them to go after me, but I back up into the first zombie and get hit from behind. We then take out the zombies without any further injuries. I perform a medical check on Friend 1 and see he\u2019s hemorrhaging blood from a Laceration on his throat. I bandage his 3 Lacerations before he bleeds out. I then perform a check on myself and discover that the one and only injury I have sustained; is a Bite (100% chance of zombification). \n\nKnowing I have no hope for survival, I soldier on to the storage facility, hoping to at least find some useful supplies for my group before I inevitably die, while Friend 1 turns around to return home.\nI arrive at the storage facility, at the edge of the parking lot is a group of about 8 zombies, they spot me, I run past and book it to the first storage unit and attempt to open the door. It\u2019s locked. I go to the second. Locked. The third. Locked as well. I try the door of every unit on the outside of the building, but they\u2019re all locked. By this point I had attracted the attention of several other zombies, and probably had 20 or more trailing behind me. I try the front door of the building, hoping that the storage units on the inside would be open. The door is locked. I circle the building and find another door. It\u2019s also locked. I spot on the other side of the small parking lot; an office. Surely this will have something of value. I open the window and climb in. The only containers in the office are two filing cabinets with nothing in them, a trash can with a garbage bag and a cockroach, and a mini-fridge. I open the fridge and inside I find only 2 items; a Ham, and some Lard. I climb out the back window with these spoils tucked safely away in a duffel bag I picked off one of the zombies. \nI run all the way home and share what I found with Friends 1 and 2. I leave all the items I found on the floor and set off into the woods in search of the zombies I had led out there. I step on a stick and cut open the bottom of my bare foot. I find the horde wandering through the thicket and stomp two of them to death with my bare, bleeding, disgusting, dirt-covered foot. I\u2019m quickly overcome by the horde and consumed, after racking up a total of 70 zombie kills in my short, short life, I die. \n\nAnd that's the story of my first life in the game's Multiplayer.\n\nWe continued playing after this but nothing else of interest happened, apart from 2 occasions:\nOn my way back to the group, I found a pair of zombies, shambling along the side of a small, gravel road. I took them out with a frying pan I had found in my spawn house. \nNothing seemed out of the ordinary about this encounter; until I looted the corpses...\nOne of the corpses had nothing on them but several books, a pen, a keychain, and the clothes on their back.\nA name on the keychain identified this poor lost soul; \nJonny Johnson.\nAfter I made it back to the group, I returned the keychain to Friend 1, so he would always have something to remember dear Jonny by.\n\nUpon my return I discovered that Friend 1 had taken my duffel bag from the floor of my bedroom where I left it, and then, as if without a second thought as to the value of it's contents, discarded it upon the floor of the dining room. I rescued the Ham and Lard and transported them safely to the fridge.\n\nIn conclusion; this game is a lot of fun singleplayer, and easily worth the $20 asking price, (although in my case it was bought for me by Friend 2). But if you have friends willing to play it with you, this game is truly magical, and no other game in it's class can compare to level of drama and storytelling it provides.\n\nI hope this review has encouraged you to buy this game, or at least, brought you some entertainment.\n\nThank you for coming to my ZEDtalk", "timestamp_created": 1655633822, "timestamp_updated": 1655633822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 589, "votes_funny": 80, "weighted_vote_score": "0.918413400650024414", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142347055": {"recommendationid": "142347055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198884322562", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3971, "last_played": 1711552754}, "language": "english", "review": "how to live a good life\nstep 1 grow up and earn money\nstep 2 buy project zomboid\nstep 3 die in project zomboid\nstep 4 buy your friend project zomboid\nstep 5 never get tired of project zomboid.", "timestamp_created": 1689705733, "timestamp_updated": 1689705733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 330, "votes_funny": 65, "weighted_vote_score": "0.917533576488494873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12123912": {"recommendationid": "12123912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041034349", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 214592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 940, "playtime_at_review": 73272, "last_played": 1713773881}, "language": "english", "review": "OK, review time. \n\nWould I recommend this game? Absolutely. It's one hell of a fun game that just keeps getting better with each new build. It's not perfect, there are still a few rough edges, but the Devs are busting their butts to get everything working properly. The gameplay is surprisingly addicting, sometimes I look at the clock and wonder where the last 4 hours went, but looking at my fort shows me where they went.\n\nThere are some great elements of the game still being worked on (NPC's, Map Expansion) that will certainly alter the current games play style. No longer will we be \"limited\" to just raiding Muldraugh, West Point, or the \"New(ish)\" Mall area/recent expansion......which to be perfectly honest is quite a bit of looting to begin with. It honestly necessitates a new Safehouse/Fortress for each area as carrying all the stuff you find between forts would be kind of pointless...as the current map is that big....(map link) http://pzmap.crash-override.net/ and the planned additions of Louisville, Fort Knox and whatever lies in between them will make this a HUGE map.\n\nMy play style is a little Kamikaze(ish), i love to get a Nailed Baseball Bat or an Axe and take on a horde or two, just swinging away till either the zombies are dead, my weapon breaks, or i have to run and get bandaged up.....maybe have my character drink some bleach if the zombies made me bleed. Consequently, i rarely have a character last much beyond a month in the game. But that's the fun of the game, it lulls you into thinking that you are \"Too Good\" for the mere zombies to hurt....until they get you surrounded and you remember that you swore to yourself last time, that you would not let that happen again.\n\nBut don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself and see how well you do. Just remember the words on the screen at the beginning of the game \"This is how you died\"\n\nEDIT on November 30, 2014\n\nAs i write this we have just had a recent hotfix of Build 30, which brought in a Medical Overhaul. I have fallen out of windows and broken feet and legs, requiring me to bandage and splint the injuries then just wait for it to heal. I have cut my hands climbing in thru broken windows, had to get some tweezers and pry out the lodged glass before bandaging, possibly having to stitch the wound. Been scratched and bitten by zombies, requiring me to disinfect, stitch/bandage the wound and hope i did not get infected.\n\nOf course, before i can do any of this, i had to locate the needed medical equipment at various locations on the map. With the new overhaul, it's even possible to bleed out from a bad wound if i cannot locate some band aids, bandages, or even some sheets or clothing to rip up for use as a low grade bandage. One nice thing is the ability to clean a bandage for reuse.\n\nI swear, every new build the Devs come up with just continues to draw you in and add more game immersion, and they have plans to \"adjust\" the game to make it harder for you to survive a lengthy amount of time. \n\nThe MP has continued to improve, with more and more Game Server companies starting to add PZ to their inventory.  And i just realized i did not mention some of the other new things in the latest Build (30.3) We have more Sandbox options available when starting a new game, including adjusting how often Zombies respawn, whether or not you want random loot respawn and it's frequency.\n\nOH yeah, the incredible Erosion mod has been integrated into the base game which literally is Mother Nature taking over the map...vines growing up buildings, cracks in pavement, trees losing their leaves as fall approaches then regrowing as spring comes, bushes and trees growing in places where we Humans would remove them, SNOW, and so much more that i just cannot think of right now.\n\nOK, I don't want this to be a 10,000 word review so i'll stop here. but as before, if you would like to see some gameplay there are plenty of videos on youtube. Or, check on Twitch  and catch a live stream. Either way, I hope you enjoy what you see and you too join the Zomboid community.\n\nEDIT #2...8-22-19\nstill playing, still enjoying most of it. damn zombies \ncars are a reality now, and yes you can indeed rally a 2 door sports car at about 120MPH head on into a tree to smash a zombie....but yer gonna die too. the map has continued to expand, adding a military community as well as a new town alongside the river. more water has been added, aiding in survival for towns away from the river with farming and fishing. hunting is due \"soon\", along with an incredible animation update they are busting their asses to get working.\n\nthe MP community has grown drastically, with multiple long term servers available for those who want to die in front of others (lol). did we mention mods? check out the Steam Workshop, the community has gone nuts in there. ALL KINDS OF MODS....with more to come. it ain't gonna be stopping anytime soon.\n\nnow, the Devs have mentioned to likely increase in price as the game nears V1.0\nand all the goodies have been added....with more to come. so jump in now, while its still just $15. \n\nWARNING: you may regret it as you watch the zombies munch on a favorite character that made that One Fatal Mistake. but load a new character, and avenge their death!\n\n\nEDIT 3 8-24-21\n\nI'm still here, still playing and  STILL dying. currently we have a hold on MP as the Devs work to get that madness, and the associated follow up glitches that are part of a Devs Nightmares all figured out. the TIS  team has grown quite a bit, as they brought in one of the Community Mod Map makers to help, some new people from General Arcade have been doing great MP work, and i know there are more who i can't name.  we have a improvement on the games sounds coming soon....and other things i cannot remember\n\nsince the last edit, the community has gone WILD with the incredible mods, maps and other goodies. hell, we have Boats now. (i don't think you can get seasick and puke over the side) we have Louisville on the horizon as an in game map addition. there are already several new things on the map they just kinda slip in, which is a mini Easter Egg of sorts, i'd say.\n\nas i said before, plenty of people stream this game if you want to check it out.  in truth, it has been growing like crazy at Twittch.. back with Edit 4 after Build 41 drops, and MP is active again.\n\nGood Luck, you'll need it\n\n3-27-24\nI'm still here. still playing, still dying.\n\nit's funny to read this, it's like a timeline of when new stuff got added in.\ncurrently, we're waiting for Build 42 to drop. animals will be interesting when they get added. their have been doghouses and pet accessories in the loot for a while as a type of preview i guess. one thing they have stated as a Definite No in the Vanilla game for years, no zombified animals. which i like. i don't want to be forced to kill my ingame Best Friend because he got bit/scratched. i'm sure the modders will take care of that, if you want that decision .\n\nsince i last edited, Louisville was added to the map as well as several smaller additions throughout the map. and i tell ya, there a re some awesome safehouses to be found up there, many with the river in the back yard and a good fence already built\n\nanyway, back to the horde. come join me/us", "timestamp_created": 1410913355, "timestamp_updated": 1711601988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 229, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.916060149669647217", "comment_count": 33, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156079758": {"recommendationid": "156079758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198886393678", "num_games_owned": 637, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 27766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26510, "last_played": 1709412191}, "language": "english", "review": "encountered my first character that i created, now its literally me vs myself", "timestamp_created": 1705381958, "timestamp_updated": 1705381958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 228, "votes_funny": 38, "weighted_vote_score": "0.915596663951873779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112296182": {"recommendationid": "112296182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072187638", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 7894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2505, "last_played": 1691263174}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2611 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

Zombies are a real threat here; the smallest scratch can be fatal. \nDespite the graphics and the camera style (which personally I love), there have been some situations that have had my heart racing and my hair left standing up. The smallest event can have great consequences if incorrectly handled. \n\nDon\u2019t like your slow, one-bite-kill zombies? Customise them the way you like in the sandbox mode! Live in the zombie apocalypse you want, with the world rules you want! Don\u2019t like that the water and electricity shut off after a few weeks? Change it!

Unlike other zombie survival games, guns are more of a hindrance than something actually useful. A well-prepared survivor, with a good handle on all of their moodles alongside a stockpile of ammunition, can surely eliminate entire hordes. However, an unprepared survivor with a revolver and a handful of bullets will soon find themselves chased by the entire town, with hundreds of infected chasing down the player. Surviving is difficult in a world where nowhere is safe. Sometimes it's better to walk away than to try to face a group of zombies that comes banging on your door. \n\nThe character progression is amazing. Starting out obese causes your character to be unable to climb tall fences, or scratch themselves badly when hopping over smaller ones. Starting out underweight makes your melee damage feel like you're poking someone with a squeaky toy hammer instead of a metal one. Surviving long enough to improve all your skills makes you feel unstoppable, until a zombie sneaks behind you and you get that one fatal bite that ruins everything.\n\nWhile there is no story aspect to the game, the world itself alongside the details within every house and building, supplemented by the annotated maps, tells a beautiful and horrible story of how the world went down. When you get the chance, listen in on the emergency radios or news television, or travel through one of the busier highways: you'll see hundreds of infected wandering on a highway that seemingly is empty and without any vehicles, until you find an endless roadblock of wrecked cars and a few more infected lingering about. The visual storytelling behind just that Sunday drive really makes us feel like we are a part of this apocalypse.\n\nThe sound design is just wow. There's only a handful of soundtracks in the game, but every single one of them goes hard. The atmosphere feels thick, especially as a newer player, as zombies would bang on every window and door around you. The sound of every weapon feels substantial, along with that sweet watermelon-squashing sound of an infected finally dying. The high-pitched jumpscare sound that follows up with the heightened heartbeat of the character causing panic of the same caliber for the player. Even the calmer moments in the game, listening to the mumbling of a television or radio broadcast, while turning through pages on an educational book, and shoveling graves to throw the hundred or so corpses outside of your newly-established base, establishes this sense that you are really a part of this world.\n\nAlso, there are A LOT of amazing community-made mods which enhances your experience in the game.

He was never to be seen or heard from again, we could only fear the worst. \n\nThen soon two others in our group drove down a wrong road, they got surrounded by a horde and only one of them made it out alive. He made his way back to us, with a fever slowly starting to shut down his body.\nBefore we could continue on, he collapsed infront of us, he screamed about a zombie eating him, but there was none. The fever was taking him, we could do nothing but watch.\n\nSoon, it was only me and the other remaining survivor, and the RV full of our countless supplies. We couldn't give up here. However, the bandage around my stump of an arm was becoming infected, so I had no choice but to change the bandage. I managed to change it just in the nick of time before bleeding out. [i]But then[/i], as I felt things go dark.. I realized, that in the chaos of everything unfolding, the stress and the anxiety and the pain of losing an arm, I had forgotten to eat or drink. Panicked, I opened my bag.. it was empty of food or water. The food and water was all in the RV. Before I could get up and move towards it, I fell down to the ground. It was too late, it was the end of the road for me.\n\n(And then my character turned into a zombie and inevitably, the last surviving group member died.)\nAlso, now that I think about it, I could've

"playtime_at_review": 17417, "last_played": 1713792863}, "language": "english", "review": "Project Zomboid is the best zombie survival game there is, it's that simple. Okay, maybe not quite that simple, as this may or may not be true based on your expectations of what a \"zombie survival game\" should be. Should it be realistic? Should it just let you mow down hordes of zombies in a cathartic killing spree? Should it be difficult? How many RPG elements should be in it? Let's try to narrow down exactly what Project Zomboid offers and if it could indeed fit your idea of the \"best\" zombie game.\n\nTo understand what Project Zomboid is, it could be worthwhile to single out what it isn't. It isn't an \"easy\" game. It is neither easy to play for the first time nor does it compare well to other zombie survival games. The isometric perspective and the somewhat unintuitive controls cause Project Zomboid to be quite a daunting experience in a first playthrough. A lot of trial and error and, consequently, a lot of dying is absolutely a part of the gameplay experience. Indeed, each run in Project Zomboid starts with the phrase \"This is how you died...\", hinting at the fact that it is very much expected that your character will eventually get overwhelmed by the many dangers of a post-apocalyptic land filled with the flesh-eating abominations that once lived there peacefully. Project Zomboid is very much a simulation of what surviving such a hostile environment entails. You will need to forage for food, catch rain with pots and pans and learn practical skills such as carpentry, metalworking or fishing. Most importantly, however, is that you need to be very careful and deliberate with your each and every move. Zombies are quite plentiful and new hordes will always form, especially in urban areas rich in supplies. Killing a single zombie is almost laughably easy. Killing two or three can be a little more challenging, especially if you do not have a weapon. Any more than that, and you will seriously need to consider the risk versus reward factor. Is it worth completely exhausting your character, killing 30 or so zombies by hand, just so you can loot a tiny corner store in relative peace? Should you use the shotgun you found in a police station to clear out a particular area, or will the noise just attract more freaks to your location? Should you just push through a horde with your car, or will that damage the engine too much? Is your new safe house really safe, or is it right between where a large horde is and where it's going next? These questions constantly keep you on your toes and if you do get overwhelmed, it is often the end. Each scratch delivered by an infected may infect you as well, which is a certain game over. If you get bit, that's a guaranteed infection. An interesting meta aspect of the game is that you can keep playing in your current world even after your character dies - As a brand new character. This means that you can take advantage of anything you built with your previous character and any supplies they've hoarded can be yours for the taking as well. You can even go to where you died to find your character, now likely part of the shambling hordes themselves, to reclaim any important gear they had on them such as car keys or a military backpack.\n\nThe above experience is strictly based on the vanilla settings of Project Zomboid. It is worth noting that you can customise these to your heart's content when starting a new world. Fewer or more zombies? No problem. Zombies that sprint after you instead of slowly shuffling? Also possible. Finite zombie hordes that do not repopulate after you kill them? It's all in the settings so you can make the game as easy or as hard as you'd like. Add to that the phenomenal selection of community-created mods available through the Workshop and you get to decide exactly how your world should look and feel. You can add tons of content to the game, new guns, new cars, entirely new towns that fit seamlessly into the game world, or you can change some core mechanics to more suit your playstyle. You don't like that an RNG infection will just always kill you? There's a mod that gives you a chance to survive an infection with proper care. Or maybe you'd instead like to roleplay as a brave scientist looking for a cure? Also a mod for that. I myself put together a collection of mods intended to enhance the vanilla playstyle with more content without drastically changing the game, you can find [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/recommended/108600/]the full guide and collection here[/url].\n\nAdmittedly, Project Zomboid may not be for everyone. No matter how much you tweak the settings, the game will always reward a slow and methodical playstyle, as well as a drive to learn more about its mechanics, how zombies can be manipulated, how your character's moods work and how you can best improve any particular skill. If you do enjoy all of this, the game is a compelling storytelling engine that will give you a different experience everytime you start a new game. Surviving for over a year of ingame time and building up a somewhat self-sustaining safe hub on an abandoned farm can be quite rewarding, as is hoarding guns and ammo to eventually take out and go on an all-out rampage in town with. You have to set your own goals, the game only gives you one: Survive for as long as you can.\n\nAfter what feels like an eternity, Project Zomboid is still in Early Access. This is often a bad sign, but in this case, it shows that the game is still under active development. Every major patch promises huge changes to the game and plenty of content. Currently, the developers are working on AI controlled animals to hunt and domesticate, which in the long run may open up the possibilities for AI survivors to interact with and/or fight. Currently, you are the only survivor in singleplayer, with the endless undead being your only company. However, this could change very soon. Similarly, the developers listened to the community who have expressed a desire for being able to play a character for a very long time. This means more ways to live off the land, more primitive crafting skills that help you create tools that may never get manufactured in a factory again. Maybe find ways to generate electricity long after the power plants have shut down and all the gas pumps have run out of fuel. All these features will eventually be added.\n\nAnother huge feature is the multiplayer. You could team up with some friends to improve your odds of surviving, or you could find a server with different factions and actually fight others for control of valuable areas. While PvP is currently not the most balanced experience, the possibilities of roleplay servers are endless. This will again depend on your personal preferences, as it turns Project Zomboid into a very different game.\n\nI will stick to what I stated in the introduction: Project Zomboid is the best zombie survival game IF you like the genre, want a customisable but overall difficult and realistic simulation type game and are a fan of a healthy dose of RPG elements. Also, there is a bit of a time commitment that is needed when you first get into the game. It's easy to try it out, die because you didn't know how to vault a window and then never play it again. If you do give it a chance though, it may well be one of the most unique games you'll ever play and the future is looking bright for this title with its huge fanbase, active modding community and the dedicated dev team that's constantly working on new, exciting features for this labour of love.", "timestamp_created": 1680965763, "timestamp_updated": 1704137439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 205,
