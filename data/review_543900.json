The twist of this game's story is highly predictable, and most of the missions are fetch quests with some defense sprinkled in. This just isn't a Metal Gear game.

I get it. But I think much of the harsh criticisms come from subverted expectations as the first new 'Metal Gear' title following the fall out with Kojima/Konami with biases and passions high. (I WAS ONE OF THEM - I SLEPT ON THIS GAME FOR YEARS LISTENING TO THE BAD RECEPTION) However, this game is really not bad. It's just not the game people wanted. If this game was added as a DLC feature/part of MGSV Online, I think it's reception would be completely different. \n\nThe beginning will challenge you, only a little, as you learn to manage the controls and survival mechanics of thirst and hunger. After a couple hours in you won't even be thinking about it. Daily log-in reward bonuses always offer clean water and rations among other items. It's damn near impossible to run out of food/water resources. There's also daily and weekly challenges yielding extra resource rewards. (Don't be afraid to drink dirty water to manage thirst) You'll find containers that unlock recipes for cooking and crafting. You'll get to craft a wide variety of weapons and equipment. You also get to build, customise, and defend your base camp as the game progresses. It is a joy to return to the Fox Engine with all of the recycled assets of MGSV. \n\nYes, the story is silly. (I'm not finished it yet) But the gameplay makes up for it. This game has growing pains if you're used to MGSV, but it will grow on you. Especially if you have friends. Fending off waves of zombies is hella fun together. As you aim for S ranks you get insanely good rewards and recipes you get to take back with you to your single player campaign. Keep progressing Single Player, and as you grow, return to Co-op modes to put your progress to the test for further rewards.\n\nThe Co-op staging area is so cool I can't even. You can see everyone's load-out plastered on a huge wall in the background so you can help one another optimise what you need to handle zombie waves. There's a firing range where you can spawn targets, you can spawn all of the crafting benches/cooking for mission prep. You can shoot each other for fun too. unlimited hunger/thirst and ammo in the staging area so you don't have to worry about that.\n\nI'm really enjoying my time with Survive. Honestly, far more than I thought I would be.

What is the point of having a game that [b]REQUIRES[/b] online connectivity, yet doesn't give us a functional way of playing online with others? I know several people have complained about it, yet as a developer, you refuse to do anything about it.\n\nThere is so much more to this game that needs to be fixed and added before I even consider this as worthy to recommend to someone. Half of the time low end resources have no real use once you have better equipment, there is no way of converting and making additional materials like firing units, sensor units, etc. When it comes to the actual campaign space, it feels empty.\n\nTL;DR Version to the community.\nWhile I found it enjoyable at first, the severe lack of content and lack of a functional match finder makes it difficult to recommend. While yes, I wouldn't consider this a real Metal Gear game, if branded as something else it wouldn't have been viewed so terribly.\n\nTL;DR Version to Konami.\nAdd reasonable amount of content to the game, fix the bugs involving multi-player.

There is some helpful advice on how to \"fix\" this by changing stuff outside the game but I wonder why it works perfectly fine in any other game and MGSV.\n\nThis game does not go well with my monitor's refresh rate - I get screen tearing so bad, it like I'd have sandpaper as contact lenses - activating vsync gives a high delay\n\nThe story feels such a directionless mess, cringy as hell and it already has plotholes in the first minutes alone. Dialogue goes nowhere and gets interrupted by something completely unrelated just to have the story somehow proceed. Voiceactors sound unmotivated, they throw in some buzzwords to make it somehow interresting but sadly it just doesn't work for me, it feels poorly written and underdeveloped.\n\n\nThe combat is... meh - whenever I take that metal pipe and try to hit an enemy, my main character throws out 2 stiff animations in sequence that never change - this does not feel right, this feels like an early ARMA mod, the Machette does not feel any better, you unlock some combos later but they don't change the dynamics much. I had some other weapons later on such as a machette and a pistol but the stick was the most efficent way to tackle the creatures (and most unspectacular)\n\nThe building defense mechanisms on the fly during missions is a neat idea, it feels badly implement. You spawn a fence, zombies get stuck on it, you poke them with a stick until they are all dead and repeat the process with the next zombie waves.\n\nThe survival aspect is not very enjoyable. I went around and killed a herd of sheep and 2 rats - I ate 3 sheep steaks and my character is already hungry after what? 3 Minutes? You are also forced to drink dirty water until a certain chapter is unlocked - sadly until then, your character will be constantly vomit and this will drag on and on - while I do like this approach on having an unforgiving survival experience, it feels a bit tedious and on the nose, especially since later on the problem just disappears and you won't have to deal with dirty water anymore.\n\nA curious bug I have encountered was, that movement refused to work after a menu interaction for no reason - happened two times after I exited a tutorial menu. I was unable to move anymore with my right analogue stick. I first thought my controler was fucked but NOPE, it works perfectly fine in the menu and on the map.\n\n\nOverall, I am not feeling it. I dipped 3 hours into the game and I feel like nothing will change to the better or worse. I saw videos of amazing cutscenes from the game with massive boss battles but the overall gameplay does not chance. I would have given the game a better chance if it had a fully implemented 4-player coop as it was advertised back in 2016, but sadly, coop is just one gamemode restricted to one activity.", "timestamp_created": 1519510508, "timestamp_updated": 1520083244, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2020, "votes_funny": 192, "weighted_vote_score": "0.891357243061065674", "comment_count": 70, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40394708": {"recommendationid": "40394708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003998994", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1086, "last_played": 1519509752}, "language": "english", "review": "I came into this game with an open mind, hoping that it would end up being a case similar to Metal Gear Rising, a Metal Gear spinoff that everyone thought was going to suck but ended up turning out great.\n\nThis ended up not being the case\n\nAs a gamer and a consumer I am willing to forgive certain practices if it means I can get a quality product, I was willing to tolerate the microtransactions, I was willing to tolerate the grindy and tedious gameplay, I was willing to forgive a story that isn't amazing like every other Metal Gear Solid game.\n\nBut one thing I CANNOT tolerate, is this kind of always-online DRM.\n\nNow, when I say \"Always-Online\" I mean if you lose connection for even a second in the middle of a mission in single player, it boots you back to the main menu.

Rather than unlockable mechanics that keep the player busy, you can pay to unlock features of the game that completely eliminate the core aspects of playing a survival game.\n\nLet me first start out this review by saying that if you are a fan of Metal Gear, this is your Indiana Jones IV moment. Do not enter here. You will have all the wrong expectations and will ultimately leave angry, disappointed, and in general, feeling sorry for your wallet.\n\nAt the time of writing, I had 135 hours into the game. I've seen nearly every scrap of content the game has to offer, and all I want to do is play through the main story one more time. But, I can't do that. I either have to set up a new steam account and then share my copy of the game with that steam account to do that, or I need to pony up $10 to buy a new saveslot just to play the game a second time. Big ol' negative point #1: This game wants to charge you for everything:\n\n$10 for a new save slot (You can buy up to 4 more)\n\n$10 per save slot for a new away team that hunts down resources for you in real time (You get 1 free, the other 4 have to be paid for.)\n\nSo just to max out one character, Konami thinks it is appropriate to ask $80 of the consumer. To have two characters, The cost is $50.\n\nThere are a total of almost $300 in purchases available before you even get into the cosmetics and pay to win boosts. It's just gross.\n\nYeah, I hear you. I don't have to buy them. But you know what I would like? A game where there's something to do. Where there are small, consequential rewards gated behind little challenges sprinkled around the map, where you can unlock things depending on how much time you devote to the game. You know, little mechanics and missions? Things you can actually do with the game rather than your credit card? Yeah, that'd be fucking great, Konami. Why don't we try that business model. You know, not making such an obvious cashgrab that the game's population is dead in less than a month and it takes 30 minutes to queue for a multiplayer match because LESS THAN 2000 PEOPLE GLOBALLY ARE PLAYING YOUR GAME.\n\nOh, and we haven't even gotten to the actual gameplay. Let's not forget that there are pay to win boosts that double the rate that everything in the game is harvested, but there's no actual in-game mechanic that boosts harvesting. You know, like every other survival game ever. Instead, if you want more resources, you either have to cough up about $1 a day, or about $20 a month to double the rate at which you earn resources. But wait, you could just dump hundreds of hours into the game grinding resources just so you could participate in multiplayer without getting yelled at for not bringing 300 ammo to kill a boss that you don't have to kill to complete the mission. One which doesn't give you anything for killing it and wastes 10 minutes of your time in an unfun, completely pointless boss fight.\n\nThe first 30 hours are wonderful. Survival isn't easy, getting wounded is hellishly detrimental, even just sleeping for a few hours can really screw you while you are working out how to secure regular food. The only problem? This will vary for every player, because recipes are distributed in random crates that repop every single day. The first time you pop the crate, you get the recipe. If you happen to miss a crate, or don't pick up a specific vegetable in a specific place during the storyline, you are completely missing a valubale structure or blueprint that can mean the difference between loving and hating the game. Gone are the days where strategy dictates how well a player progresses, and now are the days where just wandering around hoping to spot a container in PS1-era fog zones that limit your visibility to about forty feet at best. All the while, you are running out of oxygen and need to constantly teleport back and forth between home base and the wilderness to refill it.\n\nYeah, so the game definitely tries to push you forward. It's structured in such a way that you are deeply uncomfortable exploring as you go, and the pacing is all set up to keep pushing you forward in the story rather than making sure you are set up at home base to actually be able to survive and develop technology that will help you with the story. So the whole thing just feels like a trainwreck of ideas that don't work.\n\nAnd then at some point toward the end of the story, you figure out that you don't actually have to fight anything except during specific parts of a mission where you need to protect specific locations from the enemy. You can literally outrun all but one enemy in the game at a leisurely jog. The enemies don't path properly, they kind of flow toward obstacles and dumbly swing at them, and the whole engine being engineered for a stealth/gun game having this slow, melee-focused affair where enemies don't communicate and cooperate to take you out just doesn't really work.\n\nThe single player campaign, the only enjoyable part loses its title of being truly enjoyable because it's fundamentally not challenging.\n\nBut wait, you want to defend the game for the single player just being a tutorial for multiplayer? Multiplayer sucks. Seriously. If you are playing with a group of people you like and know, it sucks less. But let's gloss over the fact that the playerbase lacks the ability to understand basic mechanics, objectives, and simple concepts like: If you are kiting a giant boss that can one-shot all of your defenses in one giant swing, DON'T BRING IT TOWARD THE SPAWN. And let's also gloss over the fact that multiplayer varies from annoying to nonexistent due to the lack of playerbase. And let's also gloss over the fact that half of the time that multiplayer fails to function because inexplicably, one player's connection will drop and the whole lobby can't recover properly, or the lobby will freeze while handing out the rewards, invalidating your reward but still managing to eat all the ammo and materials you used while trying to get said reward. Let's also ignore the fact that the game freezes on loading screens a huge percentage of the time.\n\nMultiplayer is dull and repetitive. It's the recipes/blueprints you really want. But you don't really know exactly what you want, because you don't get to purchase/prioritize rewards. They are just given to you in a random sequence and you have to work with what drops. Even then, the key problem with multiplayer is just the fact that it's gated behind single player. You basically need to be level 25-30 (about 30 hours of gameplay) just to start the easy missions.\n\nEven then, by the time you've finished the single player campaign and gotten high enough level to be of any help whatsoever in multiplayer, the rewards you are getting are tuned for characters around level 5-15. But Hard missions can vary from skull-numbingly easy to infurating (not for difficulty) due to the skill of the randoms you get hooked up with, sometimes you have to bite the barrel and really go overboard on how many resources you use during the course of a mission in order to complete it. This can lead to spirals where you are running out of a resource that isn't rare, but is inexplicably nowhere to be found in the world, like aluminum or lead. How do you fix this? Single player. Go to single player and teleport to bases and loot them. If it's not hard or engaging, why are you making me do it?\n\nIt's just not fun. Konami's arrogance and greed really showed through on this one. You can't take a survival game and p2w it so that survival isn't hard. And you can't take all the mechanics out of a game, slap a price tag on the rewards for playing the game, and have a game be fun.\n\nWorst game of 2018.

REAL MONEY. Most Free games are less brazen.

After the Mother Base attack (end of MGS ground zero) some wormhole portal opened into another dimension. When that happened... Actually I dont know. The entire story is a mess, despite the monotonous amount of exposition the game drones on about in its opening hour. Theres quite a lot going on, all at once, and it isnt written well so there are plot holes galore. As IGN diligently pointed out, Mother Base from MGSV didnt even exist at that point, it wasnt until an entire decade later in the universes timeline that it was built. That one went right over the heads of Konamis writers apparently.\n\nThe zombies are a source of energy, called Kuban energy. Yes thats right, zombies can be harvested for an energy that can fuel many things. This can eventually replace fuels like gasoline to power vehicles and machines. Cringe worthy... Who the hell even thinks of this drivel?\n\nThe script is very hokey, and also poorly written. Voice acting is uninspired and emotionally wooden. The cast of charcters are all forgettable and wholey uninteresting. Im only about 7 hours in, but so far everything has been very mediocre,  despite quite a lot being put into its opening segment.\n\nThe gameplay is clunky and lacks fluidity. Combat is rather dull due to the generic zombie enemies, which have absolutely broken AI. They are not challenging at all, are stupidly predictable. I guess thats to be expected from zombies, but the execution is poor. Sometimes they wont even notice you despite being right in front of them, even attacking them. The lack of enemy types is also a drag. Youll almost always be going against \"wanderers\" the generic zombie type, and since they are boring as heck to fight, combat is NOT a highlight of survive.\n\nThere are a few different weapon types, all of which are bland. There are one handed weapons like crowbars/machetes, two handed spears and bats, and projectile weapons. The melee weapons feel weak and are annoying to use. Poor hitboxes and long windup animations turn simple things into annoyances, hunting sheep for food turns into whack a mole as you struggle to chase it, attack, wait for the long windup, only for it to run just out of reach. There are no combos, attack strings last TWO hits, which makes the combat even more  bland.\n\nClearly Konami recycled the entire MGSV gameplay/graphics engine for Survive. This is noticeable in EVERY facet of the game. Recycled character models, menus, textures, weapons, animations, wildlife, sound effects... Everything, even down to the most minute and petty things like the loading icon or foliage and rock models. Its essentially an overhaul mod of MGSV. The world map is Afghanistan but with the terrain shuffled and sandstorms 24/7. But piggybacking on the accomplishments of MGSV should have worked, since it was such an incredible game. Using it as a foundation, this should have been pretty decent, but its not.\n\nEdit: Ok so Ive found two different areas that are suspiciously similar to areas in MGSV, I mean like identical. A mission where your to use a wormhole digger to mine something called Iris... The buildings in the area are straight copy paste from the MGSV outpost where you have to kill/capture a spetnaz officer, one of the early game missions. Its literally the exact same buildings, same layout and even some furniture in the SAME areas like the bar in the back of the room and the couch next to it. I found another area near there that was the outpost from MGSV mission angel with broken wings where you rescue Malak. The big building where he is being held when the mission first starts, is once again a complete copy paste into Survive.\n\nEdit: Ive noticed slowly that the entire world map, is Afghanistan from MGSV. I dont mean its like it, I  mean it IS is. The entire terrain map is identical, only differences is the placement of additional buildings. Its incredible, now I see why they added the \"dust\" which obscures your view. Without the 24/7 sandstorm youd be able to notice instantly its the same map.\n\nAlso into the story you rescue a black child.. ITS THE SAME EXACT KID FROM MGSV! They not only reused the body model, but even the face model, they didnt even alter any facial characteristics to hide this. Its the same damn kid. It really is mind blowing, seeing the extent to which they copy pasted, its unprecedented. The saddest part is despite Konami having all the tools, assets, and engine of an amazing game to build off of, they still cant make something worth a damn\n\nGun play is even worse than melee. The aiming and weapons in general are inept and clunky. This is very peculiar considering how much they reused from the previous MG game, youd think they would have stuck to what worked in it, but they did not. \n\nTheres a level up/progression system which is a great addition. It gives more meaning and purpose to playing. But sadly the actual progression of levelling up is mired by boring perks and abilities. Most of them are useful, like being able to finish off a zombie on the ground by stomping it.  But those are all zombie game cliches, none are interesting or change the gameplay in meaningful ways.\n\nThere is also a building system you can use, to place things like fences or sandbag towers, while your out exploring. Its kind of cool to be able to place a fence in a choke point to hold off a mob of zombies, and poke them through the holes walking dead style. There are teleport/fast travel points you can capture in the world to make travelling easier, and when activating them for the first time, they require you to hold the point against zombies. This is one of the moments that makes the game fun, as you get to strategically place objects and hold out against a small horde until the countdown stops. Sadly these events are few and far between, and short lived.\n\nBetween the fun moments there is a quagmire of tedious grinding, bland gameplay, and lack of purpose. Exploration is always interrupted by the incessant need for micromanagement, of hunger thirst and oxygen level if your in certain areas. Food and water are extremely scarce and those needs control everything in the game.\n\nYour character is a total hog, you need to kill and eat FOUR SHEEP just to fill your hunger meter, and drink four to five HUGE jugs of water. Its excessive, way too demanding since these resources are so scarce. I found myself interrupted time and time again from exploring because I had to fix my insatiable appetite. Its overly intrusive and a big downer.\n\nWater is the hardest to come by. Dont get me wrong, your surrounded by springs and ponds, and will find tons of bottles to fill it with. But it will be considered \"dirty\" and drinking it will cause illness, which is basically an irritating mechanic of making you stop every 5 seconds for a 3 second long vomit animation. Even more of a nuisance is that they decided to lock the ability to boil water until you progress 5-7 hours into the story.\n\n Its an absurd design choice. You need SO much water constantly, and Ive only found 4 bottles of clean water the entire time ive been playing. For the last few hours in game Ive been forced to drink dirty water to avoid death, so Ive been dealing with nonstop vomit interruptions. Its beyond infuriating. Its a survival game I know, but the way these aspects are implemented is poor.\n\nMicrotransactions are not as bad as I was led to believe. There are no advertisements, no enticements or bait. I cant remember a single time the game has even mentioned them. The only reason Im even aware of their existence is from news articles. They can be found in the start menu, and there really isnt much there in the way of offerings. I only saw one thing, some kind of subscription to get a boost to resources gained, or something like that. This game surprisingly handles microtransactions well.\n\n4.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1519271609, "timestamp_updated": 1519387810, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1345, "votes_funny": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.789469778537750244", "comment_count": 84, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143936178": {"recommendationid": "143936178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269330623", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 4538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2755, "last_played": 1705857189}, "language": "english", "review": "Take the campaign out and \"metal gear\" out of the title and you a have decent game", "timestamp_created": 1691794621, "timestamp_updated": 1691794621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780185878276824951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74531077": {"recommendationid": "74531077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041476571", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 7491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 421, "last_played": 1599627655}, "language": "english", "review": "You have to play online in the single player mode.

Is it better than the bad rap it's gotten? Certainly.\nIs it still bad? Probably.\nThe game has two major flaws:\n1. It is very obviously unfinished.\n- The single player mode has The Multiplayer Tutorials shoehorned in at random.\n- The multiplayer mode has a mind blowing total of 5 maps, two modes, and no players. And the maps are all either copy pasted from MGS5, or areas of the single player game.\n- The balancing is completely bonkers, and as such - appears not to have been play tested. While most of the game can be beaten with little more than one of the early bows and arrows, the game has random spikes in difficulty.\ne.g. I spent far too long on an early mission because you get mobbed by around 100 enemies which can only reasonably be defeated by running them over with a car?? One of the most difficult missions is about half way through the game, and for absolutely no discernible reason is a 15 minute long siege which is effectively failed at the 13th minute when 3 mini bosses spawn and must be killed within seconds before they damage lock the player. This follows one of the game's easiest mission which involves killing 3 stumbling zombies.\n- Despite having all of MGSV to pull from, the variety of weapons and customisation is near non-existent.\n- No AI players for multiplayer mode.\n- Some of the items and UI are broken e.g. because one of the base roles is not unlocked until after the end of the game- the explorer training manual uses the wrong manuals.\n- Several item paths are clearly intended to have a large number of options, but instead only have 2 or 3.\n- There is an entire \"Development Team\" base function who don't research (nothing to research) and instead just grant access to some pathetic post-game minor armour upgrades.\n- There is a base expansion mechanic which only goes to level 2.\n- There are mechanics for multiple bases. Again, there are instead only 2.\n- The exploration mode is very broken and unfinished. Every mission beyond the most basic takes at least 1 real world day. And also yields little of use. Regardless of difficulty, the damage the team sustains is always a percentage, not an absolute. e.g. a mission requiring 11 power will still cost my team with an initial power of 6000... 300. Each mission has a table of possible rewards, with the probability of each reward. But every probability is 100%.\n- The fulton and Air Tank mechanics are clearly designed to be incremental, but are instead limited to either you have it or you don't. Again, the research mechanic was designed in, but never implemented.\n- Main characters who are right there never join you in battle. e.g. I had a base with 15 people who vanished when I was being attacked from all 4 sides at once and their houses being blown up. But despite appearing fighting in cutscenes were not there?\n- The medical function is headed by a professional nurse who doesn't heal the team. Instead the player has to come in and manually heal the characters.\n- The exploration team very specifically and mechanically can't explore? This is despite it being a plot point that they exist to help explore!\n- Placed items despawn at random. e.g. there is an oxygen recharge station which can be placed. It is intended to be to allow the played to extend travelling distance, by placing a waystation. Instead it strands the player by allowing them to travel further in one direction, then it despawns when it's out of eyesight, leaving the player suffocating trying to find it on the return journey. During defence missions, sometimes items just start despawning while preparing a defence. \n\n2. Shoehorned in P2W & Microtransactions\n- Much of both the single player and multiplayer have been intentionally nerfed with pointless microtransactions.\n-- This goes as far as a microtransaction (and I wish I was kidding) to unlock multiple save files. They charge $10 for each save slot.\n-- And a further $10 for each exploration team beyond the first. Fortunately, the exploration mode is unfinished too.\n-- Each exploration takes between 1 and 6 days (or $5-30 of microtransactions)\n-- Every exploration mission except the most basic has \"Projected losses\" of 100%... unless you pay an additional $10 for the \"Support Defender\". Yes, they are running a protection racket in-game. Apparently my S rank party of 4 armed with 2 sniper rifles, the best armour in the game, and enough medicine to make them a mobile hospital - all of them will come back dead or dying while hunting for gerbils. Something I can do myself with a 30s walk from base.\n-- There is a single player mission that is real-time locked to take at least 2 real world days unless you pay $4\n- For the absurd price of $24 a month, you can pay to straight up make the multiplayer mode easier.\n- The single player game feels like a vehicle for getting people to play the multiplayer.\n-- This is incredibly unsubtle, as by the end of the game, you realise the story mode isn't actually over, and instead it explains that in order to actually finish the story, you have to play the multiplayer mode.\n- The base defence for no apparent reason has a full real world day cool down between stages (or pay $2)\n\nBut it's not all bad. If you can if you can ignore that the game is unfinished and wants to milk you for money at every opportunity despite being priced as a premium game, there is a decent game underneath it all. It doesn't have the depth of  main series MGS games, but it's still got an engaging and interesting story, and there is always a feeling of impending peril as you try to balance base building to keep the base stocked.\nThe game feels and plays like a rough draft of Death Stranding, where the player is looking after a bunch of needy survivors, and having to balance personal resources in order to do it; and do so in a pretty landscape but with peril around every corner.\nAnd unlike most of Kojima's games, the player is not limited to playing as a burly bloke.\n\nIf you can get the game for a few dollars, it's worth a go. But it isn't worth much more than a few. But if you already have MGSV and Death Stranding, you can get the same experience by loading them both up on two screens and randomly switching between the two.", "timestamp_created": 1664064835, "timestamp_updated": 1664064835, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758054077625274658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120360920": {"recommendationid": "120360920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041114429", "num_games_owned": 657, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4228, "last_played": 1665487225}, "language": "english", "review": "Terrible Metal Gear game.\nPretty fun survival game.", "timestamp_created": 1660085702, "timestamp_updated": 1660085702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.755553305149078369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107493312": {"recommendationid": "107493312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011433474", "num_games_owned": 3991, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1630032434}, "language": "english", "review": "no", "timestamp_created": 1641524086, "timestamp_updated": 1641524086, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753806829452514648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40619298": {"recommendationid": "40619298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079528527", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 495, "last_played": 1520904638}, "language": "english", "review": "putting aside the $10 save slot thing\n\nthe game is very mediocre\nthe hunger and thirst meters go down way too fast and the tutorial doesnt even help where you need help. \n\nit only takes like 3 hits to kill you so even the smallest mistakes can severely punish the player\n\nthey changed the buttons from phantom pain (the interact button used to be E, now it is SPACE for some reason), and it really throws me off. in fact, i was trying to interact with a container, and i accidentally threw a molotov on the ground (the new E button is for items like molotovs and lure) and eventually burned myself to death, making me walk all the way back from base camp because there are no checkpoints. speaking of the checkpoint system,\n\nthe checkpoint system is really awful. ill be out exploring for like 5-10 min and i will have to walk all the way back from the base camp and all of the stuff i got will be gone. it feels like its really just there to waste time and with the already obnoxious stamina meter it makes it a challenge to motivate myself to go back to where i was and not quit in rage from losing all my new loot. i know it is supposed to be a survival game, so its supposed to be like that, but there is typically a fine line between frustrating and difficult in the genre, and metal gear survive is on the frustrating side.\n\nyou have to be online to play the single player. my internet tends to go down about once a day for 5 minutes and losing all my progress on a mission is incredibly frustrating. at least in phantom pain if you lose internet it keeps you in the game and you only lose your online resources (which don't really matter all that much) until you reconnect to the servers\n\nnot even 2 hours into the game and i can already feel the repetitive combat with the stick but i have to applaud the feel of melee combat because its not half bad and its actual new animation. i also enjoy the new weapons that arent guns (bows, machetes, etc) they actually feel pretty nice to handle\n\nthe story is really bad so traditional metal gear fans have no reason to check this out if they care about the main series lore. it is worth mentioning, however, that there are some pretty cool references to phantom pain here and there that make it nice and its the best way that they could have done it\n\ni dont want to hate this game but konami has made the gameplay mechanics annoying \n\nthe game takes place after ground zeroes and before phantom pain yet they used the diamond dogs mother base from phantom pain???

EDIT: it turns out that you can use flag markers to mark where you are going in the dust. that makes it a bit better. please disregard my incompetence.\n\nim sorry, but all the people who say \"guys this game is good ur just hating cuz there is no kojima!!!\" , please explain to me how walking around endlessly and having no fucking clue where the fuck you are going with depleting survival meters is fun. how dreadful.\n\nbefore people criticize for my relatively low amount of hours, you should know that i physically cant play anymore of this. it hurts to play, and it makes me want to go back to phantom pain. i have seen some say that the game gets better after around 10 hours, but with the amount of negative reviews from people who have like 30-60 hours, that seems to be not entirely true.", "timestamp_created": 1520382612, "timestamp_updated": 1520901136, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 178, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.752985358238220215", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42425897": {"recommendationid": "42425897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078499427", "num_games_owned": 731, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1519935042}, "language": "english", "review": "As a long time fan of the series, when this abomination was first announced I was very heartbroken.

Like, they made this just to make fun of you. I want to believe this, because such a massive brain drain, brain eclipse cannot be real. I'm okay with making fun of me, but not okay with being this stupid.\n\nSo, i am playing this game, and enjoying it obviously, for like 70 hours. I was all okay with all the downsides of it, this whole gameplay loop, mechanics, lack of skill tree and all the other things. Because nonetheless it is simply fun, if you are looking for a game to play while listening or watching something at the background. Base defense parts are enjoying, its story is followable and good. Yes, maybe it has some downsides. But i had fun with them too. I like games which the only point is progression. Like upgrading base, leveling up your character etc. Which is all you do in this game. Its okay to me. \n\nAnyway... Now i am so furious, because i just finished it. And... And guess what I saw? The game has a lot of different contents like more weapons, more equipments that you can put on the base, etc. AND the more important is, THERE ARE FOUR OTHER CLASSES TOO WHICH YOU CAN UPGRADE AND USE THEIR SKILLS! AND THEY SEEM SO FUN TO USE! ''Tripler shot with bow'', ''backstab and gain health'', ''be invisible'', ''hammer throw'' and much more... \n\nWHY? WHY? Why didn't you let me use those while i am playing through the game and instead you put them at the END of the game?? I am now able to use  them, but i already FINISHED THE GAME! I was okay to lack of the skills, like i said. BUT THEY DID MORE SKILLS ACTUALLY, BUT PUT THEM AT THE END OF THE GAME LIKE HELLL\n\nTHEY MADE A GAME WHICH STARTS AFTER YOU FINISH THE GAME. BECAUSE BEING 3000 IQ GAME DESIGNER REQUIRES THIS, YES?\n\n[b]Edit :[/b]\n[b]Of course you can see this as a ''replay value''. But i can not see like that. Bonus content or ''reward for finishing the game'' content should be ''bonus''. It should not contain %70 of the actual game. Resident Evil games for example. They too have rewards for the end game. But they are not like, ''You can only use a knife and one weapon but if you finish the game, a shotgun, an automatic rifle and much more will be unlocked.'' (Which wouldn't be too bad evet if they did this. Because they are not this grindy and hours sponge. They are relatively short and lineer games.) Yes you can unlock cool weapons in the end but the base game also contains a very satisfying amount of content. The bonus should be bonus. It should exist only for those who love the game and want much more. In this game, it is not like that imo. Base game is pretty boring, comparing to ''bonuses'' and it has not enough content.[/b]\n\nEdit 2 : \nJust because the old Metal Gear Solid games also like this before, i dont have to like or accept it yo.

In this spin-off players impersonate \"The Captain\", one of the survivors of a mysterious incident that transported them into a parallel dimension. Toxic air, harsh climate and dangerous monsters make this alien world extremely dangerous to humans: that's why the Captain along with an AI called Virgil and other survivors, has to find a way to go back in their reality.\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 [b]The Good Side[/b]\n[list]\n\n[*][b]It just works![/b]\nMGSU manages to jam together mechanics belonging to around a dozen different genres and somehow make the whole thing work quite well. From survival-crafting to stealth, passing through base / resource management, tower defense and third person shooter, Survive creates a unique gameplay style thanks to bold design decisions that mostly work out well. The fact new gameplay aspects, enemies and whole mechanics get added as the campaign progresses (and even after), prevents the title from getting stale, as there is always something new to look forward to and experiment with.\n\n[*][b]Defenders of a broken land[/b]\nThe game focuses much on the defense aspect at all times through both the solo campaign and co-op missions. MGSU delivers a freeform building style where players can place crafted barriers, stationary weapons, traps and more anywhere in the map to create a stronghold against the oncoming waves. Enemy variety during these phases is not great, but it compensates by making each Special enemy unique in behavior and purpose. Be it in solo or with others, building and defending a custom fortress with the hard-earned materials always feels satisfying and plays out well.\n\n[*][b]Never saw THAT before[/b]\nSurvive is a boon for completionists and collectors. Legendary weapons, rare animals, secret blueprints, tons of hidden cosmetics, secret bosses - all this and more is out there in the wastelands, waiting to be found. Both during the campaign, in the post-endgame and also co-op, there is always something new and exciting popping up between exotic weapons, new enemies and secondary missions. Global events lasting a certain period of time (MMO-style) also feature unique bosses, rewards and modifiers when they happen, adding more variety.\n[/list]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2353870683\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 [b]The Bad Side[/b]\n[list]\n\n[*][b]Always online? Always stupid.[/b]\nMGSU requires an active internet connection, even when playing in solo. Any slight disturbance to the net may trigger an error that immediately kicks players to the main menu, with possible progress loss. This is a stupid design decision that will surely penalize many players, as not everyone might happen to have a connection (or a stable one) at all times.\n\n[*][b]I can't believe it's not a mobile game![/b]\nOne of MGSU's biggest flaws is found in the quite annoying micro-transaction amount. Want additional character slots (which can give certain advantages)? Pay up. Want to have more than one Expedition Team to send in special missions? Pay up. Want to avoid waiting 20+ hours between base defense waves? Pay up. This kind of mechanics might be okay in a free-to-play game, but have no place in a 40\u20ac title on PC.\n\n[*][b]I know that I know nothing[/b]\nThis game has the very bad habit of not explaining at all, or poorly, a lot of otherwise essential / important mechanics or nuances that would make any player's lives infinitely better after knowing them. One thing is making a learning process, which is good by all means - another is completely failing to explain how many things work. Unite this factor with a very fiddly, unintuitive interface design and there is a recipe for annoyance.\n[/list]\n\n[quote]Liked this review, and want to see more of the same quality?

After that the co-op and post-endgame contents come into play, which take more than 50-60 hours: in total there are 100+ hours of content. For the price of 40\u20ac I would suggest buying full price only if you have someone to play with, otherwise wait for a discount since a large chunk of content is co-op related.[/i]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2358209484\n\n[h1]In-Depth Breakdown[/h1]\n\ud83c\udfae [b]Gameplay Analysis[/b]\nGameplay is divided into Exploration, Base Management, Defense Missions and Combat\n\n[b]Exploration[/b]\nIs performed on foot or with vehicles which however degrade over time and are rare. Later on, teleports become available to fast-travel. Navigation is provided by a map, which however doesn't indicate player position while in the Mist, a noxious gas permeating most of the world that reduces visibility and limits oxygen. Each area has many secret containers and supply caches to find, each can be marked with Stickers to remember the location, as they will respawn after some time. Animals, plants and of course enemies are also present across all maps, presenting different dangers.\n\n[b]Base Management[/b]\nConsists in providing food, water and supplies to the Captain's crew. At first this is a difficult manual process, but later support facilities like purifiers or farms are unlocked. Players also need to manage six different teams,h eac with its own purpose, by assigning crew members to them depending on their attitude. Each team's rank increases with better members, and gives out bonuses. Defending the base also becomes necessary in some circumstances, and each of its four sides has a Defense Rating to boost by building specific structures such as guns or barriers.\n\n[b]Defense Missions[/b]\nHave a Digger to defend as main objective usually and to do this the Captain, alone in the campaign or in Co-Op online, will have to build defenses such as fences, barricades, mortars, traps and more to fend off the incoming waves of monsters. Defenses can be destroyed, the Captain can of course be killed, and each monster deals generally high damage until late game. Enemy paths are usually indicated in tower-defense style, and there is some time between each wave to repair and prepare. Always having what one needs is key to victory.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nPlays out in third-person style, with some weapons able to ADS. The shooting and feeling of guns is good enough, however there is more emphasis on melee combat and special related moves such as each weapon category having unique movesets, special CQC counter-attacks and throws, while also context-based attacks like backstabs or stomps on downed foes.

Call it a tentative recommendation.\n\nI picked this up on sale. I wasn't expecting much. But it's not a bad game. The ugly backstory behind the game's creation will overshadow the game itself. However, ignoring all that - I've played much worse games than this.\n\nBut let's establish what this game is, at its core: A budget title. It shouldn't be - Konami should be a big publisher, Metal Gear should be a big franchise, the budget should've been expansive. But everyone knows what's happened at Konami, and so the result is that everything about Survive shows the limits of how far they could go. \n\nFor example, there are only a few cutscenes, which are notable for lack of dialogue. Actual dialogue takes place with still images and slideshows - clearly, they didn't have the budget to really do full motion-capture cinematics. (I have the unresearched hunch that originally, they were planning full cinematics, as the still images are from the ingame engine - but I think at some point, they must've had to cut that). \n\nHowever, within those limitations - there are core mechanics and core gameplay loops here which are all actually very well-balanced. The combat is challenging, so even lower-level enemies pose challenge, but skillful play lets you triumph. Melee dominates; ranged weapons exist, but ammo management makes their usage strategic. Stealth isn't necessarily required, but it will definitely save you time, energy, and resources by letting you avoid enemies.\n\nThe strategic layer is the exploration. You have a big blank map and you have to uncover it all yourself. You have to explore to obtain resources, find weapons, and locate new areas. The oxygen mechanic makes you weigh the time you're spending out in the \"dust\" versus the energy it takes to refill. Again, it's all well-balanced - resources are just plentiful enough that you can find what you need, but not so plentiful that exploration is no longer needed. And that ties into the combat loop quite well. Exploring the dust truly does feel like you're launching an expedition into the dangerous and unknown, and you have to weigh the benefits of your decisions out in the dust. \n\nEven the story is pretty decent. Again, the limitations are evident - no intricate subplots or character stories. And the main plot was limited to only what could be told via still images of people's heads over a slideshow. But the plot is decent enough - government conspiracy intrigue, with a few decent twists that I didn't see coming.\n\nMy gut instinct is that the team that made Survive consisted of whatever competent game designers still remained at Konami after the purge. And they had enough talent to construct a decent, well-balanced gameplay experience with a decent enough story that had enough originality.\n\nWhich makes it more of a shame, because it's wasted here. As I said, it's a budget title, and the budgetary constraints are obvious. \n\nBiggest negative: the visuals are extremely underwhelming. The Fox Engine is a great engine, and the assets they re-use from MGSV look good - but they clearly didn't have much of a team to create new art assets. There are only a few enemy types who suffice you for the full game. (There are other boss monsters that exist in co-op and post-credits play only - which I would guess are casualties of budget cuts. I am certain the original plan was to incorporate these boss monsters into the main story mode, but they ran out of money or time, so they only exist in modes where they don't have to be explained). The environment looks very much the same everywhere - barren desert wasteland with a heavy gray fog. Later on, you open up an area which is somewhat forested wasteland with a heavy gray fog - which made for a very mild change. I guess it's tough to get much more extravagant than that if you're not allowed to create new assets. So it's all very, very dull to look at. \n\nThere's an attempt at a RPG skill-building tree, but it's very limited. It unlocks melee abilities, which do incorporate into the main combat loop pretty well - but they're pretty much limited to things that they wouldn't have had to create extensive new animation or coding for.\n\nThe ending to the game is ... decent, but it doesn't give you much closure. There's a limit to how much of a denouement you can create when you're not allowed to use cutscenes or hire more than a handful of voice actors. Then it dumps you into sandbox mode - which unlocks extra bosses, new base buildings, new mission types - which I really feel should've been incorporated into the main campaign, but again, they just ran out of time or money or both.\n\nKojima fans are righteously angry at this game's very existence - and I can't really blame them, but their ire is misplaced. I think this game is actually just another casualty of the tragic decisions made by Konami. There's clearly talent and originality here among this team of devs, but they were on an extremely tight leash for this game and they'll be doing nothing but creating pachinko machines for Konami from now on. \n\nDisclosure - I'm not a Kojima fan. I've enjoyed some of his games, I thought MGSV was really, really good - but I also thought MGS2 was disappointing and that MGS4 was a massive load of dog turds with all the worst tendencies of Hideo Kojima's design and writing (god, his writing) on display. (MGSV, by comparison was all the best tendencies of Kojima's design on display. ) So I didn't quite feel the same deep profound sense of betrayal at Kojima's firing and Survive's creation that all the fanboys did. \n\nOn its own merits, I think Survive is a decent enough game, and I might recommend it to a gamer who enjoys this kind of game if it was on sale. In the larger context, it's just a shame that it wasn't allowed to become anything more than it was.\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n- I wasn't too happy about the 'always-online' component of the game, because my internet has a tendency of disconnecting and reconnecting itself randomly, which led to me losing my progress. But always-online has grown more common nowadays than when Survive was first released.\n- I had no issue with microtransactions. I never once felt I needed microtransactions to advance. In fact, I am not even certain how to buy ingame currency or what it can be used for. Maybe it was more of a presence at launch.\n- If you want to play more than one character, then you do need to pay extra, I believe. I dunno - I was never tempted to do that. I'm not sure what benefit playing more than one character might be. I suppose if you wanted to have another character concurrently, this would be a bugbear for you.", "timestamp_created": 1613965403, "timestamp_updated": 1613965403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723212361335754395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40317609": {"recommendationid": "40317609", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964324880", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1448, "last_played": 1519509690}, "language": "english", "review": "The game its self appears to be solid and I have had fun based on my time so far.\n\nHowever, I can NOT recommend this game due to content being gated behind scummy microtransactions.\n\nThis isn't just cosemetics, this is core functionality that is blocked from the player for the sake of getting them to buy Konami's currency (which has its own scummy practice, such as always being over/under what you want.\n\nExample A: You get one character slot, the others are gated behind $10 worth of konami coins (sure, but what if you only want one character?)\n\nExample B: You unlock exploration teams, and you can see it lists \"Alpha Unit\" through to \"Echo Unit\" (5 units total).

Unfortunally this was part of it..\n\nAfter the events of Ground Zeroes and before Phantom Pain [b](As i write this, i'm about to play The Phantom Pain.)[/b]\n\nI'm also one of those kind of people that go with a motto [b]\"Play the game before you judge and before your final thoughs\"[/b], So i had to try this game despite what alot of people say of this game, Most if it not being positive and not being developed by [b]Hideo Kojima[/b] this time, They couldn't have fucked this up, [b]right[/b]?\n\nWell the thing is... \nit's not what people claim it to be, Being that it's a really bad game. But it's not a really big superb game that i would keep playing, i only really played it as part of the Japanese Dub Marathon and to really try what it's [b]REALLY[/b] all about.\n\nBEFORE i write the rest down that; This will contain spoilers.. so if you don't want to be spoiled from knowing what happeneds in the story. Best not to read this review until you either beat it. otherwise you can read!\n\n[b]Pros[/b]:\n- [b]Co-op[/b]: The one thing I will give [b]Survive[/b] compared to [b]The Phantom Pain[/b] is Co-op gameplay, TPP didn't really have that much of co-op except for only thing like [b]FOB[/b], Which wasn't really much if the other player attacking the base in FOB is a possible hacker and really ruins the fun for everyone. So it's pretty nice to see lots of options and things to do with friends if your friend has one. So i'll give Survive this point.\n\n- [b]Stanima and Hunger System[/b]: The concept idea of during the Zombies Apocalypse Survival with having to make your character as healthy keeping your hunger up and not dehydrated while dealing with Zombies this is pretty clever and pretty challenging, Kind of felt like if they gave TPP more time with development. i could see Kojima eventually putting this kind of mechanic, simillar how [b]Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater[/b] (Best game in MGS history) did it.\n\n- [b]Customization[/b] Pretty decent, with a few options to choose from. Even though you start from scratch and don't have that much options to choose from, just playing the story and progression will help you unlock and get more stuff to wear. Even though i'm all about MSF and Big Boss' army stuff, i didnt really need to upgrade much. Being whatever you want as a character, Since it's a MSF member that seperated from Big Boss; will have to find their way back into the actual world after being teleported to a \"altrenate\" world. and since MGSV [b](Except MGO)[/b] wouldn't let you become Female, this was pretty up my alley~\n\n- [b]Upgrades[/b]: you get is pretty rewarding, Weapons, Traps, Base and many more. So you won't always need to stick to just one weapon and/or want to upgrade to get better thing and have more smoother time in the game\n\n[b]Cons...[/b]:\n\n- Now with the Stanima and Huger mechanic i mentioned earlier; The idea and concept does sound like a good idea. but the way it's executed on here is pretty bad and just frustrating. Even if your character is very healthy and not injured of any sort, Even with taking care of yourself. You STILL get hungry very easily even with not so much equipment, not matter what's going on. you go hungry super fast, and it always was such a chore to hunt down food and still be hungry 5 minutes later into the game... Even [b]MGS3[/b] did this better. And don't get me started on trying to take care of the crew...\n\n- [b]Story/Characters[/b]: The story felt very short and not worthy of being part of the MGS timeline and considering it's a spin-off.. makes me glad. The characters are not memorable and forgetable, Even with the \"important character\" [b](GoodLuck)[/b] didn't click onto me and didn't grow much of a bond. Such bland and uninteresting characters Konami gave us. The ending also felt very lazy and just was leading up to get you all pumped up and replay the game again [b][I even tried to do the Altrenate Ending, But even the game didn't want me to do that... Which in this case i'd rather pick as it's pretty canon to the original timeline!][/b] I guess that's what it is if the game is full focused on co-op, So it's expected for this to happened. I have hoped the storyline with how your MSF members went would've been cool. but it isn't...\n\n- [b]Hit Detection[/b]: The game's hit detection is awful. And i mean [b]AWFUL[/b]. It's happened too often when my characters gets very hurt and injured to the point where she bleeds, Even with the incoming attacks from Zombies felt very unfair. Even if you're at a safe distance or in good condition, one swipe out of the Zombies will make you in a bad state, which in this case gets really frustrating.. With your attacks feeling pretty good, but it's even a hit and miss at the point, even if you're behind them to perform a backstab or just doing a super attack with your weapons dosen't really always register. With this I keep dying and dying to things either unfair or just one shotted despite my character being fully healed, fully healthy and not dying of hunger. it just makes the game un-fun.\n\n- [b]Payment Walls[/b]: Konami is very greedy with this sh!t, With (If you love this game), Getting more characters and more things to \"upgrade\" require using money (Virtual or Real Money). Which is someone like me gets very off-putted by, And since it's Konami i'm not suprised...\n\nI don't know.. At the end of the way, it's a Survival Zombie game with a few stuff but with Fox Engine using MGSV gameplay mechanics and slapping Zombies all over it. so there isn't much to it. While it's fun to do with friends. It's been a very bumpy and very drowsy feel of having to go through this game with such bullsh!t. But i mean hey, it's my opinion\n\nIf you like this game, All power to you. But i don't like this game. Very mediocre. but not a garbage game.\n \nAlso not worthy of being called Metal Gear in the franchise.

But I want to give credit where credit is due:\n\nTHE GOOD\n- Scavenging is done well, possibly even better than Fallout 4. Gathering junk is always fun, because there's always another upgrade to install in your base, a new weapon to craft, a new turret to build.\n- The Fox Engine looked good 2 years ago and it looks fine now. Game runs at 60 frames all the time.\n- The misty otherworld generates solid, tense atmosphere.\n\nTHE BAD\n- MGS5's smooth, satisfying gunplay is driven into the background by constant ammo shortages. Since this is a survival game we expect this, so we switch to melee. Unfortunately --\n- Melee combat is awful. Each attack locks your feet in place as you swing weakly with a reach of less than a meter. The zombie you're fighting ignores it, then launches a 3 meter forward dash that results in a grapple. Repeat.\n- The story is terrible and when the plot advances, you are brought up to speed by Microsoft Bob Text to Speech. It's almost funny, but instead it's just awful.\n- Your hunger and thirst tick down at a breakneck pace, but you can mitigate this by grinding up big piles of food and water. What you cannot do is bring more than 5 minutes of oxygen. (7ish if you're willing to burn in game currency to refill it constantly). Play is constantly, constantly being broken up by needing to go home and refill. There's no flow, no momentum.\n- Companions are gone. I miss my dog, and the chilling otherworld-Afghanistan would have been a spectacular place to ride your horse.\n\nIn short, combat is terrible but the looting and building is fun. The result is that you'll be out the door the moment the slow trickle of upgrades stops.\n\nI feel kind of betrayed.

What else could I ask of it?\n\n------ ORIGINAL REVIEW --------\n\nNOT A Hideo Kojima Game\n...and that's okay.\n\nI recommend 'Metal Gear Survive' only as an addendum to 'Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes + The Phantom Pain', sorta like 'Metal Gear Online'.\n\nMGSurvive is [NON-CANON] and that's a good thing. It's just messing around with the mechanics that TPP left behind.\n\nDid you like the Mother Base development but thought it was lacking? It's in Survive.\nDid you like resource collection? It's better in Survive.\nDid you like utilizing lethal weaponry but wish you weren't \"PUNISHED\" for it? Survive.\nWish you could parkour over rocks without Snake slipping all the time? Survive.\n\nThe game does feel cheaper, a lot of Kojima's flair just isn't there. The boundaries of the world feel inorganic and LOD pop-in is bad sometimes. Lots of recycled assets from TPP.\n\nYet, we get Masahiro Ito(!), Silent Hill 2-3's creature designer (Pyramid Head, man), to add enough of a layer of interest to keep the game engaging. At times, wandering the Dust feels like MGS and Silent Hill finally crossing over, if only a little. (There are even some 'P. T.\" sound effects!\") Each area feels like a unique place. As far as I can tell so far, no area is copied from the previous games like was reported initially. [EDIT: There are some copy-pasted areas I've found. However, the gameplay context and aesthetic presentation are different enough, that you'll have to be very familiar with the original MGSV:TPP to notice. Again, context is different that it doesn't really feel the same, even if the geometry is.]\n\nThe world is less open than TPP, but that's only a good thing in my opinion. More like an open Metroidvania (sorta) with tons of secrets and collectible items for those willing to explore.\n\nOverall, this is still made by real talented people and many of them having worked with Kojima before or other great projects. It's unfortunate that the game didn't get a fair shake upon release, but I understand wholly why that was.\n\nGet the game on sale. I got it for $7.50. Easily worth it. Though for anyone who liked MGSV a lot but are left with something missing, but the pain is still there... yeah, give Survive a shot.\n\nMAIN BIG BAD THING:\nI just found out that the game will unceremoniously kick you from the game if your Internet drops.

This game shits on the line and flips you the bird while it tells you to eat and drink more lest you starve or dehydrate.\n\nHonestly, this should have been a more enjoyable game if you only look at what it offers on paper. More MGSV styled gameplay, there's still stealth, there's the excellent FOX Engine and it looks great. Sure zombies are a dated concept but Dying Light's going strong and this spin that MG Survive has with its zombies (wanderers) is at least kind of fresh. Sure, some survival mechanics in a TPP styled game should be kind of interesting.\n\nSo what the fuck just happened? \n\nNone of that stuff is actually fun with how they implemented it in the game.\n\nDo you ever get the feeling that these Devs either don't play the game they made or don't play it enough to feel concerned about how it plays at all? Cause that's what i'm getting.\nI realize giving this game a thumbs down negative review is like beating a dead horse. \n\nBut come on Konami, you should know you fucked up hard on this.\n\nRun for a bit and you get stamina warnings, get nagged to drink water, get nagged to eat.\nTurn down the rate at which this stuff depletes and we'll be on our way to a \"sort-of okay\" game.\n\nRemove the \"Always Online\" aspect and let it be optional and we'll be on our way to an \"okay\" game.\n\nBut you and I both know they aren't going to. Not now, not ever.\nThey have moved on.\n\nSo should you. Let's just pretend this game doesn't exist cause it almost feels like it wants you to uninstall anyway.\n[b]They already have your money.[/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n>not to mention I can't progress past Chapter 5 due to some weird reason.\nThe nurse keeps dying before I even get to her.

In case of two word allowance, it would be \"gross incompetence\".\nWhoever was responsible for design on this game either had no idea whatsoever what he was doing or intentionally sabotaged it. Because game fails on most fundamental level, when it comes to both survival and MGS setting. After playing it for just 10 hours i have 7.5 A4 pages of issues i have with this game. If not for the fact that at 80% of all assets being lifted from Phantom Pain, this game would be a complete train wreck. \nIt is a convoluted incompetent mess, with literally every feature being implemented in a \"wtf is this\" manner. This level of gross incompetence can be seen from get-go. It literally takes 4 clicks(not counting ones needed to skip intros) and 3 loading screens to just get to main menu. Seriously !!?\nAnd Virgil...fucking Virgil. AI that is talking constantly and having opinion on literally everything. You cant take a piss without it commending on how you are unzipping your pants wrong. After i got a mod that shut this fucker up, game instantly got significantly better. And devs clearly thought that an average player is mentally retarded, because AI talks real slow. With long, mostly uninformative, segments of talking. There is a lot of filler, that serves no practical purpose, nor gives any meaningful information.\nOriginal MGSV was build around concept of ranged combat and stealth. This game is build around concept of speed and melee combat...using framework of original game. Because due to extremely limited amount of oxygen available to player sneaking around is not really a particularly good option. And ranged weapons are pathetically weak in this game. With melee combat system being on most rudimentary level. One-handed melee weapons are crap, to put it mildly. Only competitive melee weapons are two-handed, but they also take \"back\" slot...only slot where bows or sniper rifles can go in, so, yet again, player has to chose. But you can carry 3 handguns, for whatever reason.\nSkill system in this game is on par with everything else. There is maybe couple skill that help with exploration. And there is pretty much none that deal with alleged core concept of this game - survival. Also all 4 subclasses are locked behind finishing main campaign and even then you can have only one active at the time, with only one active ability and up to 4 perks \"equipped\" at once. Why ?! Because devs hate gamers. So that player not just have barely any content available to them, they also cant utilize it all at the same time.\nSpeaking of campaign. Most of it is just fetch quests. There has been a few interesting twists and turns, but those twists also created quite a few contradictions in narrative, so...yeah.\nEnd game is boring. Aside of regular running around and looting, there are just 2 minibosses and also 2 mission types, with 4 levels of difficulty and handful of maps to play them on. Lower difficulty levels give you trash as reward and higher level ones require a team, that you are unlikely to find(due to low active player count), unless you play with fiends. Again, absolutely minimal amount of content.\nThere is literally no way to extend your oxygen supply in this game. You can later learn and craft Oxygen Supply Unit, that is equipped in gadget slot, but once you place it there is no way to reallocate it and if players walks a bit of a distance it simply despawns. And it is not exactly cheap to make either. You cant expand capacity of you oxygen tank, learn to use less oxygen or find alternative way to refill oxygen, but by using already mentioned gadget or return to base(it does not even refill when you are in Dust-free zones, nor there is any way to make it so). Same goes for hunger and thirst. And for whatever reason food also spoils(and there is no way to refrigerate it and there is also no indicator of food \"freshness\", you can only dry it later on, but even then only meats and they lose most of their nutritional value in the process). Fuck if i know why somebody thought it was a good idea to put it into game. Especially considering how player needs to eat and drink about every 5 minutes.\nBase building system is as incompetent as the rest of the game design. How can you take very simple(yet normally quite efficient and ergonomic) system of tile building and fuck up it this badly ?!!? It takes a half the keyboard to build anything, because you will be forced to play twister with your fingers in some weird game of 4D chess(on a 2D board), as almost every action requires simultaneous pressing of a several keys at once. Why making drinking water is made so convoluted ?! Why i can craft several types of barricades and fences, yet art of making gates and doors has been apparently lost !?! Why buildings cant be upgraded and instead player has to build higher tier ones and deconstruct old obsolete ones ?! Why ? Why ? Why ? Why does this game hates it players so much ?\nAnd of course console cancer. Need to hold a key for every fucking action. And not for a second, more like 5. Killed a dozen Wanderers and want to loot them ?! Well tough shit, looting every one of them will take you a minute. Slooooow tedious minute. While your extremely limited oxygen supply, if you are in the Dust(and player spends most of the time there), rapidly ticking away. Good thing i have been using X-Mouse for years, so i just rebind it to \"toggle\", rather than \"hold\". And game is composed of those small extremely poorly designed features. With players having to twist themselves in pretzels to fix those obvious basic QoL issues. And to those that will say \"But there is a Quick Hands perk.\" - this perk reduces searches by maybe 1 second, it barely makes a difference.\nSpeaking about QoL, why to fuck i can balloon out containers, corpses and animals, but i cant pack up and send up all the loot that i have gathered on my journey ?! This game requires returning to base and constant loading back and forth nonstop.\nSo on and so forth.\nSaddest part is that idea is sound, core concept can work and work well in given settings. It has the basics of a good game. There is about 20% of a good survival game. If it had competent development team, that would actually give it content, balance, test it and most importantly finish it(there area lot of features that were clearly unfinished, like perks that have 1 level and their description states that they are level 1 and higher levels will have improved efficiency, implying that there was supposed to be more levels), it could be a good game. But as it is usually with cash grabs, this game is barebones, absolute minimum effort and work was put into it. It has abandoned core gameplay of original game, but did not really build much in terms of survival game.\nDid i get my moneys worth out of it ? Yes. But then again, i paid just 8 euros for it. This game is worth maybe 10 euros, but their asking full price of 40 is a complete ripoff.

But then, there's this *snap* by the middle of the game, and the game starts to feel... Alright. Water and food don't become a worry anymore, but the thing that now matters is getting enough resources to craft more ammo for your bow or weapons.\n\nThe best way to do these is through the coop game-mode. Because in single-player, you don't get ANYTHING. It's a chore to get gunpowder in the story when you can get it like crazy if you simply do an extraction on easy mode. Is it easy though? Once you reach a specific level AND carry a specific amount of ammo, it is. Is it fun though? Perhaps... It was for me, at least.\n\nI can't say this enough: The melee gameplay is some of the worst I have experienced (Even Yakuza 3 is better). It's just not fun to hit enemies that rarely stagger and take thirds of your health in a simple slap. Now multiply that slap by 3 in a matter of a second. \nIt sucks. The game tries to give you some skills that improve the combat, but it's barely enough.\n\nBesides melee, Gun gameplay is pretty much just Metal Gear Solid V, removing the First Person ADS (apparently it's shift instead of F. Why would they change MGSV's controls anyway?). The bow is fun to use, especially with the different types of arrows. Guns feel powerful and are mostly rare, which, in a way, is what you'd expect from a survival game. I don't want it on this one, though.\n\nCoop missions are surprisingly fun to do, also. Not only do you get amazing rewards if you suceed on higher ranks, you get nothing if you lose. It's the rat way of life.\n\nStory is ok, I guess. It has a fun little plot twist that makes the game feel longer, and it's done in an alright way.\n\nHowever, most missions or chapters are clearly designed in the way of \"your level is too low for this area, so the big meanies do the boo boos and it hurts :((((\". I didn't have much trouble, simply because I rushed most of the missions and, well, did the coop things.\n\nThe saving system is also one of the worst I've seen. Due to the way the game is structured, whenever you die, it feels extremely punishing, and it forces you to do the missions from the start. Just because this is a survival game, doesn't mean that whenever you die, you just get this huge middle finger that forces you to do a mission in its entirety again. Also, there's a holdout that takes 15 minutes to end. If you die, you get to do it again.\n[spoiler] WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!? [/spoiler]\n\nBut despite all these HUGE flaws, I managed to beat the game and have fun. How? I don't know.\nHopefully it isn't the start of a shitty taste in games. \nFor 10$ (or 10\u20ac, which is actually 12$), it's not a bad game. Given you can get better games on steam for the same price or a fraction of it, \nIt's a niche game, basically.

The characters you meet, are pointless. The plot is confusing. The main character is literally a nobody who develops no real personality and who's whole goal is largely GTFO but also... save people?
