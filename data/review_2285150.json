Rather play solo / with friends on a private server without having to pay an additional amount on top of the base game (Still hate the devs of Icarus for this).\n\nNote to devs; \n- Please give us the ability to disable the quest tracker on screen. Honestly, I don't need it filling up that much of my screen, I want to see my ammo rather than \"Craft a ...\".\n- Please give us a block function (unless I missed it, but I haven't found a way to be able to block?).\n- Make beds give the option to skip time in Solo Play. Like in Green Hell, everyone in the server needs to sleep in order to skip time could work and not mess with the \"Core\" of the day/night cycle that you guys seem to have in mind. No one is awake for 4 weeks in a row? Alternativly, give option in Admin tools to change time?\n\nThe good imo;\n- Base building is quite extensive and very fun to do.\n- (auto)snap works really well!\n- Building manual electronics incl. splitters etc is an awesome idea!\n- Map is very big and diverse. More smaller villages would be nice. In between a \"Town\" and a single house.\n- Love the upgrade idea, of both Player based and knowledge based.\n- Option to Wave attacke' is awesome, all though, would be fun that smaller groups try to attack your base. Like 1-8, depending on your own level. Deadside I.E. has these roaming groups, build to close to the road, they spot your base and attack.\n- In overal the sound quality is good, but lacks in depth.\n- Enemies aren't trained soldiers, they actually miss sometimes. Something I find lacking in most Survival games. I.E. Deadside, every shot is a headshot 9/10.\n- Server options are very extensive, even for solo play. You can almost tweak anything, great idea!\n- Mining and chopping trees has a good time ratio, not endless chopping up trees in several parts to get a few wood. 4 chops and off to the next tree. Less time-grinding.\n- No weight system. Just annoying in games that are focussed on building.\n- Give instructions to turrets is great!\n- No lame weather system. Standing in a house in Icarus at a storm, hammering away for 10-15 minutes or putting out fires, just so your base survives was one of the worst ideas I've ever seen. Especially since it happened like every day... Go out, come back, base destroyed... Please keep the weather as it is!\n- Game has a lot of potential if the less good things are addressed. \n\nThe not so good.\n- I get a steady 40-60 FPS on Icarus on Ultra, and to it looks to me the textures are higher detailed. On the Front I get a steady-ish 20-30 fps with a lot of drops back to 8-10, while nothing significant seems to be happening. No fires, no building collapses. I'm just walking or cutting down a tree. So some optimization needs to be done it seems.\n- A.I. isn't terrible, but could be way, way better in time. Sometimes I get to sit on a cliff side and Headshot enemies in a row while no one responds to a single gunshot. Other times 1 or 2 \"wake up\" and decide to fire back. Other times everyone comes at me as if they are on some narcotics.\n- The range that A.I. sees you could be better, make them stand on \"alert\" I.E. move towards you. Now they just stand there, 30m away, decide to turn away from you and go stand somewhere else, staring at a cliff side while in a post apocalyptic world, everyone should be considered a threat?\n- Lack of \"crazies\". some zombie/ghouls could easily fit in. There are massive dudes already in the game. Why not add some loonies that charge you without a reason. Give the game more depth and less player decision based events. Chopping a tree, thinking your safe and get swamped by 4 loonies with axes I.E.\n- A.I. lacks sounds, animals hardly make their presence known. Either they don't see you and wonder around aimlessly or they spot you and attack without a warning. \n- Boars are friendly creatures? Have you ever encountered a wild boar in real life? Eagles attack without remorse? Should be the other way around.\n- More ambient sounds would be nice. The music is very nice, but get's old quite fast imo. Ambient sounds makes people trim down music and enjoy the surroundings.\n- Can't seem to build over water? Nothing beats a lake-house where you can fish or get your nets from the water and easily drink. Placing supports under water doesn't seem to be working in any way. Yet, you can build over a road appearantly.\n- As said before, more roaming A.I. Make them less static, let a few groups wander around in a path. Makes more forced encounters and travelling a whole lot more interesting and suspenseful. Especially at night.\n- Followers don't pop up and don't seem to do anything at I.E. a forge, still have to do everything manually?\n- Lacks the option to move \"Stuff\", workbenches, generators, forges, chests etc. You have to destroy them, rebuild them in order to place somewhere else. Give the option to just move them?\n- Gun play seems a bit sluggish imo.

Some materials for crafting you have to travel all over the map the distance makes that a chore. Also some are hidden behind enemy npcs which is cool but often times far more aggravating to deal with just to mine some nodes not really worth the effort.

It's loads of fun initially, exploring the levelling up, however I now find it more like a chore and whilst I don't mind games with a grindy nature (Valheim for example) I do find that this game gets somewhat tedious.  \n\nI'm currently level 40-something and in what I'd describe as mid game lull, where every bit of progression feels tiresome.  I should be building and crafting things at this point, but honestly, I don't enjoy the building mechanics and find the combining of materials frustrating.  Endlessly looking in chests for the mats you need gets old quickly.\n\nThen there's the graphics and performance.  I'm running a 4080 at 3440x1440 and it drops below 60fps frequently, other times it's up near 200fps, so the transition between the two extremes is noticeable to the point I've had to limit it in-game to 60fps.  \n\nChanging graphic fidelity options makes no difference at all, so this is purely an optimisation issue, which considering the game runs on UE4 is bad.  The world itself doesn't look amazing either, I get triple the FPS and more on RDR2, which by comparison looks like they were made a decade apart.\n\nThen there is DLSS.  There's the option to enable it, however it does absolutely nothing whatsoever, enable it and the AA doesn't change, nor does the FPS.  It's clearly not working, so I'm not even sure if it's just there as a placeholder or what.\n\nAll in all, there are some brilliant mechanics to this game, however I'm not enjoying the building or crafting so far, it's tedious and the graphics and performance are both a let down.

played (7 months ago) there were alredy tickets open for the server lag and the thing causing it was all the persisting bodies of the players all over the map and the game attempting to load sed player and there inventory even when there not there causing the connection to be unstable impacts of this issue are>\r\nwhen flying your helo will lag back and fourth or up and down making impossable 75% of the time to land with out blowing up the expensive helos or even crashing vehicles into objects like trees and rocks as the cars trucks and tanks are lagging alll over the place when driven.\r\nthe combat making it hard to kit enemys with guns or bows as they tend to be 20 feet behind you then freeze in place for a second then the next there on you beating you to death.\r\n\r\nthe other issue is the ammount of cheaters on BOTH pvp and pve servers. tho there isnt any player damage against other players there is an issue with players cheating stats and other things making it hard to farm stuff for lower levels as the cheaters hit it all as soon as there up or duplicating ammo and other things and constently raiding dungeons making it impossable for player at the point to hit sed dungeons.\r\n\r\nthe added bosses. unless you have a group of atleast 6 friends good luck. there impossable to do solo the tank mini bosses will aimbot you at extreme distinces witch verry little chance to run away or live they need to make the bosses a raid so when your withing a distince of sed boss its toned down or up in difficulty depending on how many people are attacking

Fix this immediately, as you can see in others reviews, people hate the way this system is currently. \n\nAtleast let us like have a higher cap of materials able to be placed in the thing that protects your base from PVP/Decay (autorepairs via using materials stored in this thing, i forgot the name, Space something,its basically a TC with more uses) just let us put like atleast 1K materials in there so we can extend the time we dont have to be afraid of losing progress if we just dont want to play one day...\n\nHowever i think more PvE content would be nice as games like this really lack at that, some people dont want to just PvP,spawn,die, repeat, however this game does have a lot of unique ways to prevent PvP and looting and interestingly i think they could expand on a lot of features, however first how about the random NPC traders that are just randomly around the map? Fix those and make those look like they are meant to be placed in the spots they are, and also have more life to them, maybe voice lines or QUESTS from them and i believe this game could be great competitor to Rust, they need more fixes and such first tho, but GAME IS NEW so another year or so i fully expect this game to be packed and features nearly complete for their Launch out of Early Access eventually, however i think the UI needs INSANE work, map UI, not being able to use mouse scroll wheel to swap between items in quickslots, or use it for really anything actually? Weird, but game really does have good ideas and uniqueness to it however i think they need to fix a lot first, and optimize the game for the masses before doing more Marketing via streamers/content creators, also personally i think they could do good unique fun PvE content, with Bosses, Raids, the whole 9..... However some people just love to PvP and thats fine but understand new content benefits both parties of players who enjoy both PvP and PvE content, and i think this game could use a GIANT PvE AI/and NPC rework like PLEASE I beg you rework the AI of Enemies to not just walk straight to you, and actually do things other then just run towards you and auto attack like a basic UE5 model.... come on guys, love shows and a lot of the places in the map feel left out and left in the cold (some spots literally have stretched textures, like across a mountain in the grass area, just like brother come on) so i think this game is great however a lot of fixes and features need to come and more communication with the playerbase via socials like steam and twitter/x is amazing for updating us on whats to come and whats IN THE WORKS as well, so we know what to adjust ahead of time or what to ask for changes for or if the playerbase sees a rising issue before the devs do, things like that.\n\n5.7/10 game currently however give it a few feature updates and optimization (like major optimization) and this game could easily compare to Rust, if not surpass it in fun factor in a lot of ways (RPG elements via skills, could expand on this too, and the MANY unique \"wacky\" items and vehicles and weapons you can get in this game, set it apart from the rest) So as long as they continue that route, should be in a good place within a few months/year or two time.\n\nPlayer base is apparently Toxic but like you play survival games what do you expect hugs and kisses? \nYou SHOULD know what you get with these kinda games, base campers, sh*t talkers, and Xbox 2010 MW2 lobby chat simulators, it is what it is.", "timestamp_created": 1707241482, "timestamp_updated": 1707242091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150553385": {"recommendationid": "150553385", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970883509", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1700580392}, "language": "english", "review": "Update: Change is coming! We did this, folks :)\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/games/2285150/announcements/detail/3899617007501078392\n\n\n\n--- original review follows ---\n\nThis game should NOT be allowed on Steam!\n\nThe game immediately requires one to install a Kernel-level anti-cheat called \"ACE\", aka the \"Sguard\" service. One can't even stay in the main menu for longer than a few seconds without agreeing to install this. \"ACE\" is made by Chinese company Tencent. Unlike with other games, this requirement is NOT disclosed on the store page!!\n\nThe anti-cheat software's updates can not be realistically controlled by the game maker, it has a data protection document that is very light on details, and is hilariously self-referential. It is in no way compliant with data protection laws in the EU or most of US. Running at Kernel level, the Chinese maker of \"ACE\" could potentially (i.e. hypothetically) push any future functionality to one's PC, to potentially spy on any communication, steal data or currency, or manipulate any file. It might also contain potential security holes, potentially allowing malicious actors full access to the PC.\n\nThis is in principle no different from things like Easy Anti-Cheat, BattlEye and friends, but this is Chinese-made and therefore outside of any Western jurisdiction.\n\nI really wanted to try the game, but this is a no-go. Refunding.\n\n---\nEdit: an ammendment to respond to some of the comments\n\nI want to respond to one point people make. I am under no illusion that other companies have the same potential means, and similar incentives, to spy on me as well. In fact, I have a healthy skepticism against non-Chinese corporate conglomerates as well. You could consider me a bit of an activist and also the fool who actually reads the data protection clauses.\n\nAt the end of the day, every one of us has to decide where we fall on the spectrum between living without technology in in a cave, and reaping the benefits of technology. Yes, I, too, use some social media. But I try to wage benefits against cost carefully.\n\nMake no mistake: \"I have nothing to hide\" is laziness at best, and harmful ignorance at worst. Every one of you has something to hide. Consider this: Do you want every private conversation, every medical record, every party picture, every single one of the little lies we tell others or ourselves dragged into public? That stuff increasingly happens on your hard disks, and saying that you \"got nothing to hide\" is just foolish.\n\nEven if you trust Tencent (or Google, or Facebook) - which in itself is a silly statement, \"trusting\" an abstracted entity, there are so many cases of Kernel-level software opening up exploits then abused by hackers. With access to a machine, they can encrypt your data, take over your accounts (yes, maybe your precious Steam account). And it's not just people getting your data that's already there. As an IT professional, I have been asked, many years ago, to plant criminal material on a compromised machine, to frame someone. Of course I didn't, but people should know the extend of what's technically imaginable.\n\nSo, if you're truly prepared to give a random stranger full, utter CONTROL over your digital existence, tell me you got nothing to hide. Until then, this review aims to do no more, and no less, than to tell you what the game makers were supposed to tell you, but neglected: They are helping another company to potential, full control over your machine, but unlike many other Steam shop pages, this one did not proactively tell you about that fact. And unlike many others, this product (the anti-cheat) does not even appear to make a pledge to grant you the rights established by GDPR/DSGVO (for the EU citizens among you).\n\nNo more needs to be said.\n\nOP out.", "timestamp_created": 1700581385, "timestamp_updated": 1702394890, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6306, "votes_funny": 145, "weighted_vote_score": "0.942542493343353271", "comment_count": 333, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1701143575, "developer_response": "Thank you for the suggestions and feedback.

I've played 440 hours now with a revolving selection of teammates across 9 different NA PvP fresh wipes. I've tested and mathed a lot of stuff, and could probably answer any question you have about the game in its current state. I know the absolute fastest ways to level, how much damage every weapon and vehicle deals to various targets, all the raid mechanics, etc.\n\nBut unfortunately, right now I have to put the game down and ask you not to give the devs your money - force them to instead confront the rampant balance issues and glitches that are keeping this game from being great. Here's a selection off the top of my head:\n[list]\n[*] [strike]Placing signboards gives 20 xp. This one simple trick means what should take you at least several days of hard grinding can be done in a matter of hours. And once you understand how important progression is in this game (it has HUGE effects on your harvest rate and combat ability), you'll know how broken this truly is.[/strike] Edit: FINALLY they fixed this.\n[*] All raiding is based around turrets - they can shoot down most raiding projectiles, so raiders have to play intelligently to work around this, either draining turrets, approaching with smokes, etc. And there's meant to be counter play there for the defender. Plus, there's the cost of defensive and offensive ammo to consider. Sounds interesting, right? But if the raiders simply set up devastator turrets of their own on the edge of your claim, they will completely shut your ability to defend by 1-shoting you whenever you peak. Then they will place tamed rocket NPCs, who fire free ammo. And neither of these things will be intercepted by your turrets.\n[*] Most of your play session revolves around your base, be it farming Ether Shards, Blueprints, Oil, or Explosives - you'll spend most of your time at home. When you do go out to get talent books or hit mines, you'll be in and out so fast that there's no time for organic open world PvP interactions. And once you've progressed in your tools and talents, you'll get so much material from a single mine run that you barely ever need to go. The map is also 2x the size of your standard Rust map, with 1/3 the pop. Nearly everyone I've gotten interested in this game has left due to a lack of organic open-world pvp.\n[*] By a week after launch, most mines will be covered in turrets, because players can build right next to them. This means the first hour of server launch is a massive rush to grab territory, with beacons that are incredibly cheap and so strong that you'd only ever raid them by glitching a very strong NPC into attacking them for you.\n[/list]\n\nNow you might say \"well, it is EA, give them time and they will fix these things.\" But I'd ask you to take a look at their discord, at how long these issues have been noted by their players, and then compare that with the content of their patches and development announcements. While I think the mods do a good job at filtering feedback up, whoever is running this company is clearly out of touch.\n\n[b]TLDR: I'm going to come back to this game in 6 months or so, and maybe they will have addressed these issues. But from what I've seen so far, I'm not expecting much. And I ask you to seriously consider if these developers deserve your money. Don't fall into the trap of playing this game > 2 hours and then being unable to refund. Take a look through the bugs and suggestions threads in their discord first.[/b]\n\n-----\n\nEdit: I wanted to respond to something I'm seeing frequently in the replies to this review - \"How can you play so many hours and still give it a bad review? Don't you feel like you got your money's worth?\"\n\nFirst of all, I know most people have more self-control than me and put less than a few hundred hours into their games. But take a look at my profile - I've put over 10k hours into various survival games, 4.6k into Rust alone. 400 hours is not a lot, for me, for something that has the potential to be my next main game. It is, however, just enough time to reach peak PvP meta and understand how the game is competitively played, and my discoveries there are the basis for my negative review.\n\nSecond, \"is it worth my money?\" is not the only question to consider when making a purchase. Most games are very cheap per hour played. But gamers don't have infinite time to play them all, so we have to pick and choose on factors besides cost. \"Do they deserve my money\" is an important question too, one that I think we should ask ourselves more these days as EA money-grabs run rampant over our gaming world.

I was very hesitant to get it because there\u2019s soooo many negative reviews. \nSo if you\u2019re you\u2019re on the fence about getting it like I was, read this.\n\n1. Firstly the graphics are pretty good, up there with Ark and stuff, I\u2019m able to run the game on ultra and still have about 90FPS.\n\n2. Lag and stuttering hasn\u2019t been an issue for me, I play on a dedicated server because on official there are a few hackers I\u2019ve noticed and mods are good about banning hackers on dedicated servers.\n\n3. This game is very grindy! But a fun grind! I do recommend playing on a 2x or even a 3x server (I play on 3x) as a duo or solo. Because you need a tonnnnn of resources always. But again it\u2019s a fun grind.\n\n4. I prefer pvp just because it adds to the risk factor, you can do pve servers but you will get bored pretty quickly without that added risk. (In my opinion)\n\n5. This game is like Ark, Rust, and 7 days to die had a baby, and then add gunship helicopters and tanks and rpgs and stuff to the mix. Super addicting\n\n6. I haven\u2019t had the game crash once, it\u2019s been stable for me and all of my friends.\n\n7. The game is $20. It is worth at least $40-60. Get the game and enjoy days/weeks/months of it.\n\n8. The map is hugeeeee, there\u2019s tons of npcs to kill and things to do. When you\u2019re not sitting in your base grinding go explore.\n\n9. The only thing I will say negative about the game is the wind generators. I have mine over 80 meters high and they still get \u201cinsufficient wind\u201d only generating 40 power instead of 75. Super annoying, nothing is near them either. \n\nConclusion: get the game and stop listening to negative reviews based off them having potato PCs and play on a dedicated server to avoid hackers.\n(EDIT): oh yeah about the people complaining about pvp, just to let you all know, your base is pvp protected for 21 hours of the day, you get to choose a 3 hour window that your base is raidable, so yeah, enjoy the game and ignore the negative reviews.", "timestamp_created": 1698170517, "timestamp_updated": 1698171016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 290, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892471611499786377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148029185": {"recommendationid": "148029185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344184946", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 18353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3927, "last_played": 1700805721}, "language": "english", "review": "I've seen comments talk about this game like it's just another generic survival game adding nothing to the genre. YouTube comments are brutal. Everyone seems to want to just assume this one is dead on arrival.\n\nI really disagree. This game actually has some fun things going for it.\n\nI've put in countless hours in to many survival games - ARK, 7D2D, Valheim, Grounded and others. I'm well aware of the usual tropes and gameplay loops and I can honestly say The Front offers a healthy mix of areas you're used to combined with new fresh ideas that feel creative and fun. \n\nMy group has mostly been messing around with PVE mechanics for the closed betas as the PVP elements in (very) early access survival games can prove to be sort of a mess. We're holding out until further down the line to really embrace  the PVP aspects, but I can safely say the PVE and crafting / gathering feels very polished for such an early build. The base defense system is reminiscent of 7D2D, but the \"zombie\" horde has many new enemy types that offer more layered levels of difficulty and strategy. Their roadmap indicates many many more on the horizon as well, and I'm excited to see what sort of threats they cook up as it progresses.\n\nThe player progression system incorporates \"Talents\" that are unlocked via Talent Books, and tech tree crafting blueprints that are unlocked via Ether Shards. Both are major sources of loot from the enemies you find in the wild and also from base defenses - this gives much needed purpose to maintaining a functional killbox base for your base defense gauntlets. Additionally, there are POIs that function as both surface-level enemy strongholds, as  well as instanced-like dungeon zones. While the loot in these needs improvement and pales in comparison to the loot you receive from defending waves at home, it's still kind of fun and shows what the future could hold. Their roadmap includes many improvements to these features, as well as eventual World Bosses.\n\nThe current price tag of this game is really had to beat. I put in 60 hours in the betas and still feel ready to put in many more. I spend more on a value meal at Burger King than the current sale price of this game, I just can't find fault in this dev team just yet. \n\nGive this one a try if you're a fan of the survival genre, and especially if you enjoy base defenses in 7D2D.", "timestamp_created": 1697036450, "timestamp_updated": 1697049392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 311, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.891508162021636963", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151349107": {"recommendationid": "151349107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174545241", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1700716566}, "language": "english", "review": "This installs Ace anticheat and even after removing the game it remains.

However, it feels like all that potential is being wasted because the developers have no clue what they're doing. It seems like they never played the game themselves; they just added things that they thought would be cool, but these things don't fit together. Maybe in 1-2 years, they will fix all of this, but currently, it's a big NO-NO.\n\nFor example, if you join a server as a new player, even on a one-week-old server that is meant to last for a year, there is no chance to survive. You're going to get raided every day or every few days because the technological difference is so huge that there is no chance to catch up and become equal.\n\nAnother issue is the presence of beds in the game that allow players to respawn on them. These beds have no limits, and the respawn time is very short, like a maximum of 10 seconds. So, what people are doing is using helicopters to crash onto the roofs of bases, causing a lot of damage to the structures. But before it happens, they jump out of the helicopter, so the player doesn't take any damage. Then they quickly destroy turrets with high-end explosives, and that's it\u2014the raid is successful. After that, the raider doesn't even need to return to their base because they pick up the valuable items, commit suicide, respawn in their base using \"reclaimers\" to retrieve their drop, commit suicide again, respawn near the enemy base on one of the many beds, loot whatever is left, commit suicide, respawn in their base, and reclaim all the items.\n\nThe second issue is that to loot something, an enemy player has to demolish a chest so that everything inside it drops on the ground. There is only a 5-minute window to pick up all the materials before they decay and disappear. So, imagine if an enemy is attacking your base using explosives, demolishing many chests, and you're trying to stop them while focusing on the fight. There's no chance to get the drop and place it in new chests because you're engaged in the battle, which could last longer than 5 minutes, for example.\n\nI can't understand why there is no limit on the number of beds per player (maximum 1 without the ability to spawn on another player's bed). Why does that option to reclaim your items even exist? Imagine I am a sniper on a rock, killing someone who is far away from me. Who would reach their drop faster? Me, who needs to go down from the hill and walk far to pick it up, or the guy who respawns in their base after 10 seconds and clicks on the reclaimer?", "timestamp_created": 1703201526, "timestamp_updated": 1703201526, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 243, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866301655769348145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149627076": {"recommendationid": "149627076", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988363181", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 842, "last_played": 1698034216}, "language": "english", "review": "READ HERE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THE \"HORDE\" SYSTEM WORKS. \n\nLots of reviews akin this game to 7d2d because survival and zombies. This will also make you think there are hordes of enemies especially with the trailer. No. This is not a survival game. It's a tower defense game that has a survival game slapped on the side of it for tedious things. There are sporadic points where you can get a half decent \"horde\" on your screen in certain towns but 7d2d does it better. Notice all the hordes of zombies and bases they run through? Yeah. It's that. You set the start and end point for the zombies and you start the event every 10 mins to have them rush to that end point and you build the path to stop them. Upgrading the distance etc as you grind through the levels. There's no random assault on your base or anything of that nature outside of pvp. \n\nAs a tower defense game, this is a solid 9/10. As a survival game it's a 3/10. The ai and open elements of the game are frankly, absolute dog shit. Everything follows the basic script of charge to player, but on top of that for melee mobs you can just jump in place to not take damage. Honestly feels worse than the old halo 2 Ai where you can sit behind a rock and they will slowly creep to it letting you blast them down. This Ai is perfect for tower defense games not survival style. They look for the path of least resistance and just rush forward. Tested it out a good bit opening doors further and further down a wall. They will in fact just run down to the open door even if it's forever away since it's easier than breaking a wall.\nBesides the Ai being weird things just don't feel right from a power creep perspective either. You get access to a full excavator that you can just sit on for free materials at the same time you unlock the ability to create a wood cabin. It also doesn't take electronics. Just awkward and all over the place for the build progression. For some reason the balista with no form of automation, just a regular giant bow you would normally have to man, will also just fire at things. Screams tower defense over survival. Survival games you ramp up and increase in a flow pattern that goes with the age that you are progressing through. Naked - weeds - woods- stone - metal - modern. This looks like that pattern and then you slap down a full automated oil rig next to your wood house and just start to question how you did that.\n \n\nThe power imbalance of pvp is more than obnoxious, between random ping issues from china connections, hacking being rampant, or the fact base building feels entirely irrelevant until you're at metal stuff is just wild. Even if you take away the already established side of survival games lets look at this from a fresh aspect.\n\nYou could sink all your time into making a base and getting it upgraded, feeling decently confident that if anyone else ends up higher than you they are def no life sweating at the game. Nah jimmyjoebob can just roll up to the winter zone and snag a tank and wipe you flat while putting up 0 effort to farm a single thing. He wasn't established, he didn't no life the game. Homie ran through dogwater AI that couldn't hit fish in a barrel then up to a tank that was \"guarded\" hopped in and proceeds to dump all over your base. Sweet design choice there, especially in a game where you should farm and work your way up to things. Nah just give people the ability to wipe bases naked free of charge. \n\nTLDr - it feels like it was built as a tower defense game and the devs didn't think it would hold enough interest so they just started slapping any feature they could from the survival genre.

It lacks modernization, and has very little polish and charm. Still a somewhat fun nostalgia trip though.\n\nPlaying The Front is a bit weird to me. The game is a time machine into the past, and quite frankly is being released a decade too late. If this game had been released in 2015 as an early access title, it would have fit right in alongside rust, Ark, Conan, etc. It may have even had a leg up on one or two of those competitors with its unique take on NPCs, tech level, vehicle options, and wave defense. However the game in its current state *feels* like those games back when they were released in 2013-2016 \nIt has dated resource grinding without any unique characterization to keep it from feeling dull. (think \"sweet spot\" minigame in rust, or dino harvesting in Ark).\n It has dated NPC ai where as long as you are walking backwards most melee enemies cant actually hit you, and all the enemy does is run a straight line at a target.\n\nPretty much everything about the game is just a 2015 survival game, from the concept, the mechanics, the graphics, all the way to the overall polish of the game. It is pretty unfortunate the devs havent seemed to pick up on any of the quality of life changes other big name games in the genre grew into. Or implemented any of the new techniques or technology explored by titles like The forest, Grounded, etc.\n\nI really enjoyed playing Rust back in the early days of its development, and still play a TON of Ark, so the dated mechanics have been a slight bit nostalgic for me to be entirely honest. Its like getting to experience a game you like for the first time again. However, I know that it wont take long for that nostalgia to end and the dated mechanics, graphics, and tedious grinding will make the game feel miserable to play. \n\nThe main thing The Front has going for it that is really promising though. The Wave defense mechanic is unique to the genre as far as the way it is implemented. Giving the player the ability to choose where and when the defense occurs is awesome and there is a loot reward tied to it so you arent forced to go clear POI's to get quality loot.\n\nUnfortunately The game is just outdated for games today, and it fights itself a little bit on what its identity is (PVE wave defense, or pvp survival shooter)\n\nI would recommend the game if you want a weekend or two of old school fun with some friends, you want a slight break from your other survival games you typically play but dont want to change genres or you want a hallucinogenic nostalgia trip into the hellscape that was 2010s survival games. Try and get it on sale. \n\nedited for formatting", "timestamp_created": 1703242395, "timestamp_updated": 1706349140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.772081673145294189", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148368551": {"recommendationid": "148368551", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994611780", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 4602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1703103263}, "language": "english", "review": "UPDATE: After playing for roughly 16ish hours I can say at the price point, it gets a recommendation from me.

Nothing beats the feeling of logging off in your palace and waking up naked and destitute.\n\nUpdate: \n\nI put in a little bit of time, and I think I've logged enough to give a more detailed review:\n1. The beginning of the game is fun the first time. After the first time it feels much more grindy but doesn't take too long to get through. This is unpleasant though if you are facing frequent server wipes.\n2. Mid-game is the most fun. This is when you are competing for resources, trying to get a defendable base, and unlocking your tech tree.\n3. End-game tends to drag. Grinding for talents and recipes is repetitively painful. Once you have a stash of thousands of rockets and tank ammunition, you just need to raid someone, but then you are waiting for their raid timer all the time. \n\nI played mostly solo, but found the game isn't great for solo play. Some of the end-game content is too easy and some is too hard for solo play. Some of it is too expensive... Grind ammo for two days in order to take out a site to get a poor ammo drop. Besides recipes, and very lucky raids, gathering resources is always the most productive activity by a factor of 100x. \n\nThis game could get really good if end-game is tuned right. My biggest complaints are no 3rd-person view, no mods workshop, and simple QoL issues like clicking 20 stacks twice to make a recipe. \n\nI had fun and it is definitely worth 10x the price for how

\n\nI might update my review later on. \n\nThe game has a good base foundation set already, with most of the early access games, do not have every thing available yet (only wood / stone for example ), such as Ark Survival with launch when early access (i got around 1000 hours ) or sons of the forest (Wood / Stone available) \n\nThe current map seems nice and enough to do with snow and desert biodomes available, I also see several mines on the map with all sort of ores available and bases / buildings full of human NPC's in which you can \"raid\" and get their items.\n\nThere is a \"creature beacon\" available in which you can let \"waves\" of creatures / animals / humans come at you (you can maze and build traps for it, they need to reach your \"spacetime beacon\" that is set out as your area to build in and get auto repair as well ) and mobs give you loot and you be rewarded with blueprints and ether shards and talent points, you can get supplies at the spacetime beacon once you finished a round for extra shards and blueprints.\n\nThe ether shards you can use these to unlock new building / vehicles / gear but you also got  \"talent points\" in which you can use to improve your combat skills ( more damage with melee or certain weapons ) or survival ( think of getting more wood when chopping or more ore )  and another skills ( vehicle skills also upcoming but not available yet ) \n\nThis game is already much further in the progress with many things available already for a early access game.\nYou can go from wood towards stone and afterwards concrete and steel and at last \"tungsten\" \n\nThere are also several vehicles available from very easy to make until basic and also advanced tanks and helicopters.\nYou can go PvE but also PvP in this game.\n\nThere are some \"bad\" reviews here about that some things are bugged ( it is still early access, come on ) and glitches but they are fixing things i noticed ( last few patches was mostly fixing bugs / glitches and optimization ) and there is much available already for a \"early access\" game with a low price for now.\n\nSince i played several survival games i got some suggestions / features to add.\n\nFeatures / suggestions to add:\n- Synced local server files (able on your own \"local\" server to play anywhere where ever you install the game ) \n- 3rd Person view ( i am really missing this one specially while building ) \n- Ultra wide support\n- Mouse sensitivity\n- FOV slider\n- Mods and workshop / mod managers ( it is on the road map that is good, they say within 1-3 months of release ) \n- Squad Alliances \n- Bigger Squads \n- Able to pick up a object / building / wall whatever after placing it in game for a certain amount of time ( not nice to see your object placed wrong and you don't get it all materials back )\n- Shared XP when in squad while killing / crafting and such\n- See each other names when you are in a vehicle ( it is there in the options on \"Shown\" but not working )\n\nThey recently added a important request / fixes in game that was missing:\n-Costum Keybindings\n- Next to that they do alot of bug fixing i see coming by in the first few patches which is good ( a better and more stable optimized game ) \n\n**Dedicated server features / suggestions **\n- They added a \"The Front manager\" to manage your own \"dedicated\" server\n- Auto recovery of crashed / hang server\n- Auto boot of servers on certain time and restart schedule as well\n- Able to select what internal IP is used for the server\n\nThey are testing out 80 player slots servers at the moment and i wonder if more and clustered servers with different maps would be possible too.\n\nI play on my own dedicated servers and i see also reviews about cheaters but i do not play on another servers but my own ( so no cheaters on my servers ) \n\nNext to some reviews about having a virus: i also got Kaspersky and i did got a report about it since the update on the 13/14th of the game ( it was fine the first few days )\n\nSo i send the actual file \"TheFront.exe\" towards Kaspersky and a malware analyst checked it out and it said was clear of anything and they would be adding it to the safe list. \n\nI think this game has a lot of potential", "timestamp_created": 1698256080, "timestamp_updated": 1698270327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0,

But its important to level up your character by killing Npcs as this gives you the books which are used to level stats and perks like increased stamina or health etc. \n\n[u][b] Final Thoughts [/b][/u]\nThis game has promise but it needs more work on the Character creation side of things as it feels bare minimum in this department. The servers need working on as connections crash alot and also i feel like there needs to be events like horde nights or dungeon exploration. Game is awesome though in all other areas.

In a world where early access often means a lack of updates and a disengaged development team, The Front stands apart as a shining example of what early access should be. This game is actively being developed on the fly, with a very dedicated and active admin and development team at the helm.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's crucial to address the elephant in the room - the occasional complaints about cheaters and perceived negligence from the developers. This is where a fundamental misunderstanding of the complexities of game design, internet security, and the challenges of working with a limited budget comes into play. The gaming community can sometimes be quick to criticize, but it's essential to acknowledge the Herculean task that game developers face. The Front's team is actively trying to make the game better, even in the face of these challenges.\n\nAs a seasoned survival game enthusiast with 4,000 hours in Rust, 1,500 hours in Conan, and several hundred hours in other titles of the genre, I can say that The Front is making a valiant effort to combine the best aspects of these games into one unique experience. While I currently enjoy playing on a PvE server due to personal preferences, I can empathize with those on PvP servers who might find hackers frustrating. However, it's important to note that the issue of hackers plagues many survival games, and it's often a battle that's tough to win, no matter the developer's efforts.\n\nOne remarkable aspect of The Front is the developer's receptivity to player feedback. They actively seek suggestions for improvements and bug reports through the official Discord channel. What's truly commendable is that they not only listen but also act swiftly to implement some of the requested changes. This kind of responsiveness is a testament to the commitment of the development team.\n\nIn terms of the game's current state, it may not be perfect, but it's important to remember that perfection is not the goal during the early access phase. The Front is a work in progress, and it's evident that the developers are putting their heart and soul into it. Thus, a 7/10 for the current state feels like a fair assessment, keeping in mind the challenges they face.\n\nAs an enthusiastic supporter of The Front, I'm excited to see where the game will go in the future. It's already showing great promise and potential, and I look forward to being an active player when the survival gaming bug bites me again. The development team deserves a solid 10/10 for their dedication and enthusiasm.

I haven't tried the game yet on any of my other systems so I can't say how it runs on them.  So I will just be referring to playing on the above machine.\n\nFirst off I collect far more games than I should.  With the new Total War just coming out, I put around 3 hours into it.   Then this afternoon I put in just shy of 5 hours, into The Front.   I didn't spent a lot of that time as one does with similar games, trying to rush the early unlocks and get a lay of the land.   \n\nI should also disclaim that I played Solo, so I have no idea what it is like for regular players (much less PVP ones).  That said, I did not change any of the settings when setting up the local server instance, other than password protecting it.    I feel that is important to disclaim for one of two reasons, first it will  off I am going to guess that the majority of players most likely are playing on an dedicated or at least open Multiplayer server.     Nothing really to back that up that just know that is how most people play games like Rust, Ark, RoK, and all the many, many other survival crafting games.    The second reason is to say what it is like for those that play solo and if doing so needs you to adjust settings like many other games similar.\n\nWhen I first started  playing I almost refunded because I kept having CTDs, but I eventually figured out that the problem was fully on my end, not the games side of things.   So once I got that resolved, I had no further CTD and the game (at least for my setup) ran a solid 60 FPS without any major bugs to speak of, aside taking me a short period of time to figure out the way to put in doors and windows.   Hint (you want to pull up the radial bar via right click when setting up walls.  Unlike many similar games, this one doesn't go the route of having a different door frame or window frame upon direct setup.  Not a big deal, though, once that was figured out it didn't take me long to set up a fairly decent small building.\n\nAt the time I quite the game for the night I had mad it to level 21.  I have no ideal what the level cap is, or if it will be unlocked as the game continues via Early Access.   So far I haven't really seen a lot of unique things that have blown me away, but then again I am still in as well as playing solo so I am sure I progressed a fair bit quicker than someone play PVP would off course.\n\nOne small thing playing solo is as of right now most of the crafting and even smelting either has a bug, or I need to adjust it for solo, because everything from cooking, the crafting, and in between requires you to stay at said station (if the item(s) must be crafted at a station, which after the initial 2 and a half hours I had enough unlocks that I was really getting burnt out at just staying at a station crafting.   I know many other games do this, and I know that it is geared for multiple players, and since I didn't change any settings, maybe boosting up the time would help.   I realize that it adds some realism to the game, not like you would drop a stack of 20 fish to fry then start up multiple furnaces and such and then walk off and let them just do their thing.   I am not sure if that is what the devs are going for, or if it is just something that they are working on changing with input.\n \nFrom the small area on the east coast I built the start of my fortress on the top of a hill fairly near the initial mid-eastern coast line.   Plenty of things to get you started there, however you still have to explore as well often right off PVE NPC's that sometimes drop talent books and more importantly recipe books. There are also a number of worn down shacks that usually have at least one NPC but there is usually one or two chest on a nearby boat or inside one of the shanty houses.   I did run into some NPCs in a mining quarry that outclassed me by a fair amount.  One of NPCs had near boss level health.  So you want to be careful, however you can respawn at your point of death, and at least at the moment the mobs don't seem to attack you right off the bat so you are able to quickly pickup your dropped loot and work on pulling back out of the enemy area.   The NPC AI is different enough to be semi-challenging when you are outnumbered, however other than being outnumbered the only mob I fought against was a huge meat  shield who also had a shield.   I forgot to try a bola on him to see if I can use that to get around him and wear his large health pool down but didn't think of that.\n\nAll in all crafting is fair.  I would put it around the same level of build-up as Conan as far as the number of potential stations and craft-able items.   \n\nFor the price, the game is decent even at this early stage.  I never ran into any other animals in the wild other than bunnies who are just okay with their evasion AI tactics.  Half the time I didn't bother switching to a spear or the flintlock I had and would just kill them by using whatever gathering tool I had in my hands at the moment.  \n\nI mentioned Bolas being in the game.  They do help a great deal.  Matter of fact against the bunnies and NPCs they did a great job at holding them in place to let me get in a  decent position to attempt to flank them.\n\nAll in all out of my approximately 5 hours I can say it is fun.  It manages to be like so many other similar games, but does manage to pull off a few things that have an unique feel  to them.\n\nNow if I can just figure out how to to use the manual drilling machine for Ore and Crude Oil.   I have had to move mine around placing it on sand as it says it requires to find such items but with around 15 minutes of drilling I only got a single barrel of crude oil and a piece of clay.\n\nAll of these things I am sure will improve.

New guns, POIs, and \"content drops\" isn't what this game requires.

It's 10x worse than this game right now in this state.\n\n- Progression, Crafting Recipes, Tiers of Loot, Various Ways of XP Gain, Car Crafting and Customization, Horde Defense (All exceeded my expectations.)\n\n- The game already has a bunch of content in it, so even after 50 hours, I still haven't reached the true endgame.\n(I can raid and get raided, but I still haven't fully finished all the content for the wipe.)\n\n- The negative reviews are people with less than a few hours complaining about server capacity (they added more servers) and performance issues, which I know for a fact will get fixed soon.\n\n- Playing solo or with a squad is fun; however, when it comes to farming and progress, the bigger the group, the easier it gets.\n\nSo I would say give it a try, and you won't regret it. I have 1000 hours on Rust, and this game knocks rust out of the park already.

The sheer amount of content can sometimes be overwhelming, which is fantastic. As of now, I'm writing this review at the game's launch, so I highly recommend giving it a try if you're a fan of this genre. The game is actively being updated. However, if it gets abandoned (as sometimes happens), I'll change my review to negative.\n\nFOR DEVELOPERS:\nObvious bugs such as: the sound of vehicle destruction can be heard from a kilometer away when another player is just passing by, server lags, etc.\n\nRecommendations from a player who values this genre and is also a game developer:\n1. TTK (Time to Kill) is very long. Gunfights with many players are chaotic because players die slowly, quickly revive teammates, and throw down spawns. Mostly, the team with more players wins. Like in Rust, going 1 against 3 is almost impossible. To do so, you have to be significantly more advanced than your opponents.\n2. Weapon balance is terrible. If you have a spear (especially a non-standard color that's easy to find), you can skip all weapons up to the first SMGs and shotguns.\n3. There's a significant lack of item descriptions, like for electronics (how much power they consume or other stats) and clothing (how much protection they offer). You have to craft them blindly to figure out which is better.\n4. Raiding is terrible. If your house is made of stone (you're in trouble). Stone houses don't degrade quickly, so it's frustrating that a clan can come and wipe you out with one drill.\n5. Household chores take up a lot of time. Inventory windows open slowly, and moving items around is clunky. If you try to move something between cells and miss, it just won't move. Over time, it becomes more comfortable to loot with the right mouse button and then manage everything in one inventory. Overall, more quality-of-life features would be appreciated since it's a significant part of the game.\n6. Player movement feels sticky and takes some time to get used to. Movement speed should be increased; during gunfights, it feels like you're shooting at boulders instead of humans trying to survive at any cost.\n7. Electronics. I haven't played with them much, but there's a HUGE lack of DETAILED explanations of how specific logic chains work, and there are balance issues.\n8. Graphics. For a game at launch, it looks not bad. But the draw distance for textures is strange. When running around a house on Ultra settings, you can see the texture on walls change just 5 meters away from you.\n9. Animations are very rough, unfortunately. Add mini-games for gathering wood and stone. In Rust, this was done to break up the monotony. Here, it feels even more tedious than in Rust.\n10. Ore spawn is spread uniformly and randomly across the map. It would be better to create more concentrated zones, making it more enjoyable to mine rather than running from one metal ore to another every 30-60 seconds. Very few oil clusters.\n11. Regarding server lags and hit registration, I won't even comment; it's a complete mess, and you probably see it for yourself. The only thing I'd suggest is to make NPC animations less sharp and jerky. Even with decent hit registration, it's challenging to aim at an enemy whose head can change its position within a frame.\n12. Loot is weird. Sometimes you farm wood and stone for half an hour, and then in a random barrel by the road, you find the same resources but in larger quantities. Overall, I'd introduce more progression in terms of the quantity of extracted volume, either through skills or the type of axe/pickaxe, but it should be somewhat noticeable. There's a massive spawn of building blocks; I can literally build a concrete house after looting 1-2 RTs. If I progressed and unlocked concrete through levels, I would have had to play another 10 hours. The same applies to weapons.\n13. Random tanks on the roadside. Please remove this; it's very, very dumb. Clans that just joined the game, without a base or clothing, just run around looking for these tanks and, early in the game, come to a solo player and decimate him.\n14. The mouse constantly drifts to the second screen, and even when it's turned off, the cursor sometimes appears in the corners of the screen when you move the mouse quickly to the side. (this problem is not on all devices and not on all screen resolutions)\n15. External walls and gates: make it possible to position them relative to each other at different angles, not just 90 and 180 degrees. The lighthouse zone is round, and it would be nice to design accordingly. Currently, players use foundations and tall 2x2 walls for a building instead of external walls because the cost of external walls and gates is just unreasonable.\n16. Make tasks more abstract: instead of \"build a wooden foundation\", simply \"build a foundation\", as often you progress faster than the tasks. There's also an issue with being strictly tied to crafting on a specific workbench; you can't complete a task by crafting a bandage on an advanced medical station \u2013 you need to do it on the starter one. There's a very low progression of experience for tasks; the further you go, the reward of experience points should increase to motivate players to complete them.\n17. Ether shards. There are so many of them that every level requires you to mindlessly click through studies.\n18. Beacon rewards. Unfortunately, NPCs cannot navigate on foundations, and it's an issue since no one mentions it anywhere. It's unclear which block can be placed where.\n19. Overall, battling NPCs looks very odd; they appear dumb and laggy. It's satisfying to kite an armored bot, but on the other hand, the rest of the gameplay seems odd. Starting bots do not instill any fear even when you only have fists and are naked; they are easy to trick regardless of their strength. (not counting medium or strong bots; their special skills don\u2019t compensate for their helplessness)\n20. There are constantly some strange noises, like someone stomping with one foot every 5-10 seconds. The crafting sound is also very annoying; the ticking doesn't provide any useful information and is merely irritating. Overall, please pay attention to the sounds; they play a significant yet uncomplicated role in the game's atmosphere.\n\nFor now, this isn't all the information. If you find my recommendations useful, you can contact me privately for more details.

My two ultimate favorites are Ark and 7 Days to Die. I have been craving a new game as 7 Days can get very repetitive and Ark Ascended was a huge disappointment - over taxing on my PC with almost no new content for a full-game price - no thank you! I tried The Front because it's a new, early access, open world survival game. Immediately I noticed the performance was way better. While it's not as graphically as beautiful as Ark, it is actually playable. Ark Ascended is so poorly optimized and so graphics heavy that even with an i9 and a 2080 super, I cannot run it without significant lag. However, The Front runs without issue, without any video adjustments. Just out of the box, this game performs far better. It also looks better than 7 Days, so graphically, I would consider it an inbetween that will probably improve further over time. \n\nAs far as game content goes, the quest or \"task\" system is very robust. There are many many different avenues for leveling talents and learning new skills and abilities in weapons, gear, building, etc. The building is fairly intuitive and similar to Ark. The only downside I see so far is the inability to pick up building pieces after they are placed and the inability to stack building pieces. However, with the addition of new pieces for building, this may be an issue that resolves itself over time as the game develops. \n\nThe map is pretty large and the resources drive you to move around the map and explore, which I like. Especially since there is a vehicle crafting system that I have yet to dive into but I am sure will make map traversal even more fun. \n\nThe server system is nice. I created a solo/self-hosted server on my own PC - similar to self-hosting on 7 days - and the amount of very easily accessed server customization built into their UI automatically was incredible. Every minute detail can be custom set, from XP/Loot multipliers, food rates, HP, self-NPC-PVP damages, etc. They can scale wildly to create some very custom servers. This will definitely be a versatile game that will accommodate both high-action PVP survivalists and those PVE-preferred survivors, like me with ease. \n\nAll in all, this is well worth the cost to get in on the ground floor and participate early on.

For the quality it brings, every single dollar is worth this game. BUT THATS IT. \n\nPositives: its the tame, tower defense version of Rust, where the focus is no longer being toxic and raiding other players, but it's a combination of self defense in raids and self-defense from players. It's more difficult to raid a location than to bring the raid to you, so it gives a sense of novice security when first starting off in a PVP setting. That's where $20 is worth it. It starts to fall off when you realize that there is no sound cue's in the game whatsoever. EVEN WHEN YOU GET SHOT, you don't hear yourself get shot. You barely even hear the autoturret that targeted you 50m away. But that's not the main problem.\n\nThe Follower system is no where near what anybody expects it to be. Every aspect that you'd think a follower would use, like the Bike Generator, or the Manual Miner, or the Crude Mineshafts, is unapplicable. But the workbenches the player uses and where it's already automated by crafting times and recipes? That's where the followers are used. They can also be used for tower defense, which would be nice, except that means these expendable humans that take at least 5 minutes each to attain can die within 2 minutes of any enemy interaction, play er or not.\n\nThe so called introductory \"lore\" given to the player is that they are apart of a \"resistance\" that has this mission of taking down the rise of a \"tyrannical\" empire. And after 40 hours on one server and producing enough resources to complete this main mission, you start to realize that the Front suffers from the same chronological curve as the Starfield; it should not take 30 hours to 50 hours for the game to get interesting. You HAVE to play on 3x XP or higher dedicated servers to see any type of story progression within the first week of playing. However, to give them some leeway, this is probably how they don't want the player to experience. So the lets stay specific to the Official Servers, where measurements and specifics are controlled by the devs themselves.\n\nEvery single PVP Official Server by The Front is given a Wipe Date. You won't experience the end within this time. \nEvery single PVE Server is given a *1 Gathering Rate, which means you will spend at least 50 hours to get to the story.\n\nPlay it for 20 dollars, nothing more.", "timestamp_created": 1698286758, "timestamp_updated": 1698286758, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604112863540649414", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148059537": {"recommendationid": "148059537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066035064", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1697333705}, "language": "english", "review": "This game seems great; PLEASE ADD FOV SETTING!", "timestamp_created": 1697083950, "timestamp_updated": 1697083950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601737856864929199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148050945": {"recommendationid": "148050945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071048926", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 9135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1698264793}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes.

As it stands right now most of the systems in the game straight up either do not work or are so bugged that it just causes frustration to play the game instead of fun. Vehicles are extremely slow and the weapon systems do not work, they also take multiple hours to build. A machine gun should fire more than 1 bullet every 30-60 seconds. The Raid system is cool if it works but fact of the matter is that NPC's get stuck all the time. When they aren't stuck they have a tendency to fall through the ground making you wait out the entire raid round before it completes. The gun mechanics are stupid. Why does the scope have separate sway from the barrel? Why do i have a ramp up time to sprint? The character talents offer nothing unique to the game and can be ignored. This game is a massive dumpster fire of shotty development and i have tried out every aspect of the game. Its really not worth purchasing until they fixed the massive amount of bugs. My last straw was when i logged in on my PVE server account to find half my buildings missing but the wire are still connected because the developers are so trash they deleted most people buildings. With devs this stupid i estimate about 2 years before the game is playable and NO this is not a Rust killer type game.
