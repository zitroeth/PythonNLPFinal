So here we are.\n\n[h1]This is an Early Access review of v0.4.3, and can only attest to what was in the game as of June 2017.[/h1]\n\nThe Wild Eight is a co-op survival game where you play one of eight characters (each having a different strength), who have survived a plane crash in a snow-filled forest. You can play in single player perfectly adequately, or play with a group to survive and explore together. It focuses on exploration and survival (food, water, temperature and monsters), with a small amount of building (just a couple of set items) and crafting. Whilst the world and the items are quite limited at the moment, it really excels in atmosphere and some of the indoor locations are fantastic. Creepy, interesting and surprising in some ways - I'm not putting any spoilers here though! There is a quest system, but the game can be played fairly openly, you're not obligated to follow the order directed at all.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Beautiful graphics\n[*] Eerie and fitting soundtrack\n[*] Tough survival, but has two modes and the easier difficulty is much more forgiving\n[*] Proper co-op survival where you work together.\n[*] A fair few different inside/building locales, with some surprises in store\n[*] Quite a few different items\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons: (Remember this is for June 2017 build - I anticipate most of these being addressed)[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Early Access\n[*] Currently fairly limited amount of monsters\n[*] The outside world looks very similar\n[*] Whilst survival (food/water/heat/outside animals) feels balanced, there are a few special monsters that feel VERY tough right now.\n[*] Multiplayer can currently be a bit laggy.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Is it worth it?[/h1]\n\nI was one of the 1200 folks to back this game on Kickstarter and I was pretty sad it didn't make any of the stretch goals, and barely got through at all. Nothing I've kickstarted has released on time, and this game is no exception, with a kickstarter release date of Dec 2016 (EA keys were sent in Feb 2017). I was a little disappointed back in February, but the recent bunker update was fantastic. It has made some decent progress since that date, and to me, the existing game is now worth the money - with the promise of much more to come so I'm happy to recommend it.\n\nIt's a game that needs more - more items, more locations, more monsters - but I'm pleased with the core of this game, happy I supported it on Kickstarter and happy to recommend it.\n\n[h1]Thumbs up - and massively looking forward to this progressing into a full game.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1498314786, "timestamp_updated": 1498314786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 698, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90348052978515625", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138203030": {"recommendationid": "138203030", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975523595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1683874989}, "language": "english", "review": "WARNING: ABANDONED GAME\n\nYet another abandoned game that had great potential and would be great even today, except as usual\nthere are many game breaking bugs that were never fixed for 5+ years.\n- Items randomly disappear\n- Crafting an item fails; the end item poofs but you also lose the hard earned resources\n- Nothing in the game seems to respawn and yet you're expected to survive not to mention the game touts\nthat it is built for multiple people; this makes it unsustainable for even 1 player\n- Saves are randomly wiped\n- Corruption of files between coop players\n- Interface fails to update skills bought and forces a restart of the game\n- Many \"skills\" don't actually function and were reported 3+ years ago from the date of this review\n- No real precise or comprehensive information to find out things about the game; trial an error is the only\nway and often is extremely obtuse.\n\nAnyway, another bummer in the massive floating bummer pile.", "timestamp_created": 1683924080, "timestamp_updated": 1683924080, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.884828031063079834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87753597": {"recommendationid": "87753597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016602204", "num_games_owned": 656, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1427, "last_played": 1614721201}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY! [/h1]\nI have bought this game as a part of humble bundle deal. The funny thing is that I actually wanted to try this game for a long time now. And now that I had chance to play it, I'm seriously disappointed. The short version, the devs abandoned this game long time ago without fixing important bugs and mechanics. This game isn't worth your money or time. If you want the long version, continue reading...\n---\n[u][b]1) Bugs, bugs everywhere...[/b][/u]\nImmediately after starting the game, you start to notice things like quest markers not disappearing after you finish the quest (this happens randomly and that's why I think it's a bug).\nSome quests are tied to a certain item and the quest won't be marked as \"done\" until you interact with that item - most of the time it's some unimportant item such as muffin or similar thing you don't need when you reach certain level. But because the quest will stay active until you pick up that one specific object, you spend your time throwing items on the ground and picking up everything in the area, one by one.\n\n[u][b]2) Organized mess...[/b][/u]\nInteraction with items and objects is pain in the a$$. Simply put, when there's multiple items or objects close together, you have to slowly and carefully move your mouse over the few pixels to try to pick whatever you actually want to interact with. Or you can just pick everything and throw everything you don't want on the ground later. However, this doesn't work with objects (chests, etc...) and won't be possible when you have full inventory and need only that one specific item before you can go because you're trying to save your bacon by picking up wood, so you can make campfire and not freeze to death. Or you're trying to pick that weapon you threw instead of firing a pistol (because the weapon switch didn't work again for some reason), so you can protect yourself against wolfs.\nYou can't even divide items into individual stacks. For example, you need to take some ammo with you but you want to leave half behind just in case you would get killed again by \"wasteland 2\" status that came out of nowhere and you froze to death in a spot that you can't reach ever again to pick up your things because now you're freezing to death 2 rectangles on map earlier then before. So, if you managed to stack items that you didn't want to stack, you're fu*ked and you will never be able to divide that stack again. \n\n[u][b]3) Freezing in Arctica? Duh...[/b][/u]\nUnfortunately, the game freezes randomly for a split second even with the strongest hardware. Mostly at times when you're under attack and you need your reaction time to be as fast as possible. Or, as mentioned above, you're suddenly out of the map borders you're supposed to stay in, but the game registered that just now. In that case, say goodbye to all of the leather, ammo, vapor 3 suits you managed to loot in the last bunker, because you'll never be able to reach the spot you just died in ever again (even with multiple personal heaters after you finally managed to find a blueprint for it).\n\n[u][b]4) range combat is pointless[/b][/u]\nThere are constant issues with terrain, moving targets and disappearing arrows. Basically, if you want to hit anything and kill it before it reaches you, you need to:\n     [u][b]A) Be on a flat area -[/b][/u] if you're fighting something while the target is standing on even the smallest rock, your shot won't hit it. To ensure that you're going to hit your target, you need to stand on the same level as the target and the target needs to stay still.\n     [u][b]B) Use a pistol -[/b] [/u]if you're using his and arrows, you'll soon find out that not every time you try to shoot the arrow actually gets shot. Sometimes it just disappears immediately after you click your mouse and if you're fighting a mutant, you just lost precious shot that could save your life.\n     [u][b]C) make sure the target is not moving -[/b] [/u]if you're trying to hit a moving target, you won't hit it. The reliable and basically the only way how to fight with long range weapons is to agro the poor thing you're trying to kill and then take as many shots as you can while it's running towards you.\n\n[u][b]5) consumables or quest items? [/b][/u]\nAfter you reach dynamite section, you'll find out that even the quest items are consumables. And if you managed to use them all before you unlocked that next section, you're pretty much fu*ked and you need to start the game from the beginning again. And if you do start the game again, you will be afraid to use anything that you can't craft just because it may be another quest related consumable you'll need later to progress further.\n\n[u][b]6) crafting in a survival game, checked... What do you mean \"it's not good\"?[/b][/u]\nUnfortunately, this is one of those games that has crafting system implemented just because it's expected to be. The crafting system is a mess. You often spend several minutes (even hours, if your looking for chemicals and other rare ingredients) trying to gather ingredients for that thing you want to make, just to find out that the loot you got during the grind is way better than whatever you'll make. \nAnother issue is that the cost isn't worth the item you're trying to craft. For example, if you want to craft basic bone arrows, you need just wood and bones. Pretty simple and easy to get. But if you want to upgrade to steel arrows, later in the game, you need wood, some leather strips and processed steel (steel is made by mining ore, forging it to iron and forging it again with no extra item. Thus, creating steel. Tadaaa). If you're a standard rpg player, you'll check what the improvent is if you're going to replace the old item with the improved version. In this case, you would find out that your damage output while using his would improve by 3. Which is basically nothing and combined with the disappearing arrows and targeting system I mentioned before, it makes one of the most useless and most expensive upgrades in the game.\nAnother issue with the crafting system is if you spent several minutes to gather the material you need for that specific item and then click on something else by mistake, you can't cancel the crafting process. You're forced to watch the loading animation showing how you're wasting valuable resources on something you don't want and probably don't have any use for. Multiple times I just stared at the screen, watching my precious recourses being wasted on something else, just because the crafting menu suddenly changed because you just used last piece of that thing you need to make the other thing and didn't notice in time (the crafting menu changes based on the materials you have in your inventory. The things you can currently make are the first in the menu).\n\n[u][b]7) legendary permanents[/b][/u]\nChests, campfire and forges are the three objects you need to build at some point in the game. Unfortunately, these objects can't be removed - ever. That means, if you managed to build a forge in a spot which, for example, prevents a gate from opening (one specific quest made me really furious), you will never get past that gate. Or, for example, if you were forced to build a campfire in hurry, to avoid freezing to death, you just created a permanent marker on your map. If this sounds like a joke to you, imagine how showing this gets after a few hours in the game, when you're looking for a specific marker on your map, because you can't create your own, temporary marker. That's right. This game won't allow you to create a custom marker so you can easily reach the spot you want but if will create a marker everytime you build a campfire.\n\n---\nTher are other issues I could write about (for example the deer sled issue and how you can't reconnect it with a new deer if you managed to lose your original deer to hunger - you simply need to create a new sled) but let's be honest...

I'm going to be firm but fair on this one - this game was really good at the time I was playing it, but that was many months-to-years ago. These days, alas, the only thing wild about this game is the codebase which now seems to have grown weeds, and there's an old rusted lawnmower out front. The lawnmower has no gas. If you ever want to know what the term \"bitrot\" means then this game is a prime example.\n\nI'll describe it as it once was: You're stuck in a plane crash on a desolate tundra with only your wits and your teammates to survive. You'll have to navigate forests and hunt wild game to find food, and keep the fires lit to stay warm. It's intense survival and it's really engaging just doing that by itself. To top it all off there's something mysterious about this landscape...something eerie and unsettling. Finding an old abandoned bunker you can't help but wonder what happened to the inhabitants of this facility, or what sinister experiments they were engaged in. Alarmingly the reactor that powered this old base has been badly damaged and the cooling systems are unreliable. It's more an annoyance but you have to constantly keep tabs on that reactor to make sure it doesn't breach. It's an annoyance you will tend to though because the alternative is frankly beyond your worst nightmares. Over time you'll come to find the dark truth behind this bizarre depraved experiment...\n\nNow I'll describe it as it is: You get stuck in walls a lot. Chopping down trees tends to throw wood up into the upper stratosphere where it floats tantalizingly in the air and out of reach. Walking into rooms sometimes leaves you in a void in the ceiling where you'll spend the rest of eternity wondering where the map went. That really cool piece of equipment that you found? Yeah, goodnight. That awesome equipment is stuck in the bottom of a pit that you can't possibly reach without turning yourself into pulpy rockface sauce. Worse yet is when it's critical to the story and you can only camp around the hole cursing yourself for going out at night. Then you reload the game only to find the save game is corrupted and you spawn in the outer reaches of the uninitialized memory with items floating around everywhere...and your legs where your head used to be. The dark truth behind this mystery is that they didn't implement software testing, and the horror that awaits is JIRA. I'll spoil the story; the mysterious missing inhabitants are \"the development staff\". The staff seem to have gone for a long lunch. They've been out to lunch for...over a year now? The lasagna must be really good or something.\n\nI can't say I've ever seen a game that's developed in reverse before, and certainly not like this. Games are supposed to become more polished and more complete over time but this one seems to have gotten worse. At some point I'll assume Frank threw his hands in the air and said, \"Ah fuck it, the code is crap. Let's have a beer.\" They never recovered from the hangover. At one point I would have recommended this game but I can only recommend it now if you're interested in seeing the result of bad software process in action. You might also enjoy it if you like gazing at logs and deer skins floating out in the upper stratosphere when you should be building a tent. Sometimes the logs you'll be staring at are actually crashdumps, and I do loves me choppin' some dem' illegal memory access exceptions.\n\n-5/10 Gravity goes downwards normally.\n-10/10 Doors should lead to the other side of the door, not oblivion.\n-inf/10 Software testing is not a \"desirable\".\n\nBuyer beware: Thar be bugs in them there snowy hills...", "timestamp_created": 1621134088, "timestamp_updated": 1621134088, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 197, "votes_funny": 53, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866418004035949707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35707875": {"recommendationid": "35707875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152623058", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 922, "last_played": 1540753127}, "language": "english", "review": "14 hours into the game with my husband, and I'm not sure what issues people are referring to, that make the game \"unplayable\".

Really impressed with the amount of interaction that the DEVs have with their players and the good vibes of the forums.\n\nThe following are my issues with the game itself.

Well just make a chest, but be prepared to have it displayed on your map forever with no way of knowing if you actually have emptied all those items in that chest. Not to mention campfires [i](not as much of a problem as they have a purpose for traveling people, but it is an issue when too many are crafted in the same area)[/i] and Furnaces [i](who wants to travel 15 blocks just to use a furnace that you build a couple hours ago?)[/i] You don't need to get refunded many resources if any at all, just let us destroy them please.\n[/code]\n[code]\nItem Scattering - Please, don't make our items that we mine with a tool [i](with a full inventory)[/i] scatter around us effectively blocking us from moving or crafting [i](issue happened with Ore)[/i] leaving us to die a cold and unforgivable death [i](unless you have a buddie rushing to come over to pick up a section of the wall)[/i].

Gifting him wooden shoes/armor will get you adrenaline shots and clothing? This has got to be a bug since you guys specifically mention in the quest that higher quality items will yield better rewards... but it doesn't. I mean this is a great way to farm gear early game but it\u2019s pretty game breaking when you gift him a couple sets of steel armor and you only have a hat and two bone knifes to show for it.

At this time it had only been released for several days. While I was more sold on the idea, my friend was hesitant because of some prior early access titles that were a huge letdown. The reviews implied that there were bugs, sketchy multiplayer servers, and some \u201cboring\u201d gameplay. After winning a bet with my friend, he decided to buy the game. We spawned into a server together and the game ran very well. We were almost immediately immersed, taking on our roles as airplane crashed survivors. After building a riddled tent and a shelter to make some tools, we began a small journey around the snowy woods. We spotted a rabbit. We chased it, throwing rocks at it and yelling. The rabbit got away. It was at this moment our stomachs began growling and our feet were turning purple. We died before making it back to camp. So we started over. \n\nAfter figuring out the basics, we set up a large and upgraded campsite, got a stockpile of food, and made ourselves some high tier clothes and weapons. This process took around a couple hours. Our new goal was to complete a series of quests and to discover what was on the map. I have to say, the map size and variability on The Wild Eight is very impressive. It immediately brought me back to my days on Terraria. We would get back from an hour long adventure and see that we only discovered about 5% of the total map size. \n\nPros:\nHuge map with lots of variables and procedurally generated content.\nAn actual storyline and main / side quests to be completed.\nBesides forest, areas exist such as caves, old facilities, and abandoned towns.  \nChallenging gameplay, where hunger drains rapidly and the cold always lingers.\nSmooth graphics, 60 fps, and a great top-down engine. \nA soundtrack that is relaxing during the good times, and terrifying in the bad. \nA variety of NPC animals both to hunt, and to hunt you. Boss battles as well. \n\nCons (most cons are only there because of early access bugs):\nAnimations sometimes are glitchy. Your axe will swing a foot away from your arm, ECT. \nThe animals will sometimes be out of sync with you and other players. My friend was killed by an animal that he couldn\u2019t see and I could. He would swing at an animal when it appears 10 feet away. \nThere is also building bugs between players. I sometimes can\u2019t see structures that my friend builds.\n\nAll in all, the gameplay is very challenging. If you die, your character\u2019s leveling / building progress restarts and you have to loot your body for the gear you had. I would highly recommend to not play by yourself. On Saturday my friend and I got the game. We played for 13 hours straight. We still have lots more to do and discover. Bugs exist in this early state, but nothing game breaking. No crashes or failed saves or anything. If you enjoy survival games like Rust, a cooperative experience, and an adventure such as Terraria, then The Wild Eight, a 20 dollar price tag, is fully worth it and I highly recommend.\n\nUPDATE: We played in stretches for a couple more days and are now taking a break. We finished most main missions and discovered most of the map. Admittedly, we both rage quit after losing max gear / levels lol. We are awaiting further updates.

It's advertised as something a lot more than what it is. The actual end product is an unfinished game that lacks depth and any sense of purpose or proper progression. Avoid unless you like to be bored by a clunky unfinished prototype.\n\n\n\nThis is another one of those games that seems nice on the surface and from the trailers but is utterly unfinished and lacks any sort of proper depth, sense of progression or balancing of mechanics or side quests. \nI wouldn't even call this a finished game to be honest. \n\nThe game starts out alright at the beginning. It seems very basic from the get go but you get the impression that there could be something cool here. Unfortunately you're faced with the reality of a clearly unfinished product within the first few hours of gameplay though. I wish I noticed it a bit earlier so I could have asked for a refund but I kept hoping that it was just rough at the start and would kick in to gear eventually...but that never happened.\n\nYou've pretty much seen it all in the first couple of hours and the rest is just repetition of those poorly planned and balanced mechanics until you're bored out of your mind.\n\nMost of the mechanics seem to be implemented on a level of depth you'd expect from an early prototype where the developer is still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't. In addition to the poorly implemented mechanics there seems to be no proper balancing of them either. \n\nYou get a ridiculous amount of loot but the inventory system is utterly terrible and you have to keep juggling constantly to be able to keep the stuff you want. \nYou have combat but it's really clunky and the skills for it are the most basic things you could imagine. Add \"x\" amount of damage to your attacks. Don't get me wrong, that could be an unlock...it's just that there hardly is anything with more depth than that. Forget about any sort of tactics or alternatives to \"click on the creature until it's dead\"-tactic.\nThere's crafting but it's so simple and boring there's hardly any sense of progression at all. You pretty much unlock better gear by finding more of the same resource you find everywhere, yay. There are some resources that require a bit more effort to find but that's a very small consolation.\n\nThe side quests usually have some sort of story but they seem so pointless that half the time you don't even realize you finished the quest until you don't know what to do next. These side quests sometimes give you some item you might need in the main quest but you have no idea of knowing that until the end. Mostly you just find lots and lots of meaningless loot that you'll struggle to carry with you.\n\nThe world map is pretty huge but it's mostly empty wilderness with some random buildings here and there with loot. Loot you don't really need most of the time.\n\nI simply continued playing this after the first few hours to get it out of my backlog and I can hardly say it was enjoyable.\n\nI know this review is very harsh and there are surely some good parts in the game (such as the art) as well it's just that this game is such a poor execution as a whole. It's a real shame because I think this could have been good with a properly cohesive plan and vision but what was deemed \"finished\" seems more like an incoherent, clunky prototype that doesn't really know what it's trying to be.", "timestamp_created": 1581373280, "timestamp_updated": 1581373280, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803443670272827148", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120657280": {"recommendationid": "120657280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405770185", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 1050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1037, "last_played": 1674789367}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved this game so much, but the dev's dropping it is SO upsetting. it is hard to recommend a game that is abandoned. this game had so much potential too :(", "timestamp_created": 1660542975, "timestamp_updated": 1660542975, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801989257335662842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38388384": {"recommendationid": "38388384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000876770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1484, "last_played": 1569683883}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello, i feel like this game could be great fun, that is why i wanted to leave a feedback, might as well do it here. I only click yes because i trust this is a WIP and there is still a lot to look forward to.\n\nAs for the positive traits:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-a large enough map, random elements too\n-the quests are fun enough when you play them for the first time\n-character progression keeps you busy for a while\n\nNegative would be:\n-Not much fun to play with random people, because there are no means to interact(simple chat, and you can drop items, thats it)\n-The quests are the same every time you do them, they may spawn in a different location, but it changes nothing\n-Map is not endless, you reach the border of it and you die, this was the thing i tested straight away when i launched it for the first time.\n-There are 2 actual structures you can build - workshop and tent. Survive this.\n\nThis game really lacks depth, like: \n\n-diversified crafting(everything in 1 place, seriously? crafting is a great jewel of any survival game, you cant just ignore it)\n\n-more building options(there should be an option to live in a tent, other than that i think player should be able to build whatever he wants, put whatever he wants in the room and make a building whatever he wants it to be) \n\n-psychological aspects(buffs, debuffs, moods and stuff, or you might just replace all your characters with robots - might be more fun)\n\n-actual traumas(not just health bar, permanent injuries and deseases included, why is there medecine added to this game?)\n\n-more interaction options(this is a co-op game, after all, so basic stuff like tagging other players, radio beacons, inspecting other players, custom written biography would be a highly recommended addition, to my mind)\n\n-definately character customization options(i d expect to see people in characters i am playing: with traits, skills, personalities and not simple pawns, i mean even strategy games have much more \"realistic\" and \"alive\" characters, even though you dont play them directly. As for character development, it should be about chosing, not about grinding xp then purchasing a skill that everyone else will master too)\n\n-somewhat real animals(who give milk, wool, eggs, whatever. Tamed animals behave wierd, but it doesnt matter, they are pretty much useless anyway, just a carriage you cant even ride, or just a pet wolf that ll run around a bit and die imminently, because you cant train it. Cant feed them vegetables or meat either - only special food, and deer cant just eat his share of grass, or whatever it eats naturally, while wolves lose their ability to hunt when they become tame - not much fun)\n\n-temperature is important in a survival game(one temperature bar and a fireplace(and furnace) is not enough, it seems the temperature is always exactly the same throughout the whole game, and you can just run around in a t shirt, periodically lighting up a fire. Have you ever been anywhere beyond california? it gets colder in winter in alaska and its pretty much green for a few months in summer)\n\n-electricity(so you have 5 generators with you, and you cant use them, you keep chopping that wood and throwing it into the fire)\n\nAt least this is what i d expect from a survival game with RPG elements, and nothing less.\nI actually had no idea you cant even build a simple wall in here when i bought it, i mean there are structures on the screenshots. You cant even enter your shelter (character disappears into it, what?), cant sleep without wood either, why? I ve played for about 25 hours, i got some of the characters to max, did most of the quests, there are literally no reason i should play again ...yet.\nI hope this game will receive some new features so it doesnt feel like you do exactly the same thing over and over again if you start a new game.", "timestamp_created": 1513551187, "timestamp_updated": 1513599566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800353109836578369", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50309125": {"recommendationid": "50309125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107910983", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2591, "last_played": 1658593286}, "language": "english", "review": "My wife and I are having a lot of fun playing this game after the kids are in bed.

Keeping an eye on development, watching youtubers play it and just overall trying to get a feel for it. Deciding whether or not it was the game for me.\n\nWell after a few years of watching development here and there, my friend and I decided to finally give in and purchase it while it was on sale for $13.00.\n\nWe tried. We really did try to give it a chance. The game just kind of throws you into this wilderness and then tells you how to do some basic things in the game. After about 10 minutes, your mission objective is just \"Find where the power lines lead\". So we did that, we followed them for probably 30 to 40 minutes because they branch off in different directions and have dead ends.\n\nSo we finally found the end and the next objective was.... follow the second power lines.\n\nSo my friend and I said no thanks and we got into the survival and crafting aspect. \n\nThe main problem with this game is everything is very simplified. I don't like games being really complicated and I don't want them to be a mobile type game with basic features. Unfortunately, this game feels like the latter. \n\nA lot of craftable items comes from hunting animals who have a random chance to drop certain things you need to progress. So you hunt boars, wolves, deer, foxes and rabbits. After two hours in, that's all I saw, also a werewolf inside a bunker for some reason that we just avoided.\n\nI'm sure there's a few more enemies further in and lots of different items. The whole world just feels empty and pointless. I was kind of hoping for The Long Dark kind of experience but in co-op form, but that's not what I got. \n\nWhat we got was a very basic, buggy and minimum content game. At two hours in, I'm already able to craft 70% of items and can already see what else there is. It's very formulaic. Leather > Metal > Crystals is basically the tiers of progression for armor, weapons and tools. Nothing felt challenging, just tedious.\n\nWanted to like it, I really did, but for $13 and especially for the default price of $24.99, totally not worth it.

That's it, there's really nothing further required to perpetually sustain your hunger. If the animal doesn't fight back you just have to chase it down and beat it to death, if it does fight back you can heal the damage by eating its flesh after it's dead. To keep warm all you have to do is periodically build a fire out of extremely basic resources you get from punching trees, stand by the fire for a brief period and now you're warm again. That's it, that's all the survival. There is a crafting system but you find so many premade items in buildings that there's little point to it. By the way, was playing on the highest difficulty which the developers claim is meant for experienced players. Yet was easily able to perpetually survive with basic beginner knowledge of the most rudimentary systems of the game that's how imbalanced it is.\n\nAs an adventure game, all you do is run around the wilderness tracking down quest locations where you then acquire a new quest marker that leads you to a random somewhere else. That's basically it, yet again. All you do is just wander around the extremely visually repetitive wilderness looting generic points of interest while you knock off vague quest objectives.\n\nThe combat is lazy, and boring. Can't really dodge enemy attacks or perform any kind of actual combat at all. You just hit the enemy until they die while they hit you until they die, it's just a damage race. Aiming attacks is awkward, the hitboxes are awkward and overly small. Can't even stealth or try to preemptively avoid enemies since they see you immediately, yet they're barely a threat since all you have to do is outrun them or juke them around an obstruction with little effort to get away.\n\nThere's little depth to the game systems at all. There's not much point to craft many things, to make traps or perform any traditional survival strategies or varied gameplay mechanics. Just wander around damage racing animals to death and looting quest locations. There is a level up system but the perks you unlock are extremely generic and uninteresting, the unlocking system is very poorly paced and in general you can unlock stuff almost as fast as it is made available.\n\nThe game is filled with lots of little glitches, even after the game has undergone an extensive early access and also has been patched aggressively since launch because it was so glitchy.\n\nWorst of all really though is how absolutely stupid this game is on a design level. You can't craft sticks without a workshop, you can't craft sticks. You can't craft throwing rocks, out of rocks, without a workshop. You can create a workshop with your bare hands but you can't turn rocks into throwing rocks without a workshop. By the way throwing rocks are just rocks but with a slightly different graphic. You can't craft any tools without a workshop yet you can only make one workshop, so if you want to take it with you you have to set it up and pack it up every single time you want to craft. The same applies to your level up station, you can only make one of it and have to unpack and repack it everytime you want to use it. Alternatively you can anchor your base to one location, that location probably being the hub bunker that you find almost immediately after crash landing into the wilderness that sure is convenient. You can't build your structures in the hub bunker where it's warm and modern though, you have to build your camp outside the hub bunker and sit out in the cold while a fully furnished research bunker with a living room that has couches and tables is directly beside you. And again, even if you choose to set up a base the cosmos won't allow you to build anymore workshops or level up stations so that becomes the only place you can perform basic character functions. This is all just so dumb conceptually.\n\nAlso rabbits are immune to being stunned by a rock being thrown at them. The description of throwing rocks is that they can be used to stun animals, yet one of the smallest most vulnerable animals in the wilderness is immune to them. And boars are immune to tasers. So what is the point of trying to stun anything or do anything even remotely interesting when it takes more effort and doesn't work, versus just running up to the animal and murdering it with a baseball bat.\n\nWalking against a solid object won't cause your character to stop walking, they'll just keep walking in place. There's no fluctuation in the characters animations for how fast they are walking, slow walking and running have the same animation. You can slip and fly off a ledge at absurd velocities, and the game calculates your fall damage based on how long you fall regardless of whether you fall down vertically or diagonally. So if you fall off a two meter drop, but get flung off diagonally for six meters because of the broken physics; the game will act as if you straight up fell six meters and damages you accordingly. When food on the fire is done cooking, it just falls onto the ground unceremoniously. All of the above are very basic quality flaws that competent developers routinely avoid. Even something so amateurish as the game visibly spawning players in the air at the start of each map, which is how developers stop players from potentially phasing through the floor on spawn but competent developers find a way to hide it. Spawning the player visibly in the air so that they fall down a foot as the game loads them into the map is something you see in shoddy free games.\n\nThe pacing of the whole thing is just bad, wake up from a plane crash with no real exposition. Immediately find bunkers and science labs in the wilderness with no exposition. Immediately set out on a quest to perpetually track down new bunkers over and over with no exposition. There's nothing interesting or engaging about any of this on a story based level. Giant green misty barrels of goofy toxic sludge with an anthropomorphic wolf guarding them, how is any of this meant to be taken seriously or be immersive at all.\n\nThere's eight characters and only two of them are female. Caucasian female or not caucasian female. What variety.\n\n\nThis is just really not good. As a survival game it's lazy, extremely imbalanced and shallow. As an adventure game it's lazy, extremely boring and shallow. Filled with glitches and completely asinine, backwards design features in general. This costs twice as much as Don't Starve Together, which offers far more content and far more interesting gameplay and is still actively being updated with new content. I'm really disappointed that I bought this ahead of release when it was on sale while I waited for it to leave early access, this was a complete and total waste of that fifteen dollars.

Your plane has crashed in Alaska and it's up to you and anyone else who is alive (up to 8 players, obviously) to gather supplies and survive the harsh environment. \n\n\n[h1][b]++PROS++:[/b][/h1] \n\n\t+Graphics. This is obviously personal preference, but the graphic styling of this title is a low-poly/high-res mashup that works all too well, creating a very unique feel.\n\t\n\t+Audio! The soundtrack to this game is rather enjoyable. I sat in the title screen for a minute waiting for a buddy to setup a server and was surprised that the track playing was actually creating a sense of anxiety...perhaps foreshadowing.\n        \n        +Cannibalism! Do I really need to explain? I may or may not have eaten my brother...\n\n\t+Explore your map and push the limits of staying away from camp. Everytime you think you have enough food and inventory slots unlocked, the wind and wolves will remind you otherwise.\n\t\n\t+Collect cooperatively. Set up a battle plan and assign roles to your group instantly. A buddy and I survived 26 days (a 3 hour play session) by having him hunt/build traps while I ran around and gathered the necessary supplies to craft said traps.\n\n\t+Crafting is splendid, even in Early Access. It comes across as a little shallow at first (if you have played any other titles in the survival genre), but that's something I'm willing to accept considering the current game state. If you finally start to get ahead and have a nice little stock pile of supplies and food, start putting out storage chests at camp. Lumber and ore are the big players currently, collecting these in combination with unlocking different crafting recipes in your workshop allows the upgrading of your tools and structures: (axe and pickaxe--->Bone Axe/Bone pickaxe, etc.).\n\t \n\t+You'll have to hunt. Right now hunting is basically crafting stun rocks and hurling these stones of stun at unsuspecting wildlife and then sprinting up and beating them OR you can set up a flurry of traps and 'herd' the animals into them. It currently takes about 3 traps to knock a full health animal down into chow. \n\n\t+Skill Points/Skill Tree is realistic. You can level up your mobility(speed/sprint), your backpack's inventory capacity, the drop rate from animals/resources,etc. The way I see this is the longer you have survived, your character 'hardens' up. Can carry more, run faster for longer, etc.\n\n\t+There are actually quests! So surviving was hard enough, right? Now you have the opportunity to follow side quests and explore abandoned facilities, settlements and labs. This adds a level of depth to the game which isn't 'needed' but is definitely appreciated.\n\n\t+It's hard. That's right, I said it. You will get frustrated, you will panic, you will die. Accept this and try your best. Try not to freeze to death as you venture out.(hint: build a campfire right behind the resources you are harvesting and then you can work, relatively safe and relatively warm). If you die, that's it. You lose all that hard work you put into leveling up.\n\n[h1][b]--CONS--:[/b][/h1]\n\t-Multiplayer servers (as stated in other reviews) were maxed out and this caused connectivity issues. The devs however have actively replied on the forums and stated that they are aware of such and are putting more servers online. \n\n\n[h1][b]Last words:[/b][/h1] One of the few early access titles that I would actually encourage players to buy. Even in it's early access state, this game is worth every penny($19.99). I can't wait to watch The Wild Eight continue to grow/update and 'survive' the sh*tstorm of disappointing Early Access survival titles that plague the Steam Marketplace at the moment. Do yourself a favor (especially if you like hard games) and get this gem asap.\n\n\n[h1][i][b]**REVIEW UPDATE AS OF 2/17/2017**[/b][/i][/h1]\nThanks to 2 or 3 patches: (these are some of the updates that I've personally appreciated and noticed in game) \nYou can now load a saved game without breaking UI.\nYou can also select a region when joining or creating a server.\nAnimals and buildings have all experienced multiple upgrades (buildings now provide immunity from blizzards and additional 50% cold defense and animals that have less than 25% HP are inflicted with a -30% speed debuff.)\nWeapons have had their bleed/stun chances altered(increased).\nEASY MODE IS AVAILABLE...that's right. If you thought the game was too hard originally, this option now exists. The effects of cold and hunger are reduced and you don't lose skills and structure levels upon dying.\nCampfire's have HP (something so simple being so game changing).\n\nOf course there are more bugs that have been fixed, items updated, etc. Make sure to check out the patch notes frequently. This game is moving fast.

It's mysterious at the beginning, and it really captures the essence of being isolated, hungry and always on the lookout for dangers,... \nMy friend and I encountered a few glitches that are not really game breaking, like taming a wolf (...) or being stuck on a \"tilted\" cliff, not being able to reclaim items after falling into a lake close to the end, magically losing items from the inventory, ... it's fine, it's still thumbs up... Even on Solo, it was enjoyable, but there are a lot of story items that are not explained, sometimes the mystery is just my own imagination running wild, as the actual fun part of the game is to roam around collecting, surviving.... the wild 8 is a game that gives you a story compass, but it is solely up to you, how you journey through this world and what you like to explore. There is no time limit, there are of course map boundaries, and that can be a good thing...but in retrospect, this game is not what I expected or what was advertised. The main story is not enough. The side stories can be great, but it just isn't enough. I would've liked, if there were some minimal bug fixes, some DLC content to utilize the large world...perhaps a little Easter eggs for future games....

Probably. So why do I not recommend it? Because the game basically forces you to play coop, because it isn't balanced around single player. I'm playing it single player. So what are the issues?\n\n1. Even with maxxing out melee damage, and having the best weapon in the game (thus far, Mutant Battle Claws, which deal 20-24 base damage), you still do not deal enough damage per second to go toe to toe with a standard bear, much less mutant bears or werewolves. \n\n2. Even with maxxing out protection skills, wearing the best armor in the game (thus far, vapor armor), you cannot go toe to toe with bears, mutant bears, or werewolves. \n\n3. Each health upgrade only increases max hp by +5, from a base of 100. As a bear can hit for 30 damage, this increase is pitiful.\n\n4. Even with the pistol or shotgun, you cannot one-hit a bear, mutant bear, or werewolf, even with maxxed out ranged skills.\n\n5. There is a lot of walking or in my case, running from bears and werewolves, in this game. \n\n6. You cannot craft a lot of the lategame resources, such as scrap, or chemicals. You always have to find them, and you go through a lot of these. \n\n7. The tram system only allows you to visit already found locations, that you've turned the tram on. Why? Who knows. \n\n8. Stack sizes are really small. Base of 8 for most items. Ammo is set to 12. Most stack sizes do not increase with skill investment.\n\n9. It takes forever to earn skills. \n\n10. A lot of quest completion steps are very obtuse in how you need to complete them, and I've had to look up online for help for almost all of them. \n\n11. There are hidden stats that are not explained anywhere. Or they are broken. Hard to say which. Like Endurance. \n\n12. There are a variety of items with unknown purposes to them. Even online searches turned up nothing. Like Radioactive Canned Food. \n\n13. Every found note in the game is listed as Note #12. \n\n14. Some buildings you automatically warm up in, with no clear source of heat and others you lose heat in. Why this works in some and not others, I have no idea.\n\n15. You cannot place chests inside structures and most storage containers in structures have between 3-4 slots in them. Chests have a base of 15 and can be upgrade to a max of 25. \n\n16. Some resources are used only once in a crafting recipe. ie Wolf Claws or Fox Tails. After that, they have no point to them. \n\n17. You cannot craft any of the really nice weapons you find randomly. Like Machete, Harpoon, Combat Knife, etc... You also cannot craft any of the Vapor items or Combat Boots.\n\n18. There are way too many Werewolves and Mutant Bears around the place I'm at, and according to the game, I'm only at 40% completion. Both of these can almost kill me if I'm not careful, and have a medkit on hand for emergencies. \n\n19. You can only repair armor with the advanced repair kit, which requires a special blueprint to be found and requires way too much scrap and circuits, which are decently rare resources. This really discourages you from using Vapor armor, as once its gone, its gone. \n\n20. For some strange reason, boots wear down super fast, despite getting hit in the body a lot. The skill to reduce their wear and tear, doesn't seem to work, or requires all 5 points invested in it to work.\n\nI could go on, but you probably get the idea. There are a ton of little things that mar the game, and really make you realize that the game wants you to play coop and wants to make single player torturously hard to do. Otherwise, it has great ambience, atmosphere, and a decent survival loop, but its flaws makes me want to quit the game. But as I'm at day 98 now in single player, I've invested too much time now to quit and the story is starting to make sense.", "timestamp_created": 1636531974, "timestamp_updated": 1636531974, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.713138818740844727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96030851": {"recommendationid": "96030851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198435254622", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1626661340}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is just too buggy to be played enjoyably.

It's as if Don't Starve and The Long Dark (which I both love) had a child. The minimalistic polygon graphics makes the game look much better than the other games in the genre, which try and fail to look realistic. Sound design is also quality: the ambience of chilly winds and the cracking fire, a wolf howl in the distance - all make it a pleasanty lonesome experience. The gameplay is solid, very intuitive and a perfect base to implement more complex mechanics upon. I dare to say that this game beats every other early access survival game in terms of polish. I haven't encountered any bugs just yet, runs well and smooth on my system. Didn't have the chance to play co-op, but that should make the game much more entertaining.\n\nSo far, the only thing that is in need of improvement is hunger. This stat needs balancing as you get hungry way too quickly. This issue has already been addressed by the developer and will get fixed soon. Also, I wish the time spent sleeping was more sped up, as it's not that interesting to spend a few minutes IRL just doing nothing and waiting for a blizzard or the night to pass.\n\nCongratulations on the launch, dear developers.

Kind of widely spread, I know, but my friend and I agreed.\n\nPros:\n- Immersive story\n- You can control wether you want to continue with the quests or just work on upgrading your skills, workshop and shelter.\n- You realisticly need to eat and stay warm to survive.\n- This is a great, great game to play with friends. You can still play it solo if you want, but it's so much fun to play with friends.\n- You can chop trees and stone with your hands. So you also get the feel of minecraft logic in there.\n\n\nCons:\n- This might be an outdated con, as the bug has probably been corrected:\nWhen I played a while back with my cousin, we would fall in a pit and die, while carrying important quest items. There was no way of getting down to the spot in the pit where we fell, so we could retrieve the items. So we basically had to start all over. I haven't had this problem since though, so I'm assuming the issue has been adressed.\n- When chopping trees it often takes multiple tries to get the character to actually hit the tree and not just waiste energy on hitting the air.\n- Time flies by way too quickly when playing this game.\n\nSo in conclusion: BUY THE GAME and play it with your friends.

The camera control could be WAY better, but you get very used to it, so also a no problem. Has a very good skills upgrades system. And yeah, an overall recommended.\n\nThe only real con I can think of are the bugs, there's a lot of them and quite a few are very annoying. Fortunately there are no game breaking bugs that I ran into.

There's quite a few features/ideas that the game could use, a few examples that popped in my head:\n\n\u2022 The reindeer is an amazing feature, I love it, owning a pet reindeer who follows you around while expanding your on-go storage with the sledge, HOWEVER, to maintain the reindeer is way too needy, its realistic, yes, but the frequency of when you have to feed him is way too high.\n\u2022 You should 100% be able to place chests down in your Bunker.\n\u2022 Imo its kinda disappointing that you can't open the door to the Main Reactor room due to an \"unknown error\", I'd really like to get in there as well and everywhere else in the game, that \"unknown error\" is always fixed when you restart the systems, why not make it like that in your own Bunker as well?\n\u2022 The dumpster in the Bunker should 100% be times and times bigger, I can only really use it to store actual valuable items, it doesn't have enough room to throw away actual useless junk like rot or ruined/spoiled food.\n\u2022 I feel like there could be quite a few more achievements, one that came in mind for example was an achievement for activating all radio stations.\nEtc.", "timestamp_created": 1640915598, "timestamp_updated": 1641201203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.67898857593536377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148162190": {"recommendationid": "148162190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150444650", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1697234634}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm on the fence about this but ultimately you shouldn't buy this, at least unless its on sale for dirt cheap.

The aesthetics are very pleasing and most things function pretty well, but some of the gameplay aspects are absolutely fuck-all.\n\nI'm a newer player, so I selected the \"normal\" difficulty, as any new player would.  The instructions and quest direction are fairly simple, but the enemy AI on a \"normal\" difficulty that's supposedly for \"exploring the wilderness of Alaska\" is AWFUL.  Wolves are far too fast, come out of nowhere, deal far too much damage, and don't show up on the map as red blips until they're practically up your ass.  You receive no warning other than a very vague audio cue, and a wolf can deal so much damage to someone who doesn't have upgraded abilities that you usually die between 3-4 hits.  This is on NORMAL, mind you.  \n\nOn the topic of enemy AI and enemies, there is a werewolf enemy in one of the abandoned facilities you find, but the thing kills you in 1-2 hits, even with the decent armor you find in another room there.  I'm assuming this thing is a sort of boss or miniboss type of enemy, but there's no reason players on Normal mode should be punished by dying in 1-2 hits, especially considering you find a gun in there too, which one-shots most lesser enemies.  My suggestion is to nerf the damage for this enemy on Normal mode, or create a difficulty between Normal and Hard or whatever the other difficulty is, so players won't feel punished for no good reason other than \"heehee hoho bbeg time\".\n\nGuns are an entirely different can of worms, and not in a good way.  The first gun you find is a little pistol, and the damage is great, allowing you to now one-shot wolves.  Only problem?  The range is UNREASONABLY PATHETIC.  I realize this is a game, but no other games I've played have had bullets from guns take a NOSEDIVE into the floor after only travelling about 3 feet away, and this is a weapon you're supposed to use to kill that miniboss I talked about before that can kill you in two hits.  I would rather have the bullet travel across the map like normal bullets do and do less damage than how they function now.  Also, PLEASE have the character able to be mobile while shooting.  The lock into the aim position takes too long to get out of, and you always take 1-2 hits before you can escape aiming down the sights (which in the miniboss case, kills you every time).", "timestamp_created": 1562477623, "timestamp_updated": 1562477623, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665107488632202148", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29949419": {"recommendationid": "29949419", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971828236", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 3295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1969, "last_played": 1549933260}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a cool little game that's not ready for prime time.

In the game you can walk, run (with skill), open doors, read notes left by people who didn't have same luck, face wild animals and even other players. The controls are simple and structured.\n\u3000 The game also has an intuitive crafting and skill evolution system. At first you will have a tent and a workshop, these items are unique, you can pack them and load them to another base. They cannot be created again and in case you die, you will receive new ones. They have upgrades, which allow you to craft better tools / weapons and get more advanced skills.\n\u3000 In The Wild Eight, you will face wild animals, and heave to deal with other players, the multiplayer mode has pvp and chat integrated, you can fight or create alliances. System is awesome, no lags and the loadings are fast. The game also has the singleplayer mode to adapt you to the game in the third person. The camera has a great zoom, you have a map and a list of quests to complete.\n\n[h1]Graphic and Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe graphic engine reminds me of \"The Flame in the Flood\", almost on realism but with a cartoonized touch. The scenery is cold, beautiful and the places where you can explore are rich in details. The soundtrack is instrumental and original, always passing a feeling of solitude and isolation, calm and sometimes melancholic songs.\n\n[h1]Rate: 10/10[/h1]\nAmazing. I'm kind suspected to say, for loving survival games, but The Wild Eight has exceeded all my expectations.
