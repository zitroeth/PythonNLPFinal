And its scope is actually smaller, I won't spoil much, but I believe this game could have campaign 2-3 longer to reach its potential.\n\nObjective issues:\n1. Game save system seem to save world and playerdata separately, which is problem, because game can sometimes crash or you can get stuck and now you are away from your vehicle. Either having ability to have multiple saves of same campaign or unifying 2 of these saves into 1 would fix some issues.\n2. Often game isn't clear about how to progress, f.e.( you need to repair something, however you can't craft component, turns out you missed one crate in kilometer long mine with blueprint for machine to craft that component, you have to mine things harder than your tool supports-either make it clear or instead of red use yellow for slightly harder things, ...)\n3. Player character is too strong, even in first day you can get weapon that can easily kill all important enemies. After that, if you are not idiot you don't die from normal enemies. honestly I found it faster and easier to smash stone knife into enemy than to shoot it. Also it's very important to lower enemy aggression, stealth is basically impossible, especially if you fix issues with early weapons being too powerful. And maybe increase damage of animals 2x-3x.\n4. Increase durability of structures-about this one I'm not sure, because only structure that I lost was module in phoenix base, which forced me to start new campaign, due to it being irreplaceable and stopping airlock from working when destroyed-stopping me from finishing objective. it was on day 15 or so, I believe it got destroyed by enemies at night, however I don't know for sure, this may be false bug report.\n5. Salvagable structures don't respawn naturally, game is quite grindy and it's ok with minerals, however you usually run out of technical components in early-mid story. Game fixes this by refreshing mines(cave) every reload of world. This is alright, however it would be good to increase debris yield of other components, I had like 100 space debris at the end, but 1 rubber. also some structures can't be deconstructed, which is not well communicated and I don't find reason why to not allow it, safe for story objects maybe.\n\nNow to subjective criticism:\n\nWARNING SOME SPOILERS\n\nthis is my opinion towards single-player campaign\n\nnot that they really matter in this game's story\n\nI was frustrated when I started playing, but slowly after some grind I repaired phoenix base and was looking forward to living stranded astronaut fantasy, growing food, building walls to keep myself safe, all while uncovering mysteries of this world. I built first mining tower, started it, which was first time enemies were interesting to engage.\n2 hours later end credits roll and I'm waiting for some twist that sends me spiralling into other moon instead of escaping and ending, surely this couldn't be end of game, well it was.\nI bought this game at least 4 years ago, and I was honestly expecting it to move further. This game feels like it should be bigger, when you leave you haven't resolved anything ,you don't know what happened, you don't know what happened to your friends... I was expecting closure like in subnautica.\n\nI just finished playing and I'm disappointed, I spent 20 hours playing this, getting interested in what happened and then my character just leaves, English is not my first language and I wasn't paying full attention to that dialog, so I thought I was going to other planet to rescue some of my comrades, or towards space station to check something/turn on something, etc. Nothing gets resolved at the end.\n\nSadly all that built up tension, interest and player infrastructure is wasted. Just when you start getting to point where you can get lot of resources, you aren't tasked with fixing interplanetary communications/scanners, or building something, you are just asked to leave. I'm not happy about this.\n\nAlso after that I decided to go look into other areas, to check whether they also got prettier, sadly my game lags and sends me to main menu, first time fails to load save, then it loads and I fly to red sea, then it throws me to menu, I reload, I get teleported out of ship and killed, but technically I'm still in ship and can't exit or leave, so I crash game, reload, now my ship is flying 50 meters above me in red sea region.

You could feel the creator's intent throughout the world. The days were spent searching for resources while skirting the territory of dangerous creatures. The nights were filled with terror, with storms and large jagged claws reaching out of the darkness. If you were caught without a shelter, survival was very difficult. The mechanics were solid and although the AI was a bit wonky, I'll never forget being lost in a sandstorm and attacked by those giant crabs. Going from this ragged existence to building vehicles felt very rewarding. Technology provided dominion over creatures that previously terrorized you, but this did not grant immunity to poor decisions, nor were you at the top of the food chain. It had a logical sense of progression and the tools you made were keys to access more distant and lucrative areas in the world map.\n\nThe developers abandoned this design and instead of expanding with more content and gameplay, chose to make everything more difficult and time consuming. Crafting became a chore and overly complex with no tangible reward to the time invested. The original map was thrown out and replaced with an awful mess that showed half a dozen ideas clearly not aware of each other and fighting for dominance over your inevitable buggy [software] death. \n\nEvery now and then, I remember that magic of the original Osiris: New Dawn and check in on the latest reviews to see if things have turned around. For years, this sentimental notion was numbed by the familiar commentary on how buggy and incomplete it is. I can only hope other developers witnessed the origin of this game and carry the spark of genius it had to other creations in the future. By luck or design, it was a breathtaking insight into the evolution of the space survival genre. Many games have tried to emulate a space explorer marooned in a hostile and alien environment, piecing together bits of technology to gradually progress from survival to thriving on the land and reaching out to the stars once again. None I have seen hold such a unique and engaging atmosphere as this one did.

I seriouldy had a blast for the 36 hours I played solo or with my friend.\n\nNew mining mechanics introduced on 10-26-16 ruined it and it does not look like they are changing it back.\n\nMaking it so it takes 10 hours instead of 30 minutes to farm enough minerals to create one building is not increasing difficulty. It's just dragging the game out in a very frusterating and boring manner.\n\nChanging the resource pile distribution from various patches of different minerals around the moon (which was very realistic), to two nodes. A basic and an advanced node that you now smack over and over again for a random mineral reward is not realistic at all.\n\nThe scientist in me loved the realism this game had until this mining change. The builder in me loved this game until this mining change. The player I am loved this game until this mining change.\n\nThis game went from amazing potential to another title to collect dust in the steam vault. I wish Beta's would allow a refund after complete game changing moments like this are done, ohh well. I do not recomend this game.\n\n Adding edit here >>> 12/7/16\n\nI am both pleased and humbled by a response from the developer, thank you very much!\n\nIn light of this I wish to be more detailed in exactly what I loved so much about Osiris.\n\nThe world you created for us was the closest I have ever encountered in any game like this, to what I could imagine an exoplanet to be like. The mineral distibution was dead on realistic for what we know about our universe. We can estimate that habital planets in the universe could have up to 60 Be Minerals, but most will have much less.  Your world had a very realistic amount. And there was room to add some more later without going anywhere near the unrealistic stage of quantity. And although I know a lot more about planetary science than I do chemistry, the combines for creating materials seemed spot on too. I loved it!\n\nThese two aspects allowed me to immerse myself into the gameplay very well. Add in the fact that the world is absolutely gorgeous and full of danger really set the mood right. The only thing I found at this point lacking in realism was a source of water, which is a requirement for life to exist. I found no lakes or streams of any kind. And yet the planet has plants and monsters. Then one night there was a thunderstorm and I smiled bright as rain pelted off my greenhouse. (I figured at this point, they got this, they'll probably just add in a standing body of water at a later point of development).\n\nThen the mining change occurred. The addition of the basic and advance mineral node completely shattered the feeling of a real exoplanet. To say it is statistically Improbable for so many unique minerals to be compacted into the same rock is being generous.\n\nI do agree that material farming needed to be tweaked and adjusted to a slower rate than it was. I believe this could have been done easily by removing some of the mineral nodes in each grouping around the planet. As well as adjusting the rate of return when using our pick on the nodes themselves.\n\nPersonally a grind doesn't bother me when the feeling of completion is rewarding enough. Realism however is very important to me in a game like this. I've spent my life studying planetary science and I just can't stop thinking about the lack of scientific realism everytime i see one of these new nodes.\n\nThank you for the support in this review everyone. I never thought my post would have received this much attention and like i said above, I am quite humbled by this.

Brian really needs to understand that people know how to use the internet and can quote him from interviews, ex-publisher information and his own store page.  \n\nIn future avoid anything from Fenix Fire or Brian McRae--he is literally the Amber Heard of the gaming industry.\n\n\n\nThis game has gone from one of Good Faith and community optimism to now being considered a scam by the vast majority.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2048309938\n\nOn paper Osiris: New Dawn invoked a lot of community interest and originally surged to the top of the steam charts, carried on the backs of expectations and desires for what it then (and in the future) represented: a solid space survival experience.  However, failures of both project and team management has led to this games downfall--turning the community from hopeful, optimistic and taking the developer in Good Faith to now questioning if this is all just a big scam by someone who claims himself as a 20 year veteran of game development.\n\nOver the years the developer Fenix Fire, especially--if not solely--their CEO, one Brian McRae, has said a lot.  Numerous updates being in the works.  Several 1.0 expected release times (originally it was supposed to be 1 year till 1.0, so 2017, then 2019, now its 2020).  For a developer who has often said that there is no set timeframe, if you are to look back through [b]their own comments[/b] posted you see that there a lot of times when things are said to have been coming.  The more recent and infamous was the alleged update to be coming out \"any day now\", that if you look through the Events section has been advertised for months; going from internal testing, to testing with their publishers and then into closed beta testing.\n\nAs someone who has been involved with most (if not all) testing of Osiris, my name has popped up a couple of times in official posts thanking me for my help, I can tell you that there never was an update and it took Mr McRae quite some time before he came out and admitted that to his community; admitted in a way that appealed to his mindset only.  The thing with Mr McRae is that he has a very disjointed idea of what both game development is like and [i]how community should respond to him[/i]; a few times now I've found him bewildered by the negativity he created within his own community by not following through with things [b]he said were coming[/b].  An example would be this recent \"update\", the one his community manager was telling people were just around the corner (which she has since removed but you'll still see people quoting her and posting the original links).  Mr McRae allowed the community to believe that an update was coming, it wasn't, he had (in his mind at least) completed the tasks to build the update and we beta testers found a very broken 'demo' of ideas already explored during the previous open betas, this time just having additional Unity store assets (creatures and weapons) through into the mix.\n\nI'm not a developer, if anything I tinker with modding and like to reach out to the developers of games I follow, but in my time doing that I've been able to talk with many developers, from small to big and the commonality of advice or comments from them was that 'if anyone tells you anything is easy, they are either a fool who doesn't understand what he's doing, or a complete liar' and that would very much encompass Mr McRae, who would often say something is easy--\"an easy fix\"--but was never able to actually fix it; never be able to actually fix bugs we found during various tests and would often become aggressive or passive aggressive and blame testers for things he is solely responsible for.  Or become annoyed when you could, I don't know, take your characters space helmet off, something easily done since 2019 betas.  \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1809603895\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2048309938\n\nAs some of you may know, I was banned from the community, Fenix Fire believing I was \"embellishing their struggles\", which is an odd thing to say as the developer never said they had struggles, in fact what people considered struggles they themselves came out and said were the best things for them and actually allowed them to work faster, harder and better.  But, I suppose they were actually struggles and parroting all the things they've said they're doing when someone asks must be hard to read--all those things you said you were doing via posts and you couldn't actually achieve.  Though your ability to ban people for repeating what you've said is pretty scammy.\n\nMy warning to the community: be very mindful when reading what this developer says, they often share non-committal posts that they can't follow through with and don't like the negativity that comes from that.  For example: they're now abandoning their most recent advertised update and are moving towards 1.0 instead but haven't said in that post what 1.0 is.  If you look, this is what they're saying is coming:\n\n[quote]How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?\n\u201cThe full version will include six playable planetary maps, power system, utility panel system, compass system, map system, two factions and six classes.\u201d[/quote]\n\nWho advertises \"we have a compass\"?, honestly.  Plus 'six playable planetary maps', but what does that actually mean?  Maps as in entire worlds, or maps as in what maps are now (seeing as Proteus 2, as an example as 2 maps).\n\nBy very cautious with this developer, there is so much more I could say but Steam doesn't seem to like my level of detail.", "timestamp_created": 1587940475, "timestamp_updated": 1675151800, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 205, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.907012462615966797", "comment_count": 74, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1588997461, "developer_response": "Many games are delayed, which in this and many creative industries, is a natural tendency.

Lol.\n\nOriginal review:\nSo I actually really want to like this game and support the devs, but that's not going to happen.\n\nI've bought this game I believe within the very first 1-2 weeks when it launched on steam.\nAt that time it took max (with a lot of dickin around) 6 hours to complete.\nEver since then, I've kept the game in my libary on stand-by for a little over a year, while waiting for updates.\n\nAfter one entire year of updates, they have added about a maximum of 5 new creatures. The biggest changes they have made are things like a bigger variety of windows you can build for your home. Now this isn't 100% the developers their fault, since the community keeps asking for upgrades to just that- their buildings.\n\nYou can expect an update once a month at its current pace and a BIG update is considered: \n1 creature, 1-2 guns and maybe 1 building OR a few building add-ons(Like a bigger variety in windows) + some fixes. So it doesn't exactly add this \"much\" content to the game every single month.\n\nThe current game looks like this:\n-The first planet you land on is a complete sandcastle(and the second planet is an iceblock). You can hardly expect other biomes other than sand/desert and the planet is very empty. Just look at the pictures at this steam page and look for the ones that show the landscape with no buildings at all or anything like that - Thats pretty much how you can expect the entire planet to be like.\n\n-There are currently about 9 different creatures roaming the first planet, all with the same colour palette and hardly interesting design. (Things you can expect: A snake, a big beetle, a spider, a big crab, an ostrich, a giraffe and a few other things that are hardly interesting)\n\n-On the second planet there are about 2 UNIQUE creatures roaming the planet, which are fortunately atleast a bit better designed (more interesting), but still not all that great. The other creatures on that planet are the same as on the first planet, because those are \"placeholders\".\n\nThe current quests make you run around the pretty boring planet all the time to keep you busy, just like the fact that you have to run around everywhere because all the materials are spread from eachother.(Yes, it's easier later when you have vehicles) Now this wouldn't be as much of a problem if the planet was atleast more interesting. Currently the biggest thing a player could get interested in when doing a 2000 meter hike is making sure  \"W\" (movement) button is pressed at all times so you can get it done as quickly as you can.\n\nThey may be creating this game with only about 10 people, however that doesn't take away the fact that this game with it's current update schedule, update size & update priorities will be done in the year 2030 at best. (which is not a joke)\n\nCurrently: Not Recommended\nMay change in the future.\n\n[b]PS: Wow I just got completely bamboozled by reading their early access text again: \"we also want to build out a fully realized Solar System that can be visited with each planet providing a unique experience for version 1.0. We estimate it will take about [u]a year[/u] to get there.\u201d[/b]\n\nHAHAH. No way. Way too optimistic. It took them a year to add 5-6 creatures, a few guns and a couple more basebuilding stuff.\n\nEDIT 17/12/17: Turns out that the year estimate is confirmed to be there since the release so these devs are basically taking you for a fool.\n\nAlso, the singleplayer base-building fans apparently somehow love this game and hate anyone who dares to talk about the game needing more content, pvp balance, dev communication & multiplayer in general.\n\nBasically they lash out on you or try to act like you're an idiot when you share your opinion, which is always nice. (MULTIPLE examples in the comment section of this review, have fun reading :^) )\nThe type of people you can expect in the comments: [url=https://imgur.com/a/ob4f4]Click this[/url]\n\nI have no clue how people have more than 20+ hours spent on this game.\n\nWARNING: If you still think you may buy this game, atleast listen to this..\n\nIf you don't have any friends to play with, I can 99% guarentee you'll get too bored to play.\n\nEDIT 23/12/17\nBIGGEST UPDATE SO FAR?!?(a few days ago) How is rise of Zer? \n\nLatest update added 1 new planet with 5 different creatures roaming it. (yes only 5 aka not much variety)\n\nI was actually looking forward to it, but I was heavily dissapointed.\n\nI already expected the planet to pretty much be uninteresting and boring like the others - which it was.. but the creatures are what dissapointed me this patch.\n\nFirst off there are 2 creatures called the Cerberus and the Hellhound, both share a very similar model although a Cerberus is much bigger and is a bit more fiery. \n\nThe fact that there are only 5 different creatures roaming the planet and 2 having similar models, is pretty sad.\n\nAnother creature out of these 5 is a big larva that slithers and jumps at you to attack, nothing special.\n\nThe 4th creature, the Mezupoid is a floating jellyfish that floats around head-height and spits lava around itself..\n\nAnd the 5th creature, the Magma Demon, the one I was most hyped for.... it has wings and actually looks pretty neat... was the biggest dissapointment of them all. \n\nThe developers chose not to let this finally be a nice creature roaming the skies. In contrary, they basically used the Giant Worm AI on it from the Sandcastle planet, which basically makes the creature pop out of the ground to try and kill you and go full kamikaze pilot style back into the ground again.\n\nAnd the biggest question of them all: If there is no player on this planet, what on earth are these creatures their purposes? There is literally no flora on this planet and the creatures seem to do nothing at all except being idle when a player isn't near enough for them to be hostile.\n\nUpdate 29th of December:\nI've noticed that there are quite a few reviews that recommend this game after playing 0.5 hours & marked as received product for free (usually) saying: \"I love it\", only to never play it again.\n\nI've grown awfully suspicious that there are a few paid reviews here.\n\nUpdate 2nd of February\nThere hasn't been an update in January.\nApparently a \"hotfix\" takes a few weeks. http://prntscr.com/i95xiz (This was posted Jan 19th and fixes arent here yet)\n\nNext update is focusing on adding purposes to currently existing things, thus not adding anything new. lol.\n\nUpdate 21st of april 2018\n\nStill no update as of yet. I'd call this game dead at this point. This game will actually never finish.\nDONT BUY!!\n\nUpdate 11th of July 2018. \n\nUpdate as of 15th of August, 2019.\nNothing has been added to the actual game as of yet.\nThey release a sort of \"beta branches\" with a very limited amount of new content, laughable at best. Can't say there has been any actual progress. Especially since OVER A YEAR of my last update.\n\nI am unable to comprehend how this is still on steam.\n\nNothing has been added yet!! DO NOT BUY\n\nUpdate as of 26th of November 2020.\nI am able to add more to a game within 24 hours than these guys do in over a year, apparently.\n\nNext to nothing has happened in like the last 4 years. It's absolute fraud.\nThey do 170MB updates right before sales are up to make the game \"relevant\" again.\nHowever these updates hardly even add anything, they don't post changelogs and everyone ends up just guessing.\n\nI was looking at the discussions, and apparently they broke the standard shovel (which you need to build everything basically) with a previous update. The recent update fixed it. Gratz devs, you did it, you fixed a fuken shovel.\n\nThere are still people shilling for this game in the discussions.

This is perhaps a more egregious claim than the time that Steel Wool, developers of FNAF: Security Breach said that they were satisfied with the current quality of their game. For context, among other issues, that game is riddled with bugs, both minor and game breaking.\n\nFenix Fire Entertainment have decided to abandon this in its current bare bones state, leaning hard on the excuse that \"we have seen no increase in player count or sentiment\" and claiming that the players also expect a No Man's Sky-esque \"explore everything\" style experience. In reality, Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nSimply put, no one is playing this game because it is a nightmarishly bad experience. Updates don't draw in players because they're built on a foundation that no one in their right mind would want to put up with. The way you traverse the world is sluggish, the amount of visual effects constantly present on your screen make it hard to see, gathering resources is boring, and combat is braindead. No amount of new vehicles will fix the issues plaguing the game's core experience. Which players do you think would put up with this experience, and then recommend it to their friends?\n\nIn regards to player sentiment, Fenix Fire have invented their own headcanon about how their game is perceived. Because the truth is, the playerbase who were actually excited to see updates for this game have the patience of saints and the excitement of kids on christmas. Every steam update announcement for this game is filled with people who are thankful for the development team continuing their work and are genuinely excited to see new updates. Even when those updates are minor patches. I have no idea how so many people still have, or had, faith in Fenix Fire, but it's clear that these people don't expect the world of the team. Even I was optimistic, every time I saw an update in my news feed.\n\nIn its current state, this game is impossible to recommend. I've spent more than 24 hours on this game, some of which don't show up because they were played on the Experimental Branch, and not once was I ever able to actually find the fun. Fenix Fire Entertainment says that 6 years was more than enough time to spend on the game, but that only counts if you're actually consistently updating the game meaningfully. In just 4 years, Raymond Cripps, solo developer of Project Feline, was able to conceptualize his dream game and release a pre-alpha proof of concept demo that is single handedly more fun and more entertaining than this supposedly \"feature complete\" game.\n\nI don't know what happened at Fenix Fire or why things turned out the way they did, but go buy No Man's Sky, the game they claim they are being compared to, instead.

Surprise, surprise. Avoid this or don't. Your choice. \n\nOriginal 2020 review below:\n\nIn my opinion, you should avoid buying this. I've given enough time before posting a review. \n\nWhat a horrendous way to develop a game. I remember this having lots of potential. Had some cool ideas, and it was fun for a while but things became tedious. You could do everything in the game within a few days (about 10-15 hours). The progression tree was stretched out to buff gameplay for lack of features. Stone age tools were implemented because they could? There's no real purpose to the game besides building a base over and over again. No real questline - even though an attempt was made. This game tries to do too many things at once. It tries to be Doom (space horror), 7 days to die (monster raids & base building), and rust (stone age tools......come on), and many more things, all at once. \n\nThe game does look visually pleasing but lags like nobody's business. Needs to be optimized. \n\nI got this game many, many years ago when the devs were still working on the game and responding to people. I may not have been around as long as some, but I've been around long enough to remember the rubber and gas issues. Sadly this EA turned out to be a dud. I remember when the devs first introduced themselves, boasting about working on numerous AAA titles and how they had a good handle of the industry. I also remember a while later how they had to switch engines and all of a sudden it was a learning process for them. No more AAA+++ super dev. All of a sudden they started rolling back their statements on their expertise and commitments. But it's EA right. \n\nI've seen them implement numerous features only to roll many of them back. I've seen them promise feature updates, only to get re-skins. I get it, it's EA..... I've also seen it all too often with other EA titles that became scams like GITSFA & EOS.\n\nI've seen the high-tech space explorer be reduced to a cave man, with primitive stone tools because the devs thought it was a good idea. They made it somewhat optional after a while when people got annoyed. I and many others have encountered game breaking bugs that have gone ignored. But it's EA right. That's acceptable. Just look at 7 Days to die, some will say. Well 7Days actually rolls out entire overhauls with their builds. It's like getting an expansion pack. This doesn't even compare. \n\nThe PTS is the ideas that will be implemented into the main branch of the game. The problem is that it's a showroom for some of the models they have made. It's not like a Factorio beta where you play the full game with new beta features implemented. It's a showroom. All their so called 'updates' go to the beta branch and stay there. They haven't touched main branch in ages. I remember when the idea of space stations was introduced. It was a no collision model that anyone could make in a few days with minimal 3D experience. Or you could just look around online and buy a fully functional model. Took them ages to get that far though. Sadly this and many other \"ideas\" are only for show to promote buying an unfinished demo. \n\nThe devs go quiet for a long time, which would be fine if they did anything useful.

Not to take away from the AI, these monsters are tricky, don't let them fool you.\n\nCons:\n1.Rubber banding the player randomly around the map... not game breaking but annoying.\n2.Monster will chase you to the ends of the earth, seems you HAVE to kill them (or fly into space, lol).\n3. MAP needs work.  Very hard to understand anything on the hand held map device.\nSome people don't even know what Latitude is or longitutde and the map makes this more complicated.  Someone who takes time to follow the map, will eventually be able to get some use out of it. but a world WORLD MAP would be great (Kinda like, you create one as you explore so you can identify land marks and so forth).\n4. RED DOME of NoBuild (In other words, restricted build near other players).  if playing multiplayer and someone has plotted their spot, good luck.  I had my camp hut up in a location, but I could not start my Habitat due to the RED DOME limit thing, so I wandered around until I found an area.  Dropped my Habitat and went back to collect my camp site, broke down my forge and depositories to move to my new area, BUT... the RED DOME wouldn't allow me to build camp next to my Habitat..  ???  This being looked into?\n5. Targeting mobs is not an easy task in 3rd person mode, first person is not to bad, but in 3rd person, your persons body is trying to twist and bend around making 3rd person combat a hard task VS first person.\n6. How long does the storms last? I mean the dust or ran or hard blowing winds....  the effects are awsome no doubt, but man, this is like 85% of the game and I have to just sit somewhere and wait til all this passes.  \n7. There are some very little mobs (physically small) and do MASSIVE damage to you and you can't even kill them unless you a Osiris god or something (they are a 1 shot kill, but so hard to hit them).  Mobs balancing need to be worked out and implement a more reasonable melee attack and weapon.\n\n\nOverall, I really like what I see here and is looking very good.  Early Access means...

If you're the sort of person who really enjoys the standard update cycle of Early Access games then this may definitely be worth your money now. Whilst the game has a lot of features already in place (and working somewhat well) it's just missing content at the moment. \n\nAt the moment I would give it these pros and cons for buying:\n\nPros:\n- Incredible atmosphere. Requiring resources at night is terrifying task, made more so by the real danger of having to go out and mine when it's dark and you can't see scaly animal bastards sneaking up on you.\n\n- Fair build/resources system. Building is expensive but the resources are by no means unachievable, and encourage you to explore and find better ways to claim the resources you need.\n\n- Beautiful. I'm amazed at what they've been able to pull out of Unity's graphics capabilities. In some ways it sets Osiris apart from other obviously Unity games, other than some UI choices.\n\nCons:\n- Combat. It just feels clunky. The pistol is by far a more reliable weapon than the assault rifle, which is needlessly expensive to buy ammo for an insuperior gun. It's innaccurate with the animal movement, does less damage than the pistol, and unlike the pistol requires expensive ammo to be made for it. I could honestly say a lot about how the combat isn't quite how I'd like it to be, but this is trying to be a short list.\n\n- Content. As soon as I was able to manufacture vehicles I realised how small the world feels at the moment. It took away from my sense of awe a little, as at first the feeling of having to plan out the day ahead was great. Not getting shredded in the dark meant you had to think about which resources you'd need carefully, and also where they were and how to get to them. The vehicles upset this balance because they're kind of the end game at the moment. The space ship allows you to cross the entire map in about 20s, which makes it feel tiny when both the G.A.V. and on foot would do the time spent on the world justice. There's not really a lot of alien types, or especially interesting and useful areas that have function at the moment.\n\n- Performance.\nOsiris is beautiful, but the sacrifice it made w", "timestamp_created": 1481201106, "timestamp_updated": 1481201106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 213, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842825114727020264", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30465221": {"recommendationid": "30465221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007906579", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 1510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1493, "last_played": 1557722904}, "language": "english", "review": "2017-03-12\nIt's ARK meets Space Engineers meets \"The Martian\" (movie).  One of the most promising groundwork early access games I've ever seen.  Made it to the end of available content in about 15 hours of play and very excited to see more.  Its modular building system is a nice balance between \"block by block\" contruction and just plopping down a complete prefab structure.  Nice variety in flora, fauna needs a little more.  No one area provides all the resources, you will need to travel +1000m to find the missing ones. Overall, very happily recommend this one!\n\nA few recomendations for the devs (yes I realize these may already be in the works): \n\n-The automated turrets are farily expensive, buff them please.  \n\n-Pathing/tethering for the OMPA... this little guy is your first interaction in OND... please make it less frustrating.\n\n-Jetpack needs more lift\n\n-Give enemies some walking noises rather than shockingly change the music when they're around/coming.\n\n-Giant \"Free Willy\" jumping worms.... glorious... Maybe add some earthquaking instead of killing the music.\n\n-Walls are too expensive for their size, add some width or reduce the cost.\n\n-Maybe reduce the length of sand/snowstorms... I'm not sure about this overall but maybe test some shorter durations.\n\n-Vehicles NEED to come sooner in play.

Action music is supposed to hint that you're about to be attacked, but by then it's too late.

At a glance it appears to be one of the prettier survival games but it's light on content. After putting in 20 hours and completing most of what is currently in the game I'd have to say it shows a lot of promise and potential but I cannot recommend it to most people. Bellow i'll try to narrow down who I think can leave this game enjoying it and who will likely end up hating its current state. \n\nWHO SHOULD AVOID THIS GAME UNTIL FURTHER DEVELOPMENT\n+People looking for a combat focused survival game. Osiris has combat in it, but it is not where the game shines. For the majority of the game your only ranged weapons will be an energy pistol and a assault rifle. There are a few upgrades to these that can be found in rare drops but weapon variety is very low. On top of that the enemy AI of the game has an early access feel and after awhile you'll learn how to use jetpack tricks to dodge most enemy attacks. I died a lot in my first few days and then went on a 15+ day stretch without dying once i learned the enemy mechanics. Combat quickly becomes a minor obstacle and is very likely going to leave anyone looking for a challenging combat focused survival game disappointed.\n+People Looking for a multiplayer game to play with all their friends. Multiplayer is supported in Osiris but given the fact I got through most the content in 20 hours there really isn't enough there for multiple people to do. Two players might be fine but anymore than that and you're likely going to run out of stuff to do in a couple hours. You could join a PVP server and fight against other players setting up bases, though games like Empyrion and Rust will give you a lot more mileage.\n+People looking for an in depth base building system. Osiris has several buildings, vehicles, weapons, and items that the player can craft. But base design is highly limited as far as uniqueness and creativity. Buildings only snap together in a few ways and only a couple items can be placed in each one meaning most player's bases will end up being similar. Seen one greenhouse or laboratory and you've seen them all. \n\nWHO WOULD LIKELY ENJOY THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE\n+People who enjoy atmospheric games and exploration. Despite all the negativity above I enjoyed my time in Osiris and felt it was an amazingly beautiful game when approached as an exploration game, similar to Subnautica. The planet feels like a real alien planet and is clearly has the touch of design about it, rather than procedural generation. Sand storms,  dangerous meteor showers, giant skeletons of ancient beasts spread across the landscape, deep caves, and the aliens you encounter make for a fun adventure. If you look at the base building as a way to help you survive, the vehicles as ways to help you farm, then you can have a lot of fun mapping out the planet and getting enough resources to finally hit the big goalpost of making a spaceship to travel off planet. Currently you can mine asteroids, and visit one other planet that is a frozen wasteland with differently lifeforms but much less developed than the main planet. The way you travel from planet to planet feels a lot like no man's sky and is extremely immersive. \n+People wanting to help the devs of a promising game with feedback and funds. Osiris is a beautiful game with amazing potential. However its hard to tell if it will be the next Subnautica or another abandoned game that never lived up to its developers vision. If you have the money to spare to help out an impressive start of a game and enjoy seeing games grow over time than Id have to say this is one of the more promising early access games Ive seen in a long time given how little time its had in early access. Its always a gamble but Im willing to give the devs a chance and try and help them some along the way. But if you're tight on money and looking for a game to give you a lot of hours of gameplay you'd be better off going with Subnautica, Empyrion, Rust, or other survival games that have had more years in early access to flesh out their content, and check out Osiris again after its had more development.", "timestamp_created": 1487002435, "timestamp_updated": 1487002435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 110, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839843630790710449", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34763307": {"recommendationid": "34763307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041387304", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1177, "last_played": 1504338628}, "language": "english", "review": "You can:\n\nCrash land on a foreign space planet like [i]Interstellar[/i]\nDodge the giant space worms from [i]Dune[/i]\nShoot a chrome hi-tech space machine gun/pistol like [i]Oblivion[/i]\nRespawn on Day 1 when you die like [i]Edge of Tomorrow[/i]\nKill the space aliens from [i]Alien[/i] & [i]Aliens[/i]\nPlant crops in a space base you built like [i]The Martian[/i]\nDrive a buggy like [i]Mad Max[/i] (but on a space desert, mind you)\nRide a space hoverbike like [i]Star Wars[/i]\nPilot a space mech from [i]Avatar[/i]\nAnd be lonely on a spaceship like [i]Passengers[/i]\n\nBest Sci-Fi movie simulator 2017. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1504640372, "timestamp_updated": 1506643833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 146, "votes_funny": 87, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836904287338256836", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25813690": {"recommendationid": "25813690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009515946", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 806, "last_played": 1632518961}, "language": "english", "review": "I definitely support buying Osiris: New Dawn in its current state.

But the problem with it, lies with bad design choices by the developer. Not lack of resources, time or pandering to the audience. \n\nLet's start by talking about the survival mechanics. There is food, water and both of your health meters - suit integrity and health. There is another meter for temperature but i have found that for the most part, you can just ignore this. Already, a bad design choice was to make simple intake of food and water difficult. In order to get water, you have to craft a glass container to get water from a lake. Or sap from a tree. You cant take water directly from the lake. You need a crafting station to build a vessel to accept the water! Then there is food. In order to obtain food, you must hack trees and plants and consume their leaves or attack monsters that MAY drop meat that needs to be cooked. The trouble with the latter is that many monsters push your camera up towards the sky, disorientating you. And the game is frequented by far, by the much deadlier monsters than can tear you apart without even trying. Bad design choice number 1. \n\nMoving on to the monsters, we have different variations from tiny little bug like creatures barely bigger than a roomba and all the way up to sand worms that are bigger than a skyscraper. I will talk about this in particular in a little while. There are flying monsters, crawling monsters, walking monsters and even ones that spit damaging stuff at the player. Another bad design choice is having these monsters wander around seemingly at random, with no goal or directive in mind. Sure, that wouldnt be a bad thing if they mostly kept to the areas that have resources needed for late game. Trouble is, they hang around early game resources too. Meaning, you can die trying to obtain the most basic of resources 10 minutes after starting the game. And you have no realistic way of defending yourself from these super large monsters until much, MUCH later in the game. Bad design decision number 2. \n\nA seperate section dedicated to the sand worm and it's problems. The concept of the sand worm is really great. The implementation of it, is just amatuerish. Why is this? Because it requires you know where they roam. Here is a point - they telegraph their arrival with rumbling, shaking camera and Dune style emerge from the ground far off in a big long arc directly aiming to land again right on top of you. For the most part, you can simply run to avoid them. But another bad design choice, which i will get into shortly, is movement is stifled by the ''small hops''. Move a tiny distance down a slope and you will ''hop'', land, come to a complete stop regardless of your forward momentum and require you to begin to move again. So now, a simple side step becomes impossible and the trajectory of the worm becomes impossible to avoid BECAUSE of the design of movement. And dont get me started on the horrendous jetpack. Bad design choice number 3. Which is my next topic. There is also the issue that if you chose to build your base in an area where - unbeknownst to you - the sand worm can reach, it is entirely possible to have your ENTIRE BASE wiped out in one single sand worm breach. It can destroy spaceships (which i wont talk about as that is end game and kinda spoilerish) vehicles and entire bases. I have had my base entirely wiped out by a worm. Through no fault of my own other than not already knowing where it can reach. \n\nMovement is a huge problem in this game. And not because it is hard. The short hops you do are a part of the problem, but not the entirity of it. Then there is your ''stamina'' for running, which, for whatever reason, is represented by an oxygen meter. /shrug. That is no big deal. The jetpack is another really wonderous yet... inexplicably bad tool in your toolkit. It seems to have a mind of it's own when and where it wants to work. You can use it to go straight up, yet you can only use about a third of your fuel (which replenishes slowly) before it just... cuts off. Allowing you to plummet to the ground. And if you decide to jump off a small cliff thinking of using the jetpack to arrest your downward momentum, well no. It for whatever reason WONT FIRE and the result is damage to your health. Why does the jetpack cut off? Why can you only use a third of the fuel in one burst? Why is touching the ground a trigger to cease firing the jetpack? Bad design choice number 4. \n\nBase building and crafting. This part is the one part that is exceptional. Clearly the developer's skills in this area, far outweight every other part of the game. You have a crafting menu where you can craft basic tools, walls, turrets, buildings and crafting stations. For the most part, i never experienced any problems with crafting or the building of a base. Things snap to the ground really well and crafting stations 'make sense'. The gathering of resources usually involve hours of smacking rocks with various implements, gathering liquid in glass containers, filling gas tanks from natural vents and hacking of enemies and space wreckage. Once resources have been gathered, you bring them back to the crafting station to start making things out of them. \n\nI have experienced what i would call the 'end game', but i dont like to spoil a game in a review, so i wont talk about it here. \n\nMy advice for anyone interested in trying this game out - dont go into any other mode besides creative. Unless you are a masochist and enjoy the game being unfair. If so, by all means!\n\nMy ending comment will be this - if the developer chose to fix the issues i mentioned, the entire community would benefit greatly as this game has serious potential. They already fixed the ''AFK for too long = anyone can steal your stuff'' problem last year, so it is clear the developer does listen. The problem is convincing them of the game's issues. Time will tell if they can see the problems and fix them.\n\nEDIT - Just an FYI. A review is NOT intended to deter you from buying a game, unless it specifically says so. A review is there to give you the author's insight into what the game is and by offering you an in-depth understand of what you would be getting you can make an informed decision if you should buy it or not.

From the start, you can see that your base is exploding with you being the only survivor. You crash land on Proteus II in your escape pod. If you follow the story, which the devs state as Recommended, you will need to repair a base which was constructed by other astronauts on a previous expedition, get a satellite dish working and finally, repair a space ship to go into space. I will not spoil much more of the story.\nThe terrain on the planets, including Proteus II is hand crafted, which used to be a mayor selling point for Fenix Fire. The terrain is well detailed, graphics are very good.\nNow that you have an idea of this game, lets talk about gameplay.\nNow, from my POV this gameplay is falling short. You spend the majority of the time gathering resources during daylight. For some reason, there aren't many aliens around during the day except in places you soon learn them to be.\nOther then that, the resources you gather... well, the devs require you to gather much more then at the start of the early access time. Building / Repairing the base is what you do and is your main objective.\nAfter that, you go into space and thats about it.\nFighting aliens isn't a big selling point either. My advice? If you really are into space survival games, then OND is worth some time but has little replay value.\nFenix Fires record from the early access time isn't good. They simply didn't do what they promised and didn't listen to the players which was building an entire solar system in which to explore, build.. expand and so forth. They didn't deliver that well. They make you run / drive around for a lot of resources, then you go into space and thats about it.\nPlaying the story line lets you do the things I mentioned.\nWhen starting a non story driven game you have either a creative sandbox game or a hard mode survival game. Worst is, in the current live build... you can't even go to other planets in the solar system! They really have let the player base down. If you want to go to other planets? There is only one way to currently do this which is to start on the other planets.. and of course, do the same thing over again...\nJust consider how much time it took you to build a base in 2017 which is little more then a couple of hours. And now.. yeah, I was leveling up my character in like a week.. to explore other planets only to figure out I couldn't!\nWell, hopefully Fenix Fire will just sell the entire project to a company who wants to make something out of it.. because as you have probably noticed... this game does have potential.. as long as:\n\nThey make building bases a lot more simple and fun\nThey allow space travel within the system to like 6 other planets\nThey allow to multiplayer be a cooperative game and have a planet or more to really be tough and team up to do defeat very tough enemies.\nPvP I am less optimistic about. It's simply no fun to players to destroy someone elses base without them being online, well perhaps to some gankers but that isn't going to be a great strategy, or to log in to find your base (which you spend weeks on to build in the first place) to be destroyed.\nOr how about to be able to build a super large space city?! You can build in space atm.. it just needs to be improved and perhaps be build together in a multi player environment.\n\nThe reason people are still playing this game is... yep, you guessed it.. it has so much potential and it looked so great at the start of the early access period.\nAs of today though... this game is not recommended to play.", "timestamp_created": 1496615299, "timestamp_updated": 1693418743, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 193, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825886249542236328", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25807461": {"recommendationid": "25807461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057489354", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1329, "last_played": 1512575100}, "language": "english", "review": "In summary, and incredibly good game and an incredibly good development team.\n\nPros:\n1.)

Its laggy as all hell and there are bloom and motion blur effects that, no word of a lie, cannot be turned off.  These effects are very heavy as well to the point where the motion blur is akin to riding a spinning carnival ride.  It gives me motion sickness within seconds and I have to stop playing.

I rank it a \"Not yet\" rating. There is a really good frame here for them to build on, but there just isn't much content. Normally in early access I wouldn't ding a game for this, but the EA status description lead me to believe there would be much more.\n\nQuote:\nWhat is the current state of the Early Access version?\n\u201cTraditionally, publishers we've worked with define Alpha as \u201ccontent complete\u201d and Beta as \u201cfeature complete,\u201d with Gold referring to a full release candidate. We'd currently place ourselves between Alpha and Beta: call it \"early Beta\" if you will. \n\n/quote\n\nIn their words an Alpha is content complete, and they state the game is beyond Alpha. If this is truly the majority of the content they intend to place in the game, this is a definite Not Buy. There is a small number of things you can build, and many of them are not working properly. Buildings beyond the main dome do not pressurize for example. \n\nState of the game: a lot of small bugs, some annoying and some near game breaking. There are problems such as items disappearing from containers, structures disappearing or duplicating when exiting and reloading a game, holes in the world, creatures and resources spawning on cave ceilings, and game status resetting upon re-entering an existing game. \n\nCurrently the E button puts away whatever tool you are holding in your hand. You need to do this to move at full speed. When you have the multi-tool in your hand, which is used to build walls for example, and you press E when aiming at a structure it will delete that structure. No confirmation or warning, and no resources returned, just POOF it's gone. That's a frustrating situation, and having that on the same key that is used to put your tool away makes it easy to do. \n\nPerformance is really good in single player mode. In official multiplayer servers the frame rates are reduced severly, even when no one else in on screen. I am guessing this is server side lag, and it makes multiplayer nearly unplayable. \n\nThe atmosphere is excellent, if not brutal at times. The dust storms will make you seek shelter and wait it out. Night time is tense as you can't see very well and aliens will sneak up on you. The fog is very nicely done, even though it again makes it next to impossible to accomplish anything. I am tempted to suggest that they tame the environment down a bit because there are many times when you can't do anything, but then that is part of the charm in a way. \n\nThe pacing of the game is slow. Really slow. Incredibly slow. To quote Joe Dirt, \"I saw a snail over there. He said, that thing's slow, it ain't moving fast. It's boring, dull. I'm yawning\". I believe the slow pace is to cover the lack of content, because it will take you hours to gather enough resources to place a single structure. There needs to be a better system of mining. Doing it yourself is too slow because you can't carry much without your movement speed getting reduced to a crawl, and the resources will be spread all over the world. You do have a droid that can mine, but it's hit or miss. The droid has pathing issues that makes it get stuck on terrain, and sometimes when you set it to mine a zone with a good resource, it just mines Iron, even though there is no visible Iron in the zone. Sometimes it just stops doing anything at all. Leaving the game and re-entering will reset the droid and bring it back to your spawn location, but that triggers the other issues mentioned earlier.\n\nTo sum it up: I think and hope this will be a really amazing game one day. If you purchase, do so knowing that there is little content, and only if you want to be a part of the development. Your two hour refund window will be up long before you see enough of the game to know if you like it, again because of the slow pacing. In two hours you will probably have placed the temporary inflatable dome and collected a fraction of the resources needed to place the dome of a real base. That dome will just be a skeleton, and you'll need more resources to build walls and the craft stations that go inside it.", "timestamp_created": 1475156644, "timestamp_updated": 1475156644, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 425, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.802710533142089844", "comment_count": 46, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25790484": {"recommendationid": "25790484", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981723215", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 711, "last_played": 1484872465}, "language": "english", "review": "Reached end-game\n\nNote: I played the entire game on a Private server with 1 other player.\n\nThe immersion of this game is unrivaled.

The game now has a much better way for the players to find resources (they don't seem to respawn on the overworld, though, so use them wittingly) The Buggie and other such vehicles are now much less cumbersome to move about in and feel more fluid (with the exception of the Mech, which definitely needs a bit more work on animations and moving up / down hill) The droids are also a very nice addition, especially with the on-map commands that allow ou to teleport them to you in case they get stuck (which happens a lot, but at least there is a band-aid fix atm) The crafting system has become better as well, boasting new craftables and harvestables alike; however, there does need to be some balance changes to weapons and ammo as I feel like there is absolutely zero incentive for using a Pistol or Cryogun / Flamethrower.\n\nThe biggest gripes I have right now are still the fact that there is nothing to do in caves. There is loot, sure; enemies from time to time, but there is no reason to be there. There is no lore to find, no boss to kill, no exclusive minerals, just no reason to be there really. Ontop of that, the caves on Aziel and Zer are very bugged. The ones on Aziel has the floor lose its mesh at some point and drop you into the void where you either log out or die. The ones on Zer have the enemies bugged to where you can't identify or loot them. The caves on Lutari and Proteus 2 are working fine, other than the fact that when I place down Path Lights to mark my way and navigate the tunnels i've already been through, they just disappear after a certain point making them useless. I am unsure if you removed the storyline you had going because the previous company owns the copyright or what, but players need some kind of drive, some kind of mystery as to what happened to the crew of the first mission(s) here. The most fun i've had so far is creating multiple drills for resources and protecting them with multiple droids while enemies surge in as it creates a pseudo-tower defense mini game. The planet surfaces (other than Proteus 2) are severly lacking in enemies; so much so that I haven't seen a single natural enemy on Aziel, they only spawned when I made the drills. Zer is also incredibly barren in enemies. Lutari has enough enemies so they don't feel non-existent, but they still feel scarce. Also, I thought there were more enemy types than I have seen currently? Were some removed? Same with the Flora on these planets. Not on you guys, but the wiki for this game is so incredibly out of date that I just don't think anyone is playing or cares about it; and that needs to be addressed. I still would not recommend this game due to the simple fact that once you've been to every planet and gathered all resources there is nothin left to do. I was so ready to storm these caves with my sick weapons and 200+ ammo packs, but there are maybe a handful of enemies in each cave with no incentive to kill them other than some small amount of xp; to which, leveling up is kind of pointless. You get a new stat point, which is cool I guess, but aside from that there is no level restriction on gear or any craftables like Ark or other such games.\n\nTL;DR\nThe game isn't bad, there's just nothing to do and still has some bugs that need to be worked out.

This issue has to do with structure decay.\n\nMy brother and I had been playing multiplayer for a while, and we created a nice base for ourselves, including a ship hangar.  I do love the fact that this game can be started by one player, and other players who have joined can log in and play the same game, without the original host being present, and without having to pay for a server; that's a very nice touch.  However, my brother and I slowed down on our game play, and chose to play some other games for a while, so we didn't get burnt out on this game.  We recently logged back into our game, only to find that the entire base had decayed to the point of completely disappearing, with exception to everything placed in the base.  Now we have a bunch of floating storage lockers and machines everywhere.  I'm okay with the decay aspect, but when there's literally nobody in the game, I don't understand why the decay is still running.  These aren't live servers, like you might find with Rust or other games running 24 hours, so I really don't think the decay should continue to tick away on your structures when there's no-one playing; it's like you're being punished for taking a break from the game.\n\nAt this point in the game, I can't recommend it, simply because you can't take a break from the game and expect to come back to anything left of your structures after said break.", "timestamp_created": 1565200465, "timestamp_updated": 1565200569, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.795102715492248535", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1565806793, "developer_response": "It's this very issue that has prompted us to redesign multiplayer PVP modes.

The music feels like its been written by Hans Zimmer himself. (Interstellar, The Dark Knight, Inception) Just the sheer epicness of the music puts me in the immersion of an epic space theme game.\n\nThe art, sound and level design is amazing, they just harmonise so well together. I never had an immersive experience as this compared to other crafting survival genre games (7DTD, Ark,Terraria, Starbound, DayZ) The easy mode of day time vs paranoia and horror during the night (random noises) keeps your eye peeled for any Arachnid Night Walkers. Night time is REALLY dark. Think of aliens from Dead Space/Pitch Black coming for you.\n\nTake in mind Osiris was developed by a team of two, still a better release than a game which cost the same as a AAA title and had a major distributor backing their release which I should refrain from naming. In terms of content, its not too shabby for an Early Access. Can't compare the amount of content with other EA releases (Ark, Subnautica) as this game was just released recently whereas the others have a head start of a few years give or take.\n\nOne of the interviews with the dev did mentioned that they will have major updates every month. Also the devs did mention they might aim for a console port in the future. (hopefully this does not hamper on the patches and updates for PC) Yes developers need money to continue developing the game but really, consoles are limited by their sandwich press hardware.\n\nNo idea why people keep comparing this game to Ark. In Osiris New Dawn you don't poop your pants every 5minutes ingame however Osiris took it up a notch further with immersion as you will poop your pants (in real life) when an unsuspecting alien creeps behind you.\n\nThe only time I felt threaten is when the night crawlers come. The giant sandworm (only appears in craters) are easily dodgeable just like One Man's Lie fanboys dodging facts about its failure as well as Ark fanboys dodging constructive criticism on the dev team's approach of a paid DLC on an EA game. \n\nI hope that the devs maybe somehow explore the possibility of having burrowed aliens (not the giant sandworm) as I think it will create a sense that the player is never safe and in turn increase the daytime difficulty slightly.

So I'm forced to create feedback that has actual impact.\n\nPut briefly, [i]Osiris: New Dawn[/i] is an object lesson in how the Early Access system can be abused. The game doesn't simply lack polish, it is very clearly unfinished. I'd been waiting a long time for it to come out of Early Access, because I wanted a new survival game to play with my friends that has a dark atmospheric setting.\n\nBut I did not have my friends buy this one. I told them to remove it from their wishlists instead, because I no longer hold out hope that the game will be improved to the point where I'd want to play it.\n\nI knew I was in trouble right away when the UI prompted me to \"pickup\" an item (It's \"pick up\", and that's not being pedantic in a product people pay money for.) But I pressed on anyway. The next serious problem was that opening the inventory doesn't stop you from interacting outside of it. If you drag and drop inventory items, you're meanwhile swinging a knife or using an item.\n\nBlatant carelessness exposed early is almost always a bad omen, and this was not an exception. Much of what was shown off as in-game early on seems to be missing. And while I assiduously avoided playing over the refund limit, I don't think playing longer would have helped.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the developer is in very serious denial about the reason the game is being negatively reviewed. To hear them explain it, the game's failure is [i]the fault of the players[/i]. Yes, folks, you and I are to blame, for being unreasonable in asking for things like \"deliver what you showed us\" and \"please fix these bugs.\" Nobody can ever succeed in delivering any kind of product worth owning, be it PC games or dish soap, if they live under the delusion that the customer should adjust to the product, and that the customer is to blame if they find the product deficient.

There are no tutorials so I'd end up asking oher players for help.\n\nWhile there is a partially completed main story, this is truly a sandbox game. There seems to be a ton of balancing issues as I found it difficult to get certain items early on in the game (i.e. titanium) at least in the starting area. And even in the end game, it is very dificult to find diamonds to build vehicles and weapons.\n\nSome people say leveling is a grind but it is no different than Skyrim where you'd have to perform those tasks to level the specific area. In the end, it does seem it is way easier to level Engineering than Science and Combat as the game is about building and mining stuff. That will require some balancing.\n\nAs advertised, the game does offer graphics similar to AAA studios. And they have a bold mission of creating an entire solar system in this game.

It has been an EA title back then, same as it's now, and sadly playability hasn't improved much. A lot of people blame old devs for a lack of direction in developing the game, and praise the new ones for consistency. I fail to see anything that has changed in the game core for the better.\n\nLooking at the progress of this game in ~5 years, I'm afraid it won't turn into anything sensible. That would most probably require redesigning the core gameplay into something more engaging mechanically, and it might be too late for such kind of a deep change.\n\nBelow is the breakdown of game aspects for anyone interested.\n\n[h1]Survival aspects[/h1]\nYou have a health meter and a thirst and hunger ones. There are a range of renewable consumables in the game in the form of alien flora and fauna, and you can generally just chug anything and be done with this. Some buildings will allow you to cook more efficient foodstuff, but it doesn't give you much additional benefits, so overall the system doesn't feel satisfying.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nMobs are kind of okay-ish visually, but fighting them is a UX nightmare. Clipping into models is abundant. There are no mobs with ranged attack anymore - one mob could do that some 4 years ago, but looks like that ability was taken away. Melee is terrible, with strange hitboxes and unreliable damage output. On baseline difficulty mobs don't hit much damage-wise, and none of them feel dangerous at all, even a multi-story Goliath bug.\n\nTo top that off, mobs usually spawn right before your eyes a bit above ground. All of them in your vicinity usually aggro you as soon as you start gathering resources, so it's a constant boring and tedious fight with them.\n\nThere are pistols, rifles and whatnots, but crafting ammo for those is expensive and most weapons don't kick as much, so the bulk of combat boils down to running into a mob and clicking them to death. Shame.\n\n[h1]Resources and crafting[/h1]\nThe recent game version, same as the old one, uses a combination of above-surface mineral nodes, gas geysers, pools of liquids and the occasional plant-based resources. These are scattered on the map, are static and, depending on your difficulty config, everything could be renewable. By default mineral nodes aren't, the rest is.\n\nMinerals are gated through the hardness system, where you need to upgrade your mining implement to be able to collect higher-tiered resources. The bad thing is that there are some 10+ types of metals strewn around the map in large clusters, and you need to collect a lot of them to progress. Crafting involves smelting alloys, which means there's another 10+ of smeltables. Figuring out the list of raw resources to build something is on you - the game wouldn't break down a recipe for you, but you can at least pin some of the recipes to the HUD to track your progress.\n\nIn general the system is okay, but has become worse. Old version used mineral nodes with mixed mineral composition, so you could hunt for a specific pure nodes, or be content with a lower yield of something you needed. These days, you'll have to hunt for each and every material type independently, which feels like an unnecessary complication.\n\n[h1]Base building[/h1]\nProgression is gated via a couple of production buildings. There are different tiers (furnace > forge > printer > chemplant > fabricator > laboratory/garage), building them requires different tiers of resources and sometimes indoor space, which means building larger habitats. The usual game design thing. There's no incentive to build larger bases once you've got the progression unlocked.\n\nLast update added an option to build an orbital station, and there's a way to construct modular buildings from blocks (instead of fully prefabed ones), but with no clear goal for those I didn't try that out.\n\n[h1]Exploration[/h1]\nThere are currently three planets. A starting one is the most fleshed out, with a lot of asset reuse since the 4yo game version. It's an okay one, and the design for the props has always been okay in this game.\n\nOnce you've got a space ship constructed (that for some reason doesn't consume fuel, even though the humble rover eats hydrazine by the hectolitres), you can visit \"orbit\" - a static space above the first planet with a couple of rocks anchored and just sitting there motionless, - and fly and land onto two other planets.\n\nThese two planets are mostly placeholders. One mob type per planet and some extra resources thrown around. No points of interest, really. Exploring past the initial location is currently only necessary to get two higher-tier resources. Which you don't really need unless you want to try out some buildings and items that don't really have much application at this point as there's little extra content to explore.\n\nCoupled with a clunky locomotion system where you would stumble against any sloped terrain, and a kind of inertial movement that's way to unresponsive for some, little is rewarding here.\n\n[h1]Character progression[/h1]\nLittle of this is available. Your character has main XP bar, as well as profession-relevant XP bars. Filling the first gives you attribute points to spend on Strength, Stamina, Speed and HP, filling the rest awards you skillpoints for the specific profession trees.\n\nWhile upon starting the game you can choose a class for your character, this is mostly cosmetic as it influences the initial pool of skill points. All characters are born equal, and profession skill trees don't offer specialization.\n\nOld game version used to gate some items and buildings behind prerequisite profession skills you would need to buy out first. As of 2021, all profession skills are purely extra bonuses (e.g. mining speed, item durability etc) that you can live without.", "timestamp_created": 1622299948, "timestamp_updated": 1622299948, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785456061363220215", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68579594": {"recommendationid": "68579594", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970522312", "num_games_owned": 606, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 2428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2428, "last_played": 1505775370}, "language": "english", "review": "Well I tried to warn all of you that this was a sinking ship that was going to be a waste of money. \n\n \n\nI cannot in good conscience recommend anyone purchase this game.

This went on for months before the community started asking about updates.  A year later and the developers promised that a update would come soon.  Another few more months go by with more development updates and screen shots but no update. Another year and a glimmer of hope hits the community.  It's a countdown for remaining tasks before the big release of 2 years of work.  A few more months and a few more tasks.  I feel a bit excited as I've been waiting years to finally play the game again.  Another month and the countdown is finished.  Then silence.  Everyone is asking where is the big update?  News finally hits a few weeks later.  The developers decides to do a closed beta test in a EA game for the big update.  The community is like WTF!  So they start taking apps for the test.  Another few months go by and news hits that the new big update is going to be the 1.0 release of the game.  I mean HOLY C. R. A. P.!!!!\n\nAll along the way it have been dishonest and lies from the developer.   \n\nI want to tack on a post from the forums that kept getting buried\n\nFacts about the beta & our distrust of Fenix Fire\nThe below is all factual, feel free to go look up the sources (I've included links).\n\nThe beta was a massive disappointment because Fenix Fire was blatantly claiming things were includedin the beta that absolutely were not, even in the news post announcing its release!\n\nIf you look back in the news feed there is a post from June 1st that goes here:\nhttp://www.fenixfire.com/news/2019/5/31/osiris-new-dawn-improved-base-building-3d-utility-system-power-system-and-more\n\nIt has pretty pictures and talks about what they've been working on: improved base building, automatic ground deformation, utilities, power routing, etc.\n\nOn June 24th there was another news entry that leads here:\nhttp://www.fenixfire.com/news/2019/6/24/osiris-new-dawn-beta-5-polish-suit-status-mech-movement-laser-tool-and-more\n\nThis one specifically states things that will be in the beta including: polish, mech movement, pathfinder vehicle, improved vehicle camera, weather radar, improvements to the mech, new scope for the assault rifle,\n\nOn July 20th they made a post that the beta had been released, that post included a list of things that were in the beta. Some of which were:\n- Power Distributor-Wind Turbine\n- Geothermal Plant\n- Nuclear Reactor\n- Fusion Reactor\n- 4 Way Hallway\n- T Interaction Hallway\n- Glass Hallway\n- Base Building Improvements\n- Automatic Ground Deformation\n- Utility Panel System\n- Power Routing System\n- Improved Redicle System\n- Lots of minor fixes and improvements\n\nALL OF THE ABOVE - ALL OF IT - EITHER DID NOT EXIST OR DID NOT WORK IN THE BETA!\n\nImproved base building? It was impossible to build a base at all - any base in the beta. If you could manage to survive long enough and acquire materials any structure you could build was broken and was incapable of being pressurized. Many structures were listed in the build menus, but the resources to build them were impossible to get in the beta. This is because those structures did not actually exist.\n\nMany of the things appearing in the build menus were bogus. I know this because I edited my save game to give me all the resources but the game still couldn't build many things in the build menu (it just wouldn't).\n\nUtility & power system? It was virtually impossible to collect the materials to build any of this. If you did manage to build it nothing worked. The power boxes kept having their internal parts disappear and even if you got everything in place for a few minutes none of the functionality would work.\n\nThey talked about vehicles and the mech, right? These were so far beyond possible to create in the beta that it was a joke. And, as mentioned above, even cheating to have all the raw materials it was impossible to build any vehicles at all.\n\nAll of those promised things were fed to us with pretty pictures and videos. The beta was intentionally crippled so that players were greatly limited on what resources they could acquire and how long they could survive (by there being no food, water or air available). This was done to hide the fact that much of the build menu was fake and those things were not actually included.\n\nThis is why many of us who have been around this game for a long time have ZERO TRUST and don't believe A SINGLE WORD that Fenix Fire says.\n\nI truly wish it wasn't so, but the fact is that Fenix Fire talks a big game and shows lots of pretty graphics off that implies they have actually completed something - but then they spectacularly fail to deliver.\n\nI've kept hoping that they might actually LEARN from their past mistakes, correct their behaviors, communicate honestly and improve.

Not a small dev who uses assets in their games, but the ones who just get some asset packs, slap them together and don't do any coding or any sort of transformative work at all.  \n\nDon't buy the game, even on sale, it's not worth it. If you want to play a game something like this, Space Engineers is actually, finally, getting some updates inbound. Starsand is amazing for the survival on an alien world front, and, despite the strong spirit of jank that the game has, a single developer has been tirelessly working on and continuing to support a game that blows this out of the water, and they've been at it for more than a decade. That game is Empyrion. \n\nNow, here are the words directly from the Dev's last announcement regarding the game. Keep in mind that if you buy this game, the only dev left is the one who wrote this, and they've gone dark... Also keep in mind that they mention that they're \"going to do better with their next game\", which, I'm sorry, but, we should trust you with another game? At any rate: \n\n[b] \"We just wanted to jump in and thank you all for your support over the years. This has been a long road, too long, and we're flattered that you've been here with us through it all.As we stated in the release from Early Access, we are happy with where the game is, and look forward to moving on. Sure, there's always things that can be added or improved, but for the past three years we've seen no noticeable increase in player count or sentiment, which has left us feeling like we'vebeen spinning our wheels for some time now.Also, we have noticed that many players who purchased back in 2016 came from the dream expectation set by other games in the genre - the \"everything\" space game with endless planets to explore, endless ships and based to build, all in either a rich singleplayer storied adventure, or in any variety of multiplayer modes. While we never said this was \"our\" dream, it was nevertheless thrust upon us. No matter how many times we confirmed what we were focusing on and what are predetermined scope was, some players refused to understand and respect the scope we set for ourselves. And to be honest, a little unfair considering we were a team of four with a budget of $100K raised from friends and family.In the end, and for our own creative exploration, it is time to move on. Six years is more than enough time to prove out a game idea and run this experiment of open development. We listened to you, worked with you, and finished what we set out to do. We found that working any more on it would please some players but upset more along the way - OND attracted A LOT of players, many of which wanted diametrically different experiences from this game. You can see that in the forums, the reviews, and on Discord. We stumbled onto a type of game that sparked a lot of passion for what we built, and for that we are humbled.Moving on we will be taking some well deserved time off. To keep us from going stale we generated a lot of prototypes along the way. All I can tell you is that this is not the end of the Osiris Universe, but only the beginning. We need a new chapter, a new beginning, and for this to happen we need to close the previous chapter and look to the possibilities in the endless horizon.That said, the game will be going into Long Term Support, meaning we'll keep the servers on and address any game breaking issues, in attempts to keep the game running as long as possible. Any new features requests will be saved for future projects - there was A LOT of stuff we wanted to keep adding in, but we had to cut it off somewhere!We're also reducing the price to make the game more accessible in these difficult economic times so that more people can enjoy our little passion project.\nFarewell and safe travels,\nFenix Fire\" [/b}\n\nSince there's currently a sale on the game, I don't want you wasting your money on this game.

I walked around for an hour and only found a single one, and had to turn that into a bashing rock after my pickaxe thing broke.

Kill a bug and it ragdolls a mile away, at night you've probably lost its carcass for harvesting.\n\n2. Hover jet used to be cool, now it's inexplicably dangerous - if you just 'land' you will get hurt, you have to drop a bit and then hit space a bit to re-hover, even if you are just inches above the ground (e.g. hovering up a hill) you will get hurt.\n\n3. Sleep is locked at six hours, cannot watch the speed time and wake up at dawn, and cannot go to sleep at a set time (e.g. 9pm) to wake up at a set dawn (i.e. 3am), no, the length of night changes without any notification.\n\n4. The level and hardness of your tools and the hardness of the ore you are mining do not seem to correlate in any logical manner to the damage your tool takes or the damage done to the ore being mined (i.e. 'softer' tools can -not always- mine faster and take less durability wear than 'harder' tools).\n\n5. You get 'stuck' on slopes, you are going up a hill and you just seem to stop moving when almost at the top, have to hover-jet over the ridge. And going downhill is worse, you move at a crawl.\n\n6. Steering the buggy is loony. You get third-person view only, and it is floating, not fixed, so when you turn the buggy you are not facing the same way and have to re-orient your view.\n\n7. There used to be several different types of alien bugs, now there seems to only be one. Why take elements like that OUT of the game?\n\n8. Changes to Key Bindings do not save! It is very annoying to set a key binding, play, save, exit, come back to the game and find that your key bindings have gone.\n\n\nThe point is that almost all of these problems are new, i.e. they either did not exist or were nowhere near as pronounced years ago, the developers are making things worse.

They are blowing the same smoke with unsubstantiated updates that project genome did(likely for the same reasons)I will not be updating this review further as it is vapor ware.  Some will say oh they have videos and stuff, and I don't really care/end update\n\n\nUPdate Feb 2019:\n I stopped testing it about 1 yr ago as no content was being added.   Like all pure survival games once one plateaus there is really nothing left to do.\n\nFast forward a year and nothing has really changed on the survival front.  Don't get me wrong it's good for what it is compared to most survival games, however other aspects of the game never got love.  PVP is/was pretty stale(fun fact there is a recent dev post floating around they intend to disable it).  PVE is/was pretty much watch your turrets kill everything.  Logging on an MP server is insta gib lag since assets built by people over a yr ago(who left) are still there.  You wont find ANYONE if your into coop. Over the coarse of the last week  the avg participation on EC servers was 4-7.  NOTE: this isn't on 1 sever this was the total of ALL east coast.  One day during peak hrs it broke a high water mark of (drum roll please) a whole 14 spread across 20+ servers....Woohoo I guess...\n\nNot only does the game give a fair appearance of having been abandoned, but the work and systems that were already in game are getting removed due to an engine re-write.  Your guess is as good as mine if those systems/mechanics make it back in.  But currently it's going backwards.  \n\nGenerally speaking anytime you see a game completely re-write, upgrade and/or replace an engine b4 the title even launches it's a big red flag(Project Genome would be an example).  Rule of thumb pre-release re-writes like this are an indicator of significant \"issues\".  A failure to design within the scope of the engine and/or licensing.  A failure to limit feature creep outside the scope of the engine and/or licensing.  A failure in understanding the capabilities/limts of the engine and/or licensing,  bad planning and/or last but not least poor time management as any significant engine modification requires significant rework/scrapping of systems/mechanics that were already on your DONE list. = waisted time just to tread water if your lucky, drown if ya aint.\n\n\nIdeally development should be an additive process, if much/most of your time results in a subtractive process you might be doing it wrong....regardless if it's tech, legal, or personnel issues.  Those issues ALWAYS ultimately derive from management decisions and/or bias.  Bad management is the singular greatest killer of EA KS dreamers vs EA KS scammers(whom never intended to produce a viable product anyway), at this point I am unsure which camp Osiris falls into anymore.  At this point legit arguments can be made either way.\n\nCurrently if there is anyone still on the planet that is considering this title, I advise waiting till launch(if it does)\n\nOriginal review:\nWhen this game 1st hit early access it was much more feature complete than typical early access games.

I have read some negative reviews on the game, and I do see where some of the complaints are coming from. That said, there are a few mitigating things that belay, in my opinion,  the negatives.\n\nFirst, the big issue I have read about is the fact you start the game with little to nothing to work with and must, for the most part, use the simple tool of a rock to get started. Here's the thing, this game, from what I am seeing, is an attempt to give a, somewhat, realistic feel of being stranded on a hostile planet with litle advanced resourse. (Manufactered Tools, Technologies ect.) So you start with what is provided by the planet, till you can advance to more relatable tech-levels. This, in my eyes, gives this game a level of complecty and sense of urgancy that is the hallmark of a well concieved game, with in its chosen genra; base building Survivals.\n\nAnother issue, I have read, is that whatever you make a furture patch can take it all away and leave you with the need to start over from scratch, once more. That complaint is an odd one, considering this is an Early Access game. It goes without saying that you will be starting over many times before the finally game his, actual, launch. If you did not want to experiance the lost of months of progress it would be best not to purchase the game till it's full release. But, and this is something to take note of and the reason, most, ppl do purchase EA games. The chance to help make a stable, enjoyable and playable game. If someone feels this game has poteinal, then, instead of saying the game is unrecocmengable for things that are not technical issues, it, might, be more productive to send your feedback to the developers and see if there might be changes to be had, that will make the game a bit more enjoyable for you and those that agree with you, while not lowering the quality of what, positive, changes that have, already, been made.\n\nAnyways, this is my take on the game and, a couple of issues that have been expressed.", "timestamp_created": 1502125753, "timestamp_updated": 1502125753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75693047046661377", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94230392": {"recommendationid": "94230392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005034233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 11730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9106, "last_played": 1672173999}, "language": "english", "review": "Game was very promising in the beginning, had a lot of potential.

It comes with many tools and toys to work towards that feel and sound great. Loot/salvage/exploration/building mechanics are very nicely done as well. Its got all the bells and whistles you would expect from the genre, and looks to go above and beyond some of my \"AAA\" titles. (Following review is pretty long, and has all the deets.)\n\nIm pretty uneasy about EA titles, as i have a few in my library that are completely dead/money grabs. Seeing the trailers for this game and reading reviews, i was pretty skeptical. The trailers looked too good, and the reviews are mixed, which to me is a warning.\n\nHowever, i am pleasantly surprised at what i got for my on sale, 12 dollar game. \n\nStarting off, you get to pick a class (basically a boost to parts of the tech tree to start with) and get some light character customization. They took the time and made each suit class differ, and has both gender options (for those that care). Already i was impressed, as none of it felt cheaply implemented. After that, i dove into the big wide world.\n\nHere i noticed the visuals/load times. The game looks great and loads quickly (max settings, and on an SSD). The trailer footage is on par with what i experienced graphics wise (not all the action stuff, but thats later). The sounds however were hit and miss.\n\nThe world and weather sound good. The impact from the enemies walking around (crab ones) were very well done, and the music/ambiance went hand in hand to build a leery atmosphere. All the menu sounds were pleasant as well.\n\n On the other hand, the starting tool was rather loud and obnoxious to use at first, and the player footsteps were somewhat inconsistent and made me think an enemy was close, when in fact it was my character shifting around while standing still. Hitting things in the face felt hefty and the rifle i made sounded outstanding after using a dingy blaster pistol.\n\nMechanics wise, the game hits all the boxes and does it pretty well. Starting with the good, the food and thirst are pretty fair. You dont have to stuff your face and chug gallons of liquid every second (Thank god) and you can get your hands on both with ease. Each food item had has diffrent values I.E: one fruit gives you food/water/heath, while another can give yout lots of food/water, but hurts you a bit. You can cook and farm, which is always welcome, and hunt (more or less).\n\nThe level mechanics are robust and sorta shallow at the same time. You get xp based on what your doing, which is awesome. EX: you build/salvage, you get engineer xp. You fight something, you get combat xp. You harvest a tree/bush, you get science exp. (some activities give you xp for multiple things) All that xp builds into points to spend in a straight forward tech tree. Each upgrade is impactful and meaningful (none of that add .1% to resist something BS) \n\nYou also get personal xp to spend on your standard stam/health/speed/strength stuff. Each point makes a noticeable difference. I feel im in the midish/earlier stages, and have my tree about maxed (which saddens me, and is the shallow part) but my character still has a bit to go.\n\nThe main thing that pulls me to the genre is crafting/building. Osiris hits the nail on the head imo. I like to salvage and break stuff down, and build shiny cool toys. This game brings both to the table and brings alot. You can find busted bases and repair or break them down. Same goes for vehicles. I personally rebuilt a bio dome and a buggy. The process wasnt tedious and it felt quite fulfilling when i completed the repairs.\n\nThere are multiple milestones so to speak, when building up to gear and tech. The transition is decently paced, but can pull you in many directions. There was a point (after repairing a biodome) that i had to make a forge, which felt like a big deal, and was eager to make it. However, getting the mats for it felt daunting at the time, and was quite a jump up from the previous requirements. After awhile i got it done, and was greeted with a bunch of unlocks which felt quite rewarding, and gave me my next goals.\n\nWith crafting stations, most of them have multiple upgrade options, which i like. Each upgrade either adds more function, or makes a function less tedious. Each upgrade adds to the appearance to the station and gets \"built on\" with your tool. Just a nice touch and i note the extra mile taken here.\n\nAll of that above are some of the main positives for me. I could feel the love and hard work in all of it, and the dev has my respect.\n\nNow for the negatives.. I would like to start by saying, these can change as i dont have alot of time put in (yet) but as of now, and also its EA. These are just my opinions from my 11 hours. Jumping in,\n\nThe combat is my biggest gripe. The different creatures all follow a similar pattern, and fighting them with melee, was not very enjoyable. To start, when you use your hover boots, or jump, you cant swing your weapon. This DROVE ME NUTS. I would boost to get out of the way, but couldnt counter until my feet hit the ground. By that time, i would have to dodge again, and repeat.\n\nIf i wanted to hit it, in its big stupid face, i would have to tank some hits, into my big stupid face. Also, to hit an enemy, in said face, you have to be very on point. What i mean is, while you \"swing\" your weapon, there is no arc or anything. Its straight up, put X on thing, click to hit thing. If the X is not completely on thing (like 100% all the way) then its a miss, and it bites your ass. It could be in your face, point blank, but if the X is just even a little off, or your like, \"in the creature because it doesnt know personal space\", then its a miss. I got used to it, and moved on to guns, but it was extremely annoying.\n\n Dev, if you bothered to read this mass of txt. Please let me dive bomb on these scrubs by letting me swing during jumping/flight.\n\nAnother thing that drove me up the wall, was these MF's will follow you to the ends of the earth sometimes. I ran into my first giant crab monster, and after shitting my pants, i proceeded run the other way like my life depended on it. This thing followed me for 30 mins, and killed me twice. For one, my character was slow as balls, and once i ran low on oxygen, i couldnt sprint. I dove off a cliff and ran behind cover and crouched, but it was still dead locked onto me from a mile away. After awhile i ran to my hut thinking it would F off once i was inside. Nope, it plowed into my POS and wrecked my face. I respawned and it F'd me up a second time. I respawend again, and it just poofed.  Its hit an miss, but alot of the time, the creatures will stalk you, even if your not in the line of sight.\n\nAnother thing i disliked is the way some of the \"craft tables\" work. I built a furnace, which is nice and all. I use it awhile, until i built a forge. At this point, i feel like a high speed, super sleek, forge can do all the things my furnace can do, but better. However, they have completely different bars they can make, among other things. Now my base has multiple  crafting stations that i feel could be condensed. LIke a chem station, and a chemical bench. Or a fabricator and a printer. A forge and a furnace. Things like that. Jumping from a ton of different stations, just to make one thing, for another station, was rather taxing.\n\nI get that realistically, sure, a furnace and a forge have different temps or something, but this is futuristic tech, and a video game. All the stations and many many different ores and bars to make, gets a little overwhelming.\n\nA little side note regarding the mines. Ive only been in a few, and noticed they have the same layout. Im sure its just placeholders maybe but aside from that. Im hoping they can be turned into like say, a dungeon with a \"boss\" and unique loot at the end. Just something i personally would like to see.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1649579351, "timestamp_updated": 1649579351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75335085391998291", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55651185": {"recommendationid": "55651185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085775845", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7611, "last_played": 1648930871}, "language": "english", "review": "This game had a lot of potential.

For the first time in ages, I actually felt on the edge of my seat. I wake up, broken helmet visor, breached suit, losing oxygen to the hostile planet I now reside upon. The temperature outside is a warm 92 Degree's Celsius (197.6 Fahrenheit) and I have so many flashing warning signs across my shattered glass visor, I am barely able to breath myself. It's a little overwhelming. Big letters and numbers at the bottom of my visor tell me I have 0 oxygen left and I can hear that I am now suffocating. Winds are blowing like a hurricane, and I am basically crawling upon the sand surface of this planet I am yet to understand in the slightest.\nI begin by salvaging what's right in front of me, an inflatable dome habitat, and I proceed to fumble about till I find the magic button that inflates the damn thing. I must have been without air for only a minute, but it sure did feel like more, as I finally found some duct tape in a survival kit and smacked it on my helmet to pressurise my suit.\n\nHoly s***. I am liking It so far. And I dont want to spoil anything more, but there is something scary as all hell, as you watch a massive centipede creature burst out of the sand and rocks, fly over head and make an epic landing as it spins around to face you. All the while you stare in amazement of how cool it is before having it lunge at you and pull your legs out from beneath you. You then quickly realise how you should stop fumbling for your gun, just grab it, and shoot the damn thing!\nEnjoying this game so far...\n\nStory aside - \nPros - \nBeautiful environment.\nBreath taking visuals.\nRealistic fogging and build up of dirt on helmet visor.\nResponsive Developers (considering its such a small team.. very good community commincation imo)\nAnimations are remarkable. \nPlayer movement.\nCreature Movement.\nLevel of difficuluty is very nice. Difficult to get resources, but not life draining. (Might help to be in a team?)\n\n\nCons - (In my opinon, these let the game down a bit)\nBuilding system, whilst very nice, doesnt have a smooth placement system. Everything snaps around, instead of a smooth rotation option, the building will snap at 45 degree increments, and when placing a building, it seems to snap along the ground. (Just adds a little bit of grindiness where it isnt needed. Not gaming breaking of course)\n\nLack of fulfilling tutorial. When I was playing it took me a while to figure out how to place walls on the habitat frame. A lot of other things to get you started were mentioned and walked through, but it was a bit confusing for me to realise to use the multitool. (Could have just been me though).\n\nNot all classes are complete yet. It doesnt break the game in any way, but I think I would like to see a bit of prioritzation over that. I know that when I play with friends, we want the option to be different and have different advantages over each class. (They are adding a new class in the next update. 27/4 I believe).\n\nOres are a bit weird. Whilst titanium can be gathered from a rock (which is confusing considering it is an alloy) the fact that I will be mining Iron one moment, copper the next, back to Iron, then finishing with Aluminium... all in the matter of mining one rock on the ground... I would prefer easily distinguishable rocks and maybe less variation in the random ores. It isn't a problem, but it is confusing imo.\n\nOther than those cons, I havent had any problems with the game. It is early access, and it is going very well. I hope this game gets some more suppot as it has got a good future ahead of it, if it continues on its current path.\n\nDefinetely worth the buy, even at full price. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1492408669, "timestamp_updated": 1492408669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749571561813354492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106333150": {"recommendationid": "106333150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140986056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8922, "last_played": 1653940815}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this game back in 2017. Keep coming back to it from time to time. It feels like there is real potential here, but it hasn\u2019t moved forward in all these years.\nBefore the game mechanics were polished, the announcement came, \u201cGuess what? You can now leave the planet.\u201d Feels like that was where the downfall started. Attention became too divided, and it felt like main bugs were being ignored in favor of trying to get space to work properly. Then, game development was pretty much abandoned\u2026 for a time.\nIf I understand it correctly, the game is now under a new development team. It is being rebuilt. Hopefully into something better. It still feels like there is potential. Sadly, Osiris cannot keep my interest long enough to advance to space this time. \nAs of this posting on 12/22/21, if building a panel for something that requires four to nine different components, each of which also requires a number of parts, which in turn require either ore, ingots, ore and ingots, or ingots that also require other types of ingots to build seems interesting to you, this may be your game. \nIf arriving to the upper northwest corner of the map to mine copper, only to discover almost all of the nodes have spawned underground, show on the map, but are unreachable, this game is for you. \nSpawns appear and disappear. At times the game feels unpopulated. The large crabs will agro from long distances, and slowly chase you across the map. It takes forever to shake them. Turns out, they really aren\u2019t that hard to kill right now. \nMines are in the rough, with little to no challenge, but huge payout in upper minerals like diamond, lithium, gold, etc. \nCrafting does not feel logical or linear. \nMovement is janky. I see where they are going with it, but suddenly being slowed on a downhill slope, while trying to escape something, seems broken. I don\u2019t remember movement being an issue before. \nA new player will need to explore the entire map to get the required materials just to build their first base.\nThere are other bugs. Those seem to be the big ones for me. The mysterious humanoid that occasionally appears on the tops of hills, spooking little rabbit pellets out of me, is a huge plus. More things like that please!\nI really, really, really, want to like this game, but cannot recommend at this time. On the other hand, it is currently only eight bucks. Maybe the gamble is worth it in the long run? I was hyped to learn the game is under new development.

The developers wanted the player to \"FEEL\" their game's emotional impact. Rather than some of the other crop-ups in response to No Man's Sky, Osiris takes the detour away from merely exploring. Now it's for survival. Now it's for investigation. Now it's for a better understanding as to why our lives will be forever changed because we are unable to return to Earth.\n\nI don't know how many, but some people will say, \"I'd rather play Astroneer\" or \"I'd rather play Empyrion.\" You know what? That's up to them. Osiris brings to the table AMAZING graphical content. AMAZING animations. AMAZING models. and AMAZING in-game feeling. Ultimately, if you set the table for the hardest gameplay possible, you experience a new realm.\n\nOsiris gives you the tools to explore, build, defend and destroy. Content has been intermittant, but a game that delivers this amount of quality is seeking to make it last. NMS burned because the content couldn't last. Here in Osiris, gameplay is meant to be adventurous and challenging. With the realistic conditions of thermal dynamics, oxygen, and legitimate \"building\" or \"crafting,\" you can expect a change of depth in your otherworldly dreams.\n\nIs there stuff missing? Yes.\nDo the developers listen? Yes.\n\nShould you help them live their dream too? ABSOLUTELY!\n\nLook, this game deserves at least 100hrs in a year from everyone.

Visor cracked, couldnt hit any keys and had no indication of what to do, died without even leaving the capsule. Figured out how to get out of the pod, built a base that served little purpose, fixed a rover and tore everything i built down to move to a premade base that i would have to spend a month repairing.\n\nDay 2: Base is completely repaired but the stupid computer wont let me proceed. Apparently my hallways is still broken even though there is nothing to repair. Built an empty container and tried to fill it with water at the water unit. Immediately gained 3749 levels and had all passives locked out. Jumped off a cliff and hoped for a better afterlife\n\nDay 3:  Reincarnated into the body of another idiot who managed to blow up his ship and crash his pod. Followed the same path except this time listened to my AI overlords and only did what it told me to do. Avoided the water unit like the plague. Randomly had skills locked out again,,, Jumped off the same cliff and figured i would end up in hell.\n\nDay 4: Reincarnated on a planet with another survivor. Together we built a base and had multiverse level glitches that forced us to reset our perceptions. Upon rebooting into this world, all of our diamond tools and inventory was gone. We had been robbed by gremlins and drug all the way back to where we started. The gremlins let us keep our levels thankfully.\n\nDay 5: New survivor friend seems to have put himself offline and the base i helped build changed the locks and said that i wasnt allowed to come home. The ignitions of the vehicles were also changed and my keys no longer worked. Assuming i had been divorced, i set off to build a home of my own.\n\nDay 6: I decided i needed some nitrogen to make fuel for my battle buggy. Traveled to Site B and heard the sound of a worm before i could even see. Then when i could see, proceeded to fall through the world over and over, die, respawn and fall through the world over and over for about 12 minutes. Then after the simulation we live in refreshed i was in my buggy with 10 health on the other side. Got my nitrogen and travelled back to site A. Naturally i repeated the process again, dieing over and over for about 7 minutes, appearing on the other side with no health.\n\nDay 7: Built a super cool space ship. Flew to the stars and told the computer to go to a moon, it basically gave me the middle finger and did nothing. Decided to return to the planet i was on and after almost burning to death was able to regain control about 50 feet above the ground heading straight down at a bajillion miles per hour. Somehoe managed to survive.\n\nDay 8: Decided i would fly to site B to set up a base of operations to get more resources. Forgot about the shenanigans the day before and fell through the world for what seemed like a few years and then got kicked out of the universe. When i found a way back in, i was suprised to find mysefl in site B with no health and no space ship. Jumped off the same cliff the previous two survivors jumped off of and decided to never return.\n\nThe game is so buggy it is bascially as you would expect an alpha release with about a year of development. You cant progress in single player past what amounts to basically a demo and multiplayer is so jank you might as well go outside with whoever you were going to play with, hold hands and repeatedly run as fast as you can into a brick wall. It will be more fun. \n\nIf you enjoy a buggy mess of a game that is basically a running, mining, restarting over and over after 10 hours due to game breaking bugs and enjoy stupid little monsters that server no purpose constantly spawning and pestering you as you try to do said activities...
