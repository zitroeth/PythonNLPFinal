The loot does not appear to increase alongside the number of players, so you and your friend will be fighting over the already low amount of items you have to take care of yourself. \n\nWith that out of the way, the majority of my hours are single player so I will review in that regard as the only multiplayer specific problem is what i shared above.\n\nSubsistence is a survival game that truly feels like one to me. Don't get me wrong I LOVE the forest and other survival titles that have risen to popularity over recent years - but usually the survival aspect is secondary and not usually challenging unless you play on the hardest difficulty. \nThat being said what you do in this game is exactly as the title says. You subsist. Some other reviewers have a large problem with this, but I think it is what makes this game unique compared to other survival games. You will not be fully kitted within a day of playing. You may not even have a finished base with all walls and ceilings after a day of playing. You are not OP in this game. Many gamers like to just be god, and if that's your thing this game is not for you.\n\nPros:\n- PVE Combat is a really unique aspect of this game introducing \"hunters\" that move into your world and try to destroy your base and you can raid their base for more loot. I've always wanted a game like rust that is strictly PVE, so theres no need to worry about cheaters or someone offline raiding your base etc.\n- There are a lot of unique energy management systems in this game which makes the player decide how they will manage the power of their base. Will you keep the fridge running? Or will you install lights in your base so its not so dark? ETC\n- In order to receive good loot you need to work for it. This is not the type of game where you can get lucky and find god items in a crate off of the spawn.\n- The game wants to encourage exploration by only allowing certain resources to be gathered from certain places. This means you will have to leave your base consistently if you want to progress.\n- You easily get your 14$ worth if you are a fan of survival games and you follow the 1$ / an hour of gameplay rule.\n- Every fight you get into is somewhat challenging (even with the animals, some can outrun you)\n- The building is fun, there are a lot of ways to make your base look nice geometrically so you dont live in a cube. (You can if youd like, though)\n\nThings that could be PROS or CONS depending on perspective:\n- This game is made by a solo developer I believe, which given that - the game is still being updated after all these years and clearly is a passion project from the dev. Hats off. This might not be for you however if you want consistent and steady updates.\n- This game is very grind heavy. Your resources get swallowed up fast if you are not consistently going out and getting more. To many this makes the game have \"fake gameplay\" where you are given busy work disguised as gameplay. If you want to chop down 3 trees and have enough wood for the rest of your world this is not the game for you. You are subsisting, and constantly trying to stay afloat. I have this listed under pros and cons because once you get into a rhythm this gets a lot better than when you are first starting off in a world.\n- Progression is slow. This follows the above statement in that you will always have something to work towards because you need to save up resources over the course of many days to craft the one machine you wanted to make.\n- The Looting system. There are randomized crate spawn locations all around the map that come in the form of food crates, ammo crates, medical crates, construction crates, and locked crates (with goodies inside). This is the only way to get certain materials reliably. You either love this or you hate it.\n- The animal spawns are insane, you are constantly running into wolves and bears and you better hope you came prepared if they start chasing you and you have no stamina. \n\nCONS:\n- Gun play is extremely clunky. Never try to hit a moving target, your bullet will not land 95% of the time.\n- The Winter season is incredibly devoid of content to make it fun. I constantly switch my season back to spring when winter rolls around just so I have something to do. (You can easily do this from the main menu when selecting your world)\n- Many of the machines you make have very few purposes (very specialized, they do 1 thing and 1 thing well).\n- Multiplayer resources are not doubled, you and your friends will be suiciding to increase hunger meter / stamina etc.\n\nAnd down to some minor complaints\n- Blood does not wash off your hands when it rains, but if you go swimming it will.\n- It took me a while to realize that when you die you lose a little bit of everything you have in your inventory, the game does not tell you this in an obvious way (That I know of)\n- Would be nice to have more options when it comes to upgrading your base to metal, as both the wood AND the metal textures feel very rough. Would be cool if there were a decor update or something of the sort, just to spruce things up a bit.\n- Beds cost power to respawn you at your base. I believe this is to prevent your base from being a safe haven, but why not just put a respawn delay on it? (You can only spawn at the bed every 15 IRL minutes).\n- Its nearly impossible to get out of the water after swimming/diving.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI think this game is worth exactly what the developer charges. Its 14$, which is what many people would spend at a restaurant or the movies. It is easily 14h worth of entertainment if you enjoy survival games. It is goofy, and it is a little clunky at times, but for a single developer this is some really good work. You eventually learn how to play along with the quirks as you would any other game (see: source engine movement tech, etc). Maybe the real subsisting was the friends we made along the way.", "timestamp_created": 1711405733, "timestamp_updated": 1711407207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159421875": {"recommendationid": "159421875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113382276", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 71, "playtime_at_review": 9051, "last_played": 1713794205}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the hardest survival games I've played.

I enjoy challenging games, but not hopeless, luck requiring games.  On Easy mode, on a dedicated server, after 5 hours of game play, I can't leave the cave I found to build a base in. At night, I'm told I am 'too cold' if I venture out, and when I do, my character lasts about 30 to 45 seconds.  In the winter, I can barelly survive in shelter.  After struggling with my gaming partner, we have 4 foundation pieces, 1 wall, 1 base controller and 2 boxes.  The animal population is unrealistic.  Most of the predators in game are territorial with territories of 10's of square miles, and will defend their territory, not allowing other predators to exist there. The cougars and wolves especially are too densely populous.\n\nThe opportunities for food scavenging seem to be non-existant.  To build a fire you need not only fuel, but a fire-starting kit that has a single use. If you are lucky enough to find a storage box, you will usually lose whatever you've found because you drop everything on death and are spawned in a long distance from your death location. Harvesting is a huge grind.  Three logs from an entire pine tree is the average. Three to five fibers from a clump and two to three medicinal herbs per cluster is also average, and the plants to obtain these are few and far between.\n\nThere's no way to tweak settings other than the difficulty mode, year length and enemy proliferation. \n\nI play other survival games, many of them challenging (older versions of 7 Days to Die, Conan Exiles, The Forest) and have not been so discouraged that I wanted to stop playing them.

What I like about the game is that it is hard and you have to work hard to improve your existence in the game world. It is not a kids game where everything is handed to you and you level up max in no time. The graphics is good. The building your base aspect is fantastic. I love it when you can move things very easily. Most games fail in that respect. Another feature I really like is the ability to turn the Hunters off or set them to attack only for revenge. When I first started, I disabled the Hunters because the bears and wolves were enough to handle for a newbie. You can then later re-enable the Hunters and they start from scratch. I use to get killed by the animals all the time when I first started until I started following this simple rule: Stop-Look-Listen and limit your running. You can out run the bears and wolves if you have the stamina. Also, they give you a warning by growling if you get close. You won't see them running up the top of a hill or around a rock. Your visibility is limited in some areas and you must use caution moving around in those areas. Sorry, starting to write a tutorial instead of recommended comments. I guess I am doing that because of some of the negative comments I read. If the people had played a little longer I feel they would have fallen in love with this game.

My review tries to be objective despite that, but I also feel the need to mention it.[/i]\n\nThis is the single player crafting / survival game you've been wanting. Rough and incomplete, but playable and fun.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] 7\nThere's a strange imbalance (so far) with the visual fidelity of this game. The bases and related assets all look great. Very detailed and blends great with the interior lighting. The environment is solid, but basic and dated looking, as with the animals. However, there have been great improves via updates over the last year, and I know the developer is constantly looking to improve it as much as he can.\n\n[b]Sound:[/b] 6\nBasic, but doable. Unfortunately, when you're developing a game, you have to prioritize what you work on first, and sound is usually more of a placeholder until the other things like graphics, performance, and balance is worked out. I will say there are a number of sound effects that are really unique to this game specifically and adds to the atmosphere. I think once music is added, it will really push the sound into a 7 or 8 at that point.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] 8\nThe game is pretty tedious at first, but once you actually establish a base and start adding to it, the game picks up and becomes really fun. I think item collection and crafting needs to be sped up, though. It's still too slow for being a single player game.\n\n[b]Performance:[/b] 7\nSolid performance, but drops on most systems if everything is maxed out. Optimization is not usually a priority for an early access game, so that's forgivable at this point.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nIf you're coming from a fully fleshed out survival / crafting / PVP game like Rust, you're going to have a bad time. Rust has been an ongoing project for almost a decade. It has a team of developers behind it, it makes a substantial amount of money (almost never falling off the top 10 most popular games), and has thousands of volunteers and contributors.\n\nOne guy makes this game. That's it. One. Even by himself, he pumps out updates on a regular basis. He listens to feedback and implements suggestions to see if they work. Although it does have co-op, it primarily focuses around single player survival and crafting, which is almost unheard of in this day and age. I've heard thousands of people beg the Rust developers for an offline mode with bots. They won't do it. That is what this guy is trying to achieve, and doing a fantastic job considering his extremely limited resources.\n\nI have over a thousand hours in Rust, yet this game draws me in and keeps me playing. I always look forward to the next update, because I have yet to be disappointed. I'll admit the game isn't for everyone, but stop calling this game trash when you all drop $60 on AAA games that nickel and dime you to death for content that was supposed to be included for the base price, then dumping the game after 3 months and buying another $60 con-job title. If you want actual good games, made by actual passionate developers who listen to their players, then support them.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\nIf you want multiplayer crafting / survival / PvP, play Rust. If you want a true single player version, buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1563216162, "timestamp_updated": 1572492760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 98, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90513455867767334", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32589093": {"recommendationid": "32589093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214500735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 836, "last_played": 1615518174}, "language": "english", "review": "I must say, this game frustrates the hell out of me! which is a good and bad thing. the graphics are nice, and the gameplay is smooth, and it is extremely challenging.\n\nPros: \n\nFor being where it is in development it is actually a great game! There is huge potential here and could be the top notch survival game out there. \n\nThe base building aspect is really nice and easy to use, yet complicated to the point it is difficult remembering exactly what components are needed when out in the wild. There are a lot of custom options available that really allow you to make base building an art. Absolutely love having to work with electrical systems.\n\nThe wilderness survival portion really puts an emphasis on body temp, and nutrition. Also being stealthy and knowing when to run away is a definite plus when out gathering.\n\nCons:\n\nI must admit, the combat system drives me insane. To start with, the pistol can't even kill small game in under 2 shots. Good luck using it against anything else... Wolves and bears will eat your face if you are not in your base, it does not matter if you are on a cliff or anything, they will get you. Wolves will run away if you step on your base, however bears will tear it up in a few hits and eat your face. God forbid if they kill you once, because when you come back (if you manage to get back in a reasonable time (see below)) they level up and get stronger, all while camping your corpse or base... \n\nLets continue with the combat system, and lets talk about the AI Hunters... If they spot you, and they are too far of a distance to use a bow, they will dead eye you with a pistal. I mean seriously 5 shots if you are not near cover... God forbid if they are using a rifle... now if you do manage to get close, they will blast away with a bow or even closer a shotgun. They do not seem to run out of ammo ever. A few days in, they get explosives, they you might as well say goodbye to your base... they will sit there all night long thowing explosives (however you can't survive a night outside without fire). The hunters have 1 other advantage, their melee hit box is so small, you can bury your axe in there face, and it will miss.\n\nOkay, so you got dead... now if it is daylight, and have your base setup (has a beacon) you have to wait 100 seconds before you have any idea where your base is. Hopefully you died at your base, you might have a chance to get your stuff back. So now after 100 seconds, your beacon lights up and you realize you were going totally the wrong way the whole time (since navigation without that beacon is zilch unless you completely memorized the repeated rock and tree formations somehow you darn genius) now you have less than 3 minutes and 40 seconds to get back to your base and locate your box of stuff that dropeed when you died. Sweet so lets run all the way back, and avoid every wolf, bear, and hunter because you have literally nothing but an axe to defend yourself with (which is equivelent to sword fighting with a bananna), and no armor or clothing... but hey, you made it back with a minute to spare, oh crap, that thing that killed you is now level 4 and still standing there... welp your screwed, all you can do is piss it off and run away to make it follow you away (which half the time it returns). Now you finally cleared the way, and what!? your precious box containing all your items is gone... Well sucks to be us, now we have to go and spend another hour gathering crap to replace the crap we lost...\n\nNow for the poor and unfortuneate ones that die at night... you are screwed until daylight. you do not have the time to return home or get your stuff because you will freeze to death before any of that will happen. (unless you spawn on a bed in your home then you are lucky). it takes 5 deaths to get through a night, sometimes 4 (depending on how early/late you die) \n\nLets talk about some of the cons on crafting. Now why would it take fiber or rope to make a gun? got me, but it does. Some of the items required to make specific items are a little wonky... But hey imagination is fun! I believe some items are simply place holders for items not in the game yet (I hope for realism sake).\n\nThe mass amount of foraging chests and boxes makes you wonder, who the frick dropped all these boxes here and there? and why do I feel like I became part of the hunger games? You will spend the majority of your time looking for these boxes and avoiding the bear or wolf or both patrolling them. Once again, god forbid if you die while doing this, you better have a damn good memory, because the liklihood of finding your things is slim...\n\nBase defense, now keep in mind I do have limited play so far, but I havn't seen much for base defense other than upgrades. Now with hunters throwing explosives and constantly attacking, there should be some form of help.\n\n\nFinally, I sum this up. This game is early access, and it is apparently very early, but far better than a few other survival games I have played. I highly reccomend this game if development continues (and some form of marker is made where you last died, or a freaking map...) This game will definitely piss you off, and yet it is still fun.

On the other hand, promoting a hard core survival game without the basics of actually surviving kinda takes the shine off of it. If I may make a couple of suggestions to what i am sure is going to be a really nice rounded survival game. Oh, I come from Australia, so I may know a thing or too about surviving.\n\n1. Basic survival techniques - if you have no matches you can't start a fire, hypothermia, you're dead. Add flint and even rubbing sticks together can create fire. you already have fibers in the game use them to build camp fires.\n\n2. Not even a spear in which to hunt with or make traps with. Basic survival is actually spears and traps. you need to add these.\n\n3. Seriously your chicken requires 4x9mm shots to kill it. You need to fix that. 5 shots to kill a wolf? I have died regualry trying out different approaches to save ammo on wolves. A head shot with a 9mm projectile at point blank range on the skull of a wolf is about 95% chance of death or serious, serious injury. You need to review the damage output or change def stats on your critters, how ever your 'combat' system works.\n\n4. You can build a shotgun or any fire arm from cloth, cortage, wood and scarp iron but you can't build a spear or a bow out of fibres and wood/scrap steel? i may suggest either finding those itmes or finding those gun parts and then piecing them together, or alllow a machinery type setup in your com build and manufacture components.\n\n5. Foraging. Really? Having to rely on food crates so that you can survive while waiting for plants to grow and dodging your animals in the game (Bear & Wolf). Might I suggest adding water firstly, fish, birds, smaller animals you can actually trap (Thos chickens must do 90 Mph). Skin, leather,meat,bone know your talking.\n\n6. Your spawn rate of animals (Bears & wolves) is excessive. if you want to make your game Hardcore survival then at least make it realistic. There is no way 3 wolves and a grizzly plus a black bear would all walk within 5 feet of each other without attacking each other. Change your aggro from neutral to all. More realistic and allows you to have the chance of getting a free feed,skins etc.\n\n7. Hunters, I'm not finding anything to wrong except in my games the animals don't attack them. Change aggro to all not neutral, again more realistic.\n\n8. Needle and water create compass. you make high tech power storage, lights, craft fire arms from basically a stick and some scrap iron but you can't make a map or a compass? You need to add those. It's not being soft at all, it's a basic survival technique.\n\n9. Animals can not climb sheer vertical faces in order to chew your arse off. You should make it the same for everyone full block or however your collision or climb code works on objects. Still happens numerous times.\n\n10. all mobs level excepty yourself. As soon as you start having mobslvl and you remain the same unbalances the game. If you're going to use the excuse of experience age etc then your toon should also level up. Trying to kil a lvl 14 wolf with a hatchet is plain crazzzeeee, see up top for comments on spears etc.\n\n11. Not installing your BCU makes the game actually much easier and allows yoou to build your base,clothes, shot guns and more importantly ammo.\n\n12. the object of thegame from past couple of re-starts is not actually to survive but to die as often as possible. Scrap your pants there's cloth for ya, take note of your base, die, get spawned where boxes are loot until malnourished, Die, wash rinse repeat. no it's not cheating, it's using what the game has been developed for. if that's too hard or viewed by some as a @hack@, when you die you die permantenly restart with nothing if you want a true survival game.\n\n13. No way tomatoes use that much fertiliser to grow. Seriously. \n\n14. Try killing a wolf with a hatchet and see how many times you die. If you can't kill anything with the basics and you need to make guns then the point of survival is missed. See previous points about spears, traps etc.\n\nOther then that, I'm on about death 250 and still having the patience to keep on trying different things. I like it and for $15 bucks is definitely one of the best things I have bought, well there was this one time... but that's another story.\n\nAwesome job, please don't take offense, just some ideas that I thought you should implement into your game.\n\nCheers 07", "timestamp_created": 1478768011, "timestamp_updated": 1478768011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 211, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.88945770263671875", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81507581": {"recommendationid": "81507581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035345202", "num_games_owned": 1424, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 5650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5641, "last_played": 1607292249}, "language": "english", "review": "I've decided to review Subsistence after playing it this evening, for the first time in many months. The game was recently updated, and the update thankfully helped out a bunch of issues with general performance, multiplayer lag, and AI behavior.  Combat is mostly enjoyable now. But the game is far from perfect.\n\nThings I Really Like:\n+ The base building - The boys and I constructed some cool bases. And also copied the larger of the AI bases, with some slight modifications.\n+ Early game survival - Those first few days running around without any gear, just trying to avoid being eaten by a mountain line or ganked by some AI hunters.\n+ The crafting - You can build a lot of different stuff in this game. It's great to be able to have options, especially when constructing your base.\n+ Fishing - It's more enjoyable than hunting, on account of not having to deal with the hit boxes. It operates like a mini game.\n\nThings I Really Hate:\nThe game play lives up to its title. You don't really flourish in this game. You barely subsist. This philosophy is baked into the game.\n\n- You can expend a bunch of ammunition, equipment, bandages, time, and even several lives, to take out an enemy AI hunter base. You may even have gone all out to use a BCU cracker to completely destroy their base -- which takes a bunch of resources to build. And your reward is you don't get attacked from AI from that direction for some time, and you get like six pistol rounds, three feathers, some ashes from their fires, and maybe some zinc ore. The return on investment from combat sucks.\n- It's frustrating that you can kill a hunter decked out with equipment, bulletproof vest, a helmet, and a rifle... but the only loot you get off the body (or rather, from their backpack) is a shotgun shell, two feathers, and a piece of cordage. You lose money engaging in combat.\n- You consume a ridiculous amount of food. You can eat like 3-4 steaks a day, a bunch of protein bars, and several canteens worth of water. Then you look at your health and you're starving. So you shoot a bear, and you get 2 steaks and a liver out of it. So the liver is used for a basic antidote, to cure the poison status that you have from the last time you died. And the steaks carry you like 10 minutes into future. So again, you put in a lot of effort to fight or hunt, and acquire more material. But you barely pay for your investment.\n- The player models still need some work. The guy still looks like Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The girl still looks derpy. Also, there are only two player models. So if you play with more than one friend, it can be confusing who you're looking at.  It can be frustrating in the heat of the moment.\n\nSummary:\nThe game is fun. But it becomes a chore very quickly. I'd like to have more reward for my efforts, be it hunting, harvesting, or combat. Until then, I just can't play it much. There are just so many other games that I enjoy more. Because they don't make me grind. Or when I do, I'm actually rewarded, I'm at a net gain for my efforts.\n\nRating:\nD+", "timestamp_created": 1606975997, "timestamp_updated": 1607291648, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 149, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889096558094024658", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108142255": {"recommendationid": "108142255", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977080306", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 73772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 33751, "last_played": 1713731889}, "language": "english", "review": "Typically, I stay away from early-access titles, especially recommending them, as they generally become stagnant or dead by developers who have no incentive to finish their product because they've already gotten our money. However, I am willing to make an exception for this game. Before I get into my reasoning for this, let me tell you my likes, dislikes, concerns, and recommendations for this game.\n\nLikes:\nEnvironment- There is currently only one map to play on at the moment, but it is large enough that I don't feel caged in (even though you literally are). The changing seasons is something unique that a lot of games don't bother to add and it\u2019s not just a passive scenery change. The seasons and weather are an actual factor against your survival. Hot summer days fatigue and dehydrate you, where taking a dip in the lake to cool off is a must. Brutal winter blizzards that produce white-out conditions and drop the temperature to deathly lows. Even altitude plays a factor, where the higher you travel up the mountain, the colder it gets. Another factor that I like (though some may not) is that the environment is indestructible, so trees, rocks, the ground, etc. are all permanent. This prevents the map being deforested or obnoxious mining pits and other \u201choles\u201d in the map that inevitably take place on other crafting games. This keeps the amazing views and scenery fresh and untouched for all to enjoy.\n\nBase Construction- Keeping in mind that the environment is indestructible, it is impossible to smooth out a patch of terrain to start laying down a foundation. This is not a problem, as the game allows you to clip all building pieces into the surrounding barriers, so that you can truly build anywhere, even to a fault. You can build floating bases over water, or even in the sky (although ColdGames is currently working on structural integrity to eliminate the unrealistic building potential). Once you have the main foundation pieces down, they become the parent pieces, which everything else snaps to. On the inside of your base, adding storage chests, work benches, and any other utilities can be freely moved around without snaps, and even clipped through other items in some circumstances. There are enough pieces present to make some truly varying and unique builds, if you have the dedication to grinding for the materials.\n\nSurvival- Surviving in this game truly feels like an accomplishment. You can even passively compare your \u201csurvival\u201d stats with anyone else on the server who is online. Things like how many times you have died, how many animals you have killed, all the way down to how many logs you have harvest, are all stats that you and other players can see about each other. With all of the things the environment throws at you, along with how scarce everything is, you really do feel rewarded for surviving several in-game weeks or months (or even years if you\u2019re good) without dying. If you choose the male avatar, he even starts growing a beard the longer you live.\n\nDislikes:\nAI- The AI in this game definitely leaves something to be desired, specifically the hunters, rogues, and miners (all human AI). The animals are acceptable, but not great. Depending on the difficulty, the human AI are either painfully inept, or frustratingly god-like, and sometimes both at the same time. They have infinite ammo with near perfect accuracy, while you are forced to suffer through maintaining just enough ammo to hunt for a day or two. Worse, when you kill them, they MAYBE drop a bullet or two, but generally nothing useful to make them worth killing other than defending yourself.\n\nGunplay- I\u2019m going to be brutally honest, the gunplay in this game is bad. There is no way around it. The game is built with a hitbox system that is terrible in its\u2019 current state, bullets that travel like airsoft BBs, and damage stats that are more on the level of counter-strike, requiring multiple headshots to kill hunters and animals alike, depending on the weapon you\u2019re using. This game would really be a step up with a more tactical-hardcore approach to the gunplay.\n\nLooting/Crafting essentials- As many others have stated, regardless of how many hours you invest in building a fortress and getting all of the \u201cadvanced\u201d goodies for your base, the grind is still the same at any stage of the game. You will always be starving for cartridge cases, unless you just stick with the bow. If you just stick with the bow, you will always be starving for nails. There are ways to make these things for yourself, instead of looting them, but the material cost vs output is a total rip-off, which will leave you starving for other resources.\n\nConcerns:\nOne of my biggest concerns is the lack of theme or cohesion with all of the in-game assets. Because there is only one person working on this game, I can understand and appreciate the use of the Unreal asset store, but at least pick assets that fit the same theme. The main rifle in the game is an SVT-40, a pretty rare WWII Russian battle rifle. The main handgun is an M9 Beretta, a fairly common \u201cmodern\u201d 9mm pistol. The base tech is just plain weird, with antique stoves and refrigerators, but futuristic/sci-fi power and mass storage and drills and refineries. The distillery looks like some kind of steampunk concoction of 1800\u2019s tech mixed with 2077 tech.\n\nNot all vegetation yields seeds, or lets you extract seeds, making at least 50% or more of the plants in the game artificially scarce. The math doesn\u2019t add up with certain craftables, requiring too much input for too little output. The cost to repair things is almost not worth it with the majority of base pieces and weapons, barely being better than just making new parts. Upgrades to base items is worth it, but very grindy. Weapons upgrades force you to use more and more valuable and scarce materials to keep it repaired. The decay rate of tools and weapons seems too high, especially on upgraded weapons.\n\nRecommendations:\nThis game could benefit from some what I think are very minor fixes/tweaks. Firstly, the gunplay needs to be more realistic and hardcore. The survival in this game is hardcore, so the use of firearms should match that difficulty. Add multiple recipes for the same item, so that you aren\u2019t bottlenecked by the ultra-rare materials. Let the player make stone-tipped arrows instead of wasting nails, when in the early game, nails are the biggest bottleneck. Make the material requirements for all items more plausible and realistic. I don\u2019t know why I need pearls for circuit boards. I don\u2019t know why I need sinew to craft high-tech base items. I don\u2019t know why I need cloth to build a gun. Make the foundation legs terminate against any surface they clip with, so that they don\u2019t float in space on the level below them. Pick a coherent theme and replace all of the assets with something that fits the theme.\n\nI know this is a long review, but this is a game I am truly passionate about. As I stated at the beginning, I don\u2019t usually partake in early-access titles, because they usually die with an incomplete product and a dev walking away with their pockets full. However, I truly believe that this dev cares about his game. His updates are infrequent, but meaningful. His efforts to make this a truly stand-out survival game are apparent. The game is solid enough to be played and acceptable as is. Notice I\u2019m saying \u201chis\u201d a lot? Yea, there is literally only one guy responsible for all of this. For that, I commend his efforts and his responsiveness to the community and truly believe that what he is making is a great game. For that, I recommend this title to anyone who is willing to grind through the learning curve and who enjoys survival/crafting games.", "timestamp_created": 1642345845, "timestamp_updated": 1642804798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889050781726837158", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84664446": {"recommendationid": "84664446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055959480", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 10980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3405, "last_played": 1612949174}, "language": "english", "review": "I've long considered how and what I would like to say about Subsistence as a game/experience; this is my experience leading up to 60h playtime:\nWhen a friend initially asked me whether I would play this, I looked at it and after coming off Green Hell, this looked like another The Forest clone. \nI could not get into The Forest after playing Green Hell as there were two different standards in how immersive the environment was... so... I tentatively bought Subsistence and tried it out solo and found it \"lived down to expectations\".  Resources were surprisingly scarce, and the world lacked... that \"oomph\". \n\nThen I got into it while playing coop. Addictively so. \n\nWhat definition has (truthfully) been thrown at this game, is the word \"grindy\". Yes, it's grindy AF, but like with everything, context matters. To explain this, the best equivalent I could find in relation to gameplay loop, is Don't Starve/Dont Starve Together. \nYou gather by day, \"forced\" stick next to a fire at night, (so that becomes crafting time) and plan ahead so that you systematically prepare yourself for when winter hits (or rather kicks... kicks you in the balls).  This is where the \"grind\" comes in. Are you going to use your severely limited ammo to gun down a cougar for the resources needed, or are you going to keep those precious bullets for self-defense for when the NPC hunters attack you or your base? Are you even well-enough prepared to take down that cougar? If you fail, how stuffed are you? How do you deal with the concequences?\n\nThe game becomes a finely tuned balance of risk and reward. (Except for cotton. Cotton needs improvement.)\n\nNow, the gameworld: The environment seems bland-ish at first glance, but as the seasons change certain details become apparent. I will not go into what they are for risk of spoiling it, but, man, when you become aware of them, your appreciation for this game -developed by a single human being- becomes solidified. \nOne of the most prominent aspects, is sound design, where this game really excels. Coldgames really nailed that one down well. \nOnce again, Ill not spoil that one by explaining why I feel that way. \nIf you are keen on trying Subsistence, then I will let you experience that for yourself. \n\nFinal thoughts: Yes, I would recommend Subsistence. For the selling price, it is a fair deal as long as you know what you are getting into and willing to engage with it. It is a (potentially) very frustrating but ultimately satisfying experience. Definitely go at it coop, and (in-game) don't run if you don't need to, but walk, as you will be burning through food like an athlete if you do and you will straight-up run past loads of valuable resources.", "timestamp_created": 1610622541, "timestamp_updated": 1610622783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.886981546878814697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73908359": {"recommendationid": "73908359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042266140", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 12210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4359, "last_played": 1599067815}, "language": "english", "review": "BEGINNER GUIDE WITH TIPS & TRICKS ADDED TO BOTTOM OF REVIEW.\n(As some people seem to be frustrated by the lack of an in-game tutorial)\n\nCracking game by one dev...\n\nSomehow manages to be hardcore and relaxing at the same time. \nI'll be honest, I wasn't a fan for the first 5-10 hours or so, as progression can be extremely slow. Ultimately though, you find it's more about the journey than the destination.\nIf you are going to buy this game then I suggest playing on easy for as long as possible! This is a very hard game, but very rewarding!\n\nThe Game is gorgeous in 4k, and the ambience is perfect also. Combat can be very difficult to master, but you'll get there in the end. There's no crosshair, so it takes skill (something missing from most games nowadays). There is a grind, but it's an extremely addictive one for some reason. It's both tense and therapeutic.\n\nCold Games (A single developer) has created an amazing survival game, one of my favourites. It is a passion project, which means we can look forward to updates for a very long time.\nThe updates are consistent too (Every 2-3 months I believe).\n\nA few suggestions I have, that I would like to see in the future:\n- Hypothermia (Shouldn't be able to swim around lakes in the winter)\n- Flippers for diving / swimming faster\n- The ability to go prone with X key, and maybe a lean left / right Q+E\n- Food should keep you full for longer the bigger the meal (like an entire chicken roast and i'm \n  hungry again an hour or so later!)\n- Weapons slightly more durable (especially the higher tier weapons as materials are pricey)\n- Longer nights longer option (To have the time to work on gardening etc)\n- Timer switch and motion sensors for the floodlights\n- Hand-held flashlight\n- Chopping down trees. They can respawn each day. (Come on... It's 2020)\n- Strawberry water\n- More Hunter AI behaviour (Maybe factions? Hunters raiding other hunters)\n- Rocky biomes with rapids\n- More recipes\n- More random animal AI behaviour\n\nI'm sure everything else I want will already be planned, bigger map and more animals etc.\nA cracking game with infinite replayability. \n\nHighly recommended for survival fans. A true hardcore survival game.\nKeep up the good work Cold Games!\n\n-------------------\n\nTIPS & TRICKS:\nIt is a very hard game to master, but don't give up after only a few hours, as you WILL progress and you WILL enjoy the game as it does get \"easier\"\n\n- Start on EASY, set the month to MAY and the year cycle to 365. (Can change anytime)\n\n- Stay away from animals other than chickens and rabbits for the time being.\n\n- Shift left clicking moves whole stacks to and from fires, storage, inventory etc\n\n- Shift right click is single items.\n\n- Press \"F\" when in inventory menu or any other menu to use items (food/water/splints/etc)\n\n- Grab every crate you can find and get chopping wood (Its boring at first but you need plenty at the beginning.\n\n- Craft while you are running around (wood-planks & wood to sticks & fibre-cordage)\n\n- Craft a bow and keep a good amount of arrows handy as you'll need them for rabbits & chickens.\n\n- Always aim lower with guns (Aim for the chin will usually get a headshot)\n\n- Hunt rabbits and chickens each day (4-6 preferably) It's not ideal, but will do until your ready for wolves. Chickens can be caught without arrows, just chase and jump at them intil they run out of stamina. just watch where they are heading! 6 will give you a couple of meat for next day while your hunting. Just make sure to cook as late as possible so your meat stays fresh as long as possible for next day.\n\n- Any ponds/lakes - dive for kelp to keep vegetables up until you start planting seeds (which can be found around the map). DON'T FORGET PEARLS WHILE YOU'RE DOWN THERE! You will need them like crazy later on.\n\n- Big trees give you 6 wood and a grub (which can be used for fishing)\n\n- Find a nice flat area (I recommend the green pasture inbetween both lakes on the map) as it is MUCH easier to spot crates, and there is a pond there for your kelp and pearls.\n\n- Craft a fire and make cheap fire starter kits from BIOFUEL & sticks. Again, as many as possible, as the cheap fire goes out quick.\n\n- Craft a wood foundation and a wall, stick the fire on the foundation (don't worry it won't burn your house down.\n\n- Craft a storage crate and stick it near the wall and start hoarding loot!\n\n- Retracing your steps is fine, as loot spawns in randomly (so an empty run one way can be full of loot on the way back)\n\n- Rinse and repeat previous steps: collecting as many crates as possible and storing as much as you can (Don't forget to hunt 4-6 per day)\n\n- BCU: Once placed, Hunters and Rogues will spawn within a few days. (So try not to place it until you have plenty of stock and a roof over your head). The BCU gives you the wood-burner which lasts much longer than campfires, so up to you as you need more firestarters for campfires going out.\n\n- Hunters: There are 3 bases of them on easy and medium (alpha,bravo,charlie) small-large.\nThey will leave you alone as long as you stay away from them. They go fishing, hunting animals and chopping trees, so be aware if you hear anything. (make sure settings are revenge attack only! or off for now as you need to learn the basic mechanics.)\n\n- Rogues: travel around the map and make campfires. Again, they will leave you alone unless you get in their way, so try to avoid them completely. (They drop gears, wood, fish and medicinal tonics)\n\n- Animals: All can be outrun (provided you have enough stamina). They give up pretty easily, usually. They have two aggro prompts (low growl then a louder one). First one, if you stop and moe back slowly without running, they will leave you alone most of the time. Second one, they are moving in your direction, and when close enough will start to charge. Don't worry as they give up after a while.\n\n- If you get bitten there is a chance of infection, lowering your stats significantly! You can cure with an antidote made from oil from fish crafted into medicinal tonics and kelp.\n\n- You can take a shot at wolves and other animals and run. They will chase you, but eventually slow down and give up. Turn around and hit them again. Rinse & repeat.\n\n- BCU recharges 500 energy and 100 mass for free each day, so save your biofuel early on.\n\n- BCU FIRST ITEMS TO GET: woodburner-generator-refinery-lockpicks-workbench.\n- Woodburner can cook 3 items at once and melt down fat into biofuel for generator. Lasts much longer than campfire.\n\n- Refinery: smelt down as much as you can\n\n- Lockpicks: useful! they cost 18 iron fragments (from smelting ore in refinery) 4 metal scrap and 2 wood planks. Quite expensive! But when you find a locked crate, many times you'll find some high end materials that can help you out early on.\n\n- Workbench allows you to upgrade your weapons to do much more damage amongst many other great tools.\n\n- Plant beds: Get one and plant as many cotton seeds as you find, constantly! and other vegetables to help with your overall wellness. \n\n- Power & Mass storage: Your base generates 500 power and 100 mass for free each day, but for many of the other recipes you will need more. Craft one here and there and store in a safe place to avoid damage from revenge attacks from hunters.\n\n- Solar panels & Wind turbines: EXPENSIVE! but just make one here and there when you can, as they slowly (VERY SLOWLY) start to increase your power input the more you have. Eventually you can run fridges, mining drills, grow lights etc without losing power if you have enough.

You hunt down a wolf, chop some wood for a fireplace, and spend the rest of the day looking for a good place to start a camp. You spend the first night crouching by the fire and hoping that no animals will come close.\n\nThe forest has plenty of wood, so every evening you return with a bit of a surplus. You build a small shelter, then a larger house. What used to be a fireplace to spend the night becomes a home, the center of your forest, where you often return for safety and warmth.\n\nOne day you venture to the forest as usual, looking for resources, sneaking among bears and wolves, when you heart skips a beat as you see the most dangerous animal of them all - a human. You make a step back, but it's too late. He spots you. You turn around and run all the way back home, bullets whizzing around you. Never mind the wolves, they can't catch you with this much adrenaline.\n\nYou made it, this time. But he's still out there. And the forest will never be the same.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Just the right difficulty. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, it can really take the whole day to gather resources so that you have enough food and can make fire to survive the night. \n\n- It gets easier later as you get better weapons and expand your base, which is balanced by other hunters appearing and taking part of your hunting grounds.\n\n- Animals are really well done. You can't go Rambo and hope it works out as in every FPS. You have to plan, fully load your gun, approach them carefully. But it's not too hard to avoid them either - they start growling if you get too close.\n\n- When you die, you respawn at a random place in the forest while all of your inventory is lost - no gun, no bullets. However, your base stays as you left it. This is a nice middle ground where it's still very devastating to die (it takes time to make a new gun, get bullets, and be able to hunt and eat animals again), but not to a point of rage-quitting the game (you don't lose your base).", "timestamp_created": 1477788445, "timestamp_updated": 1477788445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.871783852577209473", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38550915": {"recommendationid": "38550915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126715104", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1149, "last_played": 1671162789}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't do this anymore.\n\nI really want to like this game but I have had enough.  I'm done forgiving.\n\nThe grind is INSANE.  It borders on ARKs, except you can't even rememdy it with a resource multiplier.  Trees give you miniscule amounts of wood, requiring you to spend 10, 20, 30 minutes grinding for just a few base pieces (that will break in about 5 hits from a bear.  Nice).  I'm begging you ColdGames, triple the wood income, ideally even more.  Having to spend literally hours in total hitting trees in order to make a decent base is the opposite of fun.  It's maybe the worst thing about this game on its own.\n\nAnimals give you a reasonable amount of meat at least.  Problem is, bullets are extremely expensive, and do practically nothing.  At least, that's the pistol's stats.  The shotgun is actually passable in damage, but the spread is so wide that it just spews valuable casings and gunpowder at nothing.  I'd tell you about the other two guns, but because of the extreme grind I've never gotten to try them.\n\nThe bow is the only weapon that has an OK damage return based on resources spent.  Problem is, unless you're cheesing the AI by jumping into your base, it's unusable on anything other than a chicken or rabbit.\n\nIf the point of the game is that ammo is really scarce, that's fine.  But you can't have high scarcity + low damage.  They don't mix, and just get you killed.\n\nAt least your hatchet can be used on enemies!  Barely.  The range on the hatchet is so pitiful that you have no choice but to hug the bear that you're trying to kill.  Half the time it doesn't even register pointblank hits, which leads to you getting killed by a wolf on 3 health while you are at full.\n\nEven if you land the hits--don't bother.  The damage is again, pitiful.\n\nBack onto the subject of grind, I think this game is listed in the dictionary definition of \"grind\".  Everything is very overpriced to craft.  And as I've stated before, you get very little from any source of supplies.  Even getting a simple foundation placed is a pain.  Ironically, the base command unit is one of the only items that I'd say are fairly priced.  The energy and mass system on your base is a cool idea (although it doesn't make any sense outside of running machinery), although they're less of a resource as they are progression blocking timers.  Reminds me of those facebook games.\n\nThe reason for me even writing this review and calling it quits is because of an infuriating addition to this game--cougars.  A really cool idea that winds up being the bane of your existence.  Not just because they are far more dangerous than any hunter could hope to be, but because that you MUST kill one in order to get sinew (or play the lottery of spending vast resources on lockpicks so you can cross your fingers for an elite crate and then hope there's sinew inside).\n\nThe sinew is require to get rope, which is used in many different recipies.  I honestly like this idea, it's just that because 3/4 of the time you spend playing this game is spent on grinding resources to get things that never feel worth it, it becomes another thing that you constantly groan about.  I spent about 2 hours getting enough resources to construct a shotgun with about 10 shells to supply it, so I could take on a cougar \"safely\".  I realized that I hadn't made any clothing yet, but the number of hours required to hunt creatures to get a single piece of cloth at a time made me loathe the idea of farming for any longer before killing a cougar.  \n\nBut fuck me, I guess.  This is what I get for wanting to do something other than mindless grinding.  Because of the previously mentioned spead, the shotgun dealt practically nothing the first 3 times I shot it, and the cougar 3-hit me in about 5 seconds.  I'm dead.  Come back to a barely alive cougar and try to kill it with my hatchet.  I'm dead again.\n\nCame to this game wanting to have cool battles with hunters, left with 20 hours spent hitting a tree.\n\n4/10", "timestamp_created": 1513978749, "timestamp_updated": 1513978749, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 264, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.868463218212127686", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32217953": {"recommendationid": "32217953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137103623", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 5155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1386, "last_played": 1704299859}, "language": "english", "review": "A survival game without zombies or mutants.

These problems are several fold.  First - large game does not drop near enough meat.  A bear or a boar drop a single item of meat, which cannot even feed you enough for a day.  Either of these should be enough to feed someone enough for at least a week, let alone a day.  I imagine this is to balance against the fact that there is an absolutely insane amount of wildlife in the game, which is the second problem.\n\nIt is impossible to go 50 feet without running into a bear or a wolf.  They aren't too hard to avoid, but there is a stupid amount of them and they are exceedingly annoying to have to deal with when hunting other things.  Most of the time, if you're hunting a deer, it will run into a wolf or a bear and then be killed by it, to despawn instantly (I imagine to simulate the predator having eaten the thing).  In addition, there are far more predators then there are prey animals, which is completely ridiculous - the predators would starve to death within a month with this disparity.\n\nLastly, a lot of the wildlife is far too tanky.  The bears are about right, but wolves, deer and boar don't have much less health than them, and all take upwards of 4-5 shots to kill.  A single well placed shot should be capable of felling any of these things.  This makes hunting almost a waste of resources - it is simpler to just make a bunch of fishing traps and put grubs in them so you aren't constantly losing nails, wood and other things.\n\nWhile this game is fun in concept, I cannot possibly recommend anyone play it until A. The amount of meat from killing large game goes drastically up.  B. The spawn rates for animals are drastically lowered and balanced towards more prey and less predators.  And C.

You gather resources from the world (largely from bags randomly spawning around, rather than the world itself), and you can craft the usual survival game stuff. You are threatened by predators which randomly roam around and by AI hunters that spawn after you progress past a certain point.\n\nPros:\n\n- Nice visuals and world: The first person perspective for survival games is nice (although not as novel as it was when this game first came out), and the world has decent variety.\n- Range of crafting: Lots of different stuff to craft and lots of buildings for crafting. More so than the average survival game. \n- Building system is simple but well designed: Not a great deal of variety in buildings to craft but everything fits together nicely.\n- Resource collection is addictive: This might be a pro for some and a con for others but the resource collection system feels good. You get hooked on collecting resources.\n\nCons:\n\n- Very grindy gameplay: The amout of resources neccessary to do build / craft / survive is much higher than for most of this style of game. Which means you need to expect to put in a lot of hours to get anything done. This is not a bad thing for everyone, but I suspect the majority will find it too much like work.\n- Unrewarding progression: The usual story with survival games is that you start of having to forage (aka grind) then as you advance you become more self sustaining. Often with this game the \"advanced solution\" is just as dependant on outside resources as the the normal solution, and as such there is no escape from the grind.\n- Uninteresting threats: The predators have very basic behaviour and are everywhere, esp. on higher difficulties where the predator density is far too much for immersion or fun. The AI hunter are even worse, with simplistic AI making them more a source of fustration / grind than interesting challange. In both the hunters and the predators the strategy seems to be to make up for the lack of interesting behaviour by having lots of them.\n- Arbitrary gamedesign: A number of things about the game feel rather arbitrary. For example - you collect the majority of your resources from bags constantly spawning randomly over the map, instead of creating it from basic resources as in most survival games. Likewise the recipes for some items arbitrarly shoehorn some bizzare resource (e.g. grenades need sinew, arrows need 2 nails). \n\nOverall the game is definitely aiming for a 'hardcore survival' type experience, however it tries to achive this in all the wrong ways. Instead of requiring careful strategy, high level of skill or concentration, it relies on forcing the player to repeatedly do relatively simple tasks (chop wood, collect bags etc) while throwing lots of simple enemies at them.", "timestamp_created": 1529544158, "timestamp_updated": 1540284356, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.84994816780090332", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71987777": {"recommendationid": "71987777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164616656", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1559, "last_played": 1617417466}, "language": "english", "review": "From my experience, this game is the true hardcore survival game. If you're looking for a challenge, but not hard enough where you rage quit every half an hour and still have fun, this game is for you.\n\nInitially, just like every other survival game, getting started is really, REALLY tough. But once you do, the game opens up into thriving, not surviving. You'll find that hunger and thirst are more in depth than \"if you eat this, then your hunger will increase.\" Sure, it appears it does that, but each and every food item has it's own attributes to your proteins, fruits and veggies, and water stats. The only things you really have to worry about consistently though are food, water, health and stamina. Stamina decreasing rates are determined by how well you're eating (e.g if you don't eat enough veggies or meat, stamina decreases faster), which I find really cool.\n\nAnother thing this game does perfectly is force you to actually worry about winter (that is, if you don't change the season back to summer every time you're on the main menu or have 365 days a year setting on lol), and let me tell you, winter isn't fun. Most big animals which will slowly become your primary food source virtually disappear and you have to rely on what food you've saved or the berries or small pieces of meat you'll find on chickens and rabbits, and you'll have to worry a lot about temperature. Going outside for long periods of time without proper clothing will kill you really, really fast. The grind begins as soon as you load up a new game and I love that sense of urgency, it's really realistic.\n\nThe sense of progression in this game is fantastic because once you move on from primal survival and place the BCU (base command unit), you can start using electricity and craft much more advanced items for yourself, and also, it places a marker on your BCU that you can see from anywhere so you never lose your base (there's no map in this game so getting lost is very common which I also like). However, you're not the only human that can see this marker. After you place the BCU the challenge becomes real because AI hunters with guns start spawning and building bases just like the player. They even collect resources and kill animals for food. If you run into them they'll shoot at you and chase you down, and if you hide in your base, they can attack your base and potentially break walls and everything else if you don't act fast. You can choose to turn off random attacks and make it so they only attack for revenge if you attack them, or just completely disable them. In my opinion the hunters add to the challenge and make hearing gunshots in singleplayer heart racing, just like every other survival game. I wouldn't say they're easy to kill either because after a while they start upgrading their armor just like the player should. They don't even seem like AI to me which I like a lot.\n\nOverall, this game is the perfect game to play solo or with friends because it'll really bring out your true survival instincts. I gotta say the graphics are fantastic but the sounds could use some work because they seem oldish to me but im sure they'll fix them soon. Overall this is one of my favorite survival games out there because of how challenging and realistic it is.

I must admit there were many frustrations in the first 4-8 hours trying to survive.

You develop your own skills from the simple skills of shooting the bow and perceptual skills needed to spot plants in the environment to what I call the five basic skills; a) situational awareness, b) risk management, c) time management, d) strategic planning, and my favorite d) operational security. You let any of these lapse, even for a moment, and you are simply dead. :) So refreshing an experience.", "timestamp_created": 1482128249, "timestamp_updated": 1506745180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835058927536010742", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138717712": {"recommendationid": "138717712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021615741", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6717, "last_played": 1684701020}, "language": "english", "review": "With 112 hours in the game, I've finally decided to just give up.  If you have enough livestock to keep your plants fertilized, then you don't produce enough veggies to feed your livestock.  If you reduce the number of animals (to keep them from starving to death) then you don't have enough fertilizer to grow the crops needed to keep even those animals alive.  (This is also using the ashes from 3 wood stoves in addition to the fertilizer produced by the animals, as well as the occasional potassium being used as fertilizer.)  3 crop plots won't produce enough food for 3 animals, yet 3 animals don't produce enough fertilizer for 4 crop plots.  It's completely out of balance.  I can't produce enough veggies for both me AND my animals.  I'd even given up eating, and just die instead of eating the veggies I needed.  If I ate tomatoes, my animals would starve, so I starved instead of them. (I can respawn, but they can't). Even this wasn't enough to balance things out properly.\n\nIf you are wounded, you'll bleed out and die if not bandaged, but do animals bleed out?  NO.  No, they do not.  If you're killed by an animal, it levels up and gains an additional 30 or so health.  Then you get to try to retrieve your things and that level 1 wold that killed you is still there, only now it's a level 2 wolf, and you have to deal with it without your weapon.  Good luck. Oh, and If you kill an animal, do you level up?  NO.  No, you do not.  \n\nIf you get a disease, and die you can respawn, but they let you keep the disease.  That's right. If you die with a disease, you respawn with that disease.  Diseases persist even through death.\n\nThe amount of resources to make a lock pick are ridiculous.  16 iron fragments,a few scrap metal pieces, a couple of two-by-fours, and your first born male child.  For a lock pick.  It should be made with maybe a couple of metal scraps.  Sheesh!  Also, it consumes the lock pick if you use it.  Why?  That's not how they work in real life.  Does a hammer wear out if you drive a nail with it?  In the developer's world, it probably does.\n\nWindmills don't produce near as much power as a single light bulb uses.  Forget using that to power refrigerator, or a smelter.  Make 3 upgraded solar panels.  That'll help.  With 3 solar panels, you only need to run one or two generators to keep your base powered up while smelting or drilling or cooking, (just don't try to do more than one of these things at a time).  \n\nAll of these things, and I mean ALL of these things could be tweaked by changing the configuration files as you see fit.  Most of the problems would be resolved by doubling the payout.  If you got twice the veggies from your garden... If animals produced twice as much fertilizer... if your food depleted twice as slowly as it does with standard game settings...  If changing these parameters to suit the player were possible, then this would likely be one of my favorite games.  But it is NOT possible.  It shouldn't take too much effort to put in a GUI slider for resources/hunger/production, but without the possibility to change the parameters to suit your play style then you have a game that's (for me) totally out of balance, and is unplayable. \n\nIf this game's vanilla settings were balanced, then it would be playable.  It's a shame, because it's really fun to try to play.\n\nAs much as I'd love to, I can't recommend this game.  You don't have the ability to access the configuration files.  \"Life is Feudal\" has nothing on this game when it comes to the grind.

I can eat 2 rabbits in the morning and by evening time I'm dying of hunger\n- Gun mechanics are awful and ammo is way too hard to get hold of\n- Pistol is about as useful as a BB gun. \n- Enemy AI is silly\n- Some items take so long to obtain or craft due to slow electricity and mass usage\n- Very little long term playability which I will explain below\n\nThe first few days are great!

I have explored the entire map.

The crafting is subpar at best and the gameplay is in need of some serious balance.\n\nYou kill a bear(if he doesn't kill you first) and get two lousy steaks and a liver. Really?

It took some time to establish a bit of a base, get some gear, do some upgrades.  But it was a very pleasant way to pass time.  Goals were realizable in a reasonable time frame, and it was very satisfying to finally upgrade a weapon or get a new fridge.  I've come back to it in the last few months, and with only a few rare bright spots, it has become a masochistic grind fest.  You'll see posts in the forums saying how \"ludicrously\" easy it is, and I suppose it is, if you like to just non-stop grind for the smallest increments of progress, over and over, and spend all your free time on this game only.  If you only have an hour or two a night, you've been \"developed out of the game\".  Once you realize just how long it's going to take to make any substantial progress, you will in all likelihood throw up your hands and say, why?  I already have a job...\n\nI suspect this is one of those situations where just a handful of grind-bois just keep posting about how easy the game is and the dev feels compelled to react.  So he goes overboard and makes EVERYTHING excruciatingly difficult.  And in the process pretty much ruins what was once, for me at least, and wonderfully balanced, entertaining game.\n\nOne parting shot, and this is ultimately what drove me from the game for good: It takes a LONG time to get decent gear and weapons.  And I do mean a LONG time, and just decent.  Now, having reached this point, God forbid you should die.  Respawn locations are supposedly random, but you WILL respawn across the map from your carcass, it WILL be cold, it will rain/snow non-stop, and you will spawn with absolutely NOTHING to help you, we're talking light pants and one heat pack in the dead of winter.  And if, against all odds, you actually manage to make it back to your corpse, with 2 health left, at least one mob will be pretty much right on top of your stuff.  So all that work, all those hours of grinding are gone in an instant, and you're back to square one.  This, imho, is simply sadism on the dev's part.  Gaming is supposed to be an enjoyable way to pass time, not being put in no-win situations.  To me this smacks of, if you can't make it more interesting, just make it harder.\n\nAll this is, of course, simply mho and a lot of hot air.  Your mileage may vary.  Some people really enjoy staggering grinds for incremental gains.  I have found out I definitely do not.  I don't want everything handed to me on a plate, I don't want it to all be easy-peasy, but this is simply too much.  I wish there was a way I could have the old version back again...\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1603413621, "timestamp_updated": 1603413621, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808040738105773926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33589809": {"recommendationid": "33589809", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981600973", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 5305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2340, "last_played": 1606063430}, "language": "english", "review": "\"I am the sole developer of the project, which I work on in my spare time as a passion project.\" \n\nWell, compared to alot of the crap Early Access stuff that's on here, it makes you question what the other developers are doing. \n\nThe game runs well, and yet manages to look fairly good graphics wise, compared to other titles.

The diving tank could maybe hold a bit more air too. Oh yeah, I also destroyed my animal housing at a time when it felt just better to eat my food myself as it looked as if that chicken laid one egg a year :).\n\nI must admit, although I was escaping from multiplayer issues, at a certain point, I kinda missed more action.\nI got a little bit bored and even didn't go into the caves.\nSo I decided to try the game with hunters on (still on sissy mode of course).\n\nI died single shot while hitting a tree. Later, I found out I was very close to their wooden base.\nIt really changed gameplay for me. In the beginning I only dared to chop the trees right next to my little cabin :).\n\nOn local gameplay, you can have 5 profiles. So you can easily start and switch between several games.\nYou can choose easy, normal and hardcore mode, the month in which you start, the year cycle length and if you want hunters or not and their attack mode when enabled. Controls can be mapped, you can scroll through your weapons and tools. Character looks cannot be adjusted.\nYou can play co-op with friends or join or rent a dedicated server (looking empty at this moment though).\n\nIt's true there isn't super much content in this game but what there is is quite well thought of (and still being worked on by the way).\nI don't mind really. We've been running a Rust server for two years. I actually got sick of it in the end (8k hours). Finally, I only really enjoyed wipe day, the run for the base spot (they even took away the excitement finding that garage door). Even Empyrion, having a lot of content on a server with Reforged Eden and custom mini games, I had a 'ah, seen it, done that' my second start after the recent big update... \n\nI take a game for what it is. There is enough stuff out there to suit several gameplay needs. It would be a pity if they all had the same content. I can quite easily ignore negative comments on that matter.\n\nSo, if you can accept a game as it is and you like to discover a new game, this can be your next thing.\n\nEdit: I just started Keep up Survival after this review. It reminded me how sometimes one takes things for granted. Now, after having a buggy control settings, resolution issues, weird (let not say ugly) graphics, terrible swimming animation, bumpy walking animation, bad sound effects, hill issues leading to death and less pleasant user interface (...) in only a couple of minutes, I feel obliged to emphasize how great this all is in Subsistence.\nThe developer did great work.", "timestamp_created": 1624545551, "timestamp_updated": 1624552097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800121963024139404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143468407": {"recommendationid": "143468407", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996908408", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 31742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 451, "playtime_at_review": 9813, "last_played": 1713014650}, "language": "english", "review": "I just got the game in 2023 after watching lots of videos by some gaming channels like 'Old Guy Gaming', 'Kitten', 'MittsYT', 'Kage848' (Thanks to all of them. They work so hard for less views and some of them have 6-7 seasons of playing Subsistence). After playing for 150+ hours, here is my review.\n\nI just love the idea of being alone in such a stunningly beautiful world. The world is created using Unreal Engine 3 and the Canadian wilderness is captured beautifully! The lake side area is stunning and so are  rivers, waterfalls and snowy mountains. One day I went on a long walk by the river without any objective. The river that empties as a delta into a large lake is a stunning location. I still remember that walk, which gave me a lot of joy. As a wilderness walking simulator, this game is unbeatable!\n\nThe way the seasons change is amazing! Fall colors are stunning. Snowy winters are incredible to look at. I have never seen such details of seasons in any survival game. Small details like Bears hibernating in the winter, Strawberries in the summer, Winter berries from December to Feb, Rivers and Lakes freezing over. You can crack open an ice hole and fish from it or wash your hands. That special sunset. Fishing in a lake. All of this adds to the immersion. It's just a special atmosphere of you and the wilderness.\n\nWhen I first started, I played a test game on 'Easy' with hunters disabled. Easy works for me, as I don't want too many Wolves and Bears - its unrealistic on Normal, while I'm not bothered about Hardcore. Spotting a Wolf or a Bear should maybe happen once a day and must be the highlight of the day. They are as common as bunnies, which is ridiculous. At the start, the tension is real! You need to get going to find stuff and focus on your first camp at night. This game has no psychological horror with strange sounds like in 'The Forest'. That was very important for me. \nThe pressure to get food - protein and veggies, wood, biofuel in first couple of days is nerve wracking. I chose to build a platform on an Island in the Birchwood lake. Building even a basic 3x3 base will take time. The game is deliberately designed to keep the progression at a slow pace. I kinda like that. I have seen how games like Empyrion Galactic Survival, The Forest etc makes it so easy to create massive buildings. I think the pacing is okay for a wilderness sim like Subsistence. But this may not suit many people. You need to consider this when you play the game. Ideally you would like to build an enclosed base, a wood burner, a refinery, a fridge to store food, a solar panel for power. But all of this takes a lot of time and a lot of grinding - which involves finding loot boxes, hunting, fishing, gathering. When going in the wilderness, you need to practice constant and vigilant situational awareness. \n\nIt's a constant exercise, as you spend 90% of the time doing the above mentioned activities. You spend 5% of your time crafting with inventory management and spend the remaining 5% of your time building, if you love building fancy bases. I prefer tiny bases, so building is not important to me.\n\nApart from the natural outdoor wilderness, the developer has added a very elaborate underground cave system. You can only access the cave system once you manufacture a diving suit and O2 canisters. This is mid game stuff and is fairly rewarding. \nThe caves and lava caves feel like a different game. On the day of visiting these caves, it feels like you are planning for an excursion. You stock up on food, water, ammunition and you swim to the caves. The caves are a wonderful change and I really enjoy my excursions there. \n\nI love the fact that there are AI teams that will build their own bases. They are the enemy for you as a player. They make some impressive looking bases which you can raid for materials. Planning for a AI base raid is rewarding and when you get back home, it feels like a satisfying day's work. The AI are fairly intelligent in combat, as they keep moving around and take cover while reloading. There is an element of a tactical battle whenever you face them. If you are in the open you will get surrounded by them. You need to use cover and keep moving. One criticism of the AI from the community is the insane accuracy of their aim. Most shots will hit you unless you are behind cover. I enjoy these encounters and I have seen it does get stressful for some players. \n\nI have played a long solo single player game for more than 100 hours and I have finished building a small base, have tons of food. Power, Water are no longer an issue. I have a chicken coop, that gives me all the eggs for protein, so that I don't have to go out and hunt for food. I still visit regularly just to enjoy the atmosphere. \nI have also played in a multiplayer server and the network code has been implemented well. I did not face any lags or issues so far. The chat window is implemented well too. This game is perfect for multiplayer servers to play with friends.\n\nI wanted to know more about the sole developer's thought process, I went through the updates in Steam from 2017 to the latest Alpha 61 update. I was pleasantly surprised. The release notes are filled with images, functional and technical details that are very interesting and informative. The amount of detail on every feature is documented well. I really feel that features are developed with so much thought and creativity. The developer does make some mistakes but has been rectifying them with fixes. \n\nI think the Seasons update  of Alpha 50 was the developer's most impressive update. Every type of foliage and tree visually transitioning through the various seasons just blew my mind. I have not seen such a weather system in other survival games.\nBut there have been some updates like Alpha 60, which have not been well received. The update adds an ability to manufacture an ATV. There has been criticism about the need to manufacture a vehicle. The point of subsisting in the Canadian wilderness is to enjoy nature. The last thing we need is a head ache inducing noisy petrol powered engine. An electric ATV or a Kayak or an electric bike would have been better. I have not bothered to work on the ATV as I don't want noise! Alpha 61 - The latest patch has been much better, as the developer added a water pumping system and lots of QOF features.\n\nThere is no modding support in this game. There are no server customization features too. \nI wish, users could upload blueprints of bases, structures and other items to the steam workshop. Other users can spawn them in game at a cost. You want a simple 3x3 base? Don't want to build? Pay up and import them from the workshop. This saves a lot of time. All of this is not possible. \nAlso you cannot change the gameplay balance with server customization. If you want a single whack of the axe to fetch you 20 wood instead of 3, you cannot do it. \nI feel by not having modding and an active workshop, the developer is stifling the growth of the game.\n\nWith a name like Subsistence you would expect that living off the land would be more farming orientated with elements of hunting. Having actual farming plots rather than a simple small plant beds would have been preferred. Unfortunately we are not sure if Farming is even part of the developers vision, as there is no communication about future plans. \nI hope the developer can lay out his vision for the next 2 years, so we get some idea on where this game is going. That kind of communication may also help in sales for him. \n\nNevertheless, I must say, this game is truly a labour of love. And my respect for the developer is immense. \n\nI recommend this game, because I enjoy it and when in game, I'm transported to the Canadian wilderness and time just flies! However this game is not meant for the impatient types who want action all the time. If you learn the basics and watch some videos online, you will start enjoying this unique wilderness simulator called Subsistence!", "timestamp_created": 1691256820, "timestamp_updated": 1697172299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793627738952636719", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34028685": {"recommendationid": "34028685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139420856", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 537, "last_played": 1670812210}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish there was a star system on steam rather than a Yes or No option. Although I must recommend it because it has potiential and is playable (unlike some of the other games we get through early access).\n\nI give it a solid 3.5 stars, and heres why:\n\nTHE GOOD IT DOES:\nThe early game is very fun an enjoyable, lots of things to do before the NPCs come. Plus, the animals give the game that little extra umph the game needs, making sure that you stay aware of your surroundings and be careful at all times. The early base building is as it should be as well, with you looking and scavenging for resources via randomized boxes found throughout the map. Also, unlike most games, this game does not have just a hunger bar. Instead, it has multiple bars for different types of food, which is something I quite enjoy. It keeps you on your toes, making sure that you are not only well fed but also that you're eating the right types of food. This helps stop spam eating items like in some other survival games, and it also stops an overpowered food item, such as tatical bacon in DayZ.\n\nThe animal AI is surprisingly well made. I was challenged and caught off gaurd on many occasions, and the AI seems to have a great tracking system, as outrunning them by jumping on rocks or over objects doesn't seem to work, as it does sometimes in other early access games. The hunter AI is surprisingly well made as well. Unlike some games, the AI does not stand in one area in the open. The AI activly moves their position and usually sits behind cover (I've noticed this in the 10-20 times I have shot at them). I'm hoping that the developer takes advantage of his terrific AI making skills and makes some type of aquatic animal, or maybe a \"friendly\" trader. (He would work like the hunters, but he would not shoot at you and would sell items to you for resources. But if you shoot at him, hunters would start raiding your base frequently and he would keep you away from the area where he is located).\n\nThe updates come out regularly. I have seen many fan-suggested updates as well as creative updates adding other things to the game. For some soon to come updates, I suggest upping the map size, adding the AI above, or making nails easier to make. However, I know that this is an early access game, and some of these features will most certainly be far off. But the developer is dedicated and active, so I look forward to more updates as the game gets better!\n\nTHE BAD IT DOES:\n\"Bad\" is not the term I would really like to use, instead \"areas to improve\" would be a better way to describe this section. One area of concern has to be the supply boxes spread around the map. Yes, I praised them above for being a good system for early game collection, but thats the issue. They should JUST be early game collection. I, in the game, have a rifle, ammo for said rifle, a decently sized house, and 3 home base beacons. However, I still find myself looking for basic items such as nails, gunpowder, and rope. Nails, in my opinion, are too difficult to find as well, as not every box contains them. My suggestion for fixing some of these issues is:\n1. Making a \"wooden nail\". This could be used to construct wooden walls, however in order to upgrade the walls you need to build the metal nails. This would encourage early base building as well as make bigger bases be slightly easier for late game players.\n2. Make gunpowder a collectable resource. Make animal droppings, if done properly, become gunpowder. However, it takes more gunpowder to make a bullet if it is made this way. (I personally am not sure the exact process, but making this possible in game would be awesome!)\n3.Make underground mining possible, with higher levels of metals to make bullet casings.\n4. Make cordage farms avaliable, or make \"vines\", which are more rare but offer more cordage to make ropes than regular cordage.\n\nFinal Words:\nI am very fond of this game! It is something I can see myself playing for a while. I can't wait until the next update!

I am extremely passionate about survival crafting and I have tried nearly all. After ~40 hours in to Subsistence, I am ready to share my experience. \n\nI really, truly wanted to love this game. It is one of the few that deals with just the core aspects of survival against the wilderness, with very low fantasy elements. No zombies, no monsters, just animals and men and the dark. I reject the notions of this game being 'too hard' in a gameplay sense. \n\nWhat it is, however, is intentionally made difficult to play via the inconsistent mechanics. Instead of making it hard to physically gather wood via like logistics and carry capacity, it is *made* difficult by only yielding one log per swing, 3 tops per average tree. Instead of making combat interesting or compelling, you just do very little damage, and every predator can kill you in 1-2 hits. Even the guns are made less powerful. Instead of weakening a Lv2 wolf by shooting it in the face, it takes a full clip and you have to be sprinting backward.\n\nMy main gripe is that the concept of challenging gameplay has been substituted with just tuning the variables to make everything take a long time, and you just die really easily. I just don't understand it. I've tried things like turning off hunters and changing the difficulty, but the fact remains that you are chopping motionless trees and searching for duffel bags for hours just to get the reward of maybe adding a few logs and berries to your bank at the end of the day. It shouldnt take real life weeks of collaborative gameplay to overcome the adversity of a survival game. Every part of the loot is random, which, whatever. It's not the worst system, but it's not really rewarding to \"find\" ore, fibers, or even chickens, because literally every node is a random spawn. It makes the entire map feel extremely static, which is really sad because the map is huge and visually very appealing.\n\nI will say the game eventually opens up a bit more when you can afford the luxeries of plant growth and refrigeration, but the combat vs animals or hunters remains rigid, underhanded and archaic. We've had some really amazing times defending against base sieges (great system) as well as retailiating and stalking hunters through the woods, but having to deal with the senseless entropy of the engine has really diminished the playability over time.\n\nAt it's core, this is a good idea and very impressive considering the dev is just some guy. But at the moment I just think the game really gets in it's own way a lot, and it isn't very rewarding when you do succeed. I think anyone interested in low fantasy survival crafting should try this, but just understand that it's less about survival than it is about cheesing the AI.", "timestamp_created": 1535298041, "timestamp_updated": 1535298162, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792120397090911865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54138959": {"recommendationid": "54138959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009809770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 11816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1050, "last_played": 1687830964}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to like this game, and at first I did.

It gets updated every couple months and every time I'm blown away by what a single person can accomplish. Every update adds great content and not just empty promises of future content like some other early access survival games. It may not be as fleshed out as other games but that's understandable when you consider that there isn't an entire team of people working on it.

The people complaining about this game being impossible wouldn't last more than a couple days in an actual survival situation. This game is hard, you have to be harder to survive. The balance of fun to grind in this game is almost perfect. You dont have to play it all the time to progress like rust.

Almost.  There are things I love about it. Things i don't love because they seem like weird design choices, or they don't make much sense, and things I think could be added to improve the experience.\n\nI\u2019m going to talk about mechanics, and not so much the engine/graphics etc.\n\nWhat I loved:\n\n-The constant need to be aware of your surroundings in order to be able to find what you need, and in order to avoid wandering into a predator.  Plants can be challenging to find, even though they\u2019re everywhere. In many survival games, its common to get to a point where resources just snowball, and surviving and living off the land isn't a challenge anymore.  So far I haven't experienced this. There's always a need to be proactive and aware of how you're spending your time.\n\n-Bow and arrow hunting. It took me some practice to get the hang of aiming the bow, making hunting small game all the more satisfying once I finally got it.\n\n-Fishing.  Simple, but also enjoyable and worthwhile.\n\n-Weather and temperature conditions.  Being wet and cold is bad. Being dry and warm is good. Being in shelter when its raining, also good. Common sense stuff that i'm happy is included in this game.\n\nWhat seemed to make little sense:\n\n-The animal kingdom.  Bears, wolves, rabbits, deer, mooses, and chickens, all live together in perfect harmony.  All too often you will see a rabbit or something hop past a wolf like they were buddies.  Animals seem to spawn everywhere on the \u201cnormal\u201d difficulty.  Its not uncommon to wander through the woods and stumble on a handful of wolves, bears, and chickens all just kinda hanging out with no real purpose other than waiting to die.\n\n-Supplies.  There is a massive dependency on searching for supply boxes.  They spawn randomly around the map, and there's no real rhyme nor reason for why they do.  They don't parachute from the sky, they aren't part of some long abandoned wreck.  They are simply there.  Often they will appear around my base out of nowhere.\n\n-Nails, weapons, and scrap.  Scrap is a collectable resource that you find randomly around the map, and its used for many things, mostly base building and making weapons (guns), but not nails.  You need nails to build your base, and your first shelter. For this you need nails, which you can\u2019t craft.  You need to collect them from storage boxes.  Weapons...Pistols, shotguns, rifles etc....you make them with scrap and a few other tidbits, and you make them from your inventory.  Complex pieces of equipment crafted with precision machinery can be assembled by hand with scrap, BUT NOT NAILS.\n\n-The base.  In this game, you start out pretty rough, but then bam you just start building a fancy base with electricity and machines and all that.  There's not really a build up to it.  Its just, start the game, try to survive in the open and build a beautiful wooden hunting lodge as fast as possible. I spent a day and a night next to my camp fire in the rain, so I wouldn't get sick, because I hadn't found enough nails yet to put a roof on my shack.\n\nWhat I would love to see:\n\n-More makeshift/primitive weapons. Spears etc.\n-Shelter options. I think it stands to reason that players should be able to use a tent, or some other form of temporary shelter while they are exploring or waiting to get enough resources to build their base.\n-Less dependent on firearms. Given the environment, guns should be hard to get and difficult to craft.\n-Less dependent on supply crates.  At the moment you NEED to hunt for supply crates to get nails and certain other uncraftable resources.  It's a little ridiculous.\n-Animal AI. Seeing the predators chase down prey, and prey trying to avoid them, much like us hunters, would really add to immersion. \n\nFun game. Challenging. A Lot of potential.

Humans can survive without food for about 3 weeks. And without water for about 3 days. In the game you will have to eat and drink so often that you have little time to do anything else but to search for food and water. Water cantines are enough for single drink, and they do not stack in the inventory. Taking up your limited space.\n\nApparently lack of protein will kill you within a game day, the plantlife (except kelp) is completely devoid of proteins.\n\nNatural fibers are one of the most abundant resources in the world, unless you find yourself suddenly in middle of Gobi, or the Sahara, you can't literally make a step in the real world without tripping over it. In the game you have to search for tiny, camouflaged plants that give single fiber.\n\nWhile trees are plentiful, You get 3 logs from cutting down a tree, and you can't tell which trees you have already harvested and which ones you can still harvest. \n\nTakes 5 boxes of gunpowder to make single 9mm round. And it takes at minimum 2 rounds to kill a chicken or a rabbit.\nWhile i've never taken a pot shot at a chicken, i can kill a rabbit with a single shot from a .22, a 9mm handgun round would most likely make a mess of the rabbit.\n\nI can't pick back up my own arrows?

There is no \"easy\" mode, it's a lie.\n2. Bears and Wolves consider it their sacred duty to protect loot and small game. They take this VERY seriously.\n2-a Bears and Wolves are extraordinarily efficient killers.\n3. Chickens and Rabbits (small game) always have a large, fanged friend nearby. They can usually outrun you long enough to get to that friend.\n4. \"Easy\" mode is a lie.\n5. One round from a 9mm pistol will not kill a chicken; neither will two. Two, however, will render it unable to run to it's friend.\n6. Despite all the ranting you will see here about lack of fiber and other resources, and Wolves being bulletproof, there is plenty of fiber and loot crates, if you stop sprinting long enough to look around.\n7. If you stop sprinting long enough to look around,  a wolf or a bear will likely eat you.\n8. Wolves are not bullet proof. You can kill a level 1/2 wolf with 5 or 6 well aimed shots from a 9mm.\n9. Bears are impervious to 9mm rounds. At least, to more of them than you can fire in the time it takes the bear to bring about a premature end to your day.\n10. \"Easy\" mode is a lie. \n\nIn summary, this is an amazing game, with very few glitches or bugs. It is EXTREMELY difficult and challenging. You will EARN every single thing you get and every single minute that you live. Even in \"Easy\" mode, which is a lie.\n\n****Edit****  Never let it be said that I won't admit when I'm wrong. I based this review on about 3 hours of \"normal\" and a hour or so of \"easy\" play. I've now spent a good deal of time playing both, as well as \"Hardcore\".  Easy mode is not a lie.

There are some negative reviews mostly from people that don't understand the game, so let me explain a little. Subsistence is a survival game with a progression.\n\nWhen you start the game you are getting low grade food and cooking it on a campfire.   As you progress through the game, you advance your cooking up to an electric stove, you also begin to get higher grade domesticated meat.  By mid game you are throwing extra food into the mass recycler because you have more than you can store in your fridge.  Like real life you burn more calories the more you run around, so if your new, walk early game don't run, this will help.\n\nWhen you start the game you are told to avoid the animals, by mid game bears and wolves are no longer a threat and you can kill them quickly.  You start the game by crafting a simple bow and arrows, by mid-game you have rifles, shot guns, pistols etc.  These can be upgraded multiple times to hit harder and carry more rounds before reload.  You will also craft heavier clothes, ballistic vests, helmets, etc to increase your armor and take less damage.\n\nThe hunters (AI Humans) are in the game to make survival harder.  Subsistence is NOT a first person shooter, so the game is not designed for hunting humans for profit.  If you're new to the game turn off the hunters, you can turn them back on at anytime, or if they are getting overwhelming turn them off and they disappear from the map.  You can turn them on at anytime and they will start over.  You can also adjust their behavior, for example, set them to revenge attack only, they will attack your base only when you attack them first. \n\nOverall the game is built very well and is designed for you to struggle, but as you progress through the game it is less grindy and there is more to do.  By mid game it is less survival and more base building.  You will reach a point where you raise all of your food with grow beds and animal houses.  You will have autominers getting you minerals and water.

Additions to the game have made it much more enjoyable. However I will leave my original review intact:\n\nI know many people like this game and I should point out that this review is my personal opinion.\nThis game is known for being hard, I get that. I have a good number of hours into it and have installed and uninstalled it several times now.\nWhy I reinstall: The building, crafting and survival are challenging.\nWhy I inevitably uninstall it again: 9mm can't kill a domestic chicken with one shot, claims a headshot is the ideal killing shot for hunting deer, cougars are the only source of sinew. Firstly there is a reason why the 9mm is the prefered side arm of law enforcement and the miltary, why make it less effective than a pea shooter? Second every real hunter knows that the heart / lung shot is the most dependable killing shot and that head shots are not. Third deer are the prime source for siniew, carnivore sinew is nearly useless, it is short and brittle.\nThe game has no backstory, no presentation of why any of it is happening. Am I a political prisoner, a criminal, captured by aliens, in a game show? Why the heck am I there locked in with a totally unsupportable animal population and 'hunters', subpar firearms and magic mass creation machines? What is my goal? \nThe game goes nowhere, you reach a point very quickly where it becomes a rinse and repeat festival. There is no end game objective.\nIf I want to suffer I can hit myself in the face with a hammer for free, if I want to be frustrated I can spend my time trying to stand a length of string on its end for free. Who in their right mind pays money for suffering and frustration with no explanation or goal?\n\nI love the journey from half naked and hungry to armed, armored and bunkered but then there nothing more.\nThis is why in the end I uninstall and camp for the day this game goes someplace or at least gives me a reason why i am there.", "timestamp_created": 1540350739, "timestamp_updated": 1611203525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773710191249847412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34917828": {"recommendationid": "34917828", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971192292", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 18205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2529, "last_played": 1672254289}, "language": "english", "review": "The game at this point is too expensive for what it offers but it's still worth playing and trying it out.

Being someone who's put countless hours into Rust and other survival titles I'd say it's scratching an itch I've had for awhile. \n\nThings that I enjoyed.\n1. The graphics do it for me. \n2. Needing to pull your weapon in defense is not an easy task.  Not sure if this is the engine or an intentional design choice but I enjoy not being able to take down a bear without foresight. \n3. A solid beginning when it comes to crafting/house building.  \n4. The game runs pretty solid, didn't notice much fps drop.\n\nThings you may want to keep in mind.\n1.

I know I an use generators in a pinch but I'd like to be eventually self-sustaining in regards to power.\n\nNice job ColdGames!\n\n==================================================\n\nI really really wish there was a \"Neutral\" option in these reviews, I can't give the game a thumbs up and I really don't want to give it a thumbs down as it's only one guy coding the game and he's really on the right track but there's a few things in the game that I find as annoying as all heck, so here goes...\n\nPros:\n\nThe base building is fantastic: ColdGames has hit the nail more or less on the head with it, all the pieces (including foundations) snap together nicely and look good.\n\nThe focus on PVE instead of PVP:  I've seen so many survival games with so much potiential cop out and take the easy road down the path of focusing on PVP and micro-transactions.  ColdGames really seems to care about those of us that enjoy PVE.\n\nThe world looks and feels amazing.\n\nCons:\n\nThere are certain crafting elements that are either just too difficult to find or too reliant on loot boxes that randomly appear in the world, I know it's an early game and this will probably change but it's annoying nonetheless.\n\nFIBER PLANTS!!!  Good lord thee are hard to spot, not only that but the plants are NOT all over the place as I've been told.  I've found healing plants more then fiber (at least those are easy enough to spot which is probably why I have so many of them).  This needs to be addressed as I've said in the discussion forums I should be able to spot the plants I need without going blind.\n\nEverything that moves wants to kill you:  Don't get me wrong I like the wildlife, what I don't like is the heavy reliance on guns and ammo to take them down.  A lvl1 wolf should be easilly taken down with a melee weapon (for example in H1Z1 I can easilly take down a wolf with an axe and a few bandages).\n\nFood and Water:  I'm going to put this in the Con side because there needs to be a way to grow more food and have options for different kids of food (apples and blueberries should be able to be broken down into seeds for instance).  Water too should be more available, for right now you either have to rely on the loot crates or build a well head with scarce materials from the same random loot crates, A rain catcher would be easy enough to make.\n\nAll in all I'd say this game has huge potential but a lot of work needs to be done yet, making a survival game hard is one thing but right now it feels like a second job.\n\nI'm really sorry ColdGames but for right now I'll have to give it a thumbs down, as the updates come and I play more this will most likely change, I'd like to also say that the only reason I'm giving a thumbs down is the lack of a Neutral option.\n\nWill keep my eye on this one.", "timestamp_created": 1487774225, "timestamp_updated": 1591772722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767874538898468018", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35646484": {"recommendationid": "35646484", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995223194", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1702, "last_played": 1662837367}, "language": "english", "review": "A \"TL:DR\" of my review would be: \"Get it! - but expect some things to be broken\". \n\nFor the price, it's an excellent game. And ColdGames has done nothing but prove his work ethic with releasing content for this game. (Hell, he completely remade the game and surprise-announced it just for MP compatibility!).\n\n\nAnyhow, here's my review so you know how I feel about the game, and what to expect if you DO decide to purchase it!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------Pros:-------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Graphics are beautiful for an Early Access title (and for being made by only one guy, surprisingly!)\n\n- The game runs at a constant 60FPS on my Intel AND AMD PC with no issue\n\n- Extremely challenging, even on lower difficulties - (until you get fully kitted and have plenty of ammo - and even still - you can lose that in a heartbeat!)\n\n- Building things feels rewarding / Good sense of progression.\n\n- Survival feels like... well, survival. - Aside from water, you have a \"True\" hunger bar. Your hunger bar consists of proteins AND fruit/veggies, which is more realistic, and a refreshing addition to a survival game. Juggling this with the animal/hunter survival makes for a challenging, frustrating (yet fun), survival experience.\n\n- The map is relatively large, and rewarding with the amount resource crate spawns. Despite the map being so vast, you can easily identify landmarks (ie the snow mountain, large arch, short arch, cave, and so forth) to easily navigate the terrain.\n\n- More intiutive than many games I have played. You can craft planters, add grow lights, etc. (to allow for overnight growth), add wells to drill for water, and have the ability to raise animals as livestock for self-sustaining food.\n\n- The general audio quality (gun sounds, grenade sounds, water sloshing, and walking sounds) are surprisingly pretty amazing for a game with this price point.\n\n- The game is PvE, but plays like a PvP game. I often found myself side strafing while cutting trees, gathering water, etc - always anticipating getting lit up by the 4 man hunter unit that set up camp about a mile from my base.\n\n- ^ There is the ability (for those who enjoy PvE without the risk of being shot at), to completely disable Hunter AI and wipe them from your wolf. This allows a more casual experience with the game, and, if you so choose --- you can re-enable them later when you are ready.\n\n- AI actually DOES something (literally). The hunter (raider AI) build their own camo bases, gather resources, group up in 2-5 man parties, and will raid you when built up.\n\n- There is room to design a significant and beautiful base or home. Much like games like Fortnite, they have implemented half walls, quarter walls, and curved walls - allowing for more realistic, and beautiful, base designs. \n\n***** When I first started this game, I didn't anticipate it to already have the volume that it currently has. I started, and (after going into the UDK .ini file and disabling motion blur immediately), found myself shocked how well optimized and beautiful the game was. Before I Knew it, my alarm went off and I realized it was 7:00 AM... and I had played ALL NIGHT LONG. This is the first game in years that has done that to me!  *****\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------Cons:-------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Game is CAPPED at 60FPS. And if you remove this limitation in the UDK Config, the game becomes unstable. - Really just a nitpick and not a real con, though.\n\n- Multiplayer is new, and broken (as of 10/11/17). Most are unable to see 90% of friends or join their games - despite network/firewall settings.\n\n- Animals and Hunter AI have strange pathfinding and hitboxes. You may find yourself dead in one hit, or kill an enemy in 1 hit. Likewise, you can find yourself easily stuck on a rock - or get a hunter stuck on a rock... resulting in almost a guaranteed death or one or the other.\n\n- Enemiesl level and get more powerful; you do not (at least, yet). So if you keep dying to the same bear, prepare to fight a level 5 massive bear as a level 1 with a hatchet and a 9MM.\n\n- Resource management hurts. There are no better axes, etc. - and you are left to manually gather 3-5 logs per tree. Each plank takes 3 logs, and each foundation takes 5 planks. In a nutshell, even if you've been playing 10 hours on the same map, you will often still find yourself struggling just as bad for building resources. Additionally, ALL other building materials (aside from ore) must be optained from randomly spawned crates within the world. They are plentiful, but many people dislike praying to RNGesus for the blessings of steel nails.\n\n- Lack of diversity with weaponry and clothes. (Which is to be expected in an EA game, but definitely something that is on my list, and that of my friends). - You DO have the choice between a Bow, 9MM, .44 Magnum, 20Gauge Shotgun, and semi-auto rifle (SVT40) respectively for combat... But it would be nice to see some more calibers come out closer to release.\n \n-Once you have a well and are self-sufficient with plants/animals, there is nothing else to do aside from expand your base or use your resources raiding Hunters.\n\n- Hunters have seemingly unlimited grenades, ammo, etc. - making it extremely to defend early-on raids. This makes it immensely hard on harder difficulties where they have traditional \"AI Aimbot\".\n\n- Bear/Wolf sounds are on a loop and triggered with distance; causing some annoying \"Snarl SFX\" loops with glitching animals frantically flailing back/forth. This is hilarious, but honestly, quite annoying.\n\n- Some models feel like (and some ARE) complete placeholders. With a game so stunningly beautiful, it really hurts your eyes when you watch the hammer of the gun move (and slide) when racking a round into your pistol.\n\n- Prepare to lose your stuff; and not to enemies. Some bugs force items such as consumeables (spare canteens of purified water, steaks, and more) will glitch and cease to exist when re-loading your save.\n\n***** The game definitely has a substantial amount of glitches, bugs, exploits, and WIP mechanics... But is definitely worth a buy regardless. Despite my list of cons (that took quite some time to really nit-pick)... I find myself not noticing them very much aside from the disappearing food/water. Honestly, I'd recommend the game for anyone that wants to support an EA title that is actually going somewhere!*****", "timestamp_created": 1507754559, "timestamp_updated": 1507754987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765817880630493164", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42536621": {"recommendationid": "42536621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107636163", "num_games_owned": 2663, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 670, "last_played": 1626201603}, "language": "english", "review": "First, I would like to start by stating the obvious. Everything written below is my opinion and I am not a game developer. I have no idea how hard anything is to program but I finally wanted to leave a review on Subsistence after almost 2 years in development. \n\nI am giving this a positive however, I see many issues with this game even after 2 years of Early Access.  Let's get this started with a pros and cons list. \n\nPros:\n1. Great game idea. I like the idea of being thrown into the real world with the immersion of live animals and the hunt or be hunted mentality.\n\n2. Hunters. I enjoy the task of having to dodge the hunters a few days after placing your BCU. I like that fact that you can kill the hunters and raid their places. \n\n3. Building. I enjoy the building aspect of the game and feel it has been done well. \n\n4. Fishing. I have not had the ability yet to try the fishing but I do look forward to the ability to fish to find food. \n\n5. New Content. I am very happy that ColdGames is adding new content to the game and has great ideas. I can't wait to see what is next. \n\nCons:\n1. Hardcore. This game should be noted that it is completely hardcore. There is nothing easy about this game. You will die, you will lose everything and you will have to rebuild your base multiple times. Very grindy, do not get attached to anything. I played the game on normal mode because I never play a game on easy nor have I ever tried hardcore mode. I feel maybe there should not be an easy or normal mode. I would reccommend normal become hardcore and hardcore become \"Hell on Earth\" mode.\n \n2. Sound. There is no way to adjust the different sounds in the game. There is only \"Master Volume\". I believe that there should be ambient sound, animals, weapons and tools and weather sounds. I do not want to go deaf listening to my axe hit the tree just so I can hear the animals growl as I get near. \n\n3. Saving. Be warned that when the game is automatically saving there is about a 2 second delay during this process and your game will cease to function. This does not really affect you unles you are running for your life or reloading your weapon to kill the angry animal behind you. \n\n4. Balance. I do not feel the recipes are balanced. You recieve 1 to 4 logs per tree, which is not a lot to begin with but okay no problem. But then it takes 3 logs to make a plank. Immersion broken. Then 1 log to make a stick. My suggestion: Make each log make 1 plank if you want to make it difficult but allow the bushes that are all over the mat, give you 1 to 2 sticks. That seems more realistic to a game like this. The food is very hard to find, you will die of starvation at least once. You will also die of the cold at least once as well. I believe the fiber needs to be recalculated as well. Fiber is probably \"THE\" hardest thing to gather in a day. Once again maybe the bushes could allow 2 to 3 fiber as well as the sticks. Just a suggestion on my part. \n\n5. Almost 2 years. I understand that this game only has a single developer and ColdGames probably has a full time career and most likely a family to take care of, however, it has been in early access fro almost 2 years now. My opinion is that ColdGames should fix the issues with the game before moving on such as balance and sound. I feel after almost 2 years this game should be further than what it is. I played this game again today after waiting about 6 months expecting to see a big difference however I still feel it is the same as what it was when I purchased it near the release date. \n\n6. Animal Spawns and the BCU. Earlier today when I was playing Subsistence, after 3 days in game I had finally built 2 floors, 2 walls, a BCU and a storage chest. Morning of Day 4 a Level 3 bear spawned in early morning within 20 feat of base, chased me away and tore everything apart. I have no desire to spend 3 more days to try and rebuild the part I had done, with the hunters coming in less than a day. At this point I would rather start over with a new world. In my opinion the BCU should keep animal spawns further away so that you can exit your property and not have to worry about the bears tearing it to shreads while you are gone.  This is another reason I said this game was hardcore. \n\nI really want to enjoy this game. I think most of the game mechanics work wonderfully. It runs smooth for the most part and will be a great challenge once the game is completed. I honestly hope ColdGames will read my review and give it some thought. If you are considering buying this game, I say YES, please do. Support the developer because I believe it will be worth it. I tried to give not only my opinions of the negatives but also the my suggestions for changes so that it does not look like I am just bashing a good game. I am still giving this game a positive review because I believe in the game and the developer. I understand that this is being developed by one person but by now I expected more. \n\nOverall I would give this game a 7/10 review if there were something like that.

But it completely fails as a whole.\nGame is full of problems and poor design decisions, that developer simply does not address. At all. Instead he marches to the sound of his own drum and just adds stuff that nobody asked for. All while various suggestions and fixes proposed in community section went completely ignored for years.\n\"Feature Suggestion\" part of Community Hub, second biggest section after \"General Discussion\", is completely pointless. Nothing anyone writes there will ever be addressed. It is just for show.\nGame has ton of issues and QOL problems, with a lot of suggestions being made. None of them have been ever addressed. None of building players asked repeatedly have been added, instead we got an elevator. Something that absolutely nobody asked for. Over past 4 years there has been almost no QOL additions made. Just look up how many times scopes have been suggested for example.\nThat would not be too bad if modding was an option. But dev intentionally encrypts all files. So he neither fixes/adds things community wants, nor he lets others to do so.\nSo overall, good idea, pisspoor execution.\n\nTake for example just released ATV update. It takes ~4 months for an update and we got something that adds no real benefit to the game.\nThere is literally no point to have an ATV in this game, as game is structured in a way that neither solves any of the existing problems, not it adds any QoL improvement. It is purely for \"I have a wrum-wrum brrr-brrr in my garage\" checkbox.\nDoes it help with scavenging?! Not really, due to how lootbox spawning is organized. Driving around you will miss most of them and even when you do spot one, then you have to dismount, collect and then mount again. There are no large cashes spawning in different parts of the map, that would justify the need for long trips.\nDoes it help with hunting?! Again, no. Bears and wolves are everywhere, there is no centralized spawning for deer, moose, wild boar. You just come across them from time to time. Maybe cougars, as they only spawn in one region, alas big one. So if there is benefit for hunting, it is a very marginal one.\nMining!? Nope. There is no point in driving half-way across map to mine couple of small deposits that may not even spawn.\nFishing!? Really!?! Who builds base so far from nearest water source that you would need an ATV to get there!?!?\nMaybe cave entrances, as those are rather far between and can take awhile to get to. But again benefit is fairly marginal.\nAnd you cant even drive this thing fast as terrain is mostly too rough for high speeds.\nSo we have new addition that solves nothing, adds nothing and in general is there purely for checkbox. Four months of development for nothing.\nId rather take gun customization, or reworked woodcutting system, or about dozen of other improvements, that would be miles more beneficial to the game, than this pointless crap.", "timestamp_created": 1670690537, "timestamp_updated": 1670790613, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.76344907283782959", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156937246": {"recommendationid": "156937246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059848249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10021, "last_played": 1707501405}, "language": "english", "review": "I use to be able to play this game with partial controller.

If you re-spawn on other side of map, you will never get it back. \n\nWay too many animals. You can't spit without angering a wolf or bear that will chase you, annoyingly, for upwards of a minute.\n\nHunters spawn in at too quick a rate. (Yes, I know you can turn hunters off. I would like to play with hunters on... just not two new hunters per night that immediately have better weapons and armor than you and a base that you cannot destroy without very advanced game crafting). \n\nVery grindy (and I like grind, usually... but so much cordage... and wood... and ore...)\n\nImbalanced game progress/personal strength to enemy progress/enemy strength\n\nWorld is relatively small\n\nUltimately, perhaps this game is NOT too challenging if you watch all the YouTube videos, play a precise way, and pour hours and hours into strategy.

That's fine, it's been done over and over and over in other games, this one's no different.  But shooting an animal at point blank range with 9mm pistol and doing little to no damage, while it kills me every time -- b*llsh*t.  I empty the entire clip into an animal's face at less than 10-feet, and it lives and kills me.\n\nAnd there are so many animals (wolves, bears, etc.) waiting to kill you -- the map is saturated to the point that you will have a hard time finding any place without these animals waiting every few steps...there's no reason a normal person would think the volume of mobs, even on 'easy' mode, is even remotely OK.\n\nTrying to fish -- should be basic, beginner level activity -- if you haven't got the means to manufacture pistols, rifles, etc., nor ammunition, then fishing should be beginner level thing to get you by...but not in this game!!  You can only fish if you harvest \"tree-grubs\" -- and on the entire map out of hundreds, if not thousands, of trees available to be chopped down for firewood and logs there are approx. 10 \"special\" trees that will each give you ONE GRUB.  Approx. 10 magic \"grub trees\" ON THE ENTIRE MAP!!!\n\nTo fish one time you need to create fishing \"tackle\" along with a fishing pole/rod -- the \"tackle\" is the ammo -- one-time-use.  So for each grub you find you can hope to catch one fish.  Grubs, worms, or other types of fishing \"bait\" should be easiest things to find as beginner just scrounging to get by.  Plant fiber, couple sticks and a bug should enable a person to keep from starving...but not in this game -- for some reason developer decided only ten grubs on the entire map -- then you wait for the trees to respawn.\n\nHarvesting logs from trees is something we've all had to do in games of this genre -- start cutting down trees, get logs, make planks, start building some shelter...but in this developer's mind one plank requires THREE LOGS -- and nearly every tree gives only 3-4 logs.  Wait, so you're saying one entire tree is needed to make ONE PLANK?!? Yes.  Does not even make sense -- I can drop each of the three logs on the ground INDIVIDUALLY -- but to make ONE PLANK I somehow 'magically' glue three logs together into one plank.  And this 'issue' has been pointed out to developer over and over, and ignored.\n\nBasic, common-sense 'balancing' for this game is being pushed aside and ignored, while the developer caters to a hand-full of fan-bois -- creating 'diving suits' and hang-gliders and glass-walls for houses so one can have a nice 'view'.  Really, are you serious?!?  Glass-walls for your mansion IN A SURVIVAL GAME?!?  But you can't be bothered to balance the damage output of weapons, nor look at availability of basic items like fishing-bait.\n\nDo yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere -- there are many other survival-genre games available that are way better.\nOh, and before the fan-bois show up to claim \"early-access\", this has all been going on for 6-YEARS!", "timestamp_created": 1644890974, "timestamp_updated": 1644896483, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.752621889114379883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26305291": {"recommendationid": "26305291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020978649", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 19108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2685, "last_played": 1655187781}, "language": "english", "review": "Firstly, I have followed this game's development for the past 10 months by watching let's play videos of it by GameEdge on youtube. By just the changes you can see over those past 10 months, I can tell you this developer (a one man army) has been working his ass off.\n\nOn to the (partial) review.\n\n\n1: The game is not only an Early Access game, but as far as EA goes, and the general life expectancy of the EA stage, it is in the infancy of EA. The base game is there. The mechanics are smooth. The graphics are impressive for a one man developed game on the Unreal Engine. New features are being added regularly, and game breaking bugs are being dealt with ASAP.\n\n2: This game just came into public EA. Before now it was a private EA title. I can tell you that TONS of people have been begging for this game to reach public EA since let's plays of it first hit youtube.\n\n3: Do not compare this game to Rust. Different engines, different mechanics, and an extremely different take on what Survival is supposed to be.\n\n4: This game DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND. There are no tutorials. There is no \"hints\" system. You begin the game with a few basic things, like some water, some food, matches, a glow stick, and an axe. Any person that has even a smidgen of intelligence will now that the axe is likely used to chop wood from any of the trees in the game.\n\nHonestly....\"Survival\" games from 2010-2014 have been pushing this whole mentality of hand-holding on the players. It dumbs down the games, and lowers expectations the players have.\n\nSubsistence does not do this. You are not told what to do, where to go, or how to survive. You will be brutally murdered by a wolf or bear, or AI Hunter, at some point in this game. This is a fact.\n\nIf you are an intelligent person that's tired of having your hand held, then keep reading. Otherwise, GTFO and go back to 7D2D or Rust.\n\n\n\nYou chop wood. You run around and collect fiber from specific plants. You loot various resources ranging from building supplies to weapon supplies, food items, and medical supplies from \"randomly\" spawned crates.\n\nThese crates have different looks which tell you what they might have in them. The crates have a despawn timer. After a few minuets they will despawn, and randomly spawn somewhere else.\n\nWhen you die, all your stuff is dropped in a small crate on the ground. If you have a proper base built, you can spawn at it and then run back to your crate. Otherwise you are spawned somewhere randomly in the map.\n\nThe crate you drop on death will only last for 5 minuets. This means you may or may not get back to your chest in time.\n\n\nThe Wolves and Bears are brutal. They are faster than you. They do more damage than you. They have more health than you. When they kill you, they level up. Increasing their health, and damage done. For most of your first few hours playing this game, you will either run away from each animal, or you will grow a pair, and shoot that level one wolf with 5 9mm bullets and kill him dead. Then you will cook his meat and eat it.\n\n\nThe base building in this game is on par with games like Ark, Empyrion, and Osiris. Look at youtube videos featuring building for this game for more details.\n\nEnd of Review. I have only put 20 hours into the game so far. I still have plenty of things to do with base building, npc killing, animal hunting, farming, rasing chickens, and upgrading my guns.\n\n\nOnce I do all that, and put in another 20 or so hours, I will complete this review with a yes or no for recommendation.\n\n\nIf you are on the fence about whether or not you want to buy this fairly cheap, yet very polished for what it is EA game, go watch some old lets plays by GameEdge, then watch his newest videos for the game.\n\nYou will get both a sense of where the game started, how far it has come in a short time, and where it is headed.

RNG can tell me i'm not getting any nails. but i keep at it and they'll show up eventually. i usually have so much chicken it's spoiling in my inventory after being cooked, so i can sprint as much as i like which helps.\n\nfor my first night my objective is getting one foundation down, with one wall, and a ceiling. basically a lean-to. i put my fire inside it to protect it from the rain (like somebody with brain cells). i put a box down for storage. this requires about 80 wood, 50 nails, 16 fiber and 2 biofuel (for fire starting kits). this is perfectly within reason even if i've made more than 20 arrows on my first day (cause i'm not an idiot, and i learn how to play the game rather than expecting it to let me play however i like). \n\nby day 5 i'm usually up to medium clothing, over 40 animal fat stocked and needing a second storage chest to fit all my fruit/veg and seeds (i don't eat fruit/veg. not necessary, pure carnivore diet. the fruit/veg will go to my animal pen once i get one built). i usually wait to drop my BCU until i have over 100 animal fat, decent ore stocks and a single floor 3x3 house. once i drop my BCU my build order is Woodburner > Small Generator > Mass Fabricator. \n\nthe woodburner is necessary for rendering my animal fat. the small generator comes before the mass fabricator because the woodburner offsets your power/mass ratio and i don't want to sit on max power waiting for max mass to build the fabricator. i still have to wait a bit for the mass to build back up, but once i have all three built i can just render fat into biofuel, crank biofuel into power and power into mass. with over 100 animal fat i have plenty of biofuel to accelerate my base building once i drop my BCU. after that... well, i've only had 6 runs. i'm working on figuring out cougars right now, so after one or two more runs i'll be farming sinew and have a working strat to reach endgame before day 10.\n\n..i'm not some kind of god at the game. i don't even have 80 hours in (77 hours exactly as of writing this). the game isn't hard, it just doesn't pull punches. if you don't want to bother learning how to play the game, it WILL punish you for being arrogant or ignorant. honestly i love that aspect, it makes every death feel meaningful. \"this is why i died. how do i avoid dying like that moving forward?\" and there are usually MULTIPLE methods for dealing with every problem. the game isn't hard... it just expects you to deal with the challenges it poses rather than ignore them and charge forward recklessly. ...and once you learn how to deal with most of the early challenges you can certainly charge forward recklessly, as long as your not an idiot about it and know how to do it without getting wrecked.\n\ni would certainly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for something different. it's simple and straightforward, but it won't just bend over for you. it's very different from most other survival games in that regard. the progression is a little overbalanced, but honestly the game would be crap if they went too far in the other direction and over tuned things too much. i hate to admit it, but the challenge and the intricacy it creates is 80% of the draw. get rid of that... and this game would just be another dime-a-dozen piece of indie-studio crap. \n\nif you want a game that empowers you as a player and makes you feel like an unstoppable force or a one man army... this isn't the game for you. if you want a game where every single step you take forward is a challenge, feels meaningful and provides a sense of accomplishment? i don't think i've ever found a better survival game.", "timestamp_created": 1642829450, "timestamp_updated": 1642829616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748625218868255615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69375585": {"recommendationid": "69375585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277659693", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3551, "last_played": 1589820692}, "language": "english", "review": "Short review: a rare gem!

You easily max them out, build / craft everything available, so they become repetitive and boring. Well, not this one. At least, much more playtime is needed to achieve that.\n- Great mechanics, wide variety of craftables.\n- AI system is pretty cool, including the hunters and widelife.\n- Seasons. Dude... wow! Environment and weather changing all the time, and seasons as well. Lakes / rivers freeze in winter and all that stuff. Amazing!\n- I just love how the map works. It's like a satelite image with a cool animation when you open it.\n\nCons:\n- Some bugs, but that's okay, it's an early access game. Not annoying too much.\n- I find AI hunters a bit OP. They never run out of bullets, they have a natural in-build aimbot in their genes, so it can be a bit tough to fight them.\n- Animals are too smart. If you attack predators, they run in zig-zags towards you. Like wtf? Even Rickon Stark can't do that.\n- Some craftables would need some balancing I think, as they are way too expensive compared to how useful they are.\n\nOverall, it's a great game!

It's an alpha.\n\nThe Good:\nThis is NOT a game you can \"beat\" easily or quickly. You WILL spend a lot of time wandering around, scavenging and chopping wood. You WILL spend nights huddled close to your fire and later wood heater. You WILL become a pro with a bow and arrow, or go hungry. You WILL celebrate each and every nail you find, early game.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe animals in this game as...brutal. And unrealistic. Wolves and bears are EVERYWHERE (far more than you'd ever expect) and will brutally murder you with every chance they get. You quickly learn to keep stamina handy for the many times you have to run for your life. Cougars are less frequent, but more deadly...yet plentiful in resource. Moose will straight up murder you if you don't kill them quickly. You'll get diseases from....everything. And they will kill you, keep a supply of antidote, splints and bandages on you at all times.\n\nI do hope the animal system is fixed. There are far too many and they don't really hunt you or react to your presence in any way except aggression. They're just....there. More as an obstacle.\n\nThe scavenging system needs work. Some resources can only be had from the random bags of stuff lying around. Early game, they're everywhere. Later, they become scarce and you'll find yourself sprinting towards one you see on the horizon, in vain hope of finding a few bits of electronics. And scrap metal is even worse. Seemingly rare from bags, you'll celebrate every random pile of metal you find. Overall, I'm just not a fan of the scavenging system. However, it is an alpha.\n\nPS - you get far more resources if you become adept at murdering hunters and rogues. Don't forget to raid their stashes and campfires. TAKE ALL THE THINGS MWHAHAHAHAHA.\nBut remember - they will seek revenge (if it is turned on).\n\nThis is not a 7 days to die type game. No zombies, duh, but also ammo is scarce and hard to manufacture. Keep your bullets and shells for hunters, rogues, deer/moose and emergencies. Wolves you can safely kill with a bit of dancing and your axe. Bears....leave alone unless you have plentiful ammo and/or like flirting with death.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, this is a good game. It is playable and enjoyable at this level of development, and seems to be getting regular updates.

I too was frustrated at first until I worked out the system. It is very difficult to make a survival game easy to get into because if the mechanics are too easy at the start those easy systems make the meat of the game a walk in the park and survival should never be about that. It is grindy, but survival is grindy, if life as a hunter gatherer was easy we'd still be doing it. \n\nThis game is by its very nature not one for those who look for a power trip from their gaming. You should run from wolves in a survival situation because trivial wounds can be life threatening and so those who want a game where you get to blow away the opposition should buy the latest COD and stop grizzling about a real survival game. What a joy it is to finally have a game that has a survival setting without zombies that really is tough. Every item, wall and floor is hard earned.\n\nThe game is still very much a work in progress but how refreshing it is to have a dev whose focus is on providing a workable game rather than a scatter gun approach of incomplete and poorly implimented ideas. Everything there works and is well executed. The building and crafting environments are beautifully executed, the woodburner is the finest item of its type in any game I've seen, just stunning. I really hope that seasons are implimented in due course so that I can really enjoy the atmosphere warming myself by the fire with snow piling up outside.\n\nIf you're looking for a 7DtD experience the go play 7DtD. If you want a decent survival game where the focus is on survival without the usual tired old tropes then do yourself a favour and fling the dev some dosh and watch this one blossom.  A proper survival game without the limitations of \"The Long Dark\" is long overdue and judging by the wise decisions evident in the compromises necessary in the early stages of Early Access this dev may well pull it off. Yes there are placeholder systems like the necessity for having lots of items provided in spawing loot containers, and yes the map is quite small, but these are smart choices to provide a workable game in the early stages of development.  Better these compromises than a bloated buggy mess and I find these choices reassuring from a dev.\n\nDon't be put off by the bad reviews, in fact some of the bad reviews I found reassuring as any game that appealed to some of the knuckle draggers who could barely parse a sentence and threw their toys out of the pram after 40 minutes would certainly not interest me. This game may be in the early stages of dvelopment but its more than playable for those who don't have the attention span of a goldfish and don't require instant gratification.

Crates include a miniscule amount of resources.\nSo you have to wander the map every game day.\nWandering the map is dangerous and stressful all the time unless you play on easy mode.\nNote easy mode does not reduce grind.  You still have to search for loot crates.\nTrees yield 3-5 wood.  Wood is important for everything but also is a limited resource.\nOres are gathered by spotting \"warts\" on rocks.  If you have a pickaxe you can collect a miniscule amount of ore per day.\nSpecial resources like pearls are found by diving.  Again an entire lake may only have 5 or so pearls.  But it takes a dozen pearls to be useful. \nYou can spend a pile of ammo and difficult to find resources and attack a bandit camp and not get back enough resources to pay for the raid. oh. and next day they raid you and you have to spend more ammo to defend yourself.\n\nThis game is a frustrating chore of spending each day gathering very limited resources. Fighting cold. Fighting hunger. Defending from animals.  Defending from bandits if enabled.\n\nWhen you do finally get some gain or progress in the game its so lacklustre you regret all the work it took to gain that item. For example you grind forever to get a simple bow to defend yourself but then the bow sucks pretty bad and the ammo for it requires, you guessed it, more grinding of precious nails.    \n\nThere are no creative or freeplay or experimental mode to test things out.  Do you really want to spend two real life days gathering resources to test out the atv only to find out its not so good?\n\nAnyway this could be a good game but Its way too time consuming.  If you read the discussions and discord you will find that this is intentional.  This game is not intended for the casual gamer or anyone who has kids or a family.   Its a massive time sink especially if you want to progress.\n\nNot recommended for casual gamers or people who like typical survival games.   Its misleading to lump this with the survival game genre.  Because its not well suited for typical casual players. Its more suited to people who have a lot of time and dedication.  Easy mode, (which i found to be too easy), only makes enemies and survival easier but there is still the daily grind to get 10 nails or spend all day diving to get 5 pearls. Turning off bandits is ok for learning the ropes but it gets boring and you still have to wait for resources to respawn.\n\nI would change my recommendation if the game added a \"weekend player\" mode where resources are not so hard to come by.  At least make more settings configurable and disable achievements like most recent games do. \n\nTLDR;\n\nAnyway this is not recommended for the person who is the casual gamer at this time.  Its recommended for people who have a lot of time and like a challenge and for the people who already have the game and love it.\n\n** edited to be less offensive.

For some inexplicable reason the developer, who is just one person, decided to make the game even more grindy. More difficult. It's not even realistic it's beyond realistic. You can shoot a bear in the face with a shotgun two times upgraded and the thing will still kill you. And then it's just miserable because all that time energy and effort that you spent getting your health up point by point very tediously all gets reset the moment you die. Why the hell do fruits and vegetables now decay, was that really necessary? Good luck finding any lock boxes or loot boxes they are so far and few between it's ridiculous. The hunters are not even enjoyable. You spend more ammo killing them than you get from their loots. You can wipe out a whole base and 12 hours later they're right back where they were and this time with rifles and flaming arrows, like if you wipe out a whole squad should there be a reprieve for some time period? Ohh and they can spot you from so far away I was on my map about I don't know 100 meters away and I saw the rifle shot go off and I got hit next thing you know I'm running for my life. Yeah they added an airplane that crashes, that's probably cool. Except I couldn't never find it and it wasn't on the map so I never got to loot it or do anything with that. I just don't understand why the game has to be so *** **** grindy. We only have one life to live and I mean our actual lives I don't wanna spend 12 hours running around looking on the ground for lock boxes just so I can then finally enjoy the game for 15 minutes it's just a bad setup uninstalling it at this point.\n\nI recommend this game... but very reluctantly. The reason being is the sheer tedious grind nature of it sucks the fun right out the window for me. It is a very fun game, progressing, looking back and seeing how far you've come. That is satisfying. However, the way you have to go about everything is just so painstakingly slow and cumbersome. For instance, in Terraria there is a button you can click which stacks everything in your inventory to all nearby chests which have that same item already. No such thing in this game. You have to manually go from chest to chest to chest and deposit everything properly which takes time. God forbid you can set the lights on your plant box to shut off during the daytime automatically - that would be convenient. When you take a drink of water, god forbid the canteen stay in the hotkey slot. That too would make it very convenient in order to fill back up. Nope, you must drag all 4 canteens back to the hotkey bar and repeat. What else is there.... oh yes, somethings are found so seldomly it begins to feel hopeless. Cotton, for instance. Also, you can play with or without hunters. I chose without. Why? Because they are nothing but a burden. Whatever you use to kill them with (ammo mainly) will be more costly then whatever piss poor loot you get from them. It is not much. Everything in the game that you build is in need of constant attention. Must manually feed the chickens, water said chickens. Fertilize the plants. Water the plants. Refuel the generators. Provide more fuel for the stove. Then for yourself you must eat a varied diet. Simple protein bars will not suffice. You must also find fruits and vegetables in addition to the protein source. Also, water is a must. But not just any water, it must be boiled if coming from the lake or streams which takes more time and manual attention. By the time you finish all your chores (and that is what they are, chores), you will have spent so much time that the very first thing you did is once again in need of more attention. That just SUCKS the fun from the game very very quickly. I don't know anybody who feels differently. If there was some automated processes that you could implement, it would make the game just so much more fun. The fun part is going out, killing some deadly beasts or hunters and farming precious materials all whilst staying alive and healthy enough to make it back to your hideout in one piece with said loot. Then spend a little while crafting materials into increasingly complex and fun gear. If you could, at this point in your game loop, not spend a huge amount of time taking care of all of the chores and just go back out to the world again, the game would be a slam dunk. Instead, you are constantly in a state of needing to do some chore or else all will go to shit - quickly. I understand the need to manually do somethings in order to balance the game in a sense... if the game consisted of an endless loop of....  1) Go kill beasts & hunters 2) Loot resources simultaneously 3) Make it back alive with loot 4) Craft increasingly complex and fun gear.... and repeat the process after step 4, the game would burn itself out quickly. As in the fun part would no longer be fun after a short time. The manual processes are the crucial balance to the fun portion, they allow you to have that fun in other words. So I am not advocating for the complete removal of them, but they need to be tuned down big time and streamlined where possible. It quickly ends up taking more time to do the chores than the exploring portion. Inevitably, that ends with me not spending much time on the game anymore because of that. \n\nI hope the Developer or whomever takes my review into consideration. Just make things a bit easier in some ways my friend. Start with the deposit all to nearby chests button. Then you can add right click options such as \"Fill all canteens with just a click, and you can fill them from your inventory instead of the pointless moving of them to your hotkey bar... twice.... just so you can drink. That is just an example and for those who have ever played the game it is very basic stuff and understood instantly. Other folks, the gist is simply I recommend a way which the chores can be made easier and streamlined. \n\n~~ Cheers ~~ I will update this happily (or not) as more updates come out.

I fully recommend this game to everyone.\nI would suggest that you buy the game to help back the developer up for creating this game so far and creating much more to come.\nThe price is definantly worth it !", "timestamp_created": 1478204316, "timestamp_updated": 1478204316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740128993988037109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55586965": {"recommendationid": "55586965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035283770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 13811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9792, "last_played": 1706229149}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to love this game, but now I can no longer say that I recommend it. The more the game advanced the harder it got. I was fine with the game being hard, the game is called subsistence after all. Instead of adding more late game equipment and new features to the game, every update adds new resources to gather in order to make the same end game items forcing the player to spend more than double the time to be put into making the same things. It is now nearly impossible to make any of the same items that used to be done within a few hours; now it takes a whole day just to make a solar panel because of all the scarce and obscure resources required. There is barley, if any at all, progress that is made in the game anymore. I understand that the game is being made by a single developer, but adding new resources so that it takes longer to make the same things is not truly adding more to the game. \n\nEdit: Somehow it has gotten worse. The game runs at a constant 17 fps. I used to run this game with around 60 fps when it came out, back when my PC was an absolute potato. I now have 32 gigs of ram and a 1080, there is no way it should be WORSE than before (this is on MINIMUM graphics). Every fight (even with wildlife) is laggy and makes it impossible to hit shots when your screen is freezing every tenth of a second. I am WAY over the minimum requirements to run this game now. If it hasn't been optimized withing the last 5 years, it's never going to be. \n\nI wanted to try this game again to see if if had been updated to be better. Sadly it has only been updated to be worse. Materials are harder to find, the game lags more, and as a continuation of before, things have gotten HARDER to make. They've also added a lot of things that really ruin the immersion of this game and trying to survive in the wilderness. All in all, I rate it \"not very good/10\" would not recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1570978833, "timestamp_updated": 1704300648, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737872064113616943", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98380651": {"recommendationid": "98380651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048908047", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 3232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2254, "last_played": 1631527745}, "language": "english", "review": "I just want to say that I respect the work of the creator and the fact that he makes this game alone.This game has potential. But there is one but... After the latest updates, I can conclude that the developer does not know what \"game balance\"is. I have compiled a short list of shortcomings for this game.\n- Spawn of wild animals, in order to find a chicken or a hare, you need to run through the floor of the map,while 3 bears and 2 wolves walk on 1 square meter. Of course, I am not an expert on the animal world, but in my opinion, bears can not be in one place in SUCH NUMBERS.\n- An abundance of resources. Here, in principle, the same situation as with the hares above, 3 pieces of wood fall from one tree(if my memory does not change), from which you can make one board(ONE KARL BOARD), besides everything else, fibers are needed for construction that need to be extracted from\" bushes\", which are necessary for the production of ropes. Plus, everything else requires nails for construction, which at first, you will have to find in boxes scattered in the forest. Unfortunately, in the process of searching, it seems that the place of action of the game is the late USSR (there is a capital shortage everywhere) and in order to build a 2-by-2 house alone, you need at best to kill half a day of real time(and this is without taking into account the fact that you will be killed by local fauna with 1-2 blows), not to mention something global, because the rest of the resources here are in the same deficit.Or hire 9 Chinese people on the kit starter so that they would extract resources on the server.\n- The behavior of weapons and the production of ammunition. Despite the fact that aiming at the target is sometimes (torn), that is, there is no smoothness in movement, plus everything else that would kill the AI bot \"often\" has to hit the head 2 times... This is not to mention the animals that have a titanium alloy body in the course(and I'm talking about a rifle now, not to mention a shotgun and a pistol that is weaker in terms of slaughter than a bow(what is the meaning of the existence of a pistol?) The production of cartridges is a separate problem, as for me, a more balanced ammunition is arrows for a bow. The rest, in reality, is easier to do than in this game.I do not know what the creator is guided by, indicating the amount of gunpowder per 1 shotgun cartridge, but as far as I know, even in 50 BMG ammunition, such an amount of gunpowder is not used(this is if the unit of gunpowder is converted into grams), despite the fact that the gunpowder itself is scarce like other components, for which you need to run half the map again and kill at least half a day.Here comes the phrase (it used to be better)\n- AI must be given credit, AI is well spelled out here, they hide well in shelters and shoot accurately, but the algorithm of their development reminds me of Stellaris, where in half an hour the opponent has 10,000 army and you barely scored 1,000.Just like here, the enemy runs around in bulletproof vests, helmets with a full arsenal at the fifth point and endless ammunition, while you are happy with the made T-shirt. Is it really impossible to slow down their development?\nAs a result, I repeat, the game has potential, I understand that the game on DX 9 is made by 1 person. I understand that the creator may be trying to create \"REALISM\" in the game, but looking back at the early versions of the game and looking at the current state of affairs, the balance in this game becomes more and more absurd.\n\n\u0421\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0443\u0432\u0430\u0436\u0430\u044e

The most obvious issue from day one is the amount of food that may be obtained from animals and the amount of resources needed to kill that animal. \n\nThe non-aggressive animals are pretty spot on. One (1) meat plus some extra items like feathers or cloth (not leather or hide?) Yup, the rabbits are made of cloth and the chickens have one (1) breast, not two (2). These small animals may be run down and caught or normally one arrow with kill or stun them. \n\nSide note: I play game where the horses would give you chicken meat, but you got more off it! This concept of larger animal = more meat will become the topic here.\n\nMoving up to wolves or deer, these take more arrows (resources) and time and they fight back! \n\nBut ya know what ya get? One (1) meat, maybe two (2). But wait! It is better meat! (It isn't that much better). And if you act now you can get a second one for free with shipping and handling.\n\nSo... Small animal - 1 arrow = 1 low grade meat (1). Ratio is 1 to 1. \nBut, Large animal - 5 arrows = 1 better meat (2) for sake of argument I will say its twice as good. Ratio is 5 to 2 . \n\nI expended more resources (and risked my life or took damage even) for less return. If they ever balance (improve) the food system, I will be back. But until then, as much as I hate to do it, I must shelve it for now.\n\nPostScript: I asked about this in the game Discord. According to them. It's Perfect. This is the way it should be.

The \"Subsistence\" part of the game lasts maybe one game day.  Once you get past the learning curve of avoiding the wild animals (bears and wild dogs in much greater concentrations than in real life), and learn to spot fiber plants, you will have beaten most of the challenge.  You can play with or without hunters who build their own bases, but once you have their number, they don't present any challenge either.  The map is pretty small, and the biomes not that diverse.\n\nCurrently the single dev uses boxes scattered around the landscape to supply most of the players needs.  He has said since the beginning of the game that the loot boxes are merely placeholders for his planned introduction of natural sources for the items within.  One of my main issues with this game, is just that, he says that he plans to replace placeholders, then doesn't.  He says that he doesn't plan on a militaristic game, then he adds grenades, grenade arrows, riot helmets, flak vests, and claymore mines.  All of these are made by the player from scraps of wood, metal, and assorted junk that you find in nature.  One of the main weapons in the early game is a pump shotgun made from; scrap metal, wooden boards, and cloth. \n\nAnother issue that I have with the game is something that he says in his introductory blurb, that as an early access game you can help with the development.  Not true.  He does not pay much attention to the community.  He seems to have a clique of you tubers whom he works with to introduce new content.  No one in the community asked for grenades, grenade arrows, the riot gear, or claymores, yet they appeared with updates.  People have asked for more natural threats, like seasons and weather, nothing.\n\nI am sorry to leave a negative review but I have lost confidence in the development of the game.  I enjoyed much of it when it was \"younger\" before the militaristic trend.  New updates add things that have not been requested by the community and are a mish-mash.  His attitude seems to be if he introduces something, he has to take away something else.  Examples of this are his addition of pole fishing and the new cougar animal.  For one thing, no one in a survival situation would spend hours fishing with a pole.  They would build a fish trap and do something else.  There is no option to build traps of any sort.  Moreover, you HAVE to fish to get fish oil which is used in making medical kits (previously made with medicinal plants), and antidotes for getting poisoned.  That is not a sandbox approach, since you HAVE to fish in order to make needed items.  The same \"logic\" applies to the cougar, it is the only animal that has sinew, which is needed to make more advanced equipment.\n\nI have over 1000 hours in the game, and enjoyed it while it looked like the dev was taking it in a \"subsistence\" direction.   Once he started dropping in seemingly random items (the latest update has an electric \"oven\" when we already have a woodburning heater that we could have used to cook with and a magical mining machine), not following through on his promises to reduce dependance on the loot boxes, and general ignoring of the input from the community, my faith in his game and development direction (if he has one) vanished.\n\nIf you are looking for a survival game, don't buy this one.  If you know what the definition of the word \"subsistence\" is and want a game that knows what that is, don't buy this game.  If you want a challenge, don't buy this game.  If you want a dev who listens to his customers and works with them to make a great early access game, don't buy this one.  \n\nIf you are looking for a game with non-logical and contrived threats, buy this game.  If you are looking for a game where the dev will introduce a new item and take away something that you have been depending on, buy this game.

Last thing he added was a wellhead to gather water. Big community wish. Very nice! :D\n\nOriginal:\nWow, I bought this game one day after official EA release. I am used to games like Nether, Ark, Forest and so on....\n\nWhat really caught my attention was the way weapon handling is animated (drawing the gun and reloading it feels just perfect!!! I like it to empty my mag and reload the gun :D) but besides that, it's the stuff you are able to build ... the way your house can look (you can build modern/curved wood huts, awesome). And most importantly: You can catch chickens and rabbits, feed them and raise them to gain better food or eggs, you can built generators to power your lights. You can make oil from animal's fat, craft better clothing and so on.\n\nThis game is developed by ONE guy. It's quite promising. For now, the game has some problems with random crashes, but after getting used to getting killed by wild wolfs and bears and figuring out how to survive, you may get the survival feel and want to - at least - craft everything once in game! \n\nAt first I died a lot, lost everything ... until now I am able to build my semi-base on the first ingame day! Its possible! (You have, as of now, 5 minutes to get to the place where you died, to retrieve your stuff! When you build your command unit, you also have a tracking point (beacon) on screen. After a while you get used to it, and know the world and can locate your corpse, at least if you are a real pathfinder :P).\n\nOh and beware! You are not alone, the bears and wolfs are not the only dangerous beings in the world of Subsistence! Computer controlled hunters (survivers like you) spawn after several days and start to do the same thing as you, build a base. And they are not nice upon contact! I still need to figure out the best tactics to stop them from breeding ... \n\nMultiplayer is in the making (there is a trailer showing multiplayer from a year ago!), but as of now, I don't really miss it, since most people are just damn annoying anyway (see Rust <.<).\n\nEarly Access, can recommend, promising, nice mechanics, and a good crafting system! Support one Guy, he is listening!\n\nIMPORTANT:\nWolfs and bears are pi**ed off, when you come too close. So they roar and focus on you! Time to get away, otherwise they will hunt you. You can avoid contact and getting killed knowing that! Sneaking is a helpful mechanic too! Some people don't seem to get it and complain about it. So always keep in mind, ammunition is sparse (found in backpacks all over the place, can also be crafted, having the right items, but never enough to dominate nature!) and the wildlife is pi**ed off, that you are there!

Updates every other month, lately. Sometimes substantial changes, sometimes QoL, sometimes just a bit of new content. It has improved since release. \n\nYeah, there's a bit of a grind. Its been reduced since launch but still not quite at the sweet spot. Doesn't seem as bad as some of the reviews make it seem, but everyone has a different idea of what a \"grind\" can be. \n\nLooting crates can get boring, but it gets me to explore the map, makes me vulnerable. Tunnel vision will get you killed, whether by hunter or animal. At least I have a reason to search around.\n\nAnimals. Yeah, there's a good amount. Another thing addressed in updates. Happy to see interaction between the hunters and the animals now, makes it feel a bit more alive. Animal aggro is pretty easy to control or avoid - there's a distinct animation and sound that plays when alerted vs aggro'd. A bear will first stand up on its hind legs and grunt. Back up slowly, he wont aggro. Wolves sniff the air. Back up slowly, no aggro. If they start slowly walking towards you? Walk away. Don't sprint everywhere and you wont get eaten. You can outrun anything assuming your sprint holds up. \n\nAnimal health? Yeah its actually stupid that chickens and rabbits take two pistol rounds. Create a bow. They only need one arrow, and you'll probably get that arrow back. Wolves and bears? Yeah, handgun could use a little bump, but there's other guns to craft. Ammo can be scarce, don't shoot everything you see, and you'll be fine. Hunt when prepared, run when necessary, sprinting everywhere will draw attention. \n\nIts not a perfect game, and I eventually get bored after the latest update and go back to other, more action-y titles until it receives another update, but its not a bad game. It scratches a survival game itch that crops up occasionally, without needing to be online, and I don't have many other titles that offer that.

For the first sight it may also seem that the game is easy and doesn't have really much content to offer, therefore the game experience can be quite poor, but that's not true. \nThe game has a different approach of the survival and building concept which I was used to. (I played with 7daystodie, Minecraft, Deadside, SpaceEngineers, Dont Starve Together)  So the game itself like every other survival game has its flaws and beauties, but in my opinion this game is quite close to the experience what you could get if you would try to survive in the wild in the real life. \n\nWhen I start a new survival game, I always watch it from different point of views to get the most proper insight whether it can give \"THE TRUE SURVIVING\" experience or not:\n1) How much statuses (like early, mid, lategame) it can offer and how long it takes to level up into these states and how long these can be extended to not to get bored? (like does it take 2-3 days of grinding to get into lategame or does it need like hundreds or even thousands hours)\n2) How complicated and satisfying the crafting, building, survival (wellness) and fighting system?\n3) How much content it has, before you get bored of it?\n4) How fair the game in terms of getting different resources (are there any items you'll always have to grind for, loot for, or in the end you can produce everything you need for staying healthy, safe and strong)?\n\nI play solo, with hunters on and 60 days takes a year, so like every season has 20 days, and the game is at standard difficulty level.\nWith these setups the game is quite challenging but also entertaining. I've got enough time to prepare for each season and also to enjoy them. The season system, which is quite rare in survival games (Ive met with it only in DST) is also giving some of new contents and options for you either to survive or die :).\n\n1)\nWell the game has 3 states at least: Early, Mid and Lategame. Based on my almost 90 hours of playing I can say that I'm still in mid game and I feel like I'm still miles away from the lategame, so the game itself is quite time consuming, but also entertaining. The early game is truly feels as it should be, you're weak and can easily die (for example in my first game I died at night, because I didnt get enough wood for the night and got frozen to death, in my second game by the day 30 I died almost 30 times), but even these expereiences didn't deter me to continue playing. In the midgame you are getting to certain point, where you can feel safe (got base, food, some ammo), and can't wait to see what the lategame brings.\n\n2)\nWell both the crafting and the building systems are ok, easy to learn and self explanatory. The wellness system is also okay, and the fighting system is not what you would expect from an FPS game, but to be honest, this game doesn't require it at all. It is perfect as it is.\n\n3)\nSo far, I am not finished with finding and trying every single content it can offer, so I can say it has enough to keep you busy for few hundreds of hours. Of course playing in a group, and knowing what you need to do exactly to get faster into mid and lategame, could decrease these hours, but rushing towards it you'd lose the time you'd usually spend on enjoying the game itself.\n\n4)\nWell not to spoil anything, you are able to get basicly every resource you need to develop both yourself (gear, food) and your base, but it takes really some time to get certain resources. But I feel like, these high tier materials are okay to be hard to find, because they are really valueable. Just one thing which i realised recently, this game won't be the game where you can craft thousands of ammo and start shooting into the air just because you're bored and full of ammo. =)\n\nAt last, lets not forget that, this game is developed by 1 guy only (as far as I know), which is quite impressive, so congrats man, well done, keep it up! \n\nLong story in short, I can definitely recommend the game solo or in co-op mode, either way you will have fun.\n------------------------------------------------\nAfter some more hours spent ingame, here is a little more detailed pros & cons about the game in my opinion:\nPart 1: https://steamcommunity.com/app/418030/discussions/2/3070866588605310375/\nPart 2:https://steamcommunity.com/app/418030/discussions/2/3070866588605315035/", "timestamp_created": 1616526197, "timestamp_updated": 1618422834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730815291404724121", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39690736": {"recommendationid": "39690736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003256777", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1517166646}, "language": "english", "review": "Every issue I've had with this game has already been outlined by others.\n\nThe Good:\n- Base parts snap together nicely.\n- Eating and drinking isn't a chore.  You don't have to eat half a cow and drink half a lake each day to fill your stomach.\n- Graphics are nice.  Nothing groundbreaking though.\n- Fishing.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Extremely grindy.\n- You are at the mercy of RNG loot crates for ceretain crafting components.\n- Weapons need a fix.  Two 9mm bullets to kill a rabit or chicken? Eight to kill a wolf?  Three head shots to kill a hunter?\n- Most craftables in the game take a rediculous amount of mats.\n- Hunters seem to have 100% accuracy and can hit you through trees and rocks.  I turned them off out of frustration.\n\nI understand what early access means, I don't need a refresher.  That beling said, the aforementtioned problems have been a point of complaint for many players for at least 6 months.  This leads me to believe that the dev has no intention of reworking the gun damage or cost of craftables, orhas prioritized other mechanics like adding fishing(ironically, the only fun part for me) and burning your food.

You are not spoiled with a good base right away, and I can appreciate this aspect.\nThe weather is amazing too, and I loved the heat/cold mechanics, makes things more immersive and that you gotta pay attention to the environment. \nThe fishing is good! The controls felt very natural and easy.\n\nThe Bad stuff\nI find it insanely obnoxious to find so many bears and wolves around. I'd prefer a LOT fewer, but when you do face them that the fight with them is more lasting than two bites-dead scenario. As much as you can run away from them, I personally want to feel like there is a chance to survive an attack, like level 1-2 wolves/bears can be scared away with noises. \n\nFishing Tackle: Can this item please get a durability and not just be a one time consumable? \nWater Flask: I'd enjoy to see the water flask also have durability  of its contents.\n\n\nThe reason why I dont recommend the game is simply that it feels a bit too empty. I personally play this game for the \"living in nature\" kind of deal. So I dont care much about the hunters and what they are about.\n\nBut I see this game have some hecking potential!\nI can see that this game would do amazing if it got advanced animal behaviours, like, very focused on hunter/gatherer/crafter/farmer then this is one I would quickly recommend to fellow survival lovers \n\nThings I could see work well in this game:\nBoat contents: net fishing, craw fishing, boat house, dock/peer.\nAnimals: Ducks/geese/turkeys\nAnimal behaviours: TheHunt Call of the Wild offers a good example on a few things that can make animals more interesting. That they live in groups, have feed and sleep areas and are active at certain hours in the days for example, and that you can have tools to lure an animal to you. \nI think this would SPECIFICALLY be a huge boost to this game and straightens out the current feel, at least the one I have, regarding hunting. \n\nThat is my review, hope it is of use.", "timestamp_created": 1598394303, "timestamp_updated": 1598394303, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730446159839630127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55504117": {"recommendationid": "55504117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254291397", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1069, "last_played": 1659143617}, "language": "english", "review": "I am now almost 18 hours in and so far I love this game.\nCons:\n1. It is early access\n2. It is a single developer\n3. It is very grindy (in a good way in my opinion - it is not to the level of Life is Feudal!)\n\nPros:\n1. It has great AI. Yes the animals are very dangerous (A wolf can 1-3 shot you while you take 5-6 pistol shots, 2-3 rifle) You're meant to avoid them early on. \n2. Base building is one of my favorite things in the game\n3. It has a good weather system and now it includes seasons that will present even more challenges to survive\n4. It has hunters that actually hunt you and your base which can be turned off\n5. The scenery is fantastic\n6. Gardening and Fishing as well as hunting is challenging and rewarding\n7. Archery is well done in this game. You stalk weaker prey such as chickens and rabbits. You can raise them and get better quality meat or eggs from the chickens or slaughter them right then and get meat/feathers/sometimes hides. \n8. Loot crates like Rust get you going early game\n9. Sound is useful. Animals will warn you of their intent to kill you. If you run around foolishly you will probably be eaten.\n\nAll-in-all this is one of the best indie games I have yet to play and I have played a ton of them.\n\nNOTE: If you want instant gratification you will not like this game. It's not for the feint of heart. Even building has built in limiters so you can't have a full base in a matter of hours. It is unforgiving right off the bat. You can and will starve on the very first night if you don't think about your circumstances and adapt to the situations that present themselves. \n\nEarly gameplay: Hard to get protein until you get bow and arrows. Look carefully at the terrain for blueberries, onions, carrots, etc. Dive into the ponds and pick up some kelp to eat. These will get you through your first night. Think ahead about fire materials as well. You get one free match, use it wisely. It gets very cold at night and all you have is some pants. Keep the fires burning. Don't worry about a base the first few days. Build up some materials. As soon as you build a base unit, the hunters will start spawning. Explore and gather. That's your focus.

I still play it to try and change my mind, but it's not great in it's current form. \n\nThe Good:\nThe map is plenty big and really quite beautiful. The seasons change and that's really amazing, I don't know any other game that does it. I like that there's separate protein/vegetable health bars to give a little more nutrition than you get in other games.\n\nNeutral: A lot of the crafting seems silly to me. It doesn't seem realistic to craft glass, much less guns, wood burning stoves. refridgerators, etc. It seems easier to craft a pistol than craft a shirt. I'm not really interested in hunters (enemy NPCs) so I just have them turned off, no opinion there.\n\nBad: Wolves and bears seem to be more numerous than prey animals, they are violently aggressive, and on patrol. The care packages randomly spawning (that you use to craft most stuff) is a bit immersion breaking as well. Food spoils in a single day and it's not filling.\n\nNow you may say, \"Hey go easy, this is on early access!\" I'd agree with that, except it doesn't seem to be making a ton of movement.

The gameplay is difficult but addictive and for an early access game there is more then enough to keep any hardcore survivor going for a very long time. As far as I know the game itself is being made by just one person and that fact alone knocks it up from a great game to an amazing game in my opinion. \n\nThe hunting can be really hard for an early game character but it does seem to get easier as you put in the hours, I will just say to keep the hunters turned off till your base and character are well prepared to deal with their very annoying and damaging attacks. Also never waste your ammo on small animals, use your bow for them and just run if you see a bear or cougar or you will become an instant dinner. Wolves can be deadly but after a couple of ingame days you should be able to face them, even if you have a really bad aim like myself. \n\nAs for food, keeping your vegies up is simple enough as long as you put in the time to get the berries till you find enough seeds to keep a nice planter fully stocked. Now meat is a different story completly, it spoils a little to quickly so I've found it best to cook and eat it as soon as you get it untill you can make a fridge. Also if you set up a base near water it's a good idea to build a little pier with a campfire to fish off at night, it can make keeping to a healthy diet a little easier if you can keep up with the need to find grubs (from the biggest trees). \n\nNow to the selling point of any game for me, the base building...............................The textures are fantastic and fit really well with the feel of the game but I do feel it is a tad expencive on resourses making the game really slow going for builders. So far the variety of things to build your base with is great, although I would like to see some railings to go up the stairs. Maybe a ladder and bridge type thing along with structural beems to add those all important finishing touches would be amazing and help with the creative side of building a base. So far I've not seen the option to build anything to help with defending your base which really does let the whole base set up down a little, more so if your going to be playing with hunters turned on while in singleplayer, so it would be nice to see that addressed in furture updates if possible. All that said I do really like the building options that are already in the game and look forward to seeing if this area will get a little extra love as the developer progresses with his no doubt already long list of things he's planning on adding and tweaking. \n\nOverall I am truly enjoying my experiance with this game and find it to be a refreshing change to the whole survival genre. It will be rather intresting to see just how the developer progresses with his already fantastic creation over time and I for one will be looking forward to future updates. \n\nFinally I would recommend this game to any and all survival gamers, it truly is worth it and whats more not a single zombie to be found :D :D :D \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1520971944, "timestamp_updated": 1520971944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725140631198883057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30845884": {"recommendationid": "30845884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030850051", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 11503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 833, "last_played": 1603060295}, "language": "english", "review": "well lets see. i play survival games with my wife. h1z1 7d2d etc. my wife found this game and bought it for us. at first i was wow the graffix is cool, but seems to be lacking in content. until i found out one guy, who has a regular job, is making this game. so i was like, hmmm. the started looking at the updates. and they come often!!! i am loving this game. so far i havent had a major bug or glitch, which is more than i can say for some multi dev games. this guy loves what he is doing and foes it in his spare time. which says alot since updates seem often. this is very playable and stable.( watch out for the bears) LOL. this game will only evolve into something you wish you could say you was there from the start!!!!! thank you @coldgames!!!!!! keep up the awesome work!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1490932028, "timestamp_updated": 1574864269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.72473984956741333", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89697590": {"recommendationid": "89697590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082169350", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5365, "last_played": 1663619209}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fantastic job for a sole developer, well done!\n\nThis game is one of the hardest ones to survive [based on my personal experience], so the reasons of people hating [or just not liking] it are quite clear. \n- Every resource is scarce, every bullet is valuable, and punishing for each mistake is very painful.\n- Getting resources (plus energy and base mass) for a device, upgrade, or sometimes even for a base bit, and finally installing it makes you feeling like a true hero.\n- Killing a single predator is not that easy, and hunters are absolute kicka...s!\n- Not to mention that hunting for particular resources, like sinew, is the whole quest itself...\n\nBUT this is exactly what makes it different from all other survival games [based on my personal experience].\nHere you have to learn how to survive step by step, each time paying a high price for your next piece of experience:\n- How to move slowly and carefully, only allowing yourself to sprint rather short distances.\nHow to kill wolves and deers using just arrows, avoiding temptation to make it quick and lose a couple of bullets.\n- How to use structures to hunt bears.\n- How to keep your food indicators at not maximum, but rather sufficient, level.\n- How to focus only on what's needed avoiding the rest...\n- Well, eventually, how not to rush\n\nYes, slow, and yes, grinding, but all your efforts are rewarding at the end of the day.\nJust learn how to play it instead of rushing, and you'll have a lot of fun!\n\nA bit about other beautiful aspects:\n- Lovely graphics\n- Seasons changing, with not just the temperature and weather, but the overall landscape changes! I like that the developer is paying attention to small details\n- Beautiful sky effects\n- Winter fishing\n...to cut it short, if you like the game, you will continue the list by yourself :)\n\n(just for reference and fair judgement of the above, I played 7D2D, ARK, Empyrion, The Forest, Conan Exiles, Green Hell, Valheim)", "timestamp_created": 1617536747, "timestamp_updated": 1617536747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724695384502410889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40932478": {"recommendationid": "40932478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209216132", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3237, "last_played": 1530042594}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the most interesting and hard choice making survival game ive ever played really makes me second guess my wants and needs in a heart beat.
