What may not resonate with one player could be a source of enjoyment for another.\n\nFor example, some players might appreciate the slow-paced exploration and the opportunity to immerse themselves in the post-apocalyptic world, even if it didn't resonate with me. Others might find satisfaction in the grind-heavy progression system, enjoying the sense of accomplishment that comes with leveling up and acquiring new gear, despite my own lack of enthusiasm for it.\n\nAdditionally, there are aspects of Will to Live Online that could potentially appeal to different gaming tastes. The game's crafting system, for instance, offers a degree of player creativity and customization that might be engaging for those who enjoy crafting and resource management mechanics.\n\nFurthermore, the community aspect of the game could greatly influence one's enjoyment. For some players, the opportunity to connect with others, join forces in challenging quests, or engage in player-versus-player combat might be the highlight of their gaming experience.\n\nIn conclusion, while Will to Live Online didn't personally captivate me, it's entirely possible that others could find enjoyment in its unique features and gameplay elements. Ultimately, gaming preferences are subjective, and what doesn't resonate with one player may hold great appeal for another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1712861557, "timestamp_updated": 1712861557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597315430641174316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163192533": {"recommendationid": "163192533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158842678", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 241, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1713287728}, "language": "english", "review": "Nobody will read my review, so I'll just say I'm gay\n", "timestamp_created": 1713561499, "timestamp_updated": 1713561499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578313231468200684", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161669394": {"recommendationid": "161669394", "author": {"steamid": "76561199523112498", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1713711711}, "language": "english", "review": "\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u280b\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2881\u2808\u28bb\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2803\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u2840\u282d\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u2804\u2880\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28f6\u2846\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2880\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u2804\u2804\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c7\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u2836\u2819\u28ff\u285f\u2821\u28f4\u28ff\u28fd\u28ff\u28e7\u2804\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28df\u28ed\u28fe\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28f6\u28f4\u28f6\u28ff\u28ff\u2884\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u28e9\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u284f\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f9\u284b\u2818\u2837\u28e6\u28c0\u28e0\u2876\u2801\u2808\u2801\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cd\u2803\u28f4\u28f6\u2854\u2812\u2804\u28e0\u2880\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2868\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2858\u283f\u28f7\u28ff\u283f\u281f\u2803\u2804\u2804\u28e0\u2847\u2808\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u281f\u280b\u2881\u28f7\u28e0\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28c0\u28e0\u28fe\u285f\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2809\u2819\u283b\n\u287f\u281f\u280b\u2801\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u286f\u2893\u28f4\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u285f\u28f7\u2804\u2839\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2801\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804", "timestamp_created": 1711650923, "timestamp_updated": 1711650923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569633960723876953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157633922": {"recommendationid": "157633922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345697726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 45442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 225, "playtime_at_review": 45442, "last_played": 1712636328}, "language": "english", "review": "It's been a wild ride!

Bad as in I've walked away from questgivers wondering what the hell it was they meant to have me do.\n\n[b]UPDATE: It's been a few days and a few hours since I wrote this review and I don't take so much as one single word back. In fact, I have since experienced interactions of equivalent quality and depth as the one originally portrayed in this review. That's 100% positive interactions with the community thus far. People will literally stop and ask you how they can help you if you're new. I'm now level 5 which makes me pretty new still but just knowing of the level 1-3 struggles makes me stop and offer my help and a handful of items every now and then, for the warmth embrace of it, if nothing else. We had fireworks in the starting safe zone last night. We've had a hardbass dance the other night as well. I've been escorted to somewhat dangerous places to complete some missions I was hesitating to do. I've been guided through bunkers so I could loot them and complete my map of the place. I've met people from my country who have a little more experience than I have and they gifted me tokens (in-game money). As I write this update, I just logged off a session in which a random level 33 player told me to message a dude cus they were recruiting for a clan. He suddenly gifted me 10k tokens, which is over twice the amount I had with me before. This is the most wholesome and mature experience I've ever had in an online game, period. I swear the game is awesome so far but the community makes it 2x better.

game[/h1]\n[u][b]pros :[/b][/u]\n- interesting concept a bit stalkery.\n- large maps. \n- decent craft system. \n- lots of monsters and quests.\n- 2 factions and faction war system.\n[u][b]cons :[/b][/u]\n- progression is painfully slow if you have a life this game is not for you.\n- players can't purchase faction equipment unless they join a clan that have faction arsenal perk unlocked and it takes countless hours of farming to do so.\n- endgame equipments are not available to purchase outside of the canyon outpost which is an outpost that you can capture during faction war so if your faction doesn't hold an outpost you have no access to endgame contents and equipments( can buy end game equipment from the new map but still its for factions and clans only if you are a neutral and doesn't like pvp drama you are gonna have to buy the weapons from a clan member that owns an outpost in either maps and you still cant wear the end game armor made for faction).\n- developers are working really hard to make this game pvp oriented which is not what the people usually play this kind of game for but the worst is they are doing this without even implemnting an anticheat system and this is being abused by entire clans in EU1 server and if you report it doesn't matter  because you are suppose to provide the evidence which is not possible bottom line is game is full of cheaters and nothing being done about it for at least 3 month at this point ( game now uses EAC it reduced the amount of cheater dramatically because it requires fancy cheats to bypass that).\n- broken class system , if you decide to play this game pick the mercenary class developers have a soft spot for it and they keep making it more and more op (i have all 4 classes).\n- clan system pvp requirements are unrealistic( this changed with the increase of active players ), but now there are server sided performance issues when large number of players are in the map.\n- pvp system is broken, you don't get the pvp points for your clan unless you walk into enemy position and loot their backpack which is not possible in most cases because spawn is fast and usually people will easily prevent you from doing so which forces people to resort to exploiting game mechanics to satisfy pvp requirements.\n- leaderboard is exploitable.\n- neutral players have no base, all new players spawn in confederation base which give one faction access to all new players which makes it harder of blacksunset faction to recruit people and allow one faction to demonize the other because they have access to new players and the other doesn't. \n- end game equipments and traders aren't accessible to neutrals at all.\n- limited monster spawn points at end game which makes it very difficult for people to progress and it seems developpers plans are to make it even slower by making a slower spawn system the last patch that is if your faction owns an outpost( it is worst now they even reduced spawn points more ) and even premium subscription is not enough to make things less time consuming again , not for people who have a life, premium makes it way easier to earn money tho.\n\n\nThat being said i still love this game at small sparse sessions after 1900+ hours, still easy to get burned out of this game when you are high level because of the crazy progression requirements and the repetitive grindy nature of this game and the the low variations of efficient leveling up techniques.", "timestamp_created": 1582323062, "timestamp_updated": 1623614855, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 181, "votes_funny": 27,

Do you know why? Because of all the cheaters. It's ridiculous how many chinese cheaters are on Europe2. There are 3 or so. As long as you don't do anything against cheaters, I won't recommend this game. You want your game to die quickly? This is the way to go. Install a god damn anti-cheat or I will quit too. I gave out much money for credits. Many of us quitted already and if you don't do anything against this you will lose more players. DO. SOMETHING.\nEdit: I am still playing(even though I shouldn't I just play it because one of my best friends doesn't want to change the server and start all over again). In the previous week, 4 new players made the decision to cheat on EU2. So now we are at 7 cheaters, ON ONE SERVER. Devs don't want to react to anything we send them. We've sent them videos of them shooting at us in the Canyon while a sandstorm was going on at a 300-500 meter range(this is impossible for a legit player). No reaction at all. They rather ban players who insult the cheaters. Yes, that happened to a friend of mine. If you would like to try this game out, go on any other server except for EU2. Trust me, it's a pain in the ***. I don't know if there are cheaters on other Europe servers but from what I've heard EU2 is by far the worst. All negative energy set aside tho, it's a good game and it definitely has a high addiction level if you like it in the first place. I don't recommend it because of the cheaters.

The early game consists of fetch and gather quests which are in all honesty quite boring. However, it opens up later at around I want to say level 10 where you start exploring the world more and more and you don't just get mercked immediately by a dog. \n\nThe first maps atmosphere is great, and the game from 10-16 gives the impression that it has a lot to offer. Exploring the world is fun, and unlocking new armor and weapons feels rewarding. The quests definitely feel like they waste your time with where they want you to go though, and the game doesn't explain well that there are teleports around the map to speed up travel times.\n\nat around level 16, you choose your faction. From what I saw on US1, the balance was absolutely horrendous in terms of who went to which faction, and if you choose one with a very small population you're basically going to risk getting farmed by high level players. I'll get to that later.\n\nAt this point, the sheer amount of grinding this game demands starts to rear its head, but you have experienced a very interesting world so far. You'll be farming fire spiders in a dead forest until you can get to the end game content which is pvp and the canyon. You will kill probably close to 500 of the same spider to get to the point where you can go to the canyon, as well as get your chitin armor.\n\nif you chose a faction that has no presence in canyon, you have very little options to farm and will be relentlessly hunted by the other faction in the canyon. If you chose the dominant faction, you will soon realize that everyone claims farming spots, and that this game has a poor party system and way of distributing experience to multiple players, so drama ensues. around this level 20 point, it would have taken you 1million xp. To get to 37 which will give you faction armor, you need 14 million. The way to level is to kill sun spiders, or if you're a tankier class, you kill matadors. The sun spiders give about 2000-4000 depending on your level, and matadors are about 3000-5000 with the odd level 3 one thrown in giving 15000. There is a high level matador to farm in a group, but again there is just the one optimal spot and people will always be farming it and bickering about who gets it. Divide that by 13million and you'll start to see how distressing the amount of grinding in this game  is. To hit level 40, you need 19.3m xp, and it goes up to 45 and gets exponentially worse. Quests are not worth it at all to do, anything not farming sun spiders or matadors is sub optimal and much worse.\n\nThe pvp in this game is not balanced. If you are not the same level, the amount of damage you do to enemy players is laughable. I have shot enemy players with the AS VAL- a weapon specifically designed for pvp with expensive ammo 4-6 times, and they have returned fire at me once or twice and killed me instantly. It's like playing with call of duty health vs someone from halo.\n\nOn top of that, the canyon itself is just for the most part a flat area, and snipers will one shot almost every class. The highest level miners can survive more than a hit, and sometimes a merc will at the same level as the sniper. Which is nice, except it's a literal desert and by the time you realize what's happening they just follow up with another shot from 300m away behind a rock. The less dominant faction basically just uses guerrilla tactics to attack the dominant faction out of spite or boredom, maybe both, so this will be a daily occurrence.\n\nIn this canyon there are two points, a north and south with the north point having better spots to farm. When you attack a base, you need someone who is an engineer to take care of this. You literally NEED this class with you to take down the shield and capture the point. While you are attacking it, it respawns you in a randomish location, but it's always in the same area. Both the attackers and defenders can spawn here, and you can kill someone, run to try to get to the base across the sahara desert, and that person can spawn behind you and then kill you.\n\nSo what are you left with? A game that feels really bad right at the start, hooks you, slowly dips you into a massive grind, and then the end game you're grinding towards is literally a mess and full of drama.\n\nI cannot suggest this game to anyone at this time. Maybe it will get better in the future, but the developer is not very clear about what direction they want to go with all of this and if it's working as intended or not. I have not been enjoying myself though and it's really unfortunate because it showed a lot of promise.\n\nedit: I continued playing until level 40 and max weapon proficiency to give it a fair chance and see if the end game was actually a secret diamond in the rough. I'll add more to what I found.\n\nOutside of the canyon there is 2 other end game zones, the coast and the exclusion zone.\n\nThe exclusion zone, if you've played STALKER the TLDR is it's an anomaly field. It's full of environmental hazards that either instantly kill you or do significant damage, and you can only bring a knife to this place. You loot artifacts (radioactive items used for clan leveling) and NDP stones and crystals (a resource for crafting and clan leveing) you detect with an NDP detector (think metal detector) and dig up with a shovel. It's a lot of jump puzzles, learning the map, and then just looting/digging. It's an anomaly field without the cool benefit of the artifacts actually giving you some kind of effect basically (in STALKER the artifacts were equippable and did things like regenerate life, reduce damage, etc- here they're just quest items or sellable.) It's hard for me to say something good or bad about this place, because it really depends on if you enjoy searching anomaly fields just to search them. It's not quite as varied or interesting as STALKER's anomaly fields but like, it's basically that.. so. \n\nThere is a zone within this place called the maze. It is literally a maze, there are enemies called listeners that listen to your footsteps or to things you throw and they need to be managed as such. There is more crystals and artifacts in here, but the main issue with this place is if you die you respawn in it, and there are horror stories of people getting completely stuck with no way out. I don't agree with that design choice. \n\nThe other area is called the coast. This is a forested map, and all of the enemies are more dangerous than anywhere else in the game and require a group. I will admit fighting the lurkers and toxic spiders here was fun. The NPC bandits are not fun to fight, they ADAD at sprint speeds and have aimbot accuracy. There is a town in this place that needs an event completed each day for it to be usable, the event itself is janky as hell. You basically start up a generator with fuel and some items, and then invisible symbionts (that humanoid looking thing in the icon on this steam page) spawn en masse and throw aimbot mortar rounds that explode and do a heavy amount of fire damage, something not easily removed. The whole fight feels really cheap due to this, and its in all honesty really janky. It lasts for about 30 minutes (give or take I only tried it twice and forgot) or until they demolish your group and destroy the generator. From what I saw, no one bothered doing this event on my server and the coast was a ghost town 90% of the time. When this event is done, the town is usable to either faction though and is neutral.\n\nThe end game is leveling up your clan by turning in fetch quests (like artifacts/crystals, but it includes kill quests and crafting items), killing event bosses that outside of symbiont (a unique boss that requires you interact with the environment to a small degree to kill) are largely something people cheese or are just bigger regular enemies, or pvping in canyon which i discussed.

An example is that a hunter can die in a few shots untill level 40, then at level 40 they die in 3. the engineer can die in a good 5-7 shots. the mercenary (my main class) is a little better at like 7-9 depending on build. but a miner it takes 13-15 shots to the chest. Thats nearly an entire mag form a end game weapon. a ballance is REALLY needed for guns too. a recent update made offclass guns pointless because off class weapons do less dmg now. before you couldn't get completely proficient with a weapon i.e fast reloads and little extra dmg ontop of slightly moer crit. The people are toxic, the community are full of cry babies if they dont get what they want IE following there \"rules\" you will be killed over and over. if you anoy one person expect to be shot in the back for your entire stay in the game. Its nothing like dayz or rust or tarkov. its much more rpg based. Theres almost no english speakers in any of the usa servers. its bug heaven. There needs to be some sort of moderation in the servers, right now you cant even get a hacker banned even with proof. oh yea hacks are a problem. The new anticheat dose almost nothing to stop hackers. I love this game but if you piss off someone without a job or sociallife your in for a ride. come home from work only to be shot in the back and have your potition given away by people in your same faction to there friends that are in the opposite faction. i am done with this game, i might play here and there but it has become a chore to fight literal children every day when i want to just check out the new area. Just do yourself a favor and avoid this game. untill theres some sort of moderation, every server is full of power hungry toxic teenagers and children. Dont play even on pve because theres no real pve in any servers.I am also aware this is a small team of people but even then there could be some sort of community effort to stop toxicity. I will happily change my review if there's some improvements but for now its a hard pass.\n\n*****sorry about the absent cons part, in my drunk ranting I forgot to bring it up before.

This game has become a complete shit show with hackers running rampant all over on every server. The anti-cheat system is complete garbage! You can contact DivisionByZero multiple times on Discord and provide recorded evidence of cheating but just like every other trash Russian development team they don't give a damn and won't do anything about it because they only care about making money from in-game purchases. This game is free and still not worth it. It was fun at first but each update breaks more than it fixes. If I knew than what I know now I never would have spent a dime on this game and I wish I could get my money back.\n\nUpdate Mar 23, 2022:\nI have continued to play this game on and off with friends who wanted to give this game a try in between playing other games. The lack of commitment and communication to this game by the developers is still quite clear. Also, with every major update by DivisionByZero it's clear their main focus is not how to create an enjoyable game but how to rip players off to generate revenue from micro-transactions.  An update to the game since my last update, introduced a new \"testing grounds\" area where crafted weapons can be created and modified to increase various gun specs. Unfortunately, applying a mod is %50 chance or less to work or results in breaking the gun and can no longer be used unless repaired. Even worse, the ONLY way to repair this gun is purchasing a repair kit from the in-game store as a microtransaction. So, if you have any chance of competing in this \"PVP\" game, you have to spend real currency. It took me 5 tries ( that means I had to purchase and use 4 repair kits) to successfully apply the damage mod.\n\nEach update introduces new sets of major bugs and breaks previously working mechanics. The toxicity within the game increases, largely to Chinese and cheaters, but 99% of reports through all mediums (in-game, email, social media, Discord) are either ignored or advised anti-cheat will pick it up; even after clear evidence is posted by numerous players. I am a very friendly and respectful player willing to help out just about anyone, unless you are toxic. That said, in early December 2021 after spending money, I had my account \"blocked\" and it took 3 months of constant communication attempts with DivisionByZero via email, social media and Discord to finally get  a response for claiming I violated 6.12 of EULA (abusive comments or slander). The only comments I ever made in the game I can consider \"abusive\" was telling the toxic Chinese off or constantly reporting them and cheaters via in-game reports over and over again month after month of them not being banned. One week later an alt account was blocked for the same exact reason shortly after spending money on in the game.

Typical user downloads this game, completes the training parkour and ends up in the first base. He/she sees one or two survivors around and quits the game, saying it is dead in the review. I am usually too lazy to review any game but for this one it was necessary because people are misleading others instead of encouraging. I am not brave enough to give an \"early access\" game goods and bads since bads are actually meant to be reported and fixed or remade. So, let's start.\n\nPositive (What makes the game worth playing):\n-One of its own genre, an MMOFPS based on a post-apocalyptic world with a really familiar design.\n-Unreal Engine 4, which means whatever it has now, it can be improved to a wide range of posibilites as features in time.\n-Good amount of servers based on the regions, so that you can choose your ping and language preferences.\n-Pretty well made representation of a post-apocalyptic world, just like in any related Russian literature of inspiration.\n-Well-constructed netcode, weapon ballistics, pricelists, item lists, map design (in terms of choosing areas and their sizes).\n\nNegative (What is needed to be improved):\n-Movements of mobs (rats, dogs, etc.): They have good reactions to world like standing up, looking around, roaming etc. However, sometimes it looks like they are sliding instead of walking (an imbalance between move speed and walking animations). Also, when they are shot, they should be knocked back or show a reaction of pain (as animation), otherwise it looks like player is shooting a statue attacking him.\n-Hitmarkers: I know for a big amount of players hit markers makes the game quite easy etc. However, it is a good idea to introduce the feature as an option for those who want it.\n-GUI needs to be improved significantly: Menus, inventory, equipment slots, market menus, etc. They are good and simple, yes, but they look outdated (similar to the games of 90s).\n-Quest Log: Being able to \"Set Active\" more than a single quest is a must. Otherwise, player finds himself going back to base million times for each quest just because he was not aware of the quests active in the same area.\n-Optimization: The developers are actually working on optimization, I have been playing the game just for some days and I see a quite improvement in the frame rate already. However, it should be improved much more, because game engine clearly supports it. So that, players with low systems can actually get a higher frame rate. And for an MMOFPS, this should be the case, instead of maxing out the graphics for a little but rich audience.\n-Bugs and Crashes: I did not witness many of them, the most critical one is that sometimes when you interact with a door, the loading screen pops up and goes away and nothing happens, you stay in the same map. To fix it, you need to disconnect from server and reconnect. Rarely, you randomly lose connection to the server and thrown into the main menu.\n-Character Movement: When some other keys are pressed during action, you can't use \"Shift\" again to sprint. You need to stop moving and everything, than walk again and press Shift again so that he sprints. Shift should be a more dominant key that works and doesn't conflict with any other key or action. Other thing is that, there are little walls, barriers, etc. that can easily be jumped on but can't. A little bit of parkour is always nice for a player in infected world.\n-Lights: Flashlights are too bright, they literally paint everything to white and you can barely see something when it is on. They should be almost half way less bright and a bit more wider range in the screen.\n\nPlease consider the game is in it's Alpha, yet. This means that developers are actually getting feedbacks and working on many things to improve the gameplay and the design. I honestly see a really valuable project going on here, but it is naturally taking time for a group of developers to fix and rearrange. I recommend everyone to play the game, advertise it if you can (because it is a bit hard to be seen around as much as I observed), give feedbacks anytime. And a request from high-level players, please try to make detailed and updated guides in English language.

When a player dies, they don't lose their character which is awesome, giving the game an RPG-feel which many survival games fail to give. Having different unique classes, experience points, skill points and talents also makes this game a bit different from other survival games that I've played. Still... bullets hurt and even the highest level players are not invincible gods.\n\nPros: \n+ The game is difficult to the point of frustration at times, making the game hardcore as hell.\n+ Gaining experience is slow, making high-end players really stand out from the noobs.\n+ There's a lot of different enemies with unique ways to deal with them\n+ There's a lot of items in the game. And by a lot I really mean that. \n+ There's a lot of different maps and even tho some section have loading screens between them, the whole experience feels somewhat seamless and doesn't bother me.\n+ There are two different factions and guilds (clans) and guild banks and auction houses just like in vanilla WoW.\n+ The community (at least on EU1) is pretty nice. People tend to not gank people who are just farming but if you get a bad reputation of doing something like that yourself, prepare to get punished! \n+ Which brings me to this: The game has \"friends and enemies\"-lists where you can add players, giving this somewhat realistic \"your actions have consequences\"-feel the the game. If you act mean towards others you will find yourself on the enemy-list of many while if you are nice, even the players of opposing faction will leave you alone. It's pretty satisfying to see someone who is on your list of enemies doing their own thing and just ganking them without mercy because that's what they did to you.\n+ The people can't swap servers too easily so you will start to remember the players on your own server, bringing this cool community feel to it all.\n+ Level ups give static bonuses too: Even tho the stamina and the carry weight seem small in the beginning, after some level ups the player starts running faster and can carry more and still not lose stamina that fast. It's just a matter of patience to get thru the most frustrating levels. \n+ The game has true personality and is somewhat weird and funny at times. I'd say it's a very unique game. Either you like it for this reason or you will hate it for this very same reason. \n+ Upon dying you can't lose your most valuable items like weapons, armour or night vision goggles etc. While the dying still hurts and you can lose a lot of valuable stuff, at least you don't lose your core items.\n+ There are teleporters that allow players to fast travel between certain spots, cutting the \"walking simulator\" aspect by half. This is also a thing new players usually don't know about, making the huge starter-map seem hopeless at first glance but trust me: It gets better!\n\nCons: \n- The same as part 1 in the \"pros\"-section. Sometimes the game is too hardcore to the point of frustration. I see this as both positive and negative thing. I enjoy hard games and they make each success feel that much more satisfying but at the same time, sometimes it's too much. You die, you walk back, you try to loot your corpse, and you die again, losing more, sometimes having to just give up on looting your lost items because the place where you died in the first place was too hard for you to manage.\n- The enemies respawn a bit too quickly without a warning while their corpses might disappear a bit too quickly without a warning. Killing a bunch of creeps that spawn on your ass might result in some lost loot because by the time you start looting, the first corpses might sometimes already start disappearing. One of my friends quit because he kept dying due to enemies spawning behind him while he was farming xp. This can be avoided by having smart positioning tho! \n- Respawn points are far and few. Dying in some areas means that you gotta walk for a long time to loot your lost items. Thankfully I play an engineer so I can set up my own respawn points for me and my friends!\n- Some places might seem a bit hollow and empty due to the game still being in alpha. Yet, at the same time there's a lot of weird small eastereggish places to be found, making the game a lot less hollow.\n- As a dev myself, I've noticed that the game is somewhat of an asset-swap, using some assets from Unreal Engine Marketplace but I give this a pass since making an MMO-type games isn't easy. I just hope these assets are proxies and not there to stay.\n- I have a monster-PC and still there's some FPS-issues from time to time. I can play most games in 4k with highest settings but this game somehow manages to be heavy for my GPU (amd). \n- It seems a bit hard sometimes to locate where some sounds are coming from.\n- The devs make a lot of mistakes when typing in English (some of the quest objectives are funny because of this but the same mistakes can be seen in patch notes too, making it all feel a bit 'unprofessional' at times. But I can forgive this since they are clearly not native English speakers (and neither am I but still...!) But on some weird level this is also a good thing... It gives this game some personality!\n- The hunter class seems way too much fun to play, having sniper-rifles as their primary weapons and being able to spot creatures in their minimap and stuff. It's not fun doing your own business and suddenly getting sniped from 300 meters away, only to get sniped again when you try to get back to your corpse. They have their weaknesses in caves and tunnels and other close-encounter-places but in wide areas they seem a bit OP (except maybe against miners who might be able to survive from their initial shots, giving them time to heal, hide and get to safety). But as an engineer I tend to feel hunters are somewhat OP. \n\nAll n' all: Considering I've played this game for 343 hours and I'm level 30 (max level is 45) and that I still enjoy playing it... I will give this game a solid 8/10. If all the cons were to be fixed this game would be closer to 10/10 for sure!

I will update my review as I progress further into the game but as of now, it's an enjoyable game with a few minor issues that can be easily overlooked. The graphics aren't the best but graphics are the least of my concerns. The gunplay is enjoyable and hunting mutants is a great time with friends and randoms!\n\nMy only request to the devs is to please add some more atmosphere to the game.

The best way I could describe this game is a mix between an Ego Shooter and World of Warcraft Classic. Now you might wonder why I mentioned \"Classic\" when referring to World of Warcraft. Whoever played World of Warcraft back in the day or the new released version of Classic knows that the game is really hard and has long paths to travel, that is exactly what you will meet in this game. Hard - Extreme hard gameplay with long travel distances. You will find yourself plenty of times in the situation where you don't know what to do for this specific quest or where to go for this quest or even where to find the quest item, it can be frustrating at times but just asking other players or watching videos/guides about it will do the job! It is definately worth it, don't get too frustrated when you can't finish the quest in the first try. This game is a grind from the beginning on. It really makes you uncomfortable while playing especially in some areas, you will hate the monsters, you will hate the environment sounds and you will feel scared the majority of the time. Make sure that you google for the \"Will To Live Online Teleport Map\", this will improve your gameplay by a ton. This game however is highly addictive in a way I haven't been addicted before. You really need a few hours to get into the game. I downloaded it at one night and uninstalled it the same night. Gave it another chance the next morning, it was a great choice! This is a game that has PVP and PVE, yet it does not feature your typical DayZ (or similar) PvP. The majority of the community in this game is really helpful and nice. But there are some bad boys out there who will kill you on sight (if you are on a pvp server). There is a lot more I could write about the game, especially all of the hidden stuff, things you can die from or the crazy amount of weird things in this game. It is far from being polished, animations and basically everything besides the gameplay feels really clunky, yet it has fantastic gameplay, which makes it well worth playing. I do not have an insane amount of hours but so far I can really recommend the game and can only say one thing: Give it a try for more than 30-60minutes, more like 2-5 hours, and if you are a fan of MMORPG's + Ego Shooters, the chances are high that you will like this game.

For a few reasons.\n\nThe Pros:\n1: F2P, not P2W at all. Microtransactions are just for obtaining skins / premium which is essentially a minor stat boost, you can get a majority of the items through grinding.\n2: One of the better communities if you play on EU/US servers, people there are quite friendly.\n3: A lot to explore with plenty of loot if you spend the time looking. Needs quite a bit of planning and critical thinking to get through certain areas or to navigate dangerous places. Danger is hinted with subtle but fair clues / cues, maybe don't walk into a barren patch of sand in the middle of a forest? There are bones around too.\n4: The game rewards grinding very generously, you get what you put the work and patience in for.\n5: Mutants / Monsters have special traits and effects that require strategy and gear planning to tackle, there is no single solution for every problem.\n6: VOIP that works, and works quite well.\n7: Sound in general is quite good, directional audio works as intended.\n\nSome Issues:\n\nGameplay: (A lot of bugs, but it is Early Access.)\n1: Movement feels sluggish, boring, and unoptimized. It is very hard to dodge attacks or get out of aggro range if you have high ping. (Even with 50+ ping on EU servers it is still an issue.)\n2: Gunplay does not feel smooth, very choppy. You won't even be getting a decent gun until lvl 8+.\n3: Hitreg is bad, very very bad.\n4: You cannot zoom into world map in certain instances and in certain safe zones, making it hard to plan and path for quests.\n5: Monsters / Mutants are either way too overlevelled for you to tackle or way too easy, there is hardly a middle ground.\n6: Monsters / Mutants are very very generic and repeated, there are a few well done ones that are genuinely scary, but most come off as goofy.\n7: Be prepared to get PK'ed a lot, especially when going to popular farming / looting spots and during a busy time of the day. Stick to PVE servers if you are not a fan of such interactions.\n8: AI Human NPC / Enemy is either stupid or Godlike Aimbot that will snipe you from a mile away with pinpoint accuracy, don't go in expecting smart AI that is fair to fight against.\n9: Death is not punishing at all, at worst you just lose some quest items and ammo.\n10: There is no anticheat.\n\nQuests:\n1: While there are different quests, it can be categorized into: Kill / Kill For Item Quests, Fetch Quests, Exploration Quests.)\n2: A lot of walking, without knowing the proper warps / teleport anomalies you will be walking a lot. Wiki and guides are your best friend.\n3: Quest descriptions are sometimes very confusing and requires very close attention to detail, even then some quest details are downright misleading.\n4: Progression is extremely, extremely slow, you will need a long time to get to late game, over a hundred hours without a doubt.\n5: Don't think of getting rich until you are mid-high level. Until then you will barely make enough to buy the basic stuff.\n\nGraphics:\n1: Very very mediocre, bad even. Models are basic and lack depth and detail.\n2: Guns look decent, but don't expect Tarkov level of detail.\n3: A lot of visual bugs, some that even impacts gameplay.\n4: UE4 does not mean better graphics.\n\nVerdict: \nPlay if you don't mind gameplay bugs, enjoy extreme grinding and walking long distances, and are a fan of Post-Apocalyptic games or the S.T.A.L.K.E.R Franchise. (think: Death Stranding) \n\nSkip if you are not a fan of putting in a lot of effort to grind, expect a AAA experience, or get angry at bad hitreg and ping.\n\nHopefully with further updates and polishing, perhaps some quest and area reworks, the game will be more bearable.

This game has become a complete dumpster fire of bugs and hackers running rampant all over on every server and major toxicity, 95% being Chinese players. The anti-cheat system is complete garbage! You can contact DivisionByZero over and over in-game, email and on Discord to provide recorded evidence of cheating but just like every other trash Russian development team they don't even care and won't do anything about it because they only care about making money from microtransactions.\n\nI have continued to play this game on and off with friends over a year who wanted to give this game a try in between playing other games. The lack of commitment and communication to this game by the developers is quite clear. With every major update by DivisionByZero it's clear their main focus is not how to create an enjoyable game but how to rip players off to generate revenue from micro-transactions.  A major update to the game that introduced the \"testing grounds\" area allowed crafted weapons to be created and modified to increase various gun specs. Unfortunately, applying a mod is %50 chance or less to work or results in breaking the gun and can no longer be used unless repaired. Even worse, the ONLY way to repair this gun is purchasing a repair kit from the in-game store as a microtransaction. So, if you have any chance of competing in this \"PVP\" game, you have to spend real currency. It took me 5 tries ( that means I had to purchase and use 4 repair kits) to successfully apply the damage mod.\n\nEach update introduces new sets of major bugs and breaks previously working mechanics. The toxicity within the game increases, largely to Chinese and cheaters, but 99% of reports through all mediums (in-game, email, social media, Discord) are either ignored or advised anti-cheat will pick it up; even after clear evidence is posted by numerous players. I am a very friendly and respectful player willing to help out just about anyone, unless you are toxic. That said, in early December 2021 after spending money, I had a primary account \"blocked\" and it took 3 months of constant communication attempts with DivisionByZero via email, social media and Discord to finally get  a response for claiming I violated 6.12 of EULA (abusive comments or slander). The only comments I ever made in the game I can consider \"abusive\" was telling the toxic Chinese off or constantly reporting them and cheaters via in-game reports over and over again month after month of them not being banned. One week later this account was blocked for the same exact reason shortly after spending money in the game. This is not a solo player's game and if you plan to try this game out, DO NOT waste your money on any micro-transactions!

The environment it is set into is inspired to nuclear post-apo classics, particulalry STALKER, and it has a very similar feeling to this legendary old game, as far as environment goes anyway. You will impersonate one of the many survivors, and try to make your way through the brutality of the wastelands, fighing monsters, animals and also other players. The RPG aspect of gameplay is very accentuated, with quests, damage numbers, level progression and skill trees all already present.\n\n===\n\n[h1] Gameplay Analysis [/h1]\n\n\n[b] General Gameplay [/b]\nThe gameplay of Will To Live Online is one of the most classic MMORPG experiences you can think of: talk with NPCs in cities and locations to take Quests from them, which will mostly be to fetch a determined number of items, explore a certain location, kill specific enemies or even Bosses in some cases. Then you come back to the quest giver and get your reward (XP and items) for completion. A tested system that gives little surprise but also works. \n\nAside from Quests, there obviously is Character Progression, every few levels you will get Skill points to upgrade your abilities; each character class (there are currently four) has its own Skill Tree and Attributes to develop, as well as determinate proeficencies with certain weapons. The game world is completely open, exception made for Safe Cities such as the starting one, that are isolated from the rest and need a transition zone to be traversed.\n\nThere are also utility functions already present such as creating groups with friends to see their location on the map at all times, minimap, a set of custom markers to put in location with descriptions, making overall a decent quality of life. Particular focus has been put in weapons and calibers, different types of ammo such as FMJ or HP will work more or less effectively depending on the target you are using them on.\n\nExploring the world freely without being tied to any quest is also a viable activity, but you will soon face enemies far beyond your levels and therefore be unable to progress without getting more experience, as in any MMORPG. Of course there also are markets to sell and buy equipment, and also gathering of rare and precious resources is an activity you can do if you know where the stuff spawns. I have seen no presence of a player market such as Auction House yet, maybe it will be implemented.\n\nThere is also a Faction system in place where players can join different factions and then be allies or enemies of other players of the same or another faction, receive faction-specific quests, rewards and gear from factions vendors.\n\nThere is a substantial amount of dialogues and script for quests with the various main NPCs you encounter, and that may also be interesting to read and know about the Zone and all that, the bad part is the English translation is just awful and more then a few sentences will make little sense, being spoken in broken English. This hopefully will be better in the future, but considering the game is originally in Russian, hopes are dim.\n\n\n[b] Combat System [/b]\nCombat in this game is mainly firearm based, even if Melee is very effective when it comes to that. There are various types of weapons such as Pistols, Assult Rifles, DMRs, Sniper Rifles and even explosives, most of them require not only money but also a minimal level to be used. The gunplay is quite basic and does not really give away a good feel, weapons feel clunky and a bit off, but that may vary from personal experience. \n\nBeing this an MMORPG Levels and Gear will have a heavy impact on the outcome of a fight, especially if it is PVP, but anyway i noticed weapons do a substantial amount of damage to Players as i have been able to kill players of several levels higher than me with just a pistol and some decent aiming. That may be less true for higher levels where armors and such become more powerful. \n\nFighing against monsters and animals is straightforward as mobs are divided in fields, atatcking one will NOT aggro the entire field, but only one at a time. This so far has been so, i don't know if there are special mobs that all attack together if provoked. Using long range weapons such as rifles is a very good idea agaisnt PVE enemies as they will probably be dead before they get in melee range, unless they are bosses, probably.\n\nIf you do die in combat you will lose some random items from your inventory, among the unequipped ones. These can also be quest items, so being dead is definitely NOT a good idea! You can go back to where you died to get back the stuff you dropped, unless some other player got there first and stole it, which definitely happens. Experience is not affected by death as far as i saw.\n\nYou can go to a PVE server if you are not interested in PVP, and that is a good alternative for some types of players.\n\n\n[b] Content [/b]\nCurrently there are 35 levels of experience to be progressed, that will take about... 100-125 hours to accomplish, as an estimate. There are multiple classes to be used and leveled, if one wishes to do multiple characters, and also multiple factions to join. Overall there is a good amount of content right now, if you do not mind the inherently repetitive nature of MMORPGs.\n\n\n[b] Balancing [/b]\nI have found no specific issues in balance itself, other than the problem with Safe Zones explained in the Combat section. I think however that Quest Items should be excluded from being dropped when dying.\n\n\n[b] Challenge [/b]\nThis game is challenging as any MMORPG can be, levels and equip are all that matters iN PVE, aiming and skill count in PVP a little more than in other MMORPGs maybe, and that is good.\n\n===\n\n[h1] Technical Analysis [/h1]\n\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\nDespite using the modern and powerul Unreal Engine 4, graphics are very underwhelming and seem to date back many years from the current industry standards. Some aspects of them are up-to-par like Shadows and some Textures, but prop models, meshes and environments are not up to par most of the time, but of low quality instead. Models of enemies and characters are alright i guess. This inconsistency in quality does not help to enjoy the atmosphere of the Zone.\n\n[b] Sound [/b]\nThe sound system is of average quality and feature, it did not impress me save for when i noticed there are different sounds based upon whether you are in a closed environment or in an open one, like weapons sounding a bit different when shooting in such coditions, that is appreciable but everything else is just average and unworthy of note.\n\n[b] Performance [/b]\nNo issues to report.\n\n[b] Stability [/b]\nNo issues to report.\n\n[b] AI [/b]\nEnemy AI is what you would expect from an MMORPG, so a chase and attack type of AI with little else.\n\n[b] Quality of Life [/b]\nNothing to report.\n\n[b] Bugs / Issues [/b]\nN/A (Early Access)", "timestamp_created": 1523201672, "timestamp_updated": 1523549141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687099277973175049", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41730511": {"recommendationid": "41730511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080828817", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4954, "last_played": 1528139474}, "language": "english", "review": "Ignore the people who've played 0.4hrs of the game and given it a bad review.

Although most of the gameplay is quest related it's the interaction with other players that makes this game so much fun to play. Minning coal in a deep mine does not sound exiting, but when you do it with a random Polish guy you met and he has the tendency to screams like a girl at every sound he hears it makes it so much more fun. And I think that's what has kept me playing. The interaction with other players that I haven't experienced on a game like this since Dayz mod. There is always a chance of being shot, but there is also a chance of a good adventure if you take the chance to talk to someone. So to sum it up. Yes it's early access and a bit buggy. Yes it is quest orientated and that may not be everyones cup of tea. But the player interaction and a chance to explore a creepy post apocalypse world is great.

And boy was I wrong! Considering I am a big Metro / S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fan,  from the first moments of gameplay, I felt right at home.\n\nFirstl of all, as someone who's been to the Ukraine before, I immediately admired the authenticity of post-Soviet era surroundings.\n\nGameplay felt good and graphics were pretty. Well, almost pretty. The character models and animations looked pretty crappy and unpolished and character creation seemed pretty bad. However, given this game is in its Alpha state, I have good hopes for the developers to introduce better models, animations and a more feature-rich character creator. \n\nAllow me to go more in depth and start with the pros.\n\nAt first, I thought there was WAY too much grind involved to level, earn tokens and skill points. Yes, there is a skill point system in the game. This system allows you to invest skill points in different aspects of your character, such as combat boosts, XP boosts, tech, etc. There is also a stat system (kind of resembling the EvE Online character attributes), which allows you to redistribute your character's stats as you see fit for your current task(s).\n\nRunning around for a few hours doing mushroom and rat quests seemed extremely boring in the first few hours into the game. However, all of this boredom ceased to exist when I met a higher level player and they gave me some excellent tips. Following those tips made the game lots more fun and enjoyable! I enjoyed scavenging and the crafting system, which allowed me to make a few thousand tokens in a few hours by scavenginng materials and crafting items that players use and then selling  those items to players via the in-game auction. You can sell mostly anything you loot or craft there to make coin.\n\nNext, the high-level player I mentioned earlier told me about the two factions, how they PvP each other, the tactics involved, and etc. This game is ZERO pay2win, which means that if your group/faction wants something, you must prepare and have different classes on the field ready to rock. After following said player around for a bit, I was able to witness it for myself, and I can't wait to get to endgame!\n\nThe game map seemed endless, even in its current iteration. We've ran around on foot forever! There's LOTS of places to go to, things to do and stuff to kill and loot. The game even has proper dungeons, mines, underground labs and military installations which require a solid group to take. Much like in most MMO these days.\n\nThe monsters were tough. You really need to watch your health, ammo and food/water supply in this game or they will kill you in a heartbeat. Also, be careful making noise or killing a mob that's located somewhat close to a pack of mobs of the same kind. It will call in reinforcements and if you aren't out of there by the time they arrive, you better be prepared to fight.\n\nNow, onto the cons.\n\nThe UI is somewhat spartan and dull.\n\nThe combat system seemed nice. However, shooting a monster doesn't so anything besides show you a damage number, until it dies. Sure enough, it's a thing in most modern MMOs, but it would be nice to have the target twitch or animate when you shoot it in a leg or torso, for example. That would make this game truly stand out, in my opinion.\n\nThe monster AI in this game can be easily bugged. For example, shooting mobs even from a slightly elevated position such as from the top of an automobile makes them run around wondering how to get to you. Dogs and stuff like this should be able to jump on top easily and attack you there, yet they do not.\n\nFinally, English translation in Will To Live Online is somewhere between the Google-translate and high-school English level. In fact, I think they Google-translated the game first, and then had a high-school English student correct the words that made absolutely no sense. Guys, you can seriously just ask me and I will properly translate it for you. I'm fluent in both Russian and English ;)\n\nIn conclusion, I'll give this game a solid 8/10 in its current iteration, taking into account the pros and cons I've mentioned in this review. This game very closely resembles S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and somehow even Fallen Earth, but with modern graphics.\n\nP.S. I dare you to play this in a dark room, when it's night time in the game world, with Gamma settings adjusted to your environment and while wearing your headphones.

Yes, there are alot of fetch quests, but if you activate all quests, that you can, before you set out, you can do many quests together and not do all of the running around, returning to places over and over. You'll still have to return, but with lower frequency. \n\nIf you are a fan of STALKER, know what EA actually means, want to support a fun game and good developers, don't hesitate and certainly don't listen to reviewers that obviously don't have a damn clue about what an EA game is.\n\nOh, it's worth noting that there are currently people working on correcting the translations. People are making a big deal out of the translations and recommending Google translator. They have obviously never used Google translator. If you do, you get the translations as they are in the game. They probably DID use Google translate and that's why it's bad, ATM. You won't have any problems understanding what your quest is. It works, but like I said, there are several people working on fixing it.\n\nAs others have stated, this is, by FAR, the best online STALKER clone around. It's lightyears ahead of any of the other STALKER clones.

Really Bad\n\nThis game was fun for a while. It has a very unique style to it, although it is a clone of stalker, I have never really played a survival game like this. the game has a lot of potential. but is sadly shadowed by its common imperfections.\n\n the first thing I ran into was the whole \"games as a service\" which is understandable, the game is free. But it takes 500,000 tokens to create a clan. That is $70 usd...To make a clan..yeah.. it doesn't have pay to win elements. more or less just short cuts if you pay. (No level increasing or damage increases can be bought) Im actually a fan of most games as a service type deals, since i get to play the game and actually decide if the developers put time into making and enjoyable game. and if they did, then I have no problem dishing out money for a game I will continue to play.\n\nThe other thing..Is the map. it is HUGE, and there are even other maps to play on once you further progress (which is a whole other problem ATM) I will never understand why developers insist on making big maps, it's a waste of time. I want to play a video game, down time is not fun. there are no vehicles, there is no fast travel. there are hidden teleports on the map, but they are only one way. So you can get down to the bottom of the map in 2 minutes, but it's gonna take a year to walk your sorry butt back up. And if you die?? you get sent back to the last safe zone you where at. so have fun walking everywhere with a dayz sized map. \n\nThe enemies. ya need more, than just rats.. and dogs.. One of the biggest turning points to me were the enemies, it isn't a zombie game. so it immediately gets bonus points for that. If I could tell the developers one thing, I would say take the scary monsters and RUN with it!!!! God, I wish developers now a days had common sense. Make this open, empty, map. into something crazyyy. Fill it monsters that hunt you in the dark, other weirdly looking creatures. make them abundant. And make them unique. PLEASE, I would pay a subscription to this game , if just fixed the element that the map is empty, and the monsters arent really anything special. Add event bosses, hidden areas, Raid a watcher nest. do something that makes it worth it and make it easy and accessible. There is no reason I need to spend 80 hours playing this game to get to level 30 to start having a little bit of fun. And dont argue that its a free game, when you are charging us 70 bucks to make a clan\n\nI know it seems like im talking a lot of crap about this game, but it is worth the play. it really is. it kept me interested in a weeks worth of grinding, so id say it is defiantly worth the free price tag. it truly is a good game and with a little work it could be a best seller.

There are anomalies in this game but only like 10, and only 2 of those are actually a real danger (and they are also rare and off the beaten path). This game is extremely lacking in monster variety and lacks any cool or scary enemies like the controller. In fact around 80% of the enemies in this game are some kind of mutated spider/bug. I am 100% serious, to level up fast you will be grinding spiders the entire time. \n\nOk well PVE is cringe what about the PVP? Isn't it good? No you fool, its terrible. TTK in this game is beyond low, in fact you will die in one hit the majority of the time in PVP. Overall PVP is pointless, there is barely any penalty for death so killing anyone will just result in them respawning a short distance away then circling around and oneshotting you while you kill PVE (if you are trying to clear out other players to get better xp gains). The community perception of PVP is also abyssmal, they are all carebears and act like killing someone outside of canyon is the same as killing them in real life. At level 20 you unlock the canyon which is basically the endgame of will to live online. Don't be fooled, your effectiveness at level 20 is a complete joke, you will need to hit 35 to become truly useful by unlocking the L96 sniper which oneshots all but the tankiest builds. The Canyon is 98% open space with hills and snipers are king so put that shitty shotgun back in the cuckshed where it belongs. USA server population is shit, you will be seeing the same 20 people constantly. Its also very P2W, you can straight up buy ingame currency for real life cash, this is on top of the $15 a month premium. Also for some reason this game has like 15 different servers even though the population is small as hell, so enjoy seeing the same 20 people every day.\n\ntl;dr\nA boring PVE focused looter shooter with insane grind that touts PVP as a feature but completely fails to deliver a meaningful PVP experience.

The game is still in early access, and it has got a lot of potential. I know it's just an indie game and not some Triple A studio working on the game, so I won't be a dick because I respect the developer team. But let's get to the review, shall we? So the good parts of the game are a large open world with a lot of cities, towns, farms, caves... The game has a lot of guns and items to use to kill the mutants and radioactive monsters. The graphics are great for a Unity game. The day and night cycle is also good. It's a good mix of an S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game and some horror survival game and a little bit of outlast and DayZ. At the sanatorium Forest Fairy Tail at night the first time me and a few friends got\u00a0 there we shitted our pants. The location has got a lot of Outlast vibes, and it's a must-see location in the game. The game has a lot of smaller maps, but are also good to explore and learn the lore. The little maps are as follows: Swamp, Canyon, Dead\u00a0Forest, Exclusion\u00a0Zone, PVP Arena, The\u00a0Bunker, The MTE and the abandon cargo ship. The main map Called\u00a0 Solnechny Outskirts has 5 main regions. In those regions you can find safe zones, exclusion zones, traders, new mobs, factions... So the regions are as follows: The north Region, The west Region, The east region, the south region and the center Region.The north Region is the start Region where you spawn and do the main missions, it has a lot of forests and bogs, it has the easiest enemies to kill and an easy way to loot stuff. It is the home to SOLAR CITY, the first safe zone you find, and it's controlled by the Confederation aka the good guys. The central Region it's the region in the middle of the map and it's the home of the Anomalies and the MINE safe zone. The MINE safe zone is controlled by the miners. In this zone you can make quick money by mining and selling. The West Region is the most abandoned and the smallest. It just has one small Safe zone in a town and that's it. It has a lot of exclusion zones, so a gas mask is needed. The South Region is the sea region. It is at the sea, and it has a lot of caves and One big safe zone controlled by the PMC. In this region you can find a fisherman that can take you to a lot of the small maps. The East Region is the deadliest of them all, and it's the territory of the BLACK SUN. The bad guys, but you can side with them at the end. It is set in the desert, and in the desert is the Black sun's base. There is also a metro area, but at the time of writing this review, I don't know where it is. Now for the bad parts of the game. The game is a girndfest you need to grind the whole day to get one item you want or need for a quest. You also need a good PC to run this because it's not the best optimization. The monsters are just too overpowered and strong. The weapons are sealed behind a level and skill. You need to be at lest level 20 to teleport from a place to place, and that's some bullshit. Because of the players that are below level 20 they need to walk 3 hours to one side of the map hoping that something doesn't kill them. They finally add a vehicle to the game, so we can drive it, but It's too fucking\u00a0 expensive. It also has microtransactions. Now let's go to the myths and leakd stuff that will come to the game. Base building, a train, so you can travel from one side of the map to another in just 10 mins, more zones, a nuclear reactor, a metro system as from the metro games with you needing to explore the tunnels and find new stuff.no loading screens... Ok so now that we are at the end of the review I will tell my experience from this game. Its a fun game and fun with friends. I remember that my friend Fabio and I needed to go save my friend karlo from the swamp because\u00a0 we did go on an expedition to the swamp across the map and its was hell of fun, but he got stuck, and the operation lasted a total of 2 days. We still joke about it every time Me Fabio and Karlo are at a party of just hanging out on discord or in real life. The second-best experience was when in Croatia we had online school and me and my two friends Niko and Roko were just playing the fuck out of the game whilst the math teacher was doing lessons, and we were playing for about 3 months with non-stop while we were on the Team's call. We were playing it from April all the way to June. And the last best experience of this game I already told at the beginning of this review about the sanatorium.\u00a0\n\nThanks to anyone who was kind enough to listen to this crap, what I was typing for about an hour.\nMany thanks and I will fully support the will to live developers.\n\nThanks\u00a0\nNiko", "timestamp_created": 1631957600, "timestamp_updated": 1631957600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664789557456970215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76627907": {"recommendationid": "76627907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299561551", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1601548771}, "language": "english", "review": "NPC with chinese name killed me 14x times by onetapping me nice", "timestamp_created": 1601165336, "timestamp_updated": 1601165336, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664696931838989258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131438322": {"recommendationid": "131438322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000471086", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1674638695}, "language": "english", "review": "Micro-transactions !!

A lot of these games are either mobile ports done poorly, WoW ripoffs, and occasionally have really good concepts that are poorly executed. However, I occasionally uncover a hidden gem. Will to Live Online falls in that category.\n\nEver since the disappointment of Fallout 76 (haven't tried it to see if it has improved, but it was pretty mediocre at launch) and Fallen Earth has closed down, I have wanted a post-apocalyptic MMORPG with a similar style to the Fallout 3 / New Vegas games, yet with much better combat than Fallen Earth. Will to Live Online's gunplay is a bit mediocre, but for an MMORPG -- it's quite good -- and it definitely has more of a visceral feeling than Fallen Earth. The landscapes and location of mobs makes traveling anywhere feel legitimately dangerous (and it is, especially at low levels). The crafting system is both intuitive enough for a relative noob to utilize but offers enough options to satiate a more seasoned gamer's wants.\n\nDespite being in alpha, the game runs relatively smoothly and there's sufficient content for both gamers interested in both PvE and PvP gameplay. The world, while still requiring some more work, is becoming a place that feels like a living, breathing virtual world. The inclusion of voice chat as an option helps with immersion, especially given the player community has been a decent crowd in my experience.\n\nDefinitely check this title out. Perhaps my opinion will change at the 20 hour mark, but 10 hours in -- it's one of my top 20 MMORPG experiences of all-time.", "timestamp_created": 1599702729, "timestamp_updated": 1599702729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659741699695587158", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 19, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 2443, "total_negative": 1183, "total_reviews": 3626}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwFHBn6px+wE": "Mon Apr 22 23:48:39 2024"}}
