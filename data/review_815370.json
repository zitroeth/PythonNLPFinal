And that's what Green Hell is.  The promise of a survival crafting game where you can test things out and put your deductive skills and gaming talent to work to survive and build a cool base etc etc. But you'll feel gutted when you realize that was never the point. You WILL end up googling all the answers because none of them are provided and figuring them out requires either the luck or patience of a deity.

I did know however that this game is known to be challenging, so i decided to take it at the standard difficulty level.\n\nThis is a game of trial and error while suffering from an increasingly unforgiving health mechanic that means that even if you know what you are supposed to do, it is a huge amount of effort to do it and will be interrupted by fainting several times. For example, in my first 80 minutes of play, I was beginning to get thirsty. I was near a river so I thought I should make a fire and gather the materials required to purify water. \n\nThe issue is that while just trying to find enough materials to make a fire, my character passed out four times and this drains your health and stamina so it becomes a shorter timer to passing-out each time. It isn't hard, it is irritating. I wouldn't even go as far to say frustrating or challenging. I just rolled my eyes and quit the game. I am not going to subject myself to this when there are far better games out there. \n\nIt also isn't helped by the fact that the building, crafting, item using etc are all done in multiple different ways. Like some items are crafted by selecting it in your notebook, then placing down a small ghost-form version which is used to input materials, but other ones are done in a 'crafting menu'. Back to my fire example. First you need to get a plank and a stick, then go to your menu and hit craft, then make a hand drill. Then you need to go into your notebook and select 'small fire' then you will place the ghost-fire (think subnautica) then insert the required materials into the ghost fire until it is built. BUT WAIT, you only built a pile of sticks. You also need to have dry leaves collected. Now you need to open your backpack and find the hand drill (which looks almost indiscernible from the plank, but i digress) and right click it and choose 'use'.  One you have the hand drill out, you then re-open your backpack and open drag-and-drop the tinder from your backpack onto the hand drill that you are operating. Then your will make an ember. One you have the ember, you have to bring it to the pile of sticks and choose 'use'.

For all of the cool building and crafting it has, I feel like I'm being punished for playing half the time.\r\n\r\nAt least fix co-op bugs that have existed for years (still can't start a fire and have your friend cook consistently) and decide how you're doing item drop on death.

The cinematic breaks the game rhythms, same for the zone transition (fade to black loading). While I like the inventory UI, the inventory/weight management is a bit tedious with no way to improve it. And the survival aspect becomes REALLY repetitive, you won't be making an elaborate camp, not in story mode anyway. You'll build the same 2-3 things every hour or so to be able to save. The journal with the blueprints is a bit wonky, I always end up searching longer than it should for basic stuff. The predators don't care if there is an easy prey around, you will always be their first option. Don't worry, they are easy to kill and spot. It's super easy to miss what you need for the good ending, like really really easy and it's really not clear what the solution is either (had to check online).", "timestamp_created": 1713203306, "timestamp_updated": 1713203306, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525621533393859863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163363225": {"recommendationid": "163363225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198846960406", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2488, "last_played": 1674712151}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game with high replayability.

Survival Mode is a ton of fun to just see how long you can last and what all you can build.\n\nAs for the survival aspect, this is the only game I've seen where macronutrients are important. It isn't just \"eat any food and it gives +10 to nutrition\". You need to care about your carbohydrate, protein and fat intake as well as fluid balance. A real challenge is trying to run a plant based diet to obtain the achievement, as just like in real life, you end up violently weak, always tired, terrible health stats and existing is terrible. The only unrealistic part of the plant based gameplay is you are unable to contact people to inform them of how superior to them you truly are while you're withering away to dust. Be a man, eat animals and make bone broth from what's left.\n\nFun fact: If you're playing online and make a meat soup, it does not show what the meat is made of. Thus, if you make human meat soup and your buddy isn't aware of this and consumes it, he's in for a real treat.

The tutorial is not even enough to cover the basics, and you will need to look things up on the wiki, or try to figure them out on your own if you like some challenge. Even the easiest difficulty is kind of hard. You may not have to worry about predatory animals and tribe members attacking you, but nutrient depletion and disease are still big issues. You will need to stray from your destination to build a bed and save point so that you don't keep fainting from fatigue or hunger/thirst, several times. The story modes, (normal story and spirits of amazonia), are really time consuming and impossible without looking up the locations online. My friend and I found ourselves on the verge of arguing with each other multiple times trying to finish the story. \nMy only complaints are that: \na) the game seems to be poorly optimized. On highest settings, my gpu reaches 100 degrees C, and although that is considered on the normal side for AMD GPUs, I dont feel good seeing it. On medium settings, the graphics look like absolute buttocks.\nb) The game is basically obligatory multiplayer, so, if you dont have friends, forget about playing. You may be able to do some of the Challenges alone, but storymode and survival, EVEN on easy, are just too hard for one person. Multiplayer games are great, but obligate multiplayer games are rather discriminatory towards people that dont have a readily available friend group to play with. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1712091796, "timestamp_updated": 1712091796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162016559": {"recommendationid": "162016559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295554773", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "playtime_at_review": 1250, "last_played": 1713420898}, "language": "english", "review": "JUST GO AND SURVIVE!", "timestamp_created": 1712053733, "timestamp_updated": 1712330549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161954463": {"recommendationid": "161954463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198887839951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5029, "last_played": 1712260771}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanna say, after more than 80 hrs i still find it fun to play, specially with friends, this game is way more realistic than many other games i played, you always gotta be careful and make a good shelter to survive the jungle. i would rate it 8.5/10, the limited carryweight to 50 is PAINFUL. also more variety of animals would be a plus! more blueprints and weapons too would surely improve the creativity and the freedom of the players when making their bases. its a very good game that could improve even more. reccomended :)", "timestamp_created": 1711981957, "timestamp_updated": 1711981957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161081167": {"recommendationid": "161081167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268119898", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14701, "last_played": 1709400213}, "language": "english", "review": "It's an awesome game.

This journey, while daunting, has provided invaluable insights into the complex relationship between indigenous peoples and their environment.\n\n'Green Hell', as the locals aptly refer to this lush expanse, serves as both a sanctuary and a crucible for the Yabahuaca. Their survival hinges upon their intimate knowledge of the flora and fauna that surround them, as well as their profound connection to the spiritual realm that permeates every leaf and stone.\n\nYet, amidst the tranquility of this untamed wilderness, there lurks a palpable sense of danger. The threat of predators, disease, and the ever-encroaching specter of deforestation looms large, casting a shadow over the delicate balance of life in the rainforest.\n\nIn 'Green Hell', the game that seeks to simulate the harsh realities of jungle survival, players are thrust into the role of a stranded explorer, forced to navigate the unforgiving terrain and fend off the myriad dangers that lurk within.\n\nThe experience is as immersive as it is harrowing, offering a glimpse into the daily struggles faced by the Yabahuaca as they contend with the relentless forces of nature. From foraging for food and water to crafting makeshift shelters and tools, every decision carries weight and consequence, mirroring the delicate dance of survival that defines life in the rainforest.\n\nYet, it is not merely the physical challenges that players must overcome. 'Green Hell' delves deep into the psyche of its protagonist, exploring the psychological toll of isolation, fear, and the ever-present specter of death.\n\nIn my observations thus far, I have found 'Green Hell' to be a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition, offering a nuanced portrayal of the complex interplay between man and nature.

But hey, at least you've got a handy compass and GPS to help you navigate through the tangled undergrowth.\r\n\r\nBut survival isn't just about avoiding danger\u2014it's also about staying healthy and sane. With hallucinations and psychological challenges thrown into the mix, you'll need to keep a close eye on your mental and physical well-being. And let's not forget about the importance of nutrition, because even in the depths of the jungle, a balanced diet is key to staying alive. Who knew that managing your macronutrients could be so thrilling?\r\n\r\nAnd if you thought the single-player mode was intense, just wait until you dive into the co-op multiplayer experience. Team up with friends to brave the dangers of the jungle together, sharing resources, crafting tools, and unraveling the mysteries of the Amazon as a united front. Because when it comes to survival, there's strength in numbers\u2014especially when you're facing off against skull-painted splinter factions and otherworldly threats.\r\n\r\nSo grab your machete, strap on your backpack, and get ready for the adventure of a lifetime in Spirits of Amazonia.

I like to chill and get immersed in a game's atmosphere, that's the ideal, for me. I'm playing this single player.  \n\nFive comparable titles I rate:\n \n1) Subnautica            - Like a dream.\n2) Firewatch              - Not exactly survival but, hey. \n3) The Long Dark      - Those blizzards.\n4) Project Zomboid    - The huge content, the constant threat.\n5) Empyrion               - Not quite as ground breaking but a serious contender.\n \nI've Played the Forest, Rust , Stranded Deep, the raft... and plenty of lesser knowns and other variants on the open world survival theme but the above five... 'instant no-lifers' - I've struck DayZ from the list because Bohemia broke my heart.\n\nI'd put this up there with the best of them. It's a very well made, well considered survival game taking a refreshing approach to many of the more common issues compromising games in this genre. I would say, if you haven't played the other 5 on that list, take a look there too. \n\nGreen Hell stands out even in that group in one respect: maintaining a persistent threat level and challenge during the 'daily grind' of feeding your character etc. This game is very well balanced and satisfying on those PVE terms, Project Zomboid and The Long Dark are the only others I know of that really succeeded there.\n\nFirewatch I mention partly because this game has a surprisingly powerful story which does remind me of that masterwork, Green Hell engages the player with the drama through many of the same techniques Firewatch employed.  \n\nI'm 24 hours of playtime into my game and the environment remains hostile and unpredictable to me (which is unusual). Hard-to-spot poisonous spiders and scorpions are a stroke of genius as they stop you running around like an idiot and force a more realistic, cautious attention to the path you chose through the undergrowth - and exactly what you're about to stand on. The focus traversing this open world demands in that way makes exploration a deeply immersive experience which few games can match. \n\nLike the Long Dark, this game punishes you if you overreach the limitations of your character, this forces careful planning and navigation - landmarks are rare in the dense foliage so you can easily get lost if not paying close attention to your compass bearing... you don't want to be wandering around out there at night. \n\nThere's also the threat of bumping into a tribesman or large predator - either can easily overwhelm you if you blunder into a confrontation unawares. The encounters with the NPC tribesmen are just beautiful, the confusion and mystery there, the way these ghost-like natives emerge and evaporate back into the jungle... you don't know where they are or how many there are... you don;t know where they come from or go to... but they're there and they might be all around you... and you don't belong here.\n\nCHECK THIS - The nutrition system has four separate requirements to satisfy, so, straight off, it's more engaging than most in that regard but more interestingly... and this is the really clever bit... your health at any one time is calculated on the sum total of those four nutrition stats (more or less), so, your health level is in constant flux depending on the level of each nutritional component. Together with a fairly realistic appetite, this keeps the daily grind for consumables relevant, even when you have worked out how to maintain a stable food supply.\n\nI also rate the creative approach these guys have taken to handling the inventory. They've kept the rucksack and the objects in it rendered in 3d as they are in the gameworld, they're dragged and dropped straight in. That's far more immersive than all that hard earned stuff becoming a 2D icon in a drop-down menu when it's picked up. ...Your collection of sticks, stones and lumps of meat maintains much more value that way. \n\nI think it's fair to say I haven't played another survival game which maintains such a consistent pressure on the player through PVE alone - since that equation is the backbone of the survival experience, imo, this game deserves recognition for proving that prioritising survival mechanics over combat related content can make for a far more interesting and immersive experience.\n\n...It also looks and sounds fricking gorgeous and all the rest. ...All in all, Atmospheric, immersive and challenging, even to a survival game veteran.

Unfortunately most fail, which has led to suspicion of \"cashing in\" when new titles arrive on the market.\n\nGreen Hell has attempted a slightly different and much more realistic take on the genre, where micro-management is key to your success. And it's not bad, really!\n\nYou see, most survival games balance their challenge with food, water and odd dangers, such as mutant babies or zombies. They scale your consumption to ridiculous levels (gallons of fluids and kilos of food every day) to supposedly balance their gameplay. By doing so, they reduce the realism of the players adventure and inject frustration in how much of a need there is to gather nourishment over all else. It seems to be the 'go to' formula for the generic survival game... Not so in Green Hell.\n \nThere's pretty much everything you could want here. A large, sprawling rain forest that's been lovingly crafted in stunning detail (imagine Crysis on steroids). There's danger everywhere, from small parasites and insects to dangerous animals. The locals are also not happy you are in their territory, so inevitably they want to disrupt your progress (in small ways) and will even attempt to engage you in combat. Not enough to make it an irritation, but enough to have you on your toes and to raise your pulse. Even simple sounds can have you imagining the worst and set you on edge.\n\nSustenance is very well integrated, with not just water or food, but a complex mixture of hydration, protein, fats and carbohydrates that all need attention if you don't want to suffer exhaustion, starvation, or even go mad and start hearing voices. Eating some foods can directly affect your sanity, such as eating human flesh or creepy crawlies. Cooking homely foods can soothe your woes and restore your sanity. All of this adds a complex and rewarding mini-game in itself. Although it can make the early days very demanding, it is a refreshing take on human needs in this genre of game.\n\nCrafting is also a real treat here. It's complex and hard work. There's no cutting down trees for 500 wood and spamming walls and items everywhere. Gathering is its own challenge, with weight issues and item availability being a core element to expansion of your home base should you decide to make one.\n\nThe list of craftables starts small, meaning you ideally need to explore to discover how to make something. You can, however, experiment with smaller recipes and stumble into their various schematics (which unlock once crafted). So common sense is also your friend here! A nice little touch (similar to Minecraft) that makes the game feel more like a simulator than a game.\n\nIllness, injuries, parasites and other disabilities are also micro managed, with a knowledge of local herbs and plants essential to a speedy recovery. You need to consider your own hygiene. Being dirty makes a difference when eating or applying medicine. The consequence of which can be gross.\n\n[b]TLDR:[/b]\nI'm still discovering many things as I play and am amazed at the love that's been put into the development of this game. It's truly a fantastic experience for anyone that's looking for a serious survival adventure that pushes your abilities of thought and reason. It's not for the feint of heart or the impatient. I'm not even sure it can be classed as a game. Simulator is a far more accurate description, but there is a story included (EA Tutorial, with the main story being added in v1.0 Official Release), which adds purpose.\n\nExtremely well executed and highly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1566055086, "timestamp_updated": 1566057024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 407, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.955120682716369629", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55048064": {"recommendationid": "55048064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045145422", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 4177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 596, "last_played": 1653294816}, "language": "english", "review": "The thing about Green Hell, is that it fills a giant hole in the survival genre. In the last few years we've seen a miriad of survival games come up on steam, fueled by the apparent appetite for building/survival games that became obvious through the countless free-to-play mobile games dedicated to the genre. The problem is that, on the PC ecosystem, developers always seemed to think that survival/building mechanics by itself wouldn't be enough to set them apart from competition, so they always came with a twist to the gameplay. Either focusing too much on building and nothing in survival, or too much on survival and with little to build. Massive place-holders for your constructions - like Space Engineers. Dedicate your life or start over every day - like Rust. Ultra-grind like Conan Exiles. Dabling into super-natural horror like The Forest. Going unfinished for years on early access - like The Long Dark. Others are just so easy that in 2 hours you figured out how to do everything. Others so incomplete that you lack either parts, blocks, or working mechanics to be able to go all in. Some with crappy dishonest developers, like Ark. \nI played many of them. But for all I've played i couldn't find one that would get the fundamentals right. Strip them all down to the basics, the building and survival mechanics, and  all of them were flawed one way or the other. \nNow, about Green Hell: For starters, it comes with a launch price of 20 euros, lower than most of it's competition. And then it offers a really fine tuned survival mechanic, together with a great building system. Both well balanced with the amount of resources at your disposal. \nThere's a small tutorial explaining how you ended up alone in a tropical island and showing you the very basics of building and surviving, and then you start. There are no monsters , no super-natural anything. You can choose either Story mode or Survival. And you can choose from 5 different difficulty levels, acurately explained in the description. As someone used to survival games, I went ahead for a level above normal. There's just the jungle and the dangers that you would realistically have to face. Leaches, Spiders, snakes, worms, big cats, bees, ants, and all can be dangerous to your health. Health you need to manage, and there's a great number of conditions you can suffer from. It's not just about eating to fill a bar. You need to have a balanced diet over time or you'll suffer the degradation of your condition. Water, proteines, fibers,vitamines, all are needed. So you'll need to find different types of food in a dangerous jungle. You'll need to make tools, not just to hunt, gather food and resources, but also to rest on. Sleeping on the floor will quickly get you filled with skin worms and leaches. Untreated, they can origin infection, fever and death. You'll need fire to cook, boil water, escape cold and keep your sanity at night. But fire draws unwanted attention from the local tribsmen.  Eventually you'll need to build walls to defend yourself and store stuff. The loop is good and very well balanced. In survival, it's you against yourself and your own mistakes while striving to survive and get better conditions. You can take your time and avoid the tribesmen. On story mode, you'll be forced to risk yourself to advance.  \nAll in all, it's a no bull***t survival game, with a realistic setting, harder than most, with amazing graphics and great survival/building mechanics. \nRecommended. ^\nThanks for this.", "timestamp_created": 1568121630, "timestamp_updated": 1652639162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 479, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.954904854297637939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92892073": {"recommendationid": "92892073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076498358", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3694, "last_played": 1622774979}, "language": "english", "review": "Start with nothing and no idea how to survive.

In the forest you can blow up mutants and cannibals with molotovs and bombs. Or use fire arrows or flares to light enemies on fire. You can also upgrade you weapons with stuff like human teeth and bird feathers to give them a stat buff. Green hell is less combat focused. You get different tiers of tools and weapons, with stone being basic tier and metal being the best tier. That's about it, you can't blow up jaguars or natives with bombs or light them up with flares.\n\nGreen hell does have tribal native people, but they are much less of a nuisance. They don't spawn often and even if they do, they won't send waves of tribals near your location. They spawn, and if they spot you and you kill them all, it won't escalate any further like things do in the forest. There are only two main types of tribal people, archers and spearmen, no Virginia mutants or cave mutants. Again, it's less focused on combat.\n\nEnemies in the forest are all human based. In green hell, there's more variety, you get jaguars, mountain lions, caiman and other hostile animals. And these animals don't fuck around and an unprepared encounter can easily spell death. A leaf bandage will do fine against scratches but it won't do anything against a deep jaguar laceration. It depends on if you have the knowledge to treat the laceration, better yet, kill any animals before they can even harm you. That said, it takes knowledge and skill, since you all you have are spears and bow/arrows, no molotovs or bombs.\n\nFood and water is also much deeper in green hell. You have different nutrients such as proteins, fats and carbohydrates, so eating a piece of meat won't replenish your carbohydrates, it's less like the forest where you can likely survive off a single food source. And this mechanic isn't here just for the sake of variety, failing to satisfy any one of these nutrients can lead to reduced health and stamina, which can further affect your ability to survive.\n\nThis is a good segue into stamina. Stamina in green hell is also very important, it doesn't just affect your movement and combat. If your stamina and energy fall too low, you'll pass out on the spot. This will then lead to parasitic worms living underneath your skin, rapidly draining your sanity, which if left untreated can spell another death. So to stop yourself from passing out and getting worms, you need to sleep regularly on a bed. Stamina also dictates if you can light a fire, unlike the forest, you don't have a Bic lighter with infinite fuel, you need to start a fire with a drill firestarter, which uses a substantial amount of stamina and energy. If you don't have a fire, you can't purify and boil water, or cook any raw meat you have. Foods in green hell expire quickly if you don't cook or eat them.\n\nNext is the sound design. Green hell's sound design doesn't just sound good, it is also very very crucial to survival. In the jungle, there's an overgrowth of bushes and trees, so it's very easy to miss any threats that are around you, such as rattlesnakes, giant ass spiders, tribal people and Jaguars. The only reliable way to identify these threats is by the distinct sound in which they make. Hear a snake rattling? Stop moving any closer and go around the source of the sound. Hear the low growl of a jaguar inching closer? Get ready for an encounter. Hear the singing of tribal people? Crouch down and avoid alerting them. Because more times than not, you won't be able to see these threats. In the forest, you can turn off sound completely and still stay alive, but in green hell, turning off sound will get yourself killed by various threats.\n\nLastly, I want to talk about difficulty. So far I've built up green hell to be this hardcore survival game, whether it is 100% realistic or not is still debatable with sometimes questionable AI patterns, but in its core, green hell is a hardcore survival game. That said, it's actually very customizable in its difficulty. Don't want to get bit by snakes and spiders? You can actually turn it off, don't want to deal with tribal people? You can turn it off as well. Don't want to deal with sanity, there's another option for that as well. It's much more customizable than the forest. You can go in blind and get killed over and over again. But like any hardcore game, it can be very rewarding. If you want to challenge yourself or just want to play like an Amazonian tourist, you can customize the difficulty to your own liking.", "timestamp_created": 1684208962, "timestamp_updated": 1684208962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 356, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.948352992534637451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71000435": {"recommendationid": "71000435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067407978", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 9331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2189, "last_played": 1707866898}, "language": "english", "review": "7/10: Overall, I would recommend Green Hell for anyone that enjoys survival games. Along with anyone that openly enjoys being frustrated with themselves. That is not an exaggeration and you will almost immediately understand what I mean within your first 30 minutes of game play.\n\n*I have not tried out the multiplayer yet as my friends do not yet share the same sense of self-loathing required to play a game like this.*\n\nThis is without a doubt the hardest Mid-horror survival game I've ever played. (I had to add mid-horror because, of course, Ark exists.) \nTried playing through on the hardest difficulty (one death and your saves' deleted) from the start because I'm seasoned in the ways of survival games. Or, at least, I thought I was. \n\nFirst try; Grazed a snake in tall grass less than 5 minutes in. Save slot deleted. \n\nSecond try; Picked up a frog the game specifically warned me not to pick up. Save slot deleted.\n\nThird try; Decided to circumvent both the snake and the frogs, because I didn't even trust walking close to either of them anymore. Slow-stepped right into an anthill.  An ANTHILL. Save slot deleted.\n\nTry four-nine; Both malicious hunger and thirst got the best of me. Save slots deleted.\n\nTry ten; Built a hut, killed my first animal, found several coconuts to use for water. Built a fire. 2 hours in. No story elements to be found because I haven't made it 100 feet from the starting point yet, but I was alive I had food I had fire! I cook two pieces of meat, and it was like the God of Green Hell felt my hope and sent Monsoon season outta left field. Doesn't stop raining. Ever. Fire went out. Eating my two cooked meats almost yield no results in helping my completely diminished hunger.  Desperately trying to build a sub-hut just for protection for the fire to stay lit before all three hunger slots diminish. Oh joy, I have found another snake. Save slot deleted. \n\nTry 11; beat it on easy and have never been so disgusted with myself for giving up\n\nSome features of the game, like your crafting pack, inventory, and base building are on the clunky side compared to other survival titles in the genre. However, the amount of different objects you can craft, along with different types of bases you can create really help make this clunky system much less tedious and more involved in the process. I actually prefer this over, say, The Forests ability to craft extremely proficiently. You become that much more involved in what you pick up and use.\n\nThe story line of this game, in my opinion, is superb. On story alone I would rate it a 8/10. only-2 for how short the story content is in relation to the game, however Green Hell easily makes up this difference with self exploration and figuring out some connecting story elements intuitively. I thought I expected what was to come, from the very beginning, which initially felt like a huge let down early on. I was so wrong and had no idea what was to come. Game takes you through a roller coaster of different perspectives on things. \n\nGraphically, the game is beautiful. The environment of the amazon with both the animals and dynamic sounds really do the trick in feeling like you are in an insatiably large forest. Coupled with the fact you cannot actually see where you are on the map, I think they hit gold. \n\nThe only reason I knocked it 3 points is because there were some things environmentally I did not enjoy. Understand this is just extreme personal preference from playing too many survival games. Having the map walled off by higher area, to me, makes the game feel like a box, no matter how large it is. I totally understand why they felt the need to put these physical boundaries here. The map has to cut off at some point. However, I felt like once I realized this map was completely \"boxed in\", with the exception of the entrance/exit to different zones I knew I could take advantage of this system and found everywhere I needed to go by walking along the wall, where it was also the safest place to be, only leaving the walls when i needed to go continue the story. Then, back to the wall to go to the next place. Exploiting this tactic was on me, but I feel like it robbed some of the ambiance of the entire game to even be an option. Also, the hallway with different skins felt lacking too. But again, that is just personal preference. \n\nOverall, a very well done story, not too short, beautiful graphics  \n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1592518844, "timestamp_updated": 1592518844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 212, "votes_funny": 54, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946306228637695313", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101563235": {"recommendationid": "101563235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198833803960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 182, "playtime_forever": 8952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "playtime_at_review": 500, "last_played": 1713442772}, "language": "english", "review": "I always think reviews are pretty meaningless if you don't know what someone's into, so, firstly, I'm 40+, into survival games particularly. I like to chill and get immersed in a game's atmosphere, that's the ideal, for me. I'm playing this single player.\n\nFive comparable titles I rate:\n\n1) Subnautica - Like a dream.\n2) Firewatch - Not exactly survival but, hey.\n3) The Long Dark - Those blizzards.\n4) Project Zomboid - The huge content, the constant threat.\n5) Empyrion - Not quite as ground breaking but a serious contender.\n\nI've Played the Forest, Rust , Stranded Deep, the raft... and plenty of lesser knowns and other variants on the open world survival theme but the above five... 'instant no-lifers' - I've struck DayZ from the list because Bohemia broke my heart.\n\nI'd put this up there with the best of them. It's a very well made, well considered survival game taking a refreshing approach to many of the more common issues compromising games in this genre. I would say, if you haven't played the other 5 on that list, take a look there too.\n\nGreen Hell stands out even in that group in one respect: maintaining a persistent threat level and challenge during the 'daily grind' of feeding your character etc. This game is very well balanced and satisfying on those PVE terms, Project Zomboid and The Long Dark are the only others I know of that really succeeded there.\n\nFirewatch I mention partly because this game has a surprisingly powerful story which does remind me of that masterwork, Green Hell engages the player with the drama through many of the same techniques Firewatch employed.\n\nI'm 24 hours of playtime into my game and the environment remains hostile and unpredictable to me (which is unusual). Hard-to-spot poisonous spiders and scorpions are a stroke of genius as they stop you running around like an idiot and force a more realistic, cautious attention to the path you chose through the undergrowth - and exactly what you're about to stand on. The focus traversing this open world demands in that way makes exploration a deeply immersive experience which few games can match.\n\nLike the Long Dark, this game punishes you if you overreach the limitations of your character, this forces careful planning and navigation - landmarks are rare in the dense foliage so you can easily get lost if not paying close attention to your compass bearing... you don't want to be wandering around out there at night.\n\nThere's also the threat of bumping into a tribesman or large predator - either can easily overwhelm you if you blunder into a confrontation unawares. The encounters with the NPC tribesmen are just beautiful, the confusion and mystery there, the way these ghost-like natives emerge and evaporate back into the jungle... you don't know where they are or how many there are... you don;t know where they come from or go to... but they're there and they might be all around you... and you don't belong here.\n\nCHECK THIS - The nutrition system has four separate requirements to satisfy, so, straight off, it's more engaging than most in that regard but more interestingly... and this is the really clever bit... your health at any one time is calculated on the sum total of those four nutrition stats (more or less), so, your health level is in constant flux depending on the level of each nutritional component. Together with a fairly realistic appetite, this keeps the daily grind for consumables relevant, even when you have worked out how to maintain a stable food supply.\n\nI also rate the creative approach these guys have taken to handling the inventory. They've kept the rucksack and the objects in it rendered in 3d as they are in the gameworld, they're dragged and dropped straight in. That's far more immersive than all that hard earned stuff becoming a 2D icon in a drop-down menu when it's picked up. ...Your collection of sticks, stones and lumps of meat maintains much more value that way.\n\nI think it's fair to say I haven't played another survival game which maintains such a consistent pressure on the player through PVE alone - since that equation is the backbone of the survival experience, imo, this game deserves recognition for proving that prioritising survival mechanics over combat related content can make for a far more interesting and immersive experience.\n\n...It also looks and sounds fricking gorgeous and all the rest. ...All in all, Atmospheric, immersive and challenging, even to a survival game veteran.

I have HUNDREDS of hours in 7 Days to Die, but 2 hours in that game, you can be flourishing. Tons of food, tons of materials smelting in to bars, weapons, water, etc. This game is absolutely NOT like that. It WILL punish you over and over. Only purchase if you truly want a survival experience that will test you and your skill. Imagine being on the show 'Naked and Afraid'. This is pretty much it.\n\nWith all that being said, this game is poorly optimized. I can only assume the developers have no idea how to do anything that isn't plug and play.

You will have to find specific types of food to replenish fats, carbohydrates, proteins.\nStory is interesting and pretty much dramatic at times, and just as in Forest, you find some info and things that can unlock new areas for progressing through the story.\nAlso in Green Hell you have crafting and building, but to be honest, I think that building is a missed opportunity. Because there is no point of building anything except beds to save and sleep. Here it is hard to find and produce specific resources. In Forest building was a big part of gameplay that could give you hours of enjoyment. But not here. There are specific places that can be used for building structures, but they are rare. Also in some areas where you need specific item to climb up - you can't build a.. ladder, let's say - no, you can't build even a bed. I know that it is a minor and not rare thing to restrict player from breaking a game like that, but looks a bit lame.\nGot through all the story together with my wife in co-op, it was a fun experience, but not as great as in Forest.\nSo if you like survival games, story-driven, with some bits of hardcore gameplay - buy Green Hell, it is really good.\nIf you are more into building bases, fights with different kinds of enemies, more player-friendly experiences, I'd say look at Forest or some other games of similar kind.", "timestamp_created": 1610457517, "timestamp_updated": 1610457517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 389, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.938799560070037842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123567135": {"recommendationid": "123567135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198813571244", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1695393181}, "language": "english", "review": "the capybaras pulled up", "timestamp_created": 1665284942, "timestamp_updated": 1665284942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 385, "votes_funny": 82, "weighted_vote_score": "0.938359916210174561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84892978": {"recommendationid": "84892978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007314492", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 5333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3361, "last_played": 1701279345}, "language": "english", "review": "My wife picks my leaches 10/10 :)\n\nRarely do my wife and I enjoy the same game, she explores and advances the story while I build up our base and fix her wounds when she gets back.

Touch frog dead, eat mushroom dead, gone insane dead... This game aims for a realistic experience with insects eating you and infecting you.. Ontop of insects trying to kill you, you may want to be weary of the locals, you may think you can talk to them but instead they will chase you and kill you.. Did I mention their is also animals like jaguars? Yeah, me and my friends did a 4 player coop session day 2 the jaguar showed up scratching all of us.. We all died and it ran off, the next day it returned and killed one of our guys... Did I mention if a player in the coop dies you lose 20 sanity? Again sanity is important! If you lose enough sanity you hear annoying whispers in your head and if it gets to low enemy natives start spawning however they are an illusion and still kill you.. So keep a high sanity by not eating human meat and bad foods also drain sanity levels... So within 3hrs of playtime you can die by: Snakes, jaquars, infections, the locals, ants, frogs, poison plants, and more that I am yet to discover.. I think my group of friends died a total of about 20 times within the 2hr play session.. I would like to describe this game like riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire, the ground is on fire, I am on fire because this game is a NIGHTMARE starting out going in blind. I imagine this game is meant for actual survival experts or people who think they would survive in the jungle except they will not and just die before they even figured out how to make a shelter. \n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\n\nI also wanna say this game is like \"The Forest\" except if it was more realistic. This game does not have any of those mutant monsters that will give you nightmares, rather it is more about surviving against everything. Infections, insects, animals, native tribes, hunger and so forth.. This game also has 0 forgiveness you drop everything upon death. Yeah it sucks dying but your character can hold a LOT of stuff the worst is picking up everything individually and watching a sec or so long animation of you retrieving your items.. So I give the developers right off the bat a 10/10 on realism and name choice cause this is literally a green hell. I would rather be in actual hell than on this Island..\n\n\nWHAT I GOT:\n\nI simply got a game that I wanna say can be described as a game for veteran survivalist.. You fight off infections, insects, tribes, food, water, having enough proteins and carbohydrates.. What I can tell you is find a nice flat area that hugs the world border, because watching a 360 angle of your base is difficult.. Their is also snakes and ant hills..

All great games but I am wondering what made me stick to Green Hell for so long. Below I'll try to compare my experience in the other games to Green Hell.\n\nI think it's not just the good mechanics, no nonsense waste of time etc. but whenever I question a process in the game whether the time spent or things done are necessary, it just seems to make sense. Or maybe I am rationalizing.\n\nThough I looked for some challenge at the end to keep playing, I found myself joining different multiplayer games, mindlessly doing perhaps the same things over and over again but still enjoying the process.\n\nStranded Deep didn't have the ending back then but the feel and accessibility, the balance of land and sea and the island/summer/sunny theme clicked with me. After achieving the endgame objectives I kept playing again for a while.\n\nThe Forest is also a great game. It made me tense, sometimes jump scares got me and the overall theme was somewhat disturbing. I guess I prefered the smoother more relaxing vibe. The constant threat seems to give this game a different dynamic. Good amount of action if that's what you're looking for.\nAfter finishing the story, I didn't want to go on much. Tried multiplayer once but found no appealing reason to go on.\n\nGreen Hell was as frustrating at the start as the other games but once I got past the basic understanding and finished the story I realized this was pretty much exactly what I was looking for when I wondered \"is there a game that would make me experience something similar to what the Youtube channel Primitive Technology and the likes are doing\".\n\nOnce you're past the point where you are surviving fine when it comes to food shelter etc. the only challenge is the natives attacking. A bit lacking when compared to The Forest. Also not very rewarding since you don't get relevant stuff from natives that could make your base grow the way the mutants in The Forest can. (ie. build stuff from bones)\n\nThe Long Dark had a different pace compared to the previous games. The sheer amount of time spent traveling didn't make me admire the oh-so-realistic approach but rather question whether it was worth it. Great game nonetheless.\n\nSubnautica seems to offer a smooth experience as well. The whole futuristic sea oriented theme doesn't appeal to me right now. \n- - - \n\nI also wonder whether the prominence of the story is affecting the game.\nIn Stranded Deep and Green Hell which I seem to have enjoyed the most, the story doesn't seem to matter much. Felt like I'm just a guy trying to survive in nature. Somewhat easier to get immersed in.\nThe Forest and The Long Dark feel like the story plays an essential part to make sense of the world around you.\n\n- - - \n\nHere's my attempt at a game review.

A 15% reduction would be good). \n- Too few bandages (again, only slightly. a 5 to 10% increase would be good). \n- Runs like garbage - but hey, it's early access. At least it's stable.\n- Poor hit detection - don't try to crack open a coconut in your shelter unless you want to bring the whole thing down.\n- Loading times are a bit longer than I'd like, but not bad. \n- Too many animals in general. It's way too easy to hunt for larger game becasue they seem to be everywhere. \n\nSeems like I'm nit picking, right? It's true, but I had to point these things out. \n\nTo sum it up, if you like survival games at all, you MUST get this game. Like I said, it's better than anything I've played in a long time.

Survive longer, build weapons, defend yourself from enemies and predators.\n\nEventually, you know every food and water source, can crush every enemy, can build anything you need. You are more than a match for anything this inhospitable world might throw at you. Nature regards you with awe: you are the King of the Jungle.\n\nThen step on a scorpion far from your camp. Your bandages with antivenom herbs are back at camp. Stumble around looking for the herb you need. Your fever rises.\n\nPass out on the forest floor. Wake up: parasitic worms hiding in the muddy ground have made a home under your skin. Use a bone fragment as a needle and dig them out. Pass out from the pain.\n\nYou wake up dangerously dehydrated, and your makeshift coconut canteen already drained. Making it home is your only hope. You start in the right direction, but the combination of the fever, the now infected scorpion sting, and the open sores from your impromptu worm surgery have weakened you so that you can only make it a few hundred yards in between passing out.\n\nYour periodic unconsciousness gives more worms the opportunity to claim a new home. The fever rises. Dehydration worsens. Hunger racks your body. You hope the growl you heard was just a mouse, and not a jaguar hunting you. Irrelevant, as you pass out again.\n\nYou can make it, less than a mile to go. Medicine, food, water, fire, and rest all await you.

Despite some odd choppiness (1080p w/a 1080 GTX) issues and wildly swinging FPS (sometimes down to 35, settings on high and shadows on low), this game had enough to keep me engaged for the 50 hours I sunk into it. \n\nIn the beginning, the game is daunting--every fruit and nut you find is \"unknown\" and you quickly get over your trepidation as the hunger meters deplete. Yes, I said \"meters\". In Green Hell, you'll have to manage thirst, carbs, fats, and proteins as well as sleep. After a couple brutal slogs, hopping from coconut to coconut, I finally realized I could throw rocks at snakes! But, then I got mauled by a jaguar. So it goes in the jungle, where every nap is followed by worm infestations and every stroll comes with a handful of unwanted passengers (leeches). You'll stumble into snakes (and get poisoned), walk over Goliath spiders (and get poisoned), get jabbed by scorpions in caves (and get poisoned) all the while desperately trying to cure dysentery from drinking river water...\n\nAnd then, you read the Wiki. Green Hell provides zero help when it comes to identifying flora and fauna, and hands you an in-game notebook which is used only to track new crafting discoveries (objects, not food) that you bump into at various native camps and abandoned structures. Find a camp, kill the natives, learn how to make a smoker! Unfortunately, once you get the hang of the basics--edibles, tools and remedies--you'll quickly discover that 70% of the game's content is meaningless. \n\nThere are several different flavors of axes and spears, for example, but there doesn't seem to be much variation in terms of damage output. Once you track down some obsidian, you'll render all other types moot. There are no stats for us number-crunchers associated with the various blades, axes, bows and spears, so you'll just end up picking obsidian and running with it. I was also bummed that you can't make obsidian+bamboo axes and spears. Bamboo is pretty. \n\nFood-wise, it's all about the magic of coconuts. Drink their juice, crack them apart for their meat (carbs & fats) and then wear the two shells like a bra and go traipsing around the jungle high on mushrooms! Or, drop them on the ground when it rains and gather rain water. Find enough coconuts (which are plentiful) and you'll have yourself one hell of a watering hole. The orange fruits are edible, so are bananas (obvs) and the little glowy/brown mushrooms. If you stay away from everything else, you'll be golden. Rattlesnakes are everywhere, and dumber than posts. Lob a rock at one and you'll see just how intimidating they are! After staring it down for a minute and realizing it's not going to attack you, chuck another rock and you have dinner.\n\nThe natives scared the hell out of me initially, with their happy-go-lucky tribal songs, but once you realize you can snipe them from a distance as they stand there scanning the horizon... Whatever. The jaguar, if you run into its awkwardly looping growl, is just about the only predator to be feared in Green Hell.\n\nAfter 50 hours, I'd scoured the map and discovered all the crafting recipes but found that most of it was pretty useless. A set of 20 coconut shells laying on the ground was more effective at keeping me hydrated than a fancy water purifier and it rained more often than the purifier could purify. A basic campfire worked just as well as an elaborate one requiring 20 big stones, the small hut kept me just as cozy as the medium sized hut for 1/3 the materials, a smoker takes 12 hrs to smoke 4 pieces of meat that last 3 days when you can just BBQ on the go, and I tended to hole up at an abandoned fishing village which already sported a hammock! Ultimately, the mechanics need some tuning. All this stuff and no reason to use any of it made for a rather lackluster experience.\n\nBut, it's an early-access game! The atmospherics are gorgeous, but there are still numerous bugs being sorted out--the worst of which have to do with using the bow. Your arrow shows up as an item you can interact with while cocked in the bow, sometimes your arrows get oddly deflected by hit boxes that shouldn't be there, sometimes your bow entirely bugs out leaving white tracers in the air and sometimes you can't even load it despite having more arrows in your bag! Nevertheless, I had loads of fun mapping out the territory (oddly all in the SW quadrant of the map) and managing my coconut bowl farm.

It is less realistic than advertised, but combines its survival elements with two surprisingly captivating stories and kept me engaged for a long time.\n\n[h2]1. Story & Setting[/h2]\nYou play a modern-day explorer who wrote a book about one of the Amazon's \"lost tribes\" - indigenous people that avoid contact with the modern world. You learn quickly that this is your second expedition into the area, that the world is facing some sort of crisis, and you believe the tribe to hold the key to a solution. However, things do not go as planned, and you find yourself alone and without supplies in an uncharted area of the jungle. You also suffer from partial amnesia and don't remember what exactly happened. You do, however, still have radio contact with your wife, who accompanied you on the expedition and who will try to help you.\n\nI can't say much about the story without spoiling parts of it, but it definitely went to places that I did not expect, and I enjoyed that a lot. The plot around your wife includes some very serious, mature, and touching emotional elements. Also, the aforementioned global crisis is not just a backdrop - you'll gradually find out that it's interwoven with your own story in a very interesting way, and you'll find documents revealing past global events in well-crafted detail. Lastly, while the game's presentation usually strives to be realistic, your attempts to self-medicate your amnesia with local herbs lead to a few strikingly surreal journeys.\n\nThe game even includes a _second_ full story, basically a prequel that plays in roughly the same areas, but explores the events around your first expedition. I haven't played that second story yet and I think I'll probably play other games for a while before returning to Green Hell, but it's really nice to have another full story to look forward to.\n\n[h2]2. Gameplay & Mechanics[/h2]\nMost of the game revolves around survival. You have to find a way of obtaining clean water (as drinking it raw from a river will make you sick). For food, you can gather fruits, mushrooms, and nuts, and trap or hunt animals. Your smartwatch tracks your nutrition levels regarding carbs, fat, protein, and hydration, and you'll need to diversify your diet to keep them all at acceptable levels. Since you don't really know most of the plants around, finding good food sources involves some experimentation, and you have to deal with parasites and food poisoning as a result of that. But once you've eaten a food item once, the game will remember its effects and show them to you when you try to eat it again. You can also find ways to cultivate many plants.\n\nYou can craft shelters out of wood, leaves, and optionally also mud bricks. And you can craft a variety of tools, weapons, and armor.\n\nApart from food poisoning, you also have to deal with wounds, infections, fever, attacks from poisonous animals, insomnia, and other afflictions. You also have to regularly check your body for leeches.\n\nAll this creates a detailed, very engaging survival experience. However, while the game advertises itself as \"realistic\", I wouldn't call it that, since it also does a lot of very obvious concessions to make things easier for the player. Most of the food items can be eaten without problems. Traps will catch an infinite amount of animals even in the same spot, you'll never exhaust the population. Plants grow from seeds to full, fruit-bearing bushes or trees within days. Predators announce themselves loudly from a distance. While the game may seem challenging at first (and you'll probably die quickly on your first attempt), it actually becomes very easy once you know what to do (and what not to do).\n\nAdditionally, the game lends itself to some cheesy techniques that don't feel realistic at all. For example, while water is plentiful, you usually cannot just drink it directly without getting parasites. But there is a 100% reliable, very easily accessible way of curing those. So you can drink untreated water whenever you need to, and immediately cure any parasites you might get. But if you feel that this makes a crucial element of survival much too easy, then you can of course just ignore that this easy cure exists.\n\nIn short, the game does provide a detailed and more realistic survival experience than many other games in this genre, but it's still a very long shot from the real thing.\n\nAnother gameplay element that needs addressing is the crafting mechanic. You're supposed to experiment, combining base elements to discover and unlock certain tools. Other tools and structures unlock after crafting other things - which can be problematic since you may never see a need to craft that base item. Many structures and tools can also be unlocked by exploring the world and finding them built or dropped somewhere - sometimes that's the only way to discover them, especially since you can't experiment with structures, you either know the blueprint or not. Generally, the unlocking mechanic felt a bit inconsistent to me. I suggest perusing the official wiki if this mechanic feels too obtuse to you.\n\n[h2]3. Graphics & Presentation[/h2]\nGraphics are amazingly crisp and realistic for a game created by a relatively small indie team. Of course, when you compare the game's screenshots to photos from the actual rainforest, you'll notice stark differences - there's a lot of copy-pasting going on, and the foliage in the game is much less dense. But none of that bothered me - the graphics and ambient sounds were definitely good enough to keep me immersed for a long time.\n\nI didn't notice much music in the game, it was only used to subtly accompany a few emotional scenes. I think that's a good choice for a game that aims to be a fairly \"realistic\" simulation.\n\nThere is voice acting from the main character, the wife, several other characters (mostly in the form of audio logs), and also from the natives. It is generally very competently done and enhances the experience. The voices are distinct and clear, and the actors put enough emotion even into scientific reports to make them interesting to listen to. Dialog between the main character and his wife flows very naturally. For an indie game, this was exceptionally well done.\n\n[h2]4. Usability & Accessibility[/h2]\nGreen Hell generally provided a pretty polished experience. Graphics settings include most of the things that you'd expect, including AA, texture quality, draw distances, and a brightness slider. An FOV slider and a frame limiter are provided as well, as is a UI scale option. Six different volume sliders let you fine-tune your acoustic experience. Keys are fully rebindable, the mouse controls have sensitivity sliders and can be inverted, and various actions like \"run\" and \"crouch\" can be switched between \"hold\" and \"toggle\". Subtitles, head bobbing, hints, and other features can be switched on or off individually. It's great to see a developer take so much care with the user experience.\n\nIf you don't want to stress yourself, you can also play a custom game mode and individually turn off threats you don't want to deal with. A pure survival mode (without story elements) is provided as well, as are special challenges.\n\nThe UI is in some places rather idiosyncratic and imposes nonsensical limits on the player's actions. You can't equip armor from the ground, you have to put it in your backpack first. You can't douse a fire with a bowl of water, you have to fill a flask at the bowl instead. There are several other examples which I found a bit annoying, but it didn't affect my experience much after learning how the game expects you to do certain things.\n\nYou have 4 save slots available, but can only save at shelters, which you may have to build first.\n\n[h2]5. Conclusion[/h2]\nGreen Hell provides a very enganging, well-rounded, polished survival experience enhanced by an intriguing story.

Make no mistake, it's a hard bastard to get started. Discouragingly so, to the point that I uninstalled it in frustration but something always kept bringing me to try again. My third attempt, I stuck with it no matter what - learn the health system, learn what foods you need to eat and how to avoid danger.\n\nWhen you do this, the game opens up in to something truly beautiful and an experience like I have rarely had with a game. You - not the character, the player - have to fight with Jake. You struggle to learn and you will fail. You go in to the jungle at first and it's terrifying. Maybe you're dehydrated, covered in leeches, losing nutrients and poisoned from a snake bite. Then you learn you can drink coconuts and use the empty shells beside a fire to purify water. You learn what plants you need to cure poison, you learn what mushrooms you can and can't eat (tip: just don't eat the ones that look like ballerinas, everything else is fine). You get in the habit of watching for the icon that indicates there's a body problem to address and then learn that fire restores sanity, don't sleep on the bare ground and turn your sound up so you can hear and *listen* to the jungle around you.\n\n\nThen comes the breakthrough - you're bitten by a snake and have the things to save yourself. You could have saved yourself all along and this is the reward for your hard won knowledge. You meet a jaguar for the first time, crouch for stealth, meet it's charge with your obsidian spear prepared to throw and you pierce it's skull with a single throw, taking it's meat and life force for your own so that you can continue. It is so incredibly fulfilling because things aren't simply done to you in this game, you are given the choice and the tools you need to rise up and prevail against a game world that absolutely wants you dead.

It's had over 20 free content updates since I purchased it in 2020 and I think that's pretty dope and extremely notable.\n\nYou'll find a lot of reviews mentioning how this game is like The Forest. It's a fair comparison on the surface, and it's fair to say you'll enjoy Green Hell if you enjoyed The Forest. Green Hell co-op is like The Forest co-op, but with a lot more glitches (and The Forest has its fair share) and a LOT more threats. I died. Spectacularly. And often.\n\nWithin the first five minutes, a rattlesnake bit me and I died. Upon respawning, I decided to take a nap to replenish some energy only to wake up covered in worms. I attempted to kill something for food and bones (because my notebook insisted bone shards would help me with worms), but I failed. So, I drank some water instead because my guy kept complaining about being thirsty. I ended up with 4 stacks of parasites. Trying to figure out how to cure them and panicking about the flashing symbols on my HUD alerting me of my imminent death, I picked up a poison dart frog without bothering to read that it was a poison dart frog. It sapped what little health I had left and I died again. After I respawned yet again, I was dead within about 30 seconds when I ate something that gave me food poisoning. As my character continued vomiting every few steps, my macros plummeted. It didn't take long for me to fall over and die a third time. This cycle of dying and respawning happened for my first several hours of gameplay, and keep in mind that my squad was also repeatedly dying around me so our collective sanity was abysmal. I turned down the game's volume for fear of actually losing my sanity to the constant voices in my head as I watched this poor guy curl up into the fetal position in the mud, pass out from exhaustion, and subsequently die because I didn't know how to keep him alive for longer than a few minutes.\n\nThe learning curve was steep. 90 degrees, I'd say. I went in blind, and it ultimately made the survival element a [b]lot[/b] more satisfying once I figured out how to, y'know, [i]not[/i] die every few minutes.\n\nThe game has beautiful and immersive sound and visuals. Lots of audio cues that can help save your life.\n\nWe've experienced a lot of glitches in co-op mode: invisible natives that only appear when they die, weapons vanishing from hands, storage boxes randomly sorting and mixing items up, the inability to pick things up or interact with anything that's fixed only by a reset, items flying across the screen, getting stuck in the water, dead fish endlessly splashing in and out of the water making this loud buzzing sound, and just overall lag. None of it has kept me from enjoying the game, but it might bother someone looking for a more seamless experience.\n\nMy other gripe has to do with the guy you're playing. While I haven't played story mode yet and don't know his deal, I get [b]very[/b] tired of his almost [i]constant[/i] whining. I get he's in a terrible situation, but his persistent moaning and groaning got very annoying very quickly.\n\nOverall, Green Hell is a pretty intense and rewarding experience if you jump into it blind, and I highly recommend that you do.", "timestamp_created": 1588663471, "timestamp_updated": 1713719522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893532037734985352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44513823": {"recommendationid": "44513823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303238797", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 782, "last_played": 1536169436}, "language": "english", "review": "Well...

For one thing, all your stuff will constantly be destroyed by tribals. This wouldn't be such a problem if there was some functional way of preventing or discouraging their attacks. Instead of a functional deterrent, tribals can apparently teleport right into your house and smash things while your back is turned and you're ten meters away. I was once alerted to just such a sneak attack after walking around a large boulder next to my camp and suddenly half my house was debris from the six people attacking my stuff.\n\nThis might appeal to some people; there are gamers out there who enjoy having to start over from scratch every five minutes. However, it takes forever to build anything. What you can lose in seconds after blinking in the wrong spot will take you fifteen minutes to even begin rebuilding... and since resource requirements are so high and force you to venture out far, it means coming back to YET ANOTHER teleport assault that destroyed all your stuff. If this doesn't sound tedious to you, you might have a promising career in forensic accounting or as a law historian. My condoleances.\n\nThe tedium doesn't stop there, however. Leeches. Leeches everywhere. As soon as you touch an area that is designated as \"underbrush\", you stand a chance of being covered in leeches. This means that you will constantly be stopping and looking at all your limbs and clicking the leeches off. They have a minor, easily-ignored effect on gameplay, but leaving them on is still a bad idea. So while you're rebuilding all your stuff from magical teleporting suicidal tribals, carrying stacks of carefully unbalanced numbers of materials (you need four logs? You can carry three. You need six long sticks? You can carry five. They drop in twos. Enjoy your extra trips, sucker), you'll periodically have to drop everything and shake off more goddamn leeches.\n\nSounds tolerable despite how I'm making it sound? Congratulations, you've graduated to the final test of tediousness. Animal hazards. Never, ever run. For any reason. Ever. Venomous snakes and spiders and stingrays guarantee that if you aren't moving at a crawl you'll be dead. One bite is easy enough to manage, provided you have the resources to deal with it... but the fever means you'll pass out sooner rather than later. This can cause a sickness cascade that means you wake up dead. Avoidable if the correct resources spawn in convenient places in sufficient quantities, but that's trusting RNG to save your life. Oh, but that's fine! Just stockpile resources ahead of time, right?\n\nWrong. Unless you build a container (which are stupidly complex to build), resources can and will despawn. Wonderful. Okay, still manageable, right? WRONG BECAUSE TRIBALS TELEPORT AND BREAK YOUR SHIT WHEN YOU AREN'T LOOKING.\n\nThe entire thing is an exercise in frustration. You have every option given to you to establish a home base to help yourself survive, but the game practically forces you to be a nomad barely scraping by the entire time, constantly attacked by infinite numbers of tribals who don't seem to mind that one single man has killed hundreds of them and used their bones for armor, predators that can and will attack you through walls, and the single worst thing in the existence of anything: skin-worms.\n\nThe least frustrating way to play this game is to disable all of the pointless annoyances, which turns the game into a stupidly simple basebuilder survival game... with no point to playing after you've got a good thing going on, since that means no story mode.\n\nThat might sound like I'm simply making a bad decision, but you haven't played this game. The threats I've listed above? Easily avoidable. If you don't move quickly, audio cues alert you to nearby hazards, and you can deal with them very easily. One arrow to the face of a predator will kill it, and those jaguars stalk you nice and slow enough for you to shoot them.

I really do enjoy this game. It encourages you to go slowly, but you're in a constant race against the clock to keep yourself healthy, at least in the beginning. It can be crazy difficult at first, but once you've learned the plants and animals, what to listen for, what to avoid, and established a bit of a base, you start having time to focus on other goals. You really feel the benefits of having an established base; but at the same time, you have to be ready to defend or flee it. \n\nHead shots are satisfying. Tool and weapon use feels solid. Crafting is pretty intuitive. The map is interesting and beautiful. I like that you have skill gain as you use items. The seriousness of even a minor scrape is appropriate to the environment. Seasons have an impact on game play.The story is also interesting, though I admit I haven't followed it all the way as I get sidetracked by base building.\n\nBuilding is occasionally frustratingly buggy; I do hope that the upcoming building patch addresses some of the issues.

Players impersonate an anthropologist that, along with his fianc\u00e9e Mia, led an expedition to a remote forest for studying an ancient indigenous tribe. After a promising beginning, things go downhill quickly as the couple gets separated and players are left fending for themselves in the middle of the wilderness. Starting from scratch, the protagonist will need to learn how to survive, fight, hunt and explore - with the final objective of finding Mia and escape from the forest.\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 [b]The Good Side[/b]\n[list]\n[*][b]Uncompromising realism[/b]\nGreen Hell is one of the most realistic, down-to-earth survival games around. The way crafting, building and generally all other activities are performed is heavily oriented towards real-life counterparts without shortcuts. For instance, crafting is always done by hand, picking up items one by one and combining them together in a slow-paced process. The same goes for building camping facilities, healing and inventory management. The game also promotes experimenting to find new recipes: if this may sound annoying worry not, it's well thought out and works brilliantly.\n\n[*][b]A proper namesake[/b]\nFull of predators, venomous animals and hostile natives, the forest can be really called \"Green Hell\". Every inch may hide deadly insects or animals, whose venoms or inflicted wounds take time and many resources to heal. Natives may decide to attack one's base in the middle of the night without warning, while infections, parasites, fatigue and madness also some of the most conspicuous enemies. The world however also houses many tools, secret locations and rich 'treasures' for those skilled enough to find a way through this unforgiving land.\n\n[*][b]Journeying against all odds[/b]\nThe main story will see players embark into daring expeditions into the wilderness, in order to find tools, equipment and resources to progress in other parts of the forest. Without any hand-holding, it's up to the protagonist to find out what has to be done next. Along with this struggle, memories and visions will accompany Jake, revealing more about his past and the events that transpired. Travel light, or build camps and outposts to have some safe haven across the forest: any approach is entirely viable, but some may be harder.

From minor annoyances such as glitchy colliders to major problems like players not getting their progress / inventory state saved correctly or enemies popping out of thin air instantly killing someone, there definitely are issues.

At first many areas of the forest are closed, requiring specific gear such as climbing hooks or diving equipment to get through. A map is available for the initial area, but it's already damaged - while for more advanced zones maps need to be found in remote places. Exploring is essential to find food, water and supplies for crafting - which will be in constant demand as players progress. The map is reasonably large and has many secondary areas which may even lead to different endings if time is taken to read the lore found.\n\n[b]Character Management[/b]\nIs perhaps the most ubiquitous activity. Four resources (Carbs, Proteins, Fats and Water) determine the character's maximum health level, and degrade over time or faster in case of sickness or other conditions. Each food gives different nutrients, so an actually balanced diet is recommended to not have debuffs. Infections, parasites and other ailments all can occur and require specific medicine for each - they can also be waited out, but survival is not guaranteed.\n\nThe inventory system uses both space and weight as limits to what one can carry, which is not a whole lot of stuff. More weight equals to more stamina consumed to travel around, which in turn means sleeping more often to regain it. Being at all times stocked with tools, healing items and food is one of the top priorities in Green Hell, otherwise survival becomes arduous. Dying means losing a part of the inventory and major durability loss on everything else, which can be recovered at the place of death.\n\n[b]Crafting[/b]\nIs done in a realistic manner either in the crafting panel (for smaller items such as tools or bandages) or on the ground in case of larger base facilities, such as house frames, smokers, racks and so on. In both cases, each component needs to be delivered manually with limited inventory capacity, so getting anything done requires time other than effort in finding the things. In many cases also, byproducts and refined materials are needed to do so, such as molten metal that requires a furnace that in turn requires many other things. Realistic, as it should be.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nIs done against Natives and Predators. It's not very complex, and has a block function / dodging to avoid blows, while also charged attacks and varied usage modes for some weapons (spears can be thrown or used in melee as example). Headshots with bows and pointy things in general one-shot without mercy, while enemies are generally quite spongy to normal hits. Armor can be made to heavily reduce taken damage, while fighting without one will result in a quick death. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2278334661\n\n[h2]Technical Corner[/h2]\n[u]Specs: RTX 2080Ti, Ryzen 9 3900X, 32GB RAM, 970 PRO NVME SSD[/u]\n\n[list]\n[*][b]Critical Problems[/b]\n- Sometimes, player positions and inventory are saved incorrectly in co-op, leading to items / progress loss.\n\n[*][b]Performance[/b]\nAverage VRAM Usage: 4.5 to 5.5 GB\nAverage GPU Utilization: 70-90%\nSettings Used: All High, Sliders Half, 1440p 60Hz\nOverall Optimization Rating: Terrible\n\n[*][b]Bugs & Other Issues[/b]\n- Instant death enemies (like Caimans) can spawn on top of players out of thin air in certain areas.\n- In co-op, chest container inventory may get glitched, showing different things from one player to another.\n- In co-op, desync problems can happen, showing dead animals alive for another player and similar issues.\n- Animations and physics are clunky, inclined to glitch relatively often.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1604667585, "timestamp_updated": 1607710652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 185, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.884710013866424561", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131997851": {"recommendationid": "131997851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015863960", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 336, "last_played": 1688591226}, "language": "english", "review": "I ate animal droppings, a human leg, a rotten unknown flower,\nput maggots in a gaping wound,\nbitten by a Goliath birdeater,\ngot high by drinking cocaine liquid,\nfell asleep in deep water and almost drowned myself,\n\nall of that in just 10 minutes of gameplay. great game.", "timestamp_created": 1675253211, "timestamp_updated": 1675253238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 153, "votes_funny": 86, "weighted_vote_score": "0.883864343166351318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126798719": {"recommendationid": "126798719", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004133202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 15338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13008, "last_played": 1712177839}, "language": "english", "review": "it's challenging at the start, but once you figure out how to survive, it's still challenging", "timestamp_created": 1669376946, "timestamp_updated": 1669376946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 110, "votes_funny": 103, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881317377090454102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96482967": {"recommendationid": "96482967", "author": {"steamid": "76561199130777566", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 75173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48665, "last_played": 1689618971}, "language": "english", "review": "Survival games have become extremely popular over the last few years, which has led to an influx of titles that attempt to offer something new and challenging. Unfortunately most fail, which has led to suspicion of \"cashing in\" when new titles arrive on the market.\n\nGreen Hell has attempted a slightly different and much more realistic take on the genre, where micro-management is key to your success. And it's not bad, really!\n\nYou see, most survival games balance their challenge with food, water and odd dangers, such as mutant babies or zombies. They scale your consumption to ridiculous levels (gallons of fluids and kilos of food every day) to supposedly balance their gameplay. By doing so, they reduce the realism of the players adventure and inject frustration in how much of a need there is to gather nourishment over all else. It seems to be the 'go to' formula for the generic survival game... Not so in Green Hell.\n\nThere's pretty much everything you could want here. A large, sprawling rain forest that's been lovingly crafted in stunning detail (imagine Crysis on steroids). There's danger everywhere, from small parasites and insects to dangerous animals. The locals are also not happy you are in their territory, so inevitably they want to disrupt your progress (in small ways) and will even attempt to engage you in combat. Not enough to make it an irritation, but enough to have you on your toes and to raise your pulse. Even simple sounds can have you imagining the worst and set you on edge.\n\nSustenance is very well integrated, with not just water or food, but a complex mixture of hydration, protein, fats and carbohydrates that all need attention if you don't want to suffer exhaustion, starvation, or even go mad and start hearing voices. Eating some foods can directly affect your sanity, such as eating human flesh or creepy crawlies. Cooking homely foods can soothe your woes and restore your sanity. All of this adds a complex and rewarding mini-game in itself. Although it can make the early days very demanding, it is a refreshing take on human needs in this genre of game.\n\nCrafting is also a real treat here. It's complex and hard work. There's no cutting down trees for 500 wood and spamming walls and items everywhere. Gathering is its own challenge, with weight issues and item availability being a core element to expansion of your home base should you decide to make one.\n\nThe list of craftables starts small, meaning you ideally need to explore to discover how to make something. You can, however, experiment with smaller recipes and stumble into their various schematics (which unlock once crafted). So common sense is also your friend here! A nice little touch (similar to Minecraft) that makes the game feel more like a simulator than a game.\n\nIllness, injuries, parasites and other disabilities are also micro managed, with a knowledge of local herbs and plants essential to a speedy recovery. You need to consider your own hygiene. Being dirty makes a difference when eating or applying medicine. The consequence of which can be gross.\n\nTLDR:\nI'm still discovering many things as I play and am amazed at the love that's been put into the development of this game. It's truly a fantastic experience for anyone that's looking for a serious survival adventure that pushes your abilities of thought and reason. It's not for the feint of heart or the impatient. I'm not even sure it can be classed as a game. Simulator is a far more accurate description, but there is a story included (EA Tutorial, with the main story being added in v1.0 Official Release), which adds purpose.\n\nExtremely well executed and highly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1627425444, "timestamp_updated": 1628101884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.88015514612197876", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140513213": {"recommendationid": "140513213", "author": {"steamid": "76561199163214997", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 6012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_at_review": 2201, "last_played": 1713074860}, "language": "english", "review": "Green Hell is a great game because it delivers on what it promises.

Harvesting resources is a matter of pressing E randomly while walking around or a few swings with an axe.  Like most survival games that use wood, you can't cut down like 90% of the trees but the trees you can cut down takes like 4 swings of the axe to drop.  Trees drop 2 logs and 2 long sticks but recipes will need 3 logs or long sticks.  You'll get at most 10 rocks in your play through so make sure you treasure them.  Food and water is a non-issue because eating random things off the ground as you travel around will not only suffice, they can and will cure any ailments you have.  \n\nYou can hear literally every threat to your well being before you see them and pull out your trusty level 1 bow to instantly kill the aggressor.  Once you have your trusty level 1 bow (something you can get 10 seconds into the game) and 2 arrows (just in case you miss your first shot), you are set to beat the game.  Once you get armor (something you can do 10 seconds into the game), it doesn't even matter if you missed your first shot as you have become immortal.\n\nThe base building portion of Green Hell demonstrates how strong mud walls and jungle tribal men are.  Tribal enemies will be able to decimate any mud wall with nothing more than a knife and 3 swings.  Sometimes the structures you build are so flimsy and porous, enemies and animals will just walk through them to attack you without damaging the wall at all.  \n\nDirectional audio is actually amazing once you get past hearing random leaves rustling, random wooden items banging around and Jake Higgins complaining about being hungry, sleepy or thirsty or simply angrily swearing every few seconds.\n\nYou start off with a watch that can do everything except wipe your rear end and assemble a plane to fly out.  You're trying to find your wife who has been a champ to put up with your 94 tapeworms and demanding sleep requirements.  In summary, the two good points of Green Hell are the directional audio and the actual story and plot.  Green Hell touts itself as difficult and realistic but the only realistic part of the game is going insane when playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1658958008, "timestamp_updated": 1659266261, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 713, "votes_funny": 1000, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878612995147705078", "comment_count": 49, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71716906": {"recommendationid": "71716906", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960379444", "num_games_owned": 880, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 2024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1594, "last_played": 1594314735}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Green Hell isn't just another survival game[/h1]\n\nMost of the \"survival\" games have very basic and simplistic mechanics with food and water.

I lost count after the first month lost in this quagmire of lush terrible beauty! On my first day I had made my way to the site of a plane crash, and found a cave that some survivor must have lived in. There was a bed ready made, and some food stuffs, and crafting supplies. I made an axe, and constructed a simple shelter outside the cave,  which allowed me to save my progress. I then made a bamboo spear and with practice I was able to down some small animals. Two banana trees nearby provided much needed nutrients! I kept an eye on my watch, and checked my nutritional needs regularly. Water was an issue here, but after I harvested some coconut shells, I was able to boil water and make it drinkable! I built some other amenities and explored the area near and far. I set up a couple of other save sites in advantageous locations so as to facilitate easy travel, and to begin alternative camp sites. I had encountered Natives a couple of times and avoided them, but I was wounded badly in a later attack and had to convalesce. Fortunately I had crafted some ash bandages earlier! I was forced to move my main base after one awful horrifying attack by a raiding group of natives. I managed to slay four from the refuge of my cave,( they will not enter caves), with my bow and arrow. I wish I had crafted more arrows but alas I ran out of ammunition and had to make a run for it as they were going to starve me out! I ran, and ran, and I could hear them howling as they chased me. They moved faster than me and knew the area well. I tried to zig zag to avoid their arrows which whizzed past my head.Finally I hid in the brush below a small rise and they ran past! I circled back and then followed a cliff line south, to an abandoned native village. I set up a temporary camp here, as it had its advantages! Now, I am in an isolated part of the jungle, accessible by only a log crossing a high ravine. The natives had destroyed everything I had built in my first camp, and so now I am rebuilding, and gathering my courage to venture forth! Come join me on this adventure!

What separates the game from the rest of the survival titles is its good understanding on how the human body requires different nutrients to be fully nourished. Food poisoning, wound infections, parasitic infections, snake bites and leeches are some examples of adversities you'll likely face. \n\nI found crafting to be very satisfying although base building leaves much to be desired. Despite the bugs, the game has a solid premise and incredible potential to outshine other survival games.

There has been a lot of \"survival\" games that honestly don't do much more than make you look for food and avoid predators/zombies. This game already puts them to shame. So, in short:\n+ Beautiful graphics\n+ Amazing realism to the survival aspect (!)\n+ The mental health implementation is very good! The voices are disturping as hell, very well done. If anything, a few visual hallucinations would be nice - just some blurryness or change of light intensity or the like. EDIT: ignore the last part. The game does contain ... something visual :). \n+ Crafting systems are nice; one of them requires self-thinking (smaller stuff like axes), the other require that you find \"blueprints\" IE seeing it build somewhere. Larger stuff like snare traps.  \n\n- You can't choose a game mode just without the indigenous people. Maybe that's just me wanting that. EDIT: this feature is coming up with the full release.\n- You get quite a couple of notification icons that are not explained. I didn't get why my health kept declining that fast, and why I had to eat so much. I had a stomach icon with a number on it. 20-something. I thought it was the number of days I had gone without fullfilling my macronutrients. Seems like it was the number of parasites. Yuck. \n\n? Some people complain about having to watch your macronutrients. I like that idea, although I think it shouldn't be necessary to fill all three up at once. If you're eating a lot of protein and fats for a few days and then change to protein and carbohydrates, then the body should still be fine. So, good idea, I like it as it is, but a little flexibility would make it great. \n? The inventory system. I personally like that you have to move things around yourself - as in real life, you can package more stuff when you think about how to put it instead of just throwing it in there.\n\nMy first experience with the easy mode: \nI didn't recognize the eat-able plants at first. I didn't know where the \"clean\" water was. I couldn't cook the meat I'd found because I hadn't had the time to make a shelter for the fire, and it's a fucking rainforest, of course the rain will put the fire out. So I got food poisoning.

It is just a very cool survival experience, which can get extremely easy though if you get the hang of it. The spirit of Amazonas Updates were free and cool. But there is a huge problem with survival mode, which is or would be my favorite game mode. \n\nThe problem is: The lack of designing your own cozy spot. Your own base. Build, build, build. Because once you explored the map which probably takes a few in game days, to find all the blueprints if you know your way around and built the stuff you need like furnace, shower, a hut etc. there is nothing left to do except to sit there and wait for nothing. It\u00b4s actually game over then in survival mode. No threats, no hunger, no thirst, no disease and worst of all: Nothing to build. The devs really have to implement more buildables, such as decorations, more housing options, more stuff to work on like clothing, bridges, carts to transport wood, totems, plants, carved bones, planting trees and bushes, more different usable materiels to find that maybe also need a workbench to work further on it. different types of weapons, more options to light your camp, maybe options to make people move into your camp or enslave them to work for you. Survival mode needs a long term motivation. Things to actually pass time after day 10.. I don\u00b4t feel like building 10 empty mud huts, it is boring and dull. Survival mode is at some point not about survival anymore but about thinking about how you can pass time. So devs, give us the opportunity to make good fun of this time. Implement stuff.

This is the game for you.\n\nSummary:\n\nFor me this game is surprisingly good, gripping story told through small amount of voice acting, visual story telling, memory sequences and found notes and voice recordings. Crafting and survival is focused and to the point. Medicinal uses of plants and balancing of macro nutrients is well designed. For the price 8/10. What let it down was that the crafting/base building felt disjointed compared to Subnautica. If that was handled better I would probably score 10/10.\n\nBug free:\nI encountered no bugs, no crashes, no glitches.\n\nWord of caution:\nBe prepared to figure some stuff out. There are very few map markers. You have to find blueprints, and in some cases experimentally figure out how to build stuff. You don't know what plants you can eat till you try them. But if you shy away from trying anything you miss out on major medicinal herbs. You will probably die or go insane, probably both. BUT after a short but steep learning curve, you will become king of the jungle. No jaguar stands a chance, you will be ready for any sickness or malady. If you are on the brink, maybe google a bit to flatten the curve. But don't spoil too much. The map is not that big that losing a bit of progress is a big deal. \n\nFirst some small negatives: \n\nSome parts with the UI and inventory are a bit finicky, but everything works. Everyone who played this probably knows the trick of opening your backpack inventory to be able to drag rain filled coconuts on your fireplace. It works, but it will not win any beauty awards. Some of my friends found the crafting not intuitive. \n\nMy main criticism:\n\nI wish the base building and crafting factored more into the story, like it did with Subnautica. How it is now you can skip the whole basebuilding and only craft minimal necessities when pursuing the story. The \"equipment\" you need to progress is just found laying around. In contrast with Subnautica where you had to build new parts of your base to make new or upgraded equipment to progress. \nYou can take lots of time to build your base with mud buildings. But when I started getting hooked by the story I was traveling fast and light, only crafting a bed, a roof, and a fire. You can craft metal objects, which is cool. I have seen Primitive Technology, cool that it is in the game. But you dont need any of it. One shot headshots with basic bow and arrow. Metal armor does make you basically invincible tho, but is too heavy if you travel with lots of stuff, and as the combat is at the moment you should have the upper hand any way.\n\nNow the praise it deserves:\n\nYou really feel like Primitive Technology guy. Chopping trees, using palm leaves to make roofs. Using your fire drill to make a fire. Rooting through the forest to scrounge up something to eat: nuts, fruits, mushrooms. Making a spear to go spearfishing. Using different plants to create bandages and medicine against poison and fever. The Macronutrient system is simple but effective. If you cant find enough of a certain nutrient you will get tired much faster. \nThe UI is minimal and you really start paying attention to the visuals and sound of the forest. Where is that plant I need, with the long leaves and the small yellow flowers? Is that the sound of a rattlesnake ready to strike, am I about to step on a poisonous spider? Is that my dinner making that noise, or is something hunting me for dinner?\nThe map and compass watch combination is well chosen. You basically know always where you are plus minus some metres, but it feels better immersion wise. But you first need to find the map ;) Be sure to note your base locations down. Only small comment is, i wish i could draw on the map.\nThe story gripped me pretty hard. This is probably very personal if you like it or not. But it felt like a real page turner for me. In the end I was rushing through the forest to find the next story beat, because I just had to know. Every location usually holds a small piece of the puzzle. Optional areas some notes or visuals to flash out the context, and the main story locations to bring it together. But the thing that drives it forward is... the pieces don't really fit. You can see the outline, and you can guess, but your guesses do not make sense, and you can't figure out how it should fit. You notice things do not add up fairly early, but things seem all out of whack near the 2/3 mark of the game. I haven't finished it, so I cannot tell you anything about the ending.
