I have no reference for where the game was, just what the devs/publisher decided to declare was a complete game. \n\nSmalland often gets compared to Grounded, which shouldn't be surprising but is somewhat misleading. It's the equivalent of saying that D&D is basically Lord of the Rings because they're both fantasy worlds. Thematically, Grounded is Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Smalland is Ferngully, and the difference in gameplay reflects each theme pretty well. \n\nOn my actual thoughts on the game, the quality of product I received from something that's out of early access is surprising. If you look at the post-launch roadmap, you can kinda see what I mean without playing the game at all: they plan to overhaul major mechanics of the game after saying it's done. In the climate of games entering early access every minute of the day and potentially never leaving, a full release is supposed to be a meaningful moment. The game should be COMPLETE, meaning everything works and works how you intend it to work. To release the game and then say \"we actually are going to completely change how taming works in a little bit\" is to declare the game isn't done and shouldn't be out of early access. If you expect a completely polished experience, as I believe you should receive from a game with a 1.0 in the corner, you will not receive that. Calling it 1.0 feels dishonest. \n\nI say the above to make clear my opinions of leaving early access too early. The rest of my review will read as though the above isn't true, knowing that the devs plan to update the game further. For all intents and purposes, let's pretend it's still in early access.\n\nResource gathering can be the worst part of a survival crafting game if it's too grindy, or resources are too difficult to move in large quantities. That isn't the case with Smalland. Even early on without the means to harvest later game nodes, it's not very difficult to gather large amounts of resources for building/crafting. Instead of encumbrance, you are only limited by the number of inventory spaces available, so running out and filling your inventory and getting back to base to drop stuff off is pretty painless. \n\nCrafting is also relatively forgiving materials-wise as well. A few consumables require pretty rare materials, but the lower tier consumables are so easy to craft and work well enough that the Greater healing potion for example isn't something you insist on having, especially since late game enemies will drop healing supplies anyway. Weapons and tools use a standard amount of materials to craft/upgrade, meaning Tier 1 weapons use a justifiable amount of T1 materials, and T3 items use a similar amount of T3 materials. Some games will say a stone pickaxe requires 2 wood and 2 stone but one made of iron requires 20 ingots and 30 hardwood or something, which is a much longer grind obviously. I don't feel like smalland has that issue of materials inflation. \n\nUpgrading weapons and armor is incredibly well done. Most weapons and armor sets can be upgraded to have stats similar to the highest tier available. If you love the poisoned mace, its actually cheaper to upgrade that to the next tier than it is to make the iron mace. If an armor set has a bonus you just can't live without, you can upgrade it to give you as much armor as the later tier armors. This makes choosing a playstyle and sticking with it easy enough, while still giving plenty of room to explore other styles without too much of a time/resource sink. \n\nRepairing things is free so long as you repair them before they lose a certain amount of durability. Even after that, not many resources are required to repair. Maintenance isn't too terrible. \n\nBase building is unique with the Great Trees mechanics. If you build a base on a Great Tree, you can then go to another Great Tree and teleport your entire base to the new tree without any time or resource cost. The issue I have with many survival crafters is the fact you spend a lot of resources building your first base up, and then realize you have a long journey to where later tier materials are available and are posed with the decision to either build a new base and abandon the first one, or have a network of smaller bases you store materials between. In Smalland, you can teleport your base to a tree closest to where you're currently farming/exploring on a total whim. This is my favorite aspect of the game without question, and I hope future survival crafters are taking notes on the QoL concept of base moving. \n\nCombat is unfortunately not the highlight of Smalland. In short, it is Baby's First Soulslike in the respect that enemies have large health pools and their attacks do heavy damage that require mastering the incredibly simple timing of perfect blocks or dodges. This of course gets mitigated entirely once you have late game armor and weapons. Enemies even the tier prior that would kill you in 2-3 hits suddenly can't hurt you enough to keep up with your health regen and you can drop them without emptying your stamina bar. The game's poor attempt at balancing for this seems to be granting every late game enemy poison damage. This is nothing more than a nuisance, not a challenge. \n\nLet's say you still give combat the fair chance it was supposed to have and don't just tank hits and spam LMB. Learning timing for perfect blocks is incredibly easy and forgiving. A vast majority of enemies have exactly one attack that's insanely telegraphed. I too often will meet a new enemy I've never seen before and never take a hit from them because I can learn the timing on the first attack. As the game throws more posionous enemies or swarms of enemies at you, combat can still feel satisfying enough to continue to later areas, but I wouldn't expect to ever really feel challenged in combat. Boss fights aren't even worth mentioning, other than those are typically the enemies that have 2 attacks instead of 1. One of them you dodge, the other you perfect block. \n\nTaming is a little silly. You unlock treats as you progress through the \"Story missions\" for better and better creatures. All you do is make the treat, attack that creature until it's below 50% health and press F. While I appreciate the taming process is expedited in comparison to something like ARK that demands real time hours for better tames, this process feels like it was slapped on last minute when the devs realized they forgot to put it in at all.  \n\nThe first mount you unlock is the grasshopper and has MASSIVE utility with its charged jumps. You can so quickly move around the map that it's not really worth swapping to the other mounts until you get flying ones. Pet combat is bad, they will attack  anything you attack and will die very quickly. You can tell them to wait somewhere instead of following you to avoid them joining you on a boss fight and dying in 2 hits, but there's currently an issue where sometimes telling a mount to wait will make them also not attack anything, even if they're being attacked. In short, I see why the post 1.0 roadmap includes a mount overhaul. My recommendation is to keep your grasshopper out of trouble until you unlock the damselfly, then only use the damselfly until you unlock the hornet. \n\nUltimately, Smalland has a lot of unique concepts and QoL mechanics that set it apart from other survival crafting games, but it's hard to justify calling it a full release and harder to justify a full release price. Combat is a means to an end at best, while base building and exploration carry the gameplay. It is an experience I don't regret spending time on, but would recommend waiting for a sale to buy, hopefully also after they get some of these post-launch updates implemented.

Updates are released with content that always feels a little under-cooked and unpolished. The game community gives feedback, that feedback is not implemented and the devs go on to the next bit of planned content without addressing the issues brought up by the players.\n[h2]Pros[/h2]\nBuilding system works and you can make some fun and impressive bases. It's not the most in-depth or broad building in a survival game but it works well and I have no complaints.\nVisuals are great, very nice to explore and look around at stuff.\nTraversal of the land is fun, grappling hook, wings, different mounts lots of options and movement overall feels pretty good.\n[h2]Cons[/h2]\nRarity system has not changed since it was implemented, it is tied to the intelligence stat which in itself wouldn't be the worst thing but if you create a legendary piece of equipment you have to maintain a high int stat otherwise when you repair it the item will downgrade from legendary quality. No one liked this system many solutions were offered, no changes were made.\nArmor is still inventory when equipped, extra slots were added so it technically isn't taking up extra space but it shows a lack of skill that they couldn't make it disappear from the inventory when equipped.\nFactions seem dead on arrival the amount of time needed to invest into them to get rewards seems like a way the devs wanted to padd out the length of the game and the rewards you get from them despite taking ten times the time to create than any other piece of equipment are the exact same so they arn't even worth the grind. [spoiler] a perfect example of this is the sword Queen's Grace you get as a reward for completing the story of the game, it looks very impressive but has the exact same stats as the viper sword you can make yourself with the only difference being 5 block power. No unique effects or anything, very underwhelming for the reward for completing the game but par for the course [/spoiler]\nThat goes into rewards in the game. Rewards arn't worth the time investment, armor is all the same, weapons are all the same with no real differences between any of them especially since you can upgrade lower tier armor and weapons to be just as good as stuff you unlock at end game. There are no unique effects for weapons, no set bonus or gear effects for armor. \"It looks cool\" could define the entire design philosophy behind the game where differences between any piece of armor are really only surface-deep.\nAI for enemies is bad and has never been changed or improved. On 1.0 release the devs reduced the player damage which in theory makes combat harder but really it just makes it take longer. There are maybe three enemies in the game with decent combat AI that makes them do anything besides face tank all your attacks.\nThe devs finally added ranged attackers to the game, but only in the final zone, they needed to go back and add weaker variants to let the player get used to fighting them and also spice up older zones.\nThe tame system for getting mounts is undercooked, they constantly get in your way when harvesting rescources and there isn't a lot you can actually do with them with most being terrible at combat and rushing int without you telling them only to die. Not all species of tames are equal with their being clear better choices and ones you'd never take for any reason other than cosmetic.\nNot enough reasons to explore (traversal and exploration is one of the few well done and fleshed out things in the game but their arn't enough reasons to explore. There are a few cosmetic things scattered around, a few unlockable weapons, and a scavenger hunt to complete midway through the game but there is so much more that could be done here)\n\nI like this game, I'm not mad about its shortcomings I'm sad because it could be so much more. Right now I'd say this game is around a 5/10 game but if they fix just a few of these issues it could easily jump to an 7, 8 or 9 out of 10. \n", "timestamp_created": 1708401388, "timestamp_updated": 1708401657, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723855972290039063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160541821": {"recommendationid": "160541821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168447825", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 144, "playtime_forever": 3696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3696, "last_played": 1710386003}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, if you plan on playing this solo.

Honestly it felt like one of the more boring survival games I played. You run around in a giant world as a tiny smalling after humanity has died out, fighting bugs and living in trees.

Some requiring hundreds of items and hours of farming just to make and repair. The faction and world events are by far the most insulting for solo players. Each world even spawns every 20 minutes and only gives you 6 points, where you need 1000 points to rank up in a faction.

There are a lot of issues with the polish of the game, initially I thought it was still in Early Access and dealt with it but after a while I've lost interest.\n\nHere are a listing of the most glaring issues that hindered my enjoyement, in no perticular order:\n- The path to the next point of progress is not clearly identifiable (and given you would be supposed to explore, the maps and it's contents is not that interesting and the movement within it is not enjoyable)\n- The spawning of creatures, even though necessary for prorer resource gathering, is extremely annoying.\n- To that effect, the resource gathering is very bland and repetitive with the only hopes of increased rewards being to find an area with more of them to collect - usually with harder creature spawns.\n- The fact the tree house building is linked to a specific character is a nice idea however this quickly becomes a problem when trying to share resources and build a common area. Inversely if you build outside of the tree to have a common area, you then need to move resources all over the map and this takes a long time (see second point above). There is no \"in between\" and to move from tree to tree you need to reach it (even if you've already been there and they don't stay marked on the map), so no \"fast travel\" to help solve this issue.\n- The item management is quite passable, The fact you can't craft from chests close by is also very annoying. In fact having to bring them over to \"crafters\" is also very annoying. All chests in tree bases should be accessible from any crafting structure within the tree and from the NPC crafters.\n- The combat is not fun - especially as soon as you're overcrowded by creatures where there's pretty much nothing you can do. The way you are locked into an attack sequence and cannot break it in any way makes it feel like a prediction game instead of a reaction game.\n- I'd like some more customization over the character.\n- I still have no clue how to assoicate clearly with factions or whatever. Right now we're guessing you have to do events as it's pretty much the only thing we didn't succeed yet, but after trying 2 and seeing the HP bars this is pretty much where we gave up on the game.", "timestamp_created": 1712162389, "timestamp_updated": 1712241613, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656147003173828125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157249583": {"recommendationid": "157249583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002869349", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1677, "last_played": 1702464906}, "language": "english", "review": "Smalland is an unfortunate title at this point because the game is very small with very little content.

Me and my friends thrive on survival craft games, we love them.\n\nThe problem with this one is it really doesn't feel like it lends itself well to playing multiplayer.\nCertain materials are needed in such abundance for a single person (metal being the main culprit), but exist on the map in such a limited quantity that to fully equip a single person with a tier of gear will take many in-game days waiting for resources to respawn. Map markers aren't shared between players. Quest progress isn't shared between players. Every person needs to do every thing. \nPets are such a great idea, but currently their AI is to literally run into you, pushing you out of the way, or attack whatever enemy is in the vicinity, regardless of how quickly that enemy is going to kill the pet. That range seems to also not be affected by walls as pets will travel far through a maze to get to a fly on the other side of the wall.\n\nCombat is very simple, and relies on parrying to do well. Parrying is easy when fighting alone as most enemies have only 1 attack (some have 2, and bosses a few more). It is substantially more difficult with allies as aggro flip-flops willy-nilly and an enemy will spin in place to suddenly attack you instead of an ally. There are even a bunch of enemies that are re-skins of other enemies. Lizards and geckos are exactly the same. Bees/Wasps/Hornets all just have the basic sting attack. \nThere are just so many mechanics that are more annoying than add anything to the game. The lift to go up to great trees takes forever to come down and up. Pets frequently fall through the lift to go up great trees or get stuck in roofs or walls. The world is so large and finally gives you decent modes of transport only to take it away almost instantly in terms of next story-steps via a hawk and literal flak cannons. Great trees encourage you to build bases there, but they can be moved so it also encourages each player to have their own base, rather than encouraging players to build together. Recipes are locked to individual players, so for a player to unlock certain recipes they have to build the buildings. You can't pool resources to build one and let all use it for that reason. Then the codex is lacking in information on unlocking so figuring out how to tell other players what they need to do to unlock a recipe you have is difficult. Level ups increase health/endurance by 1, and speed/damage by 1%, and has an intelligence stat that I really cannot tell if it does anything meaningful. I'm level 30-something after many hours and at most I could potentially have 30 more hp and 30 more stamina. Let me have meaningful level ups! The quests are almost entirely (until many hours in) go kill this thing, then talk to this person.\n\nThey've got crafting and taming improvements in the roadmap, and you can tell there's a lot of love in the world so I'm sad to say I don't recommend it, but my main question is am I having fun, and I think the answer is no.

The grind for resources isn't awful, the repair system is forgiving, combat is really bare-bones but not altogether boring. Bug animations aren't Grounded-level but they're decent. Gear progression is interesting; your armor you're going to craft at NPCs and faction leaders with the right resources, and everything else you unlock as you pick up new resources or deploy new types of crafting/production stations. The experience seems to be tailored more around RPG/exploration and less on survival, which is something I really liked about Enshrouded. On the technical side, the game seems to run well and is fairly optimized despite some minor microstutter when loading in. It even supports DLSS. Altogether I'd put it as average or slightly above for the genre.  \nWhat's absolutely *terrible* is the faction contribution system and faction rewards. To my knowledge, contribution points can *only* be accrued by completing world events, which will often have you facing a large wave of a given type of insect. This can be challenging when playing solo, sure, but the real kick in the balls is the reward for completing said world events seems normalized around 6-9 points. When you consider world events are about 20 minutes or more apart, and reward prices (pieces of armor will run you around 30-40 each or so, same with wings, and unlocking a faction-specific buff looks like it costs a THOUSAND points), we're talking tens of hours of grinding world events just to accrue enough points for one faction's rewards.  \nThis needs to be tuned. This isn't an MMO or a live service game; there's no need to have that sort of grind unless it's to artificially inflate playtime to compensate for a lack of content... which is where I think this is at, given the relatively small size of the world map. There's the red flag, and it's dissuaded me from continuing. It feels as though the devs tried to push out a 1.0 as fast as possible, even though there's more content and major adjustments in the works according to the road map.  \nI'd honestly give this a neutral rating if I could, because I cannot in good faith give it a positive rating.", "timestamp_created": 1708883019, "timestamp_updated": 1708883019, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604652822017669678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1708891884, "developer_response": "Hey!

Harvesting stuff takes longer than it should, and they even nerfed harvesting damage recently by exempting the player stat buffs from increasing harvest damage. You also need a metric ton of certain resources, and some resources are quite rare and require extensive searching.\n\nThe crafting is even worse, because there is little to no QoL to speak of. No crafting from storage that Grounded, Palworld, Valheim with a simple mod, and many more games in this genre, have. No pinning recipes to make it easier to pull out the right ingredients from your 10 chests. No hot deposit to nearby containers (Grounded has this). All in all, making the crafting process far more cumbersome than it ought to be.\n\nThe story is basically non-existent; some flavour text here and there.

As far as I can tell, you aren't pushed or required to actually do anything to progress through the tutorial phase of the game.\n\nWhat is an instant \"no\" as far as recommendation is how bad the combat is.  Enemies are LOCKED onto you, they literally slide around sideways across the surface as you move around.  Once locked on, the only way to avoid damage is to somewhat perfectly time your dodge-rolls or blocks.  If you don't, they will hit you regardless of how much range or if you're jumping....  because they are locked on, you will get hit.\n\nThe mounts are an interesting addition to this type of game, but they aren't balanced well.

You can pretty early \"cheat\" and find out how to get a flying mount pretty early which also makes a massive difference.\n\nThat said, mounts are also pretty clunky or janky at best.  You have to tell them to \"stay\" constantly other they will make it difficult to harvest resources since they try to sit on top of you while you run around.

I mean its anooying and its especially annoying when you get to the only \"gun\" in the game. You literally need to click 71 time to craft 10 ammo SEVENTY ONE!!!! (x10 sulphur, x20 saltpeter, x10(or x20) charcoal for powder, x10 powder, x5 charcocal for iron, x5 iron + x1 to craft ammo) to craft 1 banch of the ammo which you will spend faster than you craft it =) \n\nFighting is still boring after you get your first set of armor and weapons, block is useless you can just parry everything in the game with anything, so if you are good with timings you can beat the game with wooden sword.\n\nLeveling system does nothing impactfull, I 100% the game and I went full intelegence....well...I was crafting for 3 guys in my group and we crafted every single set and we only saw 3 rarity types and it was like only 20% of the gear I crafted, what is the point of that? Its like max 5% better than original stats + without intelegence you cant repair or upgrade your gear.\n\nRight from the start of the game you can unlock \"hornet treat\" aaand world is not that big anymore, with unlocking \"blue tit\" its even smaller... I mean thats one of the reasons why endgame locations feels so empty and boring.\n\nThe game was a diamond when it first came out, just tune few things, fix bugs and add new content, there was absolutly no need in adding and buffing such flying mounts they literally ruin all the fun of the exploring this huge world. At least add the setting to disable flying mounts. Blue tit must be disabled completly, hornet just a bit of the nerf to its stamina.\n\nCreature levels means nothing, leveling your \"pets\" means nothing.\n\nFactions are just pure crap. Why every single event gives you 6 points? Its like every ~30-40 mins you can farm 6 points. How the hell do you suppose to farm 1k for only ONE faction + farm for some gear to buy from them? 10 points for 5 hoods if I remember correctly, what is a point of that? You need hoods only in late game, in late game you get 5-10 hoods from the killing of NPC's + 5 hoods for 20 purite or w/e its called, that can be farmed like 500 in under 15 mins.\n\nFinal location with the final boss can be skipt entirely with blue tit, you can simply just fly straight to the boss.\n\nI mean just a few tweaks to all of that and the game would be perfect (still many tweaks for the endgame, since its super empty and boring).", "timestamp_created": 1708457004, "timestamp_updated": 1708457004, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592356681823730469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161754262": {"recommendationid": "161754262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057563156", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 355, "playtime_at_review": 722, "last_played": 1712956862}, "language": "english", "review": "Game hasn't progressed much since buying the beta one year ago.

The \"advance\" build option to move the pieces all around and rotate them to how you need is fantastic that ALONE has made love this game plus how easy and simple to sink or snap down structures. The tree house you get is super sick and you can build all in the branches just like you'd want to you can really go nuts with your building but you can also build all over the world which is fantastic. The world is really well crafted and i feel its something i havnt experienced in a game before. Now all that jazz was building but oh wait there is more the armors are really cool and unique i feel. In so many games there can be alot of armor options but only really 1 or 2 that look good and that you rock pretty much the whole game once youve unlocked them but not on this game there are like 6 i can think of that i have unlocked SO FAR that id totally rock even the lower level ones look super unique and creative. The quest and characters you met are pretty skitz and the weapons and tools are sick. Not gonna ruin it to much but one of the weapons you get is a scythe which is pretty neat nothing is better then grinding to get wings and a scythe then jumping off of your front porch way up in a great tree then flying down and messing up some punk ants on the ground. Gonna say it again i give this game a 10/10 the only thing i could humbly recommend to improve the game is a quest dialogue just something i could look at to see exactly what the last person i talked to said just so i dont have to go back to that person to ask again what they need/need me to do thats all.", "timestamp_created": 1710821596, "timestamp_updated": 1710821596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584415614604949951", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159220816": {"recommendationid": "159220816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057064034", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1708846213}, "language": "english", "review": "So this is, of course, just 3 hours-ish but, so far, the impression is...not great.\n\nThe combat is kinda stale-ish, lots of just rolling and parrying with no really varied movesets for combat. \n\nFood is...kinda pointless? Like, there's so much variety in things to eat, but there's no actual reason to HAVE that variety, all they do is give you nourishment. So, basically, just eat ant heads forever. In so many other survival games, what you eat matters. Valheim revolutionized this and many survival games are following in their footsteps. Smalland didn't. \n\nThere also doesn't really seem to be an incentive to build nice homes that I can tell. When I say that, I mean for example, some games have a mechanic where the more you decorate your house, the more bonus you get, like in Enshrouded, you gain a buff to your stamina, so you really start to dedicate making your homes nice and cozy to get the biggest buff you can. In this, it's mostly just to...avoid damage from storms/heat/cold. Make a shack with a fire, you're good. \n\nAnimations are...eh...Some bug attacks are just so fast that trying to dodge/parry them is more or less impossible, or their animation just doesn't play at all and you take damage from a stationary enemy. \n\nThere doesn't seem to be any ways to debuff your foes outside of fire and poison, so you don't really need to plan ahead for a majority of fights. Just pick the weapon they're weak against and smack them till they stop moving, basically. \n\nBug density is...intense. Really intense, I was fending off bugs more than exploring because there was just so many of them. They aren't hard to deal with, just annoying to keep fending them off.\n\nBuild from chests. Jesus christ, any survival game that doesn't have this feature drives me insane. I already know that if I continue playing, I'll need more resources, which means more chests, which means more organizing, Any time I'll want to craft something, I gotta find that thing in the exact chest.

Big issue I have there is a wolf spider is a jumping spider and in this game is far larger than way they call a jumping spider. That makes he entire encounter backwards. I fear a smaller less intimidating creature, because it is almost impossible to dodge and over powered. So while there is a good deal of creatures, they are not terribly true to life. Another example, grey flies do piercing damage, and a fair amount at that. In reality flies are not able to bit let alone to pierce a victim. They spit an enzyme that helps breakdown food that is already dead/processed, much like human saliva. So Poison damage would be a better option. There is also not a great deal of guidance on where to find the next tier of resources so getting to higher tiers of the game can be a bit of a mystery.

It looked promising from the trailer and turns out the more I played the more interested I was as I progressed more through the game.\n\nThe pros:\n\n- A theme that stands out, the world around you is mostly ordinary but it presents a good survival situation from your playable characters being very tiny. The world is vast with different biomes and an immersive atmosphere.\n\n- Easy to get into and understand, lots to learn as you play more. You got your health, stamina and hunger bars to manage as in many survival games and the rest is up to you to discover.\n\n- The freedom, as soon as you're out of the starting tutorial area you can do as you please and go mostly wherever you want. There are quests but the game doesn't hold your hand or force you to a specific route, the world is yours to explore as you want.\n\n- The combat is very satisfying, and I was pleasantly surprised by how developed it is. You can dodge, block, parry at the right moment to stun your enemies and there are different types of damage and weapons too. It adds a lot of variety to how you want to approach every combat situation.\n\n- You can customize your game exactly how you want, make it harder or easier, change the length of the season cycle as well as set the aggression of the creatures around you. There is something for everyone, be it a casual experience or a challenging word to survive in.\n\n- The building aspect, if you like making a good looking camp/base the game offers you a variety of different materials and decorations to choose from, but if not you can still keep it basic and its perfectly viable.\n\nThe cons:\n\n- The bosses and minibosses, I was hesitant to approach them on my first playthrough, but when I actually got around to fighting them I was disappointed. Most of them have one or two different attacks which isn't what I expected given how strong the combat with ordinary enemies started out. There are also creatures that I thought would just one shot you or you would need a special item to be able to beat them but that is not the case, you can just go in and defeat them if you have the health and potions to spare and you know how to block.\n\n- Mount imbalance, there are several creatures you can tame to ride and they help with travel and/or combat. But in the early to mid game I see no reason not to use the grasshopper over the others just because it has so much mobility and allows you to traverse the map very easily. It is a shame because it lessens the otherwise solid variety the game offers you.\n\n- A lack of greater reward for greater challenge: The amount of resources you obtain from fighting is the exact same on the easiest and hardest difficulties. It would be great if there were more drops or perhaps even unique drops to incentivize players who have conquered the wilderness already and want something more to go with a greater challenge.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGiven the price and what you get for it I definitely recommend the game. I give it a solid 8/10, it has a lot of good and a few bad things about it but overall its worthwhile if you're looking for a new survival game.

However, this game has a rare experience of Early Access that doesn't always happen. The developers actually listen and have made core game play adjustments based on feedback. \n\nIn my experience with multiple Early Access games, developers tend to have their idea and refuse to budge off of it, which can be fine in many cases. They added in a parry system after early complaints of combat being shallow. They wanted the players to visit NPCs to craft certain armors, but player feedback lead them to allowing most armor crafting to be done by the player. They added in boundary markers for the movable treetop bases after players realized they could accidentally build outside of the allotted space and not realize it\n\nUltimately, the game is pretty fun with a solid gameplay loop.

Progression and base building are very similar, if not identical. Combat is centered around dodging and blocking, there's no parry mechanic. Food doesn't give you health/stamina buffs, since there's a hunger/thirst bar. Food doesn't spoil, which is nice. Tools, armor and weapons can be repaired for free if they're not damaged too much. After a certain threshold you need some resources to fix them. Inventory is only slot restricted, items don't have weight. The game has RPG-like paper doll UI where items like tools, weapons and armor have to be equipped, unlike in Valheim where equipped items are still held in the inventory. This creates a slightly annoying issue I'll get back to later.\nGraphics and sound design are very respectable. Few issues with audio occlusion when you're in a player-made building, but nothing game breaking. Performance is really solid. I was getting +100 fps, locked 120 average, 1080p High without any FSR/DLSS on a 3070. All key mappings can be rebound, there's a FOV slider and all the jazz you'd expect from a PC game. Very good.\n\nIf you're not a big fan of spiders, there's an arachnophobia slider. At max value, the spiders' legs are not visible. But that's it.\n\nAnyways, off to the specifics:\n\nCombat:\n- You can't parry and there's no shield item which is weird because the game does support having two tools equipped at once, sooooo...?\n- Most encounters boil down to everyone's favorite mini-game of bar management, where you seemingly never have enough stamina to block/dodge and attack in time. Later in the game you meet enemies that apply poison DoT which pauses stamina regen for half a second each time you take damage, so the fights drag out even longer. There's stamina potions but I always forgot to use them, no idea if they're any help.\n- There's very aggressive input buffering/queuing, whatever you want to call it. Basically you can hold down LMB to keep attacking or using your tool instead of clicking. The problem is, if you don't let go of LMB right before the next swing, you've queued up another swing. This can make combat a bit unresponsive as your character does swings you didn't really want them to and you lose stamina.\n- Weapons have different damage types and enemies have weaknesses and resistances, but despite that I often found out that just spamming sword/axe is the best tactic.\n- Weapons, tools and armors have tiered upgrades. There are resources that require a tool of a certain tier to be gathered and this part works mostly as you'd expect. As far as weapons and armors go, I often didn't notice any difference when going from Tier X to Tier X+1. If you skip one tier, then the difference becomes noticeable.\n\nExploration:\n- Your character feels very slow, even when sprinting. Mounts can help with that tho.\n- The game's scale contributes to a feeling that you're not really making any progress, since most of the map looks very same-y (I got the same vibe from Grounded). In other games you can almost always notice how the scenery changes when you advance from one biome to another.\n- Your character can't swim so early on you're gonna have to get creative to get past certain obstacles. Later on you can tame a bug or craft armor with wings that makes moving around much more bearable.\n- There's no fast travel in a traditional sense. Your best bet to get home if you're far away is to quit to menu and and load back in. Later on you unlock a... Very creative tool to travel large distances quickly.\n\nSurviving:\n- Very basic. There's one bar for hunger and that's it. Food doesn't spoil, so you can just stock up on berries or whatever and you're set.\n- Unlike in Valheim, foods don't give buffs to HP or stamina. It's only function is to fill up the hunger bar, or give yourself a warmth boost during winter.\n\nBase building:\n- As mentioned before, very Valheim-y. You craft a hammer, put resources in your inventory and place building blocks one by one. If you messed up, deconstructing gives you all items back.\n- Snapping works very well.\n- There's an \"advanced rotate\" mechanic that allows you to rotate all pieces in each axis as you see fit. Very cool.\n- There's a decent amount of shapes of walls, roofs, windows etc., so if you're more creative than I am, you can make a nice base.\n- There's also furniture you can build purely for decoration, if you're into that.\n\nProgression:\n- You unlock new recipes by picking stuff up.\n- Certain recipes are unlocked after you kill a boss and deliver an item to an NPC.\n- There's no leveling in any form. No skill trees, no classes, nothing.\n\nOther things:\n- Decent amount of session customization. You can toggle peaceful mode, dropping your inventory on death. There's also multipliers for day/night cycle, seasons cycle, hunger rate, damage dealt to/by enemies and fall damage. Very nice.\n- Only punishment for death is you lose all items you didn't have equipped. There's no extra wear on tools/weapons/armor, no debuffs. You only lose your stuff and you can get it all back by going back to where you died.\n- Vast majority of mobs in the game are aggressive by default. Makes early-mid game exploration a bit of a pain, since it can be tricky to lose them.\n- ...but you can make them fight each other if you need to make a run for it or have a hard time fighting something.\n- Certain early game items (like a wood sword or a basic healing bandage) have to be crafted via crafting station. Why can hand-craft a torch and a club but not a sword, arrows or a hatchet?\n- No crafting directly from chests and no way to pin crafting recipes to the UI. I hope you like going through chests to pick up items you've written down in Notepad or something.\n- No batch crafting. Need to make 20 of an item? Get your autoclicker on.\n- Going to specific NPCs to craft armor is a strange choice. If I have to talk to an NPC to unlock a recipe, that's fine, you're rewarding exploration. But if you make me haul butt JUST to craft the armor, what's the point?\n- Since you have to equip weapons and tools from inventory to the paperdoll UI, your inventory can get very messy after some time. I like having things in order and it ever-so slightly bothers me if they aren't.\n- The grappling gun is hot garbo.\n- Bird surprise was not fun.", "timestamp_created": 1684025366, "timestamp_updated": 1684025366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 131, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.9165915846824646", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143295654": {"recommendationid": "143295654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029584875", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 7657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4766, "last_played": 1704651311}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][i]Smalland[/i] - how is it, and how does it compare to [i]Grounded[/i]?[/b]\n\n[i]Smalland[/i] is an enjoyable, if unfinished, entry into the genre of Open World Survival Crafting. As of writing this review, [i]Smalland[/i] is in early access. It is actively being updated, with a new patch having dropped this morning. \n\nFirst, the bad. Normally, I would talk about bugs, but... well... you've seen what you are fighting. So let me say that there were almost no [i]unintentional[/i] bugs, and those may soon be gone. There are features that the game is [b]sorely[/b] lacking, most importantly in the area of preventing motion sickness. The game needs an FOV slider. Even more vitally, it needs the ability to turn of first-person head bobbing and the screen shaking during storms. And to allow flying mounts (particularly the blue tit) to hover. Without these, [i]Smalland[/i] is making a lot of players sick. \n\nThere are also QoL improvements that would be nice -- such as being able to craft multiple of an item at once -- but the game already has several good QoL features including sorting and depositing into chests according to content. And I have fair confidence based on the patch today that the desirable improvements will come in time.\n\nThat's it. That's all the bad, and there isn't much.\n\nNow for the really good!\n\nImmediate high points for a beautifully hand-crafted world in this age of procedural generation. And the world is brought to life with weather and changing seasons. \n\nIn any large open world, some sort of Fast Travel is a must. But [i]Smalland[/i] opts to offer alternatives to player teleportation. NPCs will teach you recipes to help tame certain animals, some of which you can ride. You can build catapults to launch you high into the air. Which is fantastic when combined with wings that allow you to glide. A good tree-top base with multiple catapults, and I was able to get almost anywhere in short order.\n\nDepending on which direction you travel, you can get those wings fairly quickly. This is a true open world, and with the exception of the late game zone, none of the areas are gated by progression. You can encounter the NPCs and areas in any order. NPCs stay in one place and have limited dialogue, often giving a quest and and/or moving the story forward. Plus, they unlock armor schematics, including those precious wings.\n\n(Sadly, until you get wings, your only Fast Travel option is to quit to the menu and then re-enter. This will put your character back at their spawn point, ostensibly the home you are crafting. I did this a [i]lot[/i].)\n\nOne of the coolest features of the game: While you can build almost anywhere, there are a bunch of great oak trees with very big building areas on top of them, well away from any threats. After you jumping puzzle your way up your first one, you unlock the ability to claim a tree as your own and make it where you build your house. The great oaks come with a cool hot air balloon that will take you up or down so you never have to do the jumping puzzle again.\n\nThe best part, though, is that you can you can claim another tree later and your entire base will move to that location, unclaiming the previous tree. This means you can move your house to areas you want to access quickly as you progress. It's like someone looked at the C.A.M.P. system from [i]Fallout 76[/i] and said \"Let's do that, but make it awesome.\"\n\nBase building in the game is beautiful! There are a delightful variety of building pieces, and the game includes an advanced rotation option that allows you to flip pieces about for a far greater building variety than in most OWSC games I have enjoyed ([i]Grounded[/i] included). Once I unlocked the highest tier building pieces, I started tearing down the ramshackle hodgepodge I had been living in and building my true player home. And it was glorious!\n\nGiven the BIG points of similarity -- that you are tiny and you are fighting bugs in an Open World Survival Crafting game -- it is nearly impossible to avoid comparisons between [i]Smalland[/i] and [i]Grounded[/i]. Both give you a lovingly hand-crafted world to explore from the point of view of someone very small. \n\nBut the feeling of the games are very different. [i]Grounded[/i] is polished and cartoony, with Mad Scientists wielding Weird Science in a nostalgia-inducing riff on the 1980's. [i]Smalland[/i] feels more somber. You are a member of a pixie-like race existing in the world post-humanity. Some apocalypse happened to the \"giants\" some time ago, and you neither know nor care what.\n\nYour mission is to scout out threats to your people in the hear and now. Something is making the insects more aggressive. And your Queen is dying and in need of an elixir to cure her condition. These are your concerns.\n\nThe world of [i]Grounded[/i] feels more solidly put together. The sense of scale is more consistent than in [i]Smalland[/i] where ants are several times the size of bottlecaps. In [i]Grounded[/i], practically everything was fully meshed. You could jump between blades of grass, climb ferns, and use mushrooms as archery platforms. In [i]Smalland[/i], most of the non-resource vegetation is only exists visually, and several things that do have meshes (like mushrooms) are designed so you slide off them.\n\nOverall, the game is definitely worth buying and trying if Open World Survival Crafting is your jam.", "timestamp_created": 1691027537, "timestamp_updated": 1691028756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 151, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.914452910423278809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139903933": {"recommendationid": "139903933", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961466895", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1428, "last_played": 1686517182}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game for my son and I after playing Grounded together. 23 hours in and defeating 3 bosses this is my temporary opinion of it. (Keep in mind this game seems to be very early access but I see a lot of potential)\n\nPros:\n\nDoesn't feel like Grounded at all. It adds some things Grounded doesn't have such as portable bases in the form of Great Trees. Basically it allows you to move your entire bases across a decent amount of points on the map. Tamable critters, gliding (via armor), and flying (by mount). All 3 have their limitations and most end up feeling disappointing. The armor gliding though is near perfect. I use that as my primary way to travel.\n\nInstead of Cons since I presume a lot will change according to the road map I may end up regurgitating some recommended improvements.\n\nNeed to Improve:\n\n1) Combat system: It's okay but its bad. Some fine tuning on stamina drain on block/dodge is needed. You can barley manage to go any fight without taking damage and none of the fights feel good. Also would like to see shields and parry added. The way to fight right now seems to be attack, dodge, run around, repeat. \n\n2) Tames: Taming isn't as big of an issue as the tames themselves. I'm sure the Devs have heard this, I hope they find a way to fix this. The FOV when riding is doable but its bad. If some how they made ARK level tames in this... probably wishful thinking here. Buffs and utility is needed for the tames. FOV change is welcomed it feels too close. I'd also like to see having more than 1 tame at a time. If not of the same critter which I could see being too OP for the State of the game but 1 of each please.\n\nLadybug:  Health/Resistance buff needed. This is my #1 favorite tame just for the extra inventory, but because it dies so easily I have to make it not follow and use the whistle when I need it. Since it likes to run away like a coward and often gets stuck and dies. Perhaps give it the ability to fly away from dangers. \n\nGrasshopper: I don't get this bug, I'd rather walk, seriously. If jumping distance is the idea maybe have charge leap ability and set that to determine how much distance/stamina you gain/lose as result. The leap distance and nearly complete stamina drain makes it not worth it. What would make this bug really stand out is the leap ability with a glide. \n\nGecko: This guy seems okay at the level of progression. I'd like to see massive speed boost and maybe consider allowing him to scale vertical walls. Damage is fine, I feel like it should be more of a ground travel mount.\n\nWolf Spider: This guy is disappointing. The only thing going for this is ability to attack while riding. This guy needs a damage boost and ability to scale walls. The mount speed is good and if left alone would make Gecko more appealing as a traveler. \n\nI haven't tried the few other mounts left over so no comment on those. All of the tamables for sure need health/resistance buffs. They are too weak. Both the Gecko and Spider need dramatic heals after every fight against mid level+ bugs. IE. Water bugs, green beetles, wasps, etc.\n\n3) Potions: I finally got around to making these and some are useful but man the time it takes to consume them especially health potions is too long. I hope you guys are considering time it takes to consume these items. The bandages are fine and are my go to for heals. \n\n4) Quality of Life: We need auto sort badly, as well as storage labels. I would like to see auto sort buttons in both character inventory and storage boxes. Claimed Great Trees should be viewable on the map not just the one you are occupying. A way to distinguish them could be through different icon colors. Trail markers for ground level base locations. \n\n5) Progression: The Progression feels pretty good. My complaint though has to do with the items. As we gain access to better tools and weapons, I expected bigger jumps in this. The damage improved from wood - flint - chitin - metal felt too marginal. Also the durability, please fix this. It feels like the weapons/tools are being damaged at the same rate upon use. It's very noticeable when you are cheap like me building workshops every where just to repair after a few uses for free. The only difference I notice is the rate which you get your harvest due to the extra damage from better tools. A 450 durability Iron Pick Axe degrades as fast as a 450 durability metal pick axe. Might already be in the works but I hope to see item upgrades have equal opportunity. Chitin Hatchen and Spear... but then we get 3 Iron slash damage weapons?\n\nMap Size: I don't know the exact details. The world looks big but as you travel it you'd be surprised how far you can go in a short amount of time. It feels on par with Grounded. There does not seem to be any depth to the upper level of the map. All it really seems to be is just building on top of Great Trees. Most of the activity in the game takes place at the ground level.\n\nFor anyone with high hopes in this game, it might not be worth it for you right now. I'm not sure how the cost to game play ratio will turn out for me in this. For me this game was worth the cost but I don't expect it at its current state to meet the same cost to game play ratio as I got with Grounded. Hope to see this game grow and change for the better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1686506545, "timestamp_updated": 1686506545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 378, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.909056305885314941", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135866161": {"recommendationid": "135866161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030702683", "num_games_owned": 967, "num_reviews": 161, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1704858795}, "language": "english", "review": "I happened across this while poking around an email I got from Humble Bundle about new releases and was surprised to find it flew under my radar. I am an avid player of Survival/Crafting games (my favorites including Valheim, 7 Days to Die, and Raft among others) and I try to keep up on the upcoming ones but while Nightingale and Return to Moria were definitely in my 'keep an eye on' list I hadn't even heard of this one until it's release.\n\nIntrigued by this however, I decided to give it a go, and I can say I'm quite pleased with my purchase.\n\nI've had some friends compare Smalland to Grounded in that both games offer a similar setting. You're someone very small living among the insects, where even blades of grass are akin to a mighty oak tree, but really thats where the comparison ends. So for those of you who HAVE played Grounded, here's where Smalland differs.\n\n1. [b]You Are Not Human.[/b] In Grounded you played a human child shrunk down to a height measured in centimeters. In Smalland, you're not now nor were you ever human. You play one of the \"Smallfolk\" who live in underground societies and view humans as \"giants.\" One other thing that differs is that Smallfolk have antennae that allow them to sense nearby enemies and resources (default key is V for this) which works as a \"scanner mode\" akin to the Detective Vision from the Batman: Arkham games.\n\n2. [b]The Setting Leans More Fantasy[/b]: In Smalland's story, the queen of the Smallfolk has fallen horribly ill and your king has charged you to travel to the surface (the Overland) and attempt to find a cure for her. Rather than science fiction like Grounded, this brings back many fond memories of old high fantasy comics I would read in my childhood back in the late 1980s and early 1990s (infact the character design reminds me more than a little of Elfquest.)\n\n3. [b]Weather Plays a Major Factor[/b]: In Grounded it was always a bright sunny day for the most part. You had to worry about the poison gas in the Haze biome or the extreme heat in the Sandbox, but thats it. In Smalland something as simple as a rainstorm can spell doom for your pint-sized protagonist as surely as an ambush by a swarm of hungry warrior ants. Get caught out in the elements without proper protective gear and watch your plucky pixie freeze to death.\n\n4. [b]Tame the Wild Grasshopper[/b]: Grounded had a little mechanic where you could tame small insects as pets, but Smalland takes it a step further. You can tame a grasshopper to use as a mount and ride it across the land as your faithful steed! I also noticed in the upcoming planned features that they are going to expand on this, perhaps even adding flying mounts. I did see a dragonfly buzzing around come to think of it...\n\nSo yes, while similar to Grounded, in terms of theme and feel its quite different on many counts. Bear in mind this JUST released on early access at time of writing (the first week of April 2023 for those coming in late) but after about an hour and a half of play I had to say it was a VERY promising beginning.

Unlike Valheim, doesn't have boats, but it does have gliding wings (once you unlock them) and insect/gecko mounts. The mounts are a little awkward or buggy (heh heh) to ride for now, and I didn't get much use out of them in their current state, but the gecko was pretty cool to keep by your side after the first boss because he's such a good fighter against the easy bugs while you're still fairly weak.\n\nThe bosses get fairly hard, but beatable with better weapons/armor/potions, in single player, but I haven't played in multiplayer yet to know whether they're easier, or if their difficulty scales up.\n\nBuilding is pretty fun, it has a variety of shapes for each of the building materials, as well as allowing a variety of rotation/locking which allows for some creativity.

This is to give you an idea of what I have seen so far. \n\nOk, honesty time. I have 12hrs in the game on a mulitplayer world and solo. Does the game have potential? Yes. Does it need improvements (but that is what early access is for)? Yes. My wife and I play lots of survival games (7Days, Icarus, Raft, Ark, Dinkum, Fallout, The Forest, Sons of the Forest, Green Hell, etc.)  \n\nHere are the issues I have found so far that need to be addressed: \n- DLSS setting makes things like grass and your weapon blurry when moving (using a 3090).\n- NPC chat menus are drawn out. As reference, when talking to the owl or fairy controlling the lift, its constant reassurance that, yes this is the action I want to take. \n- The world is VERY overpopulated with every insect that wants to kill you. As reference, just to go from a tree to an NPC you travel through and fight, two swarms of five wasps, two big red ants, five spiders, four cockroaches (just as an example and the enemies grow if its nighttime). \n- You cant swim in water which is fine, but there are areas you can't even build across to cross the water.\n- Jumping is very elongated. It has a long hang time and if you bump something while jumping it has a rough bounce back.\n- Multiplayer is purely an individual game. This means that if there is an objective (kill a beetle) it has to be done as many times as there are people in the server.\n- Recipes do not share while in multiplayer. As with above, all recipes have to be learned by every individual. This means food, weapons, building supplies, etc. \n- You cannot craft anything in you pocket after making the basic axe, club, etc. Not even bandages. This means no excursions into the wild as there is no way to make more bandages or fix your weapons without going back to your tree. (Higher tier weapons I get, but fixing your low tier wood tools and making bandages is basic pocket stuff.)\n- There is no indication on how much damage your structure has taken in the storms. You just have to go around with your hammer and try to fix every single item you've built.\n- There are no perks to level your character. \n- Riding insects prove to be more of a hassle than  they are worth as they cannot come up to your tree with you nor is there an option to use their attacks to fight things while navigating. You have to get off and fight with your gear while your insect tries to fight and is attacked. \n- There is no indication while building whether a wall or ceiling piece is structurally sound. The only thing you get is when you try to attach another item, it says not enough support. Well without an indication system, there is no way to tell which area needs to be reinforced. \n- You cannot (as far as my experiments have gone) add vertical supports from the base of your building up to your roof to add more supports. Think of Valhiem, 7Days, or Icarus where you can add vertical posts to add stability to your structure all the way up to the roof. \n- There is no tech tree to show how to progress further. Its a guessing game when you pick something up or build something if it will unlock more items. \n\nI think that is everything I have seen in 12hrs of play. It is a good start to a game.

Perhaps allow players to make cosmetic ones, or find some other niche to make NPCs relevant?[/td]\n\t[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h3]Gameplay + 0.5[/h3]\nYou're tiny, so tiny grasshoppers boldly fight you. Your objective is to survive, and maybe do some other things for your people while you're up here. To that end, gather, craft, set up a base, and fight stuff to gather, craft, and set up a new base somewhere else so you can fight stuff to... you get it. Progression has a few hiccups that aren't really well explained (like the rewards from boss turn-ins) and the middle to end gets a bit grind-heavy if you plan on doing any large structures (or build a lot on the ground - moreso if solo). These issues are also alleviated in multiplayer, where different weapons and targets increase survivability against insects considerably, thus allowing for better gathering returns.\n\nThe insects are actually pretty tough, and though you can block with weapons, there's no shields - your offhand can hold a torch however, which is great for night fights (otherwise plop a campfire down real quick - you don't take damage standing on it anyway!). Attacks have decent telegraphs, but it's almost always better to dodge backward than side to side, as many attacks still hit in a wide area, but lack lunge range to that distance. This changes slightly against some shoreline enemies, but by then you can cope a bit (start from range). Boss fights are done in the same way, and were challenging to overwhelming, but could be thwarted in various ways and were obviously meant for groups.\n\nBuilding in this game looks and feels pretty good as well. The hammer unlocks your pieces, and you have the basic foundations/walls/roofs starter package available in leafy green... leaves. It fits the theme, and looks decent with further upgrades later as well. I don't want to spoil too much, but the lighting options were also thematically pleasing - but they need to have their brightness level turned up, as they don't serve much point beyond accent lighting, and I'd like environmental lighting more akin to the basic torch as an option.\n\n[h3]Immersion + 1.0[/h3]\nThe game does a pretty good job setting up the basics and dropping a few lore tidbits as you find your footing in the world. Building armor and bases all keep the nature themes, and the size difference results in some silly things like blackberries the size of medicine balls or large, discarded keys serving as visual waypoints.\n\nBut no shields? No swimming? While it's been said these creatures lived underground and didn't get much exposure, I'd like to state that large bodies of water exist underground, too.\n\n[h3]Graphics + 0.5[/h3]\nThere's a slight artistic liberty taken with the otherwise semi-realistic style they have here, and I think it actually works better in motion than it does at a standstill - there are lots of little touches that make insect motion feel animated and tree branches sway. Structures for building also look detailed, and though limited in supply, various decor options add a pleasant touch.\n\n[h3]Audio + 1.0[/h3]\nAudio is crisp and well done, with enemies having nice chittering effects, flapping wings, and telegraphs when they sting. There's also a bit of effort put into the storms, which were a nice touch the first time and continued to sound powerful outside while I huddled in my shelter.\n\n[h3]Performance + 0.5[/h3]\nThere's some weird hitbox detection things: enemies cleaved split damage between them rather than taking total damage each, and anything on an elevation above or below can usually hit you, but you can't hit it.\n\nWe had some issues in multiplayer with disconnects early on, but the biggest issue we had was joining and not being able to see the host's map markers - or any map markers at all, while not being the host. Once you're familiar, this is slightly less of an issue, but as I first started the game after joining a friend on their world, this bug convinced me that there were no markers and thus no ways to help orient myself early on! I was pleased to learn later this wasn't the case (and they showed up when reconnected later), but it was a bit of a struggle early on.\n\n[table]\n\t[tr]\n\t\t[td][b]\ud83d\udd01Content/Replay[/b][/td]\n\t\t[td]High - There's a pretty straightforward quest line which is decent if short, but the path to seeing it through is riddled with smaller adventures, and that's where games like this shine - and this one is no exception.[/td]\n\t[/tr]\n\t[tr]\n\t\t[td][b]\ud83d\udcb0Pass, Sale, Buy?[/b][/td]\n\t\t[td]Buy - Did you like the concept of Grounded but preferred it played like Valheim?

It's better than it was, but it has a way to go still. But then the Developers have made it clear they're planning to make that effort. \n\nIt took me this long to get to that because I had a serious motivation problem due to people constantly making posts saying that I was just complaining that the game was too hard (which, really, I'm not. I mean, FFS the game lets you tweak the difficulty of your world. It even has a peaceful mode where creatures are completely passive until you attack them first. If my problem with the issues I identified were 'it's too haaaaard' I'd just turn that on). \nTo the point that I started deleting comments that said nothing but that and started delaying playing the game to update my review, because I did not want there to be even a 0.0001% chance that some twerp telling me to 'git gud' believed they'd successfully bullied me into changing my review to positive if it turned out that the issues were fixed.\n\nBut then I realised that that isn't fair to the developers and, really, isn't letting them get to me like that just a different way of letting them win?\n\nSo... Yeah, here's the review edited for the current state of the game.[/i]\n\nI would avoid this for now.\n\nA lot of the positive reviews for Smalland talk about its potential and they're correct in that the game has a lot of potential to be really good in the future. But future potential is not the same as current reality.\n\nAs it stands, the game's map is very large and there's a lot to explore... But a large part of that size lies in verticality. The map is obviously designed from the point of view that as you progress you unlock mobility tools (there's armour pieces with wings that let you glide, a grappling hook and presumably the eventual option to tame flying mounts). Unfortunately, those mobility tools are both essential to making getting around the map less of a slog... And completely unavailable right at the start of the game. \nWhich means that for most of the early game, you have to get around by running everywhere.\n\nAnd running everywhere highlights several other problems:\n- There are way too many aggressive insects and once they aggro, they will follow you ridiculous distances. The only way to disengage from an insect that has decided it wants to attack you is to sprint away and it often takes between almost a full bar of stamina to [i]over[/i] a full bar of stamina to get far enough where they will stop chasing. \n[b]This is still the case. The chase range still feels quite a bit too high.[/b]\n- Even when you eventually get good enough gear to where you no longer have to run from the swarms of various species of Ants that litter the map, the combat system is bad enough that even if you have weapon that kills them in two or three hits, they will also hit you a bunch of times as you take them down. Which means that you're constantly drained of healing items and weapon/armour durability just getting from where you decided to build you base to where you want to explore or gather resources. And while these ants provide some useful starting foods, they don't provide anything else, so you're not exactly getting much in return for the resources you're wasting having to fight them just to navigate the map. \n[b]The parry mechanic has somewhat improved this. While it's not actually that effective against the ants I'm talking about in this point (since those are individually weak, but drain your resources because they swarm you so that you can't dodge or block one of them without opening yourself up to an attack from one of the others), those ants aren't a real threat anyway. It works wonders against the various Beetles, Gekkos and solitary Spiders you might run into.[/b]\n- The inventory is ridiculously small. Another negative review pointed out that this game requires a lot of grinding. This is largely due to inventory size. Resources stack up to a maximum of 30 (and many 'products', like cooked food or healing items, have a stack size that's smaller than that) and the toolbar is not a separate inventory. So... Each and every tool, healing item and food item you're carrying with you (with the exception of whatever tool you currently have in hand) takes up an inventory slot. And not only do different resources require different tools, but different enemies have different weaknesses that require different weapons and if you don't use the most efficient weapon for a given enemy, it takes a lot longer to kill them, which costs more durability on your weapons and armour and more healing items to keep yourself alive. All of this stuff you have to carry with you when you leave your base, so even if you stick to carrying solely the essentials for your journey and leave everything else in a (couple of) chest(s) in your base, your inventory will already be between a quarter and a third full.\n[b]The realisation I had as I was playing the game again is that in addition to all the tools and healing you have to carry, the inventory feels small because in gathering the resource you need, your inventory will also constantly get clogged up with resources that you don't need (or don't need as many of. This isn't an issue exclusive to Smalland, lots of similar survival builders have this, but that doesn't make it less of an issue, particularly when combined with the other factors.[/b]\n- {i[I'm condensing the bullet points on tames into one point, since that is the area that the developers seem most focused on in the future and it's what's most likely to drastically change over future patches. With the latest patch, tames are more durable and being able to have more than one tame waiting at your base is a huge boon. This is a good development. But (You knew there was going to be a 'but', didn't you?) the way that switching your active pet works does still have some QoL issues. You can very easily and cheaply craft a pet whistle that lets you call your active pet to you no matter where it is on the map and it will sorta teleport to you. But in order to switch your active pet, you have to go up to your current pet, tell it to stop being your active pet, then go to the pet that you want active and tell it to become active.  Logically this makes sense... \nBut in pure gameplay terms it means that if you want to go somewhere to gather a lot of resources with a ladybug, you'll have to go there on foot. And if you don't want to risk it getting killed by the hostiles you'll be passing on the way back to base, you'll still have to leave the ladybug out in the open somewhere and hope it doesn't get killed by randomly wandering hostiles instead. Tamed pets have double the hp of their untamed counterparts, but for a ladybug that's still not a lot of health.\n\nIn closing, Smalland has a lot of potential. but most of that potential lies in what the developers [b]can[/b] do with the world they've built and it remains to be see whether they [b]will[/b] do those things or not.\n\nHowever... They're really showing promise. \n\nIf you don't think any of what I've pointed out sounds like a problem, I can recommend Smalland for you. \n\nIf you do think it's a problem, I can't recommend getting it for now, but I [i]can[/i] finally recommend keeping an eye on the game, because I'm confident that the developers are dedicated to improving these aspects as much as they can. (And the only reason I don't recommend getting it now, despite my confidence that the developers want to improve it is that early access always has an element of uncertainty and while I fervently hope that the developers don't run into issues that leave them unable to get the game to its ideal state, I can't guarantee that and I would be steering people wrong if I acted like I could).", "timestamp_created": 1685306216, "timestamp_updated": 1687895912, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 361, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.827040135860443115", "comment_count": 32, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1685446568, "developer_response": "Hey there's a lot here that's super valid, in the coming updates we'll be addressing most of this in a symbiotic way to give you more inventory, mobility,  and travel options with a creature overhaul on it's way too!"}, "135674393": {"recommendationid": "135674393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805825177", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 782, "last_played": 1708049890}, "language": "english", "review": "I received a copy of the game from the publisher/developer about a week before release. Personally I've grown tired of early access survival games as many of them launch with very little content and ultimately end up taking much longer than initially planned to be completed.\n\nThat said Smallands has far more content at launch than most early access survival games I've played over the past 5 or so years. Here's a quick list of pros and cons from my time playing the game:\n\nPros\n\n- More than adequete amount of content for an early access launch\n- The map is much bigger than I expected\n- Combat is pretty solid with the only issue being movement can feel a bit floaty\n- There's a wide variety of building choices and building matters because items and structures will degrade over time if not under a roof\n- Progression feels good in the early part of the game and requires you to explore further out and take on tougher enemies\n- The game launched with a roadmap for the first major update as well as future content\n\nCons\n\n- The map can be hard to navigate as it has very little detail and there are many places with environmental barriers that can't be passed (i.e. rock walls that are too steep)\n- Death is punishing because you leave everything not equipped on your gravestone and you'll likely die to fall damage frequently if you aren't careful and due to the floaty movement of jumping\n- Game is planned to be finished in 6-12 months but based on how long it took to get to this point (5+ years of development including switching developers) I believe this estimate is far too ambitious\n\nI'll end it with this. If you like survival games and don't mind early access this game is worth playing right now. There's more than enough to do to justify the price. If you want a complete game and don't want to wait and see if updates occur as planned put it on your wishlist and check in periodically to see how early access has progressed.\n\nIf you want to see my full review of each of the games systems here's a quick video covering them: https://youtu.be/twZ2e5AI2FM", "timestamp_created": 1680095502, "timestamp_updated": 1680095534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 219, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804913878440856934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142524494": {"recommendationid": "142524494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047886213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3486, "last_played": 1689973578}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, sooo my entry into the world was a bit rough... Terrified of everything around me, I ran for my life to the first npc beyond the elder's big tree. Absolutely everything tried to kill me along the way. Ants, roaches, bees, grasshoppers, and of course my least favorite, the water... Oh boy, the water. It was a struggle, but I made it. After finally reaching the first npc I was rewarded with some well earned crafting recipes, and to my surprise, the first of many unlocked armor sets.  This was the exact moment I became addicted to Smalland. \n\nSmalland is a beautiful balance between killing, crafting, collecting and bossing. There are bugs to tame and many bio-oms to explore. Quests to complete and respect to be earned as you strive to find the Elder's stolen seal. If you're scared of spiders I must warn you that there is a whole area absolutely filled with a variety of them. Let's not mention the matriarch spider boss... yikes. \n\nMy favorite aspect of the crafting system is the tree encampment system. If you claim and build a base at one of the tree encampments, that base can be teleported to other tree encampment locations, allowing the user to have a moveable base. This allows for quick bug kills and resource collection when you're ready to grind for your armor sets and workbenches.\n\nIf your friends tag along their character progress transfers across all locally hosted servers. This also includes tree encampments! When your friend builds a base at a tree encampment it can be teleported to ANY server's tree encampment. Pretty nice to not have to start over every time you join some friends. \n\nOverall, Smalland is a really great game with active devs looking to release a solid product.

Now that 1.0 is released, I started over and played through all of the content AGAIN plus the new stuff, so you don\u2019t have to. Long story short, nothing was fixed. So here is the updated review tearing it to shreds.\n\nLet\u2019s start off with the elephant in the room \u2013 Palworld sent this game to abyss. It is better in every way you could possibly imagine. If Palworld is Ratatouille, Smalland is Ratatoing\u2026. look it up. This is pretty evident when 22% of the player base reached the end of the launch content, but only 2% have done anything released after.\n\nHere is everything you should be aware of:\n\nThe Map\nI don\u2019t really know where to start with this. It\u2019s almost impossible to get across (pun intended) how unbelievably not-fun this map is to navigate. It feels like the developers made every attempt possible to make it more and more annoying to traverse. Ridiculous fall damage, can\u2019t swim, and can\u2019t climb are just the tip of the iceberg here. The biomes and caves are also complete fails.\n\nStatic World\nWhen you first enter the game, the world may feel alive, but it isn\u2019t. All creatures have permanent set spawns & set spaces to occupy. Meaning you will literally find the same number of the same creature in the same spot 100% of the time. It makes finding certain creatures perfectly reliable, but makes the world unbelievably boring after a few hours.\n\nLack of Story\nThis might be the laziest attempt at a story I\u2019ve ever experienced. There isn\u2019t anything to talk about since a story doesn\u2019t exist. No lore or things left behind by other Smallfolk, or the Giants from the past beyond a few non-interactive map features. Nothing to explain the nature of the world, no side quests, no secrets (except 2 not-so-hidden weapons that no one cares about).\n\nInventory\nPossibly the worst inventory I\u2019ve seen in a survival game. No weight mechanics. All of your gear and quick select stay in your main inventory which takes away tons of space and is unsightly. The quick select is 10 slots but the inventory is 8 slots across, so organizing it is out of the question. OCD nightmare.\n\nCombat\nBad and boring. The only way to really make progress is to grind better gear and brute force with healing items and death scum. \n\nBoss Fights\nEasily exploitable aggro range, predicable moves, and progress is kept upon death. Can easily just run in, attack, die, & respawn close by - which just trivializes all of the fights. A 1.0 release without some kind of boss arena is just par for the course with this game.\n\nProgression\nGoing through the \u201cstory\u201d is just talking to NPCs and fighting the previously mentioned terrible boss fights \u2013 with a few horribly tedious fetch quests traversing the terrible terrain.\n\nBuilding\nWhy do games always insist on using a god-awful building hammer? There is a normal crafting button that builds the first 5 items (including said hammer) then it is never used again. Everything with this dumb hammer that solely exists to take up a quick select slot. Placing structures is easy enough, but there really isn\u2019t any point to the higher building tiers beyond creativity. Since the world is so static, it is trivial to find a benign location to build a base (or a tree) so why anyone would waste their time with anything beyond fiber structures makes no sense to me. \n\nCrafting\nHave to craft different items from a bunch of different crafting tables, and can\u2019t craft from chests. I\u2019ll state the obvious \u2013 it\u2019s annoying.\n\nLack of Battle Mechanics\nYes, there is poison. But where is Bleed? Burn? Wound? Slow? We'll take anything else that isn't poison.  \n\nSurvival/Healing Options\nThe game has a quirk where if your \u201cFood\u201d bar drops below 70 then you no longer regenerate health. So, there is an incentive to always keep your food above 70. Basic food fills your food bar by 30. The \u201cbetter\u201d food fills more, but you never need more. So, the basic mushrooms are the only food you need to worry about the entire game, anything else is a waste of time.\nThe fiber bandages are fine for basically the whole game, then enemies start dropping better stuff for you.\n\nTree Bases\nNever saw the point. Being able to move your base around is cool, but it is so inconvenient traveling up and down the tree constantly. Plus the endgame areas don\u2019t have trees, so it\u2019s really useless. \n\nArmor\nRaise your hand if you\u2019re tired of spending time creating the look of your character just for the mandatory generic armor sets to hide your efforts. I can say they did at least fix the part where we had to have the NPCs craft armor for us, but the gear is still generic and grindy.\n\nWeapons/Tools\nThe tool progression is really unbalanced in the beginning. Wood is too hard to come by before the flint hatchet. It\u2019s also difficult and unintuitive to find the stone/flint/iron/clay you\u2019ll need to make any progress in this game. Early tools should be more useful.\nWeapons are strange as well. There are a ton of weapons that do \"Edged\" and \u201cBlunt\u201d damage, but the game just seems to forget about \u201cPierce\u201d damage somewhere along the way.  No Shields? Bows are all similar and have ridiculous grind for basically no improvement. What is the point of Fire Arrows that don't light anything on fire? The catapult is such a waste of time. Are we serious with how bad the Grapple Hook is? Most of the useful stuff you get is all the way at the end of the game, so you can\u2019t even enjoy it.\n\nCharacter Customization:\nIt\u2019s nice that this was added, but after playing through all of the content, it doesn\u2019t feel like it does anything. The improvements are so minor, they barely affect the game-play at all. An afterthought feature implemented horribly.\n\nLack of Fast Travel\nYour only means of fast travel is to quit and reload since you always spawn at your set spawn point when you start the game and not at your previous location. This unintended cheese is the only way you\u2019re getting around quickly in this game.\n\nTaming:\nAbsolutely pointless. The time it takes  to tame anything is nowhere near worth it. I seriously lol\u2019d when I saw how ridiculous the requirements are for the bird. The devs really go out of their way to make it not fun.\n\nCreatures\nLots of repetitive creatures. There are literally 4-5 different hornets that are just rendered different colors and the beetles all have the same attacks.

Why would you ever upgrade from a wooden sword, unless you plan to carry around the Material for a work bench to repair your weapon after literally EVERY fight.. \n\n2) Combat is clunky, You swing at an enemy next to you and miss, yet the enemy attacks from 50ft away and hits you. If you plan to block, you have to stop everything your doing and wait a good 2 seconds and time it perfectly, because the animation isn't accurate.\n\n3) Players are expected to travel wayyyy far south, past pretty tough enemies, to find Flint and Bark on the Beaches.. however, most enemies don't ever give up the chase, unless you find some where to cheese them. Once on the beach you can only mine Flint at first because Bark requires Flint tools, and good luck finding Seeds to make Seed oil, and refine wood.\n\n4) If you're playing alone, in your own world.. you cant pause.!?!? Why.. \n\nWhat would help the game currently?\n\n1) Pausing in single player worlds\n2) Durability fixes for all tools and weapons\n3) A better map, with clearer paths wouldn't hurt..\n\nHere's to hoping the game gets better with future patches & updates.", "timestamp_created": 1680145594, "timestamp_updated": 1681239333, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 658, "votes_funny": 42, "weighted_vote_score": "0.783212602138519287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1680274778, "developer_response": "Hello!

You might not mind, but I do. If those things are changed I will change my review. Until then: It is negative because I do not think it is worth playing in current state. While bugs aren't the issue, it is missing a lot of things other early access games had at launch. Doesn't mean I think its horrible or bad or not worth it at all - it means in its current state, things are janky and rickety and some things are not currently worth it or missing and can make or break the game. Chill out. \n\nI'm almost on an \"Eh\" for this. That being said. Would I recommend it? Somewhat - but with caution.\n\nThe game is fun, it's beautiful. The bugs are realistic, the character models are pretty good and all around it's a fun game. \nSort of finished it, playing co-op the entire time with my husband. Here's my personal opinion/things I noticed.\n\nThe positive:\n\n-The buildings look good, it doesn't take much to build a relatively large base. The materials are easy to get and it didn't take too long for me to build it up.\n-Along with building: movable tree bases. Claim a tree, build a base, find another tree on the other side of the map? Base moves to that tree. It works well and is nearly seamless! Downside - the trees have a rideable blimp and if you're trying to get back to help a coop buddy, could be like a 5 min run just to get down from the tree\n-Seasons! So few of these games have seasons! Seeing everything covered in snow and worrying about weather was really cool! The map is beautiful!\n-Combat: The bugs are somewhat hard, but it wasn't terrible. It does tune to your  players so they get harder if you have a coop. So be careful venturing alone as suddenly you're fighting an enemny with nearly double the health alone\n-Armor: really cool looking, the weapons look nice, there is a nice variety with the animations being really good!\n-The pets are really, they have a use and there is mounts. More of that below\n\nThe not so good (though some of these could potentially be easily tweaked/fixed down the line\n-Water. It's mentioned. You can't swim. While this isn't necessarily game breaking, you die instantly if you fall in. That means if you fall in on accident by sliding off a rock you're dead. That's it. You have to find your body somewhere at the edge of that same rock. It's irritating considering the movement is somewhat floaty\n-Coop - while it works well, you dont' share progress. Example: Me and my husband killed a boss, only he got the loot, only he got credit. It wasn't an easy fight and we'd have to do it again for me to get the same credit. There is no way to group, no way to ally or anything. You are two players on the same map.\n-mounts/pets: There is mounts and pets you can get though they are relatively useless. You can tame a lady bug but it doesn't ave any more health than the wild ones do, in other words you can one shot it on accident or something else can. My first two tames were tossed into the water by a passing grasshopper that wasn't even attacking it directly. You can't control each other's tames or mount together on bugs that are pretty clearly big enough for you both, but minor gripe. Just means I can't rescue my husband's pet if he does since I can't move it.\n-Armor - isn't craftable. You have to find the npc, see what they need, leave, go across the map f**ing off 50000 miles to get the ingredients you need, come back to buy your armor. With some of them being cold/hot based some might be useless when it's winter since you're going to be freezing - though not a huge deal\n-gathering materials: the first big upgrade you need is way too hard to get being between a bunch of higher level/powerful bugs and it was a lot of dying trying to just get the first upgrade to be able to fight those bugs\n-bugs have weaknesses to weapon types (slashing, piercing, etc) not a huge deal, but it requires you to carry like 4-5 different types of weapons at all time. It gets annoying. Inventory space is somewhat limited so the first row of your inventory + food, healing items, any tools you need plus some extra building just in case items - 1/3 of your inventory is just necessities leaving you not much space for looting. Please, please please devs stop doing this! Let me have my 'tools' hotbar, at least one not count as inventory space and have it be just hotbar! Omg it'd solve so many annoying issues. It's like valheim where your equipped stuff stays in your inventory.\n\nOne final request/gripe I have that's more personal choice. I want the option to customize my server. Let me make drop rate higher, bugs easier, I don't want to drop stuff on death, days longer, seasons shorts, etc. Every other survival game allows this. Let me play my lan game how we want. If I want it super cheesy or if I want to suffer, let me choose.\n\nThat being said, I was in the original Alpha and bought this on release, and I'm still sticking by to hopefully see some changes.

There's a peaceful and regular mode but hopefully more options will be added in the future. But for now if bugs feel overwhelming you can go peaceful at any time. Then they will only fight back if you attack them first.\n\nYou get a gravestone that holds you stuff when you die and you get to keep the item you're holding to do your death run back. This is less punishing than many survival games where you have nothing after death or where your stuff can fall all over and despawn. You can have many graves if you keep dying with stuff.\n\nExploration is rewarding and the environment very pretty. You can follow the quests by npcs or venture off into the unknown into the harder areas before you're ready. The game wont stop you but it's not the best action. You get better gear from npc quests. I love the different bioms so far.\n\nI love that it has seasons and weather. You get enough warning for a bad storm to erect a shelter to wait it out or return home if you're close. There are different armors to deal with the cold and hopefully they'll be some heat mechanic later as well to deal with maybe in certain areas if not in summer specifically. Fires warm you just fine it just takes a bit of time. There are also warming foods you can take with you to keep exploring. Don't start a boss fight if the weather isn't great since bad storm might happen.\n\nThere's a decent amount of choices in character creation. Maybe they'll add more. It doesn't matter that much since you will be covered by armor most of the time.\n\nMy only real gripe is there being no pause in single player. This is an issue since every time you log out you then spawn back at your base and would then need to cross the map again to where ever you were. This is a very real issue for some of us who are prone to interruptions. I really hope single player pause gets added.\n\nThere's lots of different building sets, tools and armors. It's free to repair things as long as the durability is still green. The lower it goes the more it'll cost. The materials to make a bench to repair are cheap and easy so you can repair in the field but most of the time you'll be fine if you repair each night.\n\nIt's beautiful and part of that is because not all foliage has collision. This is fine. Mammals are denser than insects even small ones. That leaf you wish you could stand on likely wouldn't hold you any way. I think this is far better than the plastic blades of grass in Grounded. I like a game that looks nice. And since I've seen some confused, the small \"grass\" all around is moss. It's even got those little spore things coming out of it.\n\nI feel plenty small in this. You fell like something naturally small which you are. You are a natural creature out in nature not someone who was shrunk down surrounded by human things. I think it's done well and the scaling is very consistent.\n\nThe story is very basic. The npcs just help you progress and provide minimal lore. It's more focused on the survival aspects which is fine by me but they do plan more npcs so maybe more will get added. If you want a new sort of survival game this is a good one.\n\nNo there's no swimming but there's literally no reason to have it. There's no under water labs or anything of use. You'd just use it to cross the \"rivers\" which would lessen the game since you'd not need to parkour across or find that log bridge. Maybe they'll add a late game water skimming mount in the future but I don't see a need for early game swimming and it would actually lessen the experience.\n\nIt's good to have some difficulties traversing the map on foot. It makes a tame to help you travel more valuable and the environment more challenging in a realistic  manor. You have to parkour up to claim the first tree base. This game is meant for the environment to be challenging.\n\nTames need work but that's on the road map. They need more health or armor or something but it's still fun to do. You just need to be careful with them. Use them for travel and keep them safe instead of for fighting. At least for now. You can only have 1 right now but they will add stables soon and then you can keep more. Right not the tame is tied to the character so spawns with the character into a world. So multiple would get awkward. The stable will allow tames to spawn with the base instead.\n\nOver all a good survival experience that needs some polish which it will get.

You enter the game already the size of an ant.\n\nThe map is huge and very well designed. You can gather and build like in all good survival games. In this one one you can also unlock schematics and recipes, and even the ability to tame wild creatures (lady bugs, grasshoppers, lizards, dragonflies, hornets, etc). Once tamed, they can help you fight and serve as a mount. The flying insects allow you to fly, which helps for quicker travel across the large map. \n\nI have about 40 hours and I've nearly finished the main storyline. I just unlocked the forbidden monument to the far North. I'm level 65, but even at high levels you still have to be careful not to take on too much at once. You craft your armors and weapons and tools, so almost none of the practical items in the game are acquired without crafting. The progression here is nice, but all monsters will respawn quickly, which detracts slightly from the immersion.

Yes, it has Early Access problems, but 20 bugs (in sale) are okay.\n\n[u]Graphics[/u]\nHands down, this game looks awesome! The world is beautiful, the armor sets look cool and the base building parts match the theme very well and harmonize with each other. I really like the art style overall, but the character model is just 'okay'. \nYou don't see your character ingame (not even the antenna) because of the full body armor without the option to hide the helmet. \nThe environment is full of life, we even have storms and seasons, which I really like. And no, they do not 'come out of nowhere'.\n\n[u]'Story' and Quests[/u]\nThe first big downside is the 'story'. A survival game doesn't neccessarily need a story, but if you decide to put some in it, then please develop it. We have no clear beginning, no common thread, nothing. All we get is \"my key got stolen. In this chest we have the elixier we need for our queen. Go find my key.\" [spoiler]I still can't figure out how that big bug could steal a key without anyone noticing it.[/spoiler] The NPCs that helps us to find the thief have no story at all. All we get here is \"I have problems with this boss monster. Go kill it for me, thanks\" Again, you do not need a story in survival games, but the devs decided to add one and failed hardly. For me, it could have been enough to have some background story of the smallfolk or why the world doesn't have any giants anymore. [spoiler]For example, why is there a big sceleton in the swamps? Lisandra could have some background knowledge about it, but well...[/spoiler] \nThe quest rewards after killing the bosses are questionable. Okay, I get a receipt how to craft a kibble to tame an animal, but why tf do I still need to go the NPC to craft the reward armor? Just give the receipt, I'll do it by myself as well. \n\n[u]Survival[/u]\nThe survival aspects are overall fine to me. If your character is hungry, you'll loose health over time and stamina instantly. As long as you're above 70% hunger level, you regenerate health (but way too slow). In winter you need cold resistance armor or warm food to keep yourself warm, otherwise you'll loose health overtime without the possibility to heal it, same during storms. \nThere is no buff food or other any other method to miprove your character's skills like cold resistance, improved health regeneration or less stamina drain. \n\n[u]Controls[/u]\nMovement feels smooth, especially flying is really well made. Movement during combat is clunky asf. Enemies are way too fast, faster than the sprinting player, which means you cannot flee without taking damage. \nEverything drains stamina, jumping, sprinting, dodging, attacking, gathering. Which itself is okay imo, but the amount of stamina is too high imo. \n\n[u]Combat[/u]\nAs mentioned before, combat is clunky. If you decide to simply walk away while the enemy is charging an attack, you'll get anyway, eventho you walked 10meters away. The enemy will glitch to hit you regardless, therefore you have to spent stamina to block/dodge. \nThe player is way slower than the enemy, which means to charge an attack results in taking damage or not hitting at all, which feels not rewarding. I don't want to fight taktical the whole time, I don't wanna play Dark Souls. \nBecause of that, combat get annoying over time. This and the aggro radius. Enemies will chase you way too long and way too fast. \nThe system of different weapon types is fine to me, although I don't like to play with a hammer. To have a shield for the second hand would be awesome or the possibility to hold two different one-handed-weapons.\n\n[u]Multiplayer[/u]\nAnother big downside is the multiplayer, because it doesn't feel like playing together at all. I guess they will work on this, at least it's on their roadmap. \nI'd appreciate more multiplayer options like more loot (or everyone has their own loot), groups/tribes to play PvP and quest sharing. It's really annoying to beat every boss for many times, because it only drops the reward for one person. \nAdditionally, if the owner of the tree base logs out, the whole base is gone which makes is hard for shared bases. But I generally like the idea of having the base connected to the character, so I can transfer my base (including chests, crafting benches) to other player safes.\n\n[u]Base building[/u]\nAs mentioned before, you can transfer your tree base to other safes, which I like. Besides that, base building is good at the current state. We have 3 tiers that harmonize with each other very well. The amount of different parts is good for early access but has potentional for more decoration parts like carpets and lamps. \nThe grind for the stone parts is heavy, but okay. \n\n[u]Questionable decisions[/u]\n1. As a keyboard player I'm lowkey mad that I only have 8 tool slots. I don't know any other game where I have less than 10? In the beginning and midgame you need at least 3 different weapons and 3 different tools. Only 2 left. If you decide to go for ranged weapon, only one left. At least give me an option to create sets so I can easily swap between a fighting set and building/gathering set. \n2. The inventory and stack sizes are way too small. Only 30 or 20 per stack? We had 50 in pre-alpha, what happened? \n3. What exactly is the point of the tannery? You can craft only one piece. \n4. Durability. Everything above 75%(?) can be repaired for free, but we never really know when we hit the minimum durability before we need materials. Additionally, it's ridiculous how often how have to repair your tools. Chop 5 trees, then repair, repeat. Really annoying.\n\n[u]False advertising[/u]\n1. Taming: taming is useless. Your pets are way too weak, they can be easily beaten by the night ants or grey flies. Also ,you can only tame ONE animal at the same time. In the trailers, the taming system looked way better, but it's just bad. \n2. Armor: In the trailers they showed, specific armor prevents you from getting aggro. Just wear the black hornet set and hornets will let you in peace, but that's clearly false. Everything will attack you, doesn't matter what you wear. \n(3. owl: Where is the owl?)\n\n[u]Bugs[/u]\n1. The most game breaking bugs I faced were dead spaces. Sometimes you end up stuck anywhere without any way out. Yes, you can 'unstuck' yourself but you just die at this location. Just set the character 30s back (or to last safe point). If you decide to jump off a cliff after getting stuck there, your tombstone will be at the point where you jumped, not where you died. Good luck getting your stuff back without getting stuck again.\n2. Translations are off for German. 'Unstuck' doesn't mean 'gelockert', it means 'befreien'. 'Webstuhl &amp; Spindel' and 'Sprache &amp; Bedienungshilfen' have some questionable additions.  \n\n[u]TL:DR[/u]\nAs an early access title, Smalland delivers. You have enoughto do for ~30hrs, a beautiful world to explore and base building is fun. Even for early access we don't have many game breaking bugs and the tree base system is refreshing imo. Downsides for me are the unfair combat (enemies are way faster than you), bad story and undeveloped multiplayer. Some game decisions are also questionable (you cannot craft armor by yourself, you need to go to the NPCs) or unbalanced (repair system). 20\u20ac (in sale) is totally fine for the currewnt game state imo. \n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1681287423, "timestamp_updated": 1681288547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696403205394744873", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135691301": {"recommendationid": "135691301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143587384", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1680108962}, "language": "english", "review": "Been waiting for the game since it was announced so this feels bad to write but it is what it is.\nThe good: Visually it looks great | There are decent amount of creatures | Building is simple and quick\nThe bad: Combat is ridiculous - there's no ''perfect block'' and the pattern for basically every creature is light attack (x1) and roll.

The worst thing in my opinion is not having leveling/skill system. If you die at a boss all your stuff drops there. Wouldn't be a big deal but the only thing that makes your character strong is gear. So if you lose all your gear after 20 hours you're instantly as weak as you were when you started. \n\nObviously everyone loves the idea of the game but in my opinion it's not worth it without core mechanic rework.

I managed to get it at a sale price and am enjoying my savings so far. The world is well thought out and the environment is intuitive. Building is a bit of a pain, but I've played with worse. The mechanics remind me a lot of Valheim, which I couldn't get into. Maybe it's the push of the world that keeps me going in this one.

This also goes for tracking Big Trees, they are color coded on the map, but when tracked they are all blue.\n\n- Storage chests have a very frustrating bug.\nI saw in real time my items disappearing from my inventory, moving between different chests, and just disappearing and reappearing from inventory and chests. This is probably my biggest frustration.\n\n- bugs are AGGRESSIVE. on lowest difficulty they are still hard to kill. You can't run away as they will chase you until you die. Only until we switched to peaceful was I allowed to actually explore and like the game without worrying about a gang of ants or bees coming to murder me. Peaceful is a must as of now.\n\n- mounting bugs are kind of awkward to control. my grasshopper twice has glitched inside of a rock.\n\n- Fall damage is way too high. You think you could make that jump? probably not. \n\n- we need an option to enable keeping inventory upon death. not everyone wants to HAVE to travel across the whole map just to collect their shit.\n\nI know I listed a lot of negatives, but these things can be easily fixed, and I actually do enjoy the game aside from these inconveniences.

Yes, it is flagged as early access, but the current content is rather a snapshot instead of a well rounded, enjoyable experience. While my friend and I grinded some components at the start, around mid to late game it became completely obsolete to farm for anything else. We also skipped many sets of gear because they were not necessary to obtain. \n\nWe also increased the difficulty to \"difficult\" with increased mob damage and HP. The game still was rather easy to play with no rewards for increased difficulty. We can also agree on the mounts being incredibly unbalanced with no adapted stats to their, in reality, unique traits. The damselfly was not a single bit faster than the Hornet while being much squishier and no abilities to attack. The grasshopper was literally the fastest and earliest mount to obtain in the game, maybe apart from the incredibly expensive blue tit mount at the very end of the game. Where's the reward in grinding for that if the game is basically over once you are able to obtain the blue tit?\n\nLeveling the pets was also rather useless. In the area in the north, we immediately encountered a hornet lvl 98. So why make the effort and level the low level hornets from the southern area? Mobs usually ranged from level 4-16 there.\n\nAt its current state, the northern area is unfinished and doesn't connect well with the southern area. we also didn't find the missions to be in any way engaging.

Wife and I played this entirely using controllers (separate computers). I had looked at Grounded but this one looked more interesting for us. We unlocked everything (that I know of). We played Valheim for a while but got bored and the difficulty spike was a bit much in some areas. This one scared the bejesus out of us a few times with creepy crawlers sidling up to you or from behind. Very much enjoyed all the base building options and the fact that there are no timers anywhere so we can take our time with building, collecting, exploring, fighting, strategizing, etc.\n\nYou can tame different beasts and while it was fun working to unlock them, we found the travel to still need work. Much preferred to just hop and glide on our own especially once we unlocked the Icarus wings towards the end of the current game. The 500 hoot price for the bird isn't quite worth it, but oh well; since there were two of us, we had to scrounge up 1,000 hoots for two birds.\n\nWhen we'd see spiders for the first time from afar, we'd say, \"What's that? Was it fuzzy?!\" It took a bit for us to feel like we were powered up enough to just go in and clear them all out. Very fun! Some late nights we'd be playing and getting into the spider areas and couldn't help but keep brushing the hair back from our necks out of habit. Good atmospheres in this game. We appreciated the catapult system for getting around and being able to attach signs to help us remember where certain ones pointed towards.\n\nInterested in seeing where else this game might go. If you're looking for another game to play online co-op with a spouse or friend, this one worked well for us.

You get at least 20 hrs of gameplay to finish the story and a lot more if you\u00b4re into building.\n\nThe map is extraordinarily beautiful und quite large. I\u00b4ve been playing alone so far and it can be pretty challenging, but the option to adjust the health and strenght of hostile insects, that was added lately, can help with that. There is also a peaceful mode which can be really useful to retrieve your death loot...\nI recommend playing the game without looking up any guides or videos. Everything is explained well ingame, and ressources are pretty much where you\u00b4d expect them irl too. One thing to note is, you currently can only have one companion, so that\u00b4s why taming another one isn\u00b4t working.\n\nThe building system is very interesting too, since you can overlap and rotate parts vertically and horizontally and create a lot of different shapes and the building parts and decorations are beautiful. Currently there are 3 tiers of building sets, the 1st one very cheap, so it\u00b4s quick and easy to setup a starter base. There is already a large variety of armor sets and weapons to craft, the best ones of them pretty pricy and a bit of a grind to get though. The character creation at this point doesn\u00b4t offer too many options, but the characters look nice and cute and the animations are pretty good.\n\nA really handy mechanic to point out is, you can move your base (once it\u00b4s a tree encampment) to any other Great Tree on the map, even to a different game hosted by a friend i.e., or lateron, once they added server support, to a different server. So I have been moving around my base all the time to where ever I\u00b4m currently harvesting or doing a quest etc...\n\nOne thing missing, which I hope will be added in the future is steam workshop support.\nEDIT: Developers stated they do want to add mod-ability on steam, but not before release.\n", "timestamp_created": 1681400222, "timestamp_updated": 1700679356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630769193172454834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149323124": {"recommendationid": "149323124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056436116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "playtime_at_review": 1850, "last_played": 1713121621}, "language": "english", "review": "Really surprising that this game is not more popular.
