If you find yourself attracted to games where seeing not just one, but three different bars go down in accordance to the law of universal entropy then this game is a 12/10 in madness! Personally I find a general amount of grind to be quite soothing and the exploration of the quirky overworld is top quality when it comes to experiencing odd stuff from beyond the realm of shadows. However as your food and sanity is more or less constantly declining like its a fuel gauge on a really shitty car you have to be constantly on the hunt for premium food or find yourself killed by shadows in a backwater swampland filled with merfolk. \n\nTHe general gameplay is as follows: Wake up, find stones, tie stones to wood, beat down bigger trees and stones, rinse and repeat until you can access new more dangerous biomes while constantly looking for carrots to take you off the edge of starvation. It is more fun than it sounds and despite a healthy support over the years nowadays you might as well jump directly to Don't Starve Together.\n\nUnless homicidal seclusion is your thing.. Then you won\u2019t be disappointed as you put another pigfolk town to the torch in reckless abandon.. \n", "timestamp_created": 1710330303, "timestamp_updated": 1710330303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654486417770385742", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157910595": {"recommendationid": "157910595", "author": {"steamid": "76561199550127722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 76, "last_played": 1697942916}, "language": "english", "review": "I STARVED", "timestamp_created": 1707467469, "timestamp_updated": 1707467469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61538463830947876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161091754": {"recommendationid": "161091754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800259065", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1857, "last_played": 1637573168}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't Starve?\nmore like Don't go insane, or freeze, or set yourself on fire, or get killed by spiders or tentacles or giant birds!", "timestamp_created": 1711052342, "timestamp_updated": 1711052342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611536204814910889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160428321": {"recommendationid": "160428321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178000013", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 36811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30922, "last_played": 1711822876}, "language": "english", "review": "\u200b\n", "timestamp_created": 1710301438, "timestamp_updated": 1710301438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603463292121887207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161045109": {"recommendationid": "161045109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299552166", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1622, "last_played": 1665306287}, "language": "english", "review": "Good, but the game have a very unforgiving learning curve.\nStill the game is chill and fun for what it is.", "timestamp_created": 1710996780, "timestamp_updated": 1710996780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161839015": {"recommendationid": "161839015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196483657", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 12327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12327, "last_played": 1601408917}, "language": "english", "review": "Great survival title.\r\nGame is pretty simple with pretty graphic.\r\nAlthough is hard a bit.\r\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1711838629, "timestamp_updated": 1711838629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580419540405273438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160321511": {"recommendationid": "160321511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108820767", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_at_review": 2345, "last_played": 1712839202}, "language": "english", "review": "I starved", "timestamp_created": 1710154645, "timestamp_updated": 1710154645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577716648578643799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158529788": {"recommendationid": "158529788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036201442", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 202, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1705234993}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game.

For the most part, the controls and interface are intuitive, so it's simply a matter of deciding where to go or what to do.\n\nThe game is called Don't Starve, and hunger is indeed a major theme. If you go a few days without food, you will die. That said, there are plenty of other things to kill you - a variety of animals and monsters, environmental hazards, and your own dwindling sanity. To battle this, you rely on building your own equipment, consumables and structures, ranging from weapons and armor to crock pots to unwholesome magical devices.\n\nDon't Starve can be brutal, so you should expect to die, but just making good progress is rewarding in itself. You unlock new characters as you play, each with little touches or specialties to diversify your experience. And while there are some pretty powerful or useful items you can make, there are still a lot of ways to play, and they're all valid (which is good, because sometimes you don't have much choice.)\n\nIf you're bored or frustrated, you can change your experience by starting a new game and adding or removing features. If you're tired of fighting certain monsters, you can just turn them off. I haven't messed with this myself, as I like the feeling of surprise, and playing the game as-is, but the developers have left the doors wide open for custom play experiences. In the same way, you can make use of a wealth of user-created elements.\n\nThere are a few things I missed for awhile, like the fact that you can view a map of everywhere you've been so far, but overall the game doesn't suffer much from lack of tutorial or hand-holding. You can go read everything on a wiki if you prefer, but this is a game where I don't actually begrudge trial and error learning. Encountering strange new things and deciding what to do with them is a ton of fun, even if it sometimes gets you killed.\n\nA warning (at least from my perspective) - this game is so immersive, I prefer to keep playing it for hours on end once I start. It's not a game I enjoy having to stop, unless I come to good stopping point like dying at the end of a long survival run. In fact, sometimes I forget to eat for a long time when I play this.

And it says you can celebrate with your piggy friends.''  that was when I bought it. I can tell you I got addicted to the game. The first day I played 12 h's. I told my brother and my friend they should buy it. They did it and got addicted, too. I think nearly every Computer can run the graphics and the the characters are funny, too.

It does a good job. \n\n\n\nThe core gameplay is simply trying to survive. gathering materials and food during the day, and huddling by a fire, trying to craft useful tools at night. As the day to night cycle progresses, so does the seasonal cycle. After a couple days, winter comes, making it harder to collect food, and hunt. The nights become longer and the days become shorter as you huddle by your fire, trying not to freeze to death. During winter, your homemade farms stop becoming useful. Huntable animals disappear and other more dangerous animals come in swarms. \n\n\n\nAs far as the story goes, there is an oddly rich story, which can only be experienced by skilled players. Whenever a new game is started, Maxwell, the games antagonist, warns him to get food. The real story mode cannot be achieved unless the player has found the four pieces, and then moves to the next level. After beating a few levels, they reach the epilogue, where maxwell is unlocked as a playable character and the game is complete. \n\n\n\nDon't starve\u2019s graphics and art style is very Tim Burton. The monsters, alone have a scary but yet cute feel to them. The sound of the game is very creepy yet welcoming. depending on what the player is doing at the time. The music changes whenever the player is in combat or not, making the combat feel even more immersive. \n\n\n\nDon\u2019t stare also has a large amount of options. Not only can you pick your character but you can also modify the world and its many resources. Players can make the world a food rich wonderland, or a barren wasteland, randomized each time. Each playable character has its own stats, and buffs/debuffs, tailoring to each possible playstyle. \n\n\n\n\nThe in game crafting provides a large variety of machines, tools, farms and structures. The player can craft anything from carpets, campfires, spears, drying racks, walls, bee-based mines and a large variety of clothing, all with special perks.

I died.\n\nDon't Starve is a creepy-cute survival game in which you're made to learn through mistakes, and in which the slightest mistake can kill you and erase all your progress. I'm currently 74 days into a run, but not without a little abuse of the game mechanics. Don't Stave is a hard rogue-like, in that the instant you die your entire world and all your progress is erased, but there are a couple resurrection items in each world that let you respawn once after death, and I've found that there's a few seconds between dying and resurrection in which you can safely quit the game without it saving over your file. Basically, it's the old Pokemon trick: if you accidentally kill the legendary, just reboot your save file and everything's fine.\n\nIs this cheating? Probably. Kind of. Not as much as the time I played through this game's entire adventure mode with God Mode turned on because I so badly wanted the character you unlock at the end. (I know, I'm THAT kind of player. In my defense, the adventure mode of this game is just absurd.)\n\nI've put more hours into this game than into all my other games combined, and I think that fact alone should show how fun it is. It's a sandbox game, in that there are no set objectives, but there are so many things to do in the game that forming your own objectives is easy and natural; it's pretty obvious when you run across something you haven't accomplished yet (surviving through winter; unlocking the Magic tab; collecting the parts to the Teleportato), and in order to accomplish it, you usually have to master some new aspect of the game. In my current save file, I have: survived two winters; walked around the entire overworld map; hunted down MacTusk; survived (and slain) the mighty Deerclops; and built a base with six farms, two bee boxes, and a nearby spider den, which I'm pretty sure could sustain me indefinitely without me having to move beyond my line of berry bushes. All this and I've still only scratched the surface. (Literally; there's a whole cave world below the surface world, and a ruin world below that, which I've only read about so far.)\n\nThe only downside to this game is the roguelike element, in that every time you die you have to start over. But the randomly-generated world makes starting over kind of fun, especially with the option to try new characters, and once you have the basic survival tools there's a million directions you can go in, most of which you won't have touched in previous playthroughs. \n\nI will say, however, that the dying does get annoying, especially when so many of your deaths feel like bullshit. Like those eyeball plants that attacked and killed me before I could figure out what they were. Or the wolves, which will NEVER stop chasing you, or even give you time to craft something to defend yourself. Or all those times a monster attacked my campsite at night, forcing me to run in circles around my fire as the light slowly burned out. Basically, if at any moment you aren't prepared for everything, it probably means you're about to die. The only reason I can ignore this is that I would quickly quit my game whenever I was about to die, but without cheats, the permadeath mechanic makes progress in this game infuriatingly difficult (but incredibly rewarding when it does happen).\n\nI'd give it an 8/10.

This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys a game where the player is given total freedom to do what they want, how they want and when they want. So as a player and big fan here is my own personal experience on such an awesome single player experience game. \n\nJ20Hawkz Personal Opinion\n\nI have been playing this game since early release and still find it extremely hard to stop playing it. Personally for me I enjoy adventure, action and rpg, Don't Starve combines all three in a unique way and blends in survival horror and a sort of farming, resource hoarding element also. If you enjoyed playing games such as Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon you will definitely feel right at home playing this. The added twist is you are always on your feet to make sure you don't go insane and lose health. Oh and of course don't starve. \n\nSeasons, Days, Interactions\n\nAlmost everything can be interacted with, from catching small butterflies and bees to having epic battles with huge lumbering monsters that hunt you in the coldest and hardest of times. Yes Don't Starve has seasonal changes, and not only do you live to survive, you must survive to live. Days go from light to dark, they don't last very long making it all important you do enough to survive the dark night and start again when the sun comes out. Anything that moves and would potentially pose a threat can harm the player if you choose to get too close or in some way anger it. \n\nWeapons, Traps, Armour, Food\n\nCraft weapons, armour, traps and walls to defend yourself against continuous threat. Capture, kill, gather and cook food to make sure your hunger never drops. Everything you see can be used to collect valuable resources that will be used to craft hundreds of helpful survival items. \n\nExplore a living world\n\nNot only are we free to explore a fairly large open map, we can also go deeper into the caves and explore a strange and creepy ancient world. With the addition of such levels Don't Starve replay ability went through the window. Again exploring either the world above ground or venturing deep into the darkness of the caves, is all up to the player. There are no strings attached. You do as you wish. \n\nMinor Issues\n\nThere are some minor faults with the game, but the team behind this game are very supportive and at least one member is on hand to help sort out any technical issues or those annoying bugs we encounter while playing. Never have I seen a more committed development team than Klei. Most questions can be answered by reading the community made Don't Starve Wiki, you can also visit the Official Klei site and post questions or reply to other friendly members of the Don't Starve community. The Steam Don't Starve forum is also a good place to share or ask what's on your mind. \n\nDeath\n\nDeath can be a pain, if you die that's it, you have to start all over again. The further you get is based on the number of days survived. However you gain experience points based on this number that is used to unlock other playable characters all of which have unique aspects about them. There are ways of avoiding a permanent game ending death so not all hope is lost. \n\nPlay alone or together\n\nDon't Starve was originally planned as a Single player game only. On the 6th of May 2014 multiplayer was announced for late summer 2014. More to follow. \n\nFinally\n\nAll in all, this game is a great single player oriented experience. The achievements we get is what we find hard and over come. With no online capabilities or steam associated achievements, some may find this game not worth buying. However if those are the only negatives in a game you will be hard pressed to find something that is as captivating as Don't Starve.  \n\nI give this game a solid 85/100.\n\nHere is just one example of what can be made in Don't Starve. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=151738059", "timestamp_created": 1370345914, "timestamp_updated": 1400661077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 119, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839121699333190918", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17355481": {"recommendationid": "17355481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034315837", "num_games_owned": 7785, "num_reviews": 766, "playtime_forever": 558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 558, "last_played": 1481609719}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a little late to the awesomeness but suffice to say this game is just that.

You're low on food and sanity so you start picking up these berries which you haven't thought about doing in the beginning, and you also found flowers. You try eating them but notice that whenever you pick'em up your sanity raises. that's good.\nAfter a while of looting the enviorment you come across a rock biome. Great, you've gathered enough rocks to make yourself nothing because the night came again.\nAfter almost dying at night you start getting stone and come across a gold nugget. What could that be?\nAnd, again, a bulb ontop of the symbol of Atom has caputred your eye.\nYou make a science machine as you start grapsing that basics of this game. After a while of exploring your general land you come across a pig village with, ofcourse, the king pig inside. These pigs will turn out to be your only allies in this game. They have farms, they offer protection for any kind of meat and will save you from some of the horrors of this game. So you start making your base next to them as it is the only logical choice you could make in this game.\nAfter more days of looting and gathering resources you hear a faint woof. What could that be?\nHounds.\nAs you run relentlessly without understanding what's going on, your fellow pigsman are there to save the day, not for long though. You came out clean this time, which you should thank the gods of this cursed land.\nYou started making up a base, you crafted random items from the science tab and again, a bulb has lit up.\nYou craft an alchemy engine which will help you craft more scientific items.\nAfter roaming around in the world yet again, you come across ancient guardians of this cursed land.\nThey work like clockwork, they defend their land like no other creatures. You bribe your fellow pigsman and you go to fight these ancient creatures, winning the battle.\nAfter looting their corpses, you come across gears. When arriving at your house, you craft an Ice Box to slow the spoilage of the food. Neat.\nYou have a base, well protected from the horros of this world, you have everything you'd like in it.\nNow, there are two scenarios which can happen:\n1. Summer starts.\nYou have no idea what to do, your character starts to heat up without any knowledge on what's happening.\nYour house starts burning and you, yourself, is overheating.\nOkay, lets say that didn't happen and you miraculously didn't any fires or didn't overheat because you mined ice.\nGuess what?\nDragonfly. I'll leave that for you to discover what's that.\nScenario 2:\nWinter starts.\nGreat, you're cold, you're almost dead but you came across a failed survivor which had a Puffy Vest, thermal stone and a Cat Cap. How lucky you are. So you barely survive this day and come back to your house, rapidly fueling your campfire as it's the only gateway from this hellish environment. You have food in your ice box, you have enough wood somehow to survive the winter (Who am I kidding, this never happends, but for the purpose of this story let's assume it does).\nA saxphone sound comes out of your characters body and a text appeares, \"That sounded big\".\nI'll let you guess what's going to happen next.\nOfcourse, there are 2 more seasons, Autumn and Spring, but I feel like they shouldn't be focused on now as they are pretty similliar.\nYou die.\nAgain.\nAnd again.\nAnd again.\nAnd again, until you master the horrors of this cursed land, feeling success after surviving your first winter, summer, autumn, spring. You survive the countless waves of hounds.

This is quite an ingenious feature on the devs' part, and it enhances the game experience and makes it feel fresh all over again - with the bonus of turning the experience into utter chaos and have a few short lived minutes of pure terror before you turn it back to the tame-by-comparison default mode.\n\nMy gripes are mainly with the game's more finnicky and frustrating mechanics, I always hated the sanity meter and found it mostly annoying with any character and the aforementioned RNG can either help or hinder you - for me. more often than not it hindered.\n\nAll in all, I recommend Don't Starve for regulars and newcomers of the genre alike as it offers a firm and adjustable challenge, with a delightfully original art style to boot.", "timestamp_created": 1414865687, "timestamp_updated": 1534615857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766786575317382813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20125857": {"recommendationid": "20125857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142147970", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 839, "last_played": 1560487600}, "language": "english", "review": "Whats that?

While it's easy to create massive farms of every resource and make it impossible to starve, you will still spend huge amounts of time mindlessly grinding basic resources like wood and rocks even 30 hours into a world.\n\n* The exploration aspect of the game is severely lacking. Each level of a single world is huge, taking easily over an hour of walking to explore, but the only real \"rewards\" for exploration, mapping the resources aside, are 1-3 \"set pieces\" per level containing a pre-crafted tools or buildings. It's hard to be excited about non-unique, perishable\"loot\" that you could craft yourself in 10-30 minutes.\n\n* While the game appears brutally difficult and unforgiving at first glance, it is actually quite easy to reach a \"stable\" point where basic resources and food renew faster than you burn through them. From this point forward, the difficulty of the game depends entirely on how much you are willing to grind for supplies before venturing outside your base area.\n\n* Despite the great diversity of enemies at first glance, all of the combat in the game really boils down to one of the two scenarios: decking yourself out in armor and simply clicking on things until they die, or kiting enemies and hitting them between attacks. \n\n* Low replayability.

And I absolutely love roguelikes or anything that has similar mechanics. I love rewardingly difficult games that enforce lots of strategy and planning. Like the SWAT series, where killing a hostage results in immediate mission failure and you must account for each bullet fired out of your gun, encouraging you to stick with burst fire weapons, pistols and even be rewarded for completing the mission without any casualties- hostile elements included. Or like State of Decay where once your favorite fully-maxed out character dies, there's no bringing them back; you must take control of some other character from your community and avoid the same mistake again to not get too many people killed, or risk losing the entire community to zombies. Or like in N++, the famous platformer where you have to be on your toes at all times with the game constantly forcing you to be fully aware of your surroundings and have higher response times or risk starting the whole level all over again. It's extremely risky, but it's so much fun! Because it's rewardingly difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, we have Don't Starve. It's a great concept with limitless potential. I can play around with it's world settings, the level and it's branching, world elements, etc; it's pretty flexible. Survival may be the focus, but fans of the survival genre know how fun survival can be if you have loads of options and choices at your disposal. Don't Starve does all of that right. Lots of varied food resources, you can go as deep as you want into the complex ecosystem where mobs interact with each-other, farm said ecosystem, face the struggles of farming too much or too little, generate your own equipment and making a self-sustained \"base\" and so forth. But the one thing it falls flat on is what it's considered to be it's strength: the punishment i.e. death. Let's be very clear here- permadeath, in itself is not an issue. Like I stated before, I enjoy this mechanic in other games. The problem is the consequences that this mechanic comes with. In games like SWAT and N++, permadeath works flawlessly because there are \"levels\". If you die, you may lose a significant amount of progress, but the games are divided into several not-so-long levels, each storing their progress seperately so you may think, \"Hmm.. let me try something different here!\". The games encourage you to take risks in order to complete the levels and reward you for it. In State of Decay, permadeath makes you lose out on a LOT of progress, for example if you take one character from the community, spend 20 hours using them and effectively maxing out their stats and then if you lose them to a hoard of zombies that you thought you could take alone, you'd at least still have your community and the people in it and you can train with some other character without completely losing the community and the game ending- a great incentive for the player to keep going. Though, Don't Starve is brutally punishing in a way that it's frustrating. It takes away EVERYTHING if you die. It essentially leaves you with no reason to start the game again. I've spent 28+ hours playing Don't Starve and I'm yet to find a good incentive to start a new game after my last playthrough.\n\nThe other part of the problem lies in the fact that the game is infinitely complex and dynamic. Now, normally, this would be an advantage for a game with similar ambitions & caliber as Don't Starve, but the fact that the game doesn't give you any tips makes it really difficult. But fair enough! I can explore and experiment on my own. That's not the problem, though. The problem is- this game punishes exploration and experimenting, even more so when you're relatively new to the game and are only a month or so in your playthrough. While it SHOULD be the other way around. There is no way to scale time to allow for a bit more risk-free exploration and experimentation and if it goes wrong, which it most certainly does, you will end up dead and will lose ALL of your progress. For example, in my last and I think the 7th playthrough, I had figured out how to prepare for winter so by Day 16, I had killed the animals I needed to make a basic winter jacket. In order to do so, I had to avoid my character's basic needs for a while and I figured I could do it once the jacket was done. I was also kind of curious as to why the two killer hounds that usually spawn at day 7 had not spawned at all. I knew that another set of two hounds spawns at about day 14 or something, so it was quite unsettling why neither of them had spawned yet. Regardless, my jacket was made and I was out hunting for food when I heard the hound grunts. I thought, \"Sure I can take two!\" but the game usually spawns them after a long time post-grunting to give you a heads up. By the time the hounds actually spawned, it was nightfall, a thunderstorm had arrived and the winter started with no advance visual cues of it arriving. Cherry on top was that the game broke it's own rules and spawned 4 hounds after me at once. I was hungry, cold, vulnerable and my health was dropping fast. So to minimize the damage, I lit my torch, wore my jacket and started running. Now, this is a game of playing rock-paper-scissors with the game. I have a torch to avoid getting killed by darkness and the game counters it's duration and effectiveness with rain and winter. I have a parasol to avoid getting my stuff wet, but the game counters it with the mechanic that dictates that you can only hold either the torch or the parasol at a time. I have materials to get a fire started to counter cold, but that would require me to stop- the game counters it with 4 hounds chasing me. The basic jacket barely helps with cold or hound bites; I had the grass armor but the game counters it with a mechanic that prevents wearing it with the jacket on. So it's pretty much check-mate. I fought back and killed two hounds as planned, but the other two were still in pursuit, eventually my torch ran out and I died of darkness. Now, some people here would say- why didn't you have a touchstone activated? And to that I say, I had Touchstones set to \"Most\" before I started, and after 16 days of exploration of the majority of the map, I didn't find a single touchstone anywhere, while with the same settings, previous playthrough saw me activating 3 in a short timespan! Not that it matters, as you respawn pretty much naked, stripped of your inventory and now I can't counter anything until I run back to retrieve my stuff, but by then the cold or the hounds would've killed me again.\n\nAnd this is just one example of how the game tries SO hard to defeat you, instead of challenging you and presenting you with an incentive to try and win. Further punishment is added in to the mix by the game by entirely deleting the world and said resources forever. That's just plain, brutal punishment and I don't understand why people who have left positive reviews like this sadism so much. Maybe the reviews were written before Klei added more complex mechanics and the game became much harder.\n\nIn my opinion, at the time of writing this review: the game has a lot of potential, but it isn't fun and rewarding like a roguelike should be. And I'm now looking towards mods to remedy this situation, because for me the game is not playable out of the box and isn't worth the money I spent on it. IMHO, the game could use a time-scaler to make up for the lack of knowledge base and tips in game. I'm ok with it but if you're making discovery this ruthlessly risky, at least allow us to have longer days and seasons so we can afford to do it at our own pace. Right now, the game is so grindy that most of the game is spent taking care of the basic needs of my Sim and prepping survival gear for later-ons in advance is pretty much impossible until you know what/how to do from day 1.", "timestamp_created": 1546010444, "timestamp_updated": 1557814620, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704124689102172852", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28395343": {"recommendationid": "28395343", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970314107", "num_games_owned": 2306, "num_reviews": 917, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 432, "last_played": 1478498299}, "language": "english", "review": "There's a definite element of horror to survival games. It could be the fear of a wild animal tearing apart your fragile corner of civilization, or simply the sickening realization that you planned poorly and you're going to starve to death. Don't Starve capitalizes on both of these fears and more, pitting you against a stretch of nature that isn't just inhospitable, but actively seeks your destruction. And if that sounds stressful and downright painful at times, you should have a good idea of what you're getting into.\n\nDon't Starve starts you off with a spread of characters to choose from (with more to unlock) and world customization options, and then deposits you into an isometric wilderness. Just about every object in the world is interactable and will become important to your survival and prosperity, but the initial steps are simple enough. Flint and twigs make tools for chopping wood and mining stone, which can be refined further into building materials that unlock new equipment options. You'll be setting up fully-featured camps but be aware that cabins and castles aren't in the cards... the best you can do is walls and some simple flooring.\n\nThis feeling of permanent exposure is important to the atmosphere, because you are never fully safe in this cruel world. There's a pervasive sense of ancient evil to everything, from the twisted trees to the dead-eyed spiders to the writhing tentacles beneath the marshes. One key to survival is light, because without it the pitch-black night is certain death. I'm not just waxing poetic here, if you get caught in the dark for more than about five seconds, you die. But even a roaring campfire is no guarantee that marauding wolves, angry frogs, or far larger things won't end your life.\n\nDeath is where the real tension of the game is, because death is permanent. No do-overs, no checkpoints, no reloads. When you die, that character and that world are gone. Now, permadeath has proven to work for short roguelikes but a game where you spend hours exploring a world and building a settlement is a whole different ballgame, and it's here that Don't Starve threatens to lose most of its audience. Dying in this game really, really, [i]really[/i] sucks, because it's always from something perfectly avoidable, comes so quick, and wipes out literal hours of progress.\n\nSo why beat your head against this game? Because as long as you DON'T die, it's an excellent survival simulator. You'll never reach a point where you're fully comfortable in the world, and there are always greater beasts and scarier places to overcome. Even the most basic materials remain relevant as your mastery over the land grows, and while you gain new ways to make gathering resources quick and painless, you still have survival tasks to complete. Eventually you'll be cultivating farms, researching artifacts, and preparing for harsh winters, all of which are involved and gratifying goals.\n\nYou'll have to deal with some trial and error in finding the best ways to survive and use what you find, and that can mean some frustration as you learn to deal with food spoiling or beekeeping or other surprisingly lethal pastimes. But once you do there's a big, strange world to explore, and that's really only the beginning. There's a story mode hidden out there in the wilds that you'll only find once you master survival, and getting through THAT is its own grand adventure. Wrapped up as it is in charming hand-drawn graphics and rich sound design, there's plenty to keep you invested in Don't Starve. It's a game that asks for a lot of patience and understanding, but it's one of the few that really earn it, too.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?
