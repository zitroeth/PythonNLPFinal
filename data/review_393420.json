No Humans left playing. This game has died, anyone you see in game now is a truely dispicable level of forest troll. With so few people on ANY server, (other than 3 Chinese servers that are suspicously always showing 255/65 people online) it is completely shocking once you realize what they are doing on said servers. These cellar dwellars spend 10+ hours per day camping the ONLY 4-5 relevant places on the LARGE map, instantly killing anyone who may wander anywhere near them... paying no mind to the fact you just spent 10+ minutes of your life holding W and Shift just to get there.\n\n2.  Mind Numbingly boring gathering/ hunting food. I dont need to explain much more... its terrible.\n\n3. Nothing interesing or amusing to build once you have spent hours numbing your mind gathering, as described in point \"2\". When this game came out I suppose one may have found the first couple days playing decent, as there were still some things they had yet to experience. I had 400+ hours before I quit in december. I downloaded this game today thinking ... \"It's been 4+ months, there must be a few new things I can experience \" ...LOL was I wrong. Not only is there not 1 new thing, they somehow took it a step further and made the old things I found fun .. NOT fun.  \n\n4. We must, as a community, Make a stand against these \"Alpha realease\" game developers that show ZERO intention of ever releasing a REAL GAME. They continue to fill their bank accounts with our money being spent under false pretenses. This hoax is becoming an alarming trend on Steam, folks are buying these \"games\" that were made by 3 dudes over a weekend. Steam did a great thing in making such an amazing engine, unfortunately many of these scammers are abusing the ease of the engine Steam has built to make VERY small games easily and charge $20 for them. All that's left now for these bastards to do now is hire some whiz-kid graphic artist to make a few amazing trailers for \" Things to Come \" with the few dollars that start to trickle in.... BADDABING BADDABANG   \"WE ARE MILLIONAIRS JIMMY!!\".\n\n\nIn conclusion... I know point 4 may have gone over some of your heads, but for those of you who know what im talking about I say FUCK THIS SHIT. ENOUGH. NO MORE. \n\nMy Advise: Do not buy this \"GAME\" or any other \"EARLY ACCESS\" or \"EARLY RELEASE\" game before you do extensive research into the dirty sweatpants wearing fellows who made it.  \n\n\nLONG LIVE REAL GAMES!!!", "timestamp_created": 1462212790, "timestamp_updated": 1556860930, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4053, "votes_funny": 325, "weighted_vote_score": "0.936232924461364746", "comment_count": 156, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41407630": {"recommendationid": "41407630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091870287", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 22874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18165, "last_played": 1686537793}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of the best survival experiences ive ever had, but u guys need to drop the price, otherwise you gonna lose it all, i've been out of the game for almost a year, always checking servers to see if theres a chance to get back into it, and no is the answer, drop the price, make an epic update and give some stuff to people, otherwise this game will die and we'all gonna lose some amazing gameplay and fun potential, for you guys and us, do the right thing, would really love to see this game back alive.\n\nEdit: Its been a few years since the original analisys, and i keep my view, the game now oficially launched on v2 seems a lot better with a lot more content, but new players as being the oficial playerbase creators for this game are just rarer and rarer, given that devs wont hype the game enough nor there are any campaings to spread the word of the launch of the game, plus the fact that nakeds often spawn clueless and easily killed on spawn now since the lost of the \"infamy\" mechanic. overall i think the game is better, but now nearly 2 weeks after release, the playerbase has already dropped by 2 thirds, i'd say dont buy this game even tho my review is positive, i've had great fun with it in legacy days and a okay time on v2 mostly due to not having many player to player interactions outside some clans vs my own, the playerbase is currently dead, and unless that changes the game isnt worth even the half price.", "timestamp_created": 1523404846, "timestamp_updated": 1576625620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 197, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926658987998962402", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22560955": {"recommendationid": "22560955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090663124", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5479, "last_played": 1485554133}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was fun at first, but it turned into something I dont want to play anymore.

Early on there was a lot of bugs. Too many vehicles in the same proximity used to make servers lag and the \"fix\" for that was to make it so each player has to \"claim\" a vehicle. This didn't fix the lag issue as players still accumulated tons of vehicles. A few years have passed and the game has taken a turn for the worse. Rock/wall glitching was a huge issue for a while as I had many of my bases raided by foreigners exploiting those methods. Raiding would sometimes be pointless as a player would log out with their good items on their character(s) would disappear with their character as they logged out. To kill two birds with one stone the devs decided that the \"fix\" was to create a \"player box\"(sleeping character) when you log out instead of your body vanishing with all of the items like before. You're unable to climb through windows in the game which doesn't make much sense, originally when implamented you were able to crawl through windows. Instead of making a few changes to the original game the devs decided to scrap the original game and create a new version of the game (V2) which is a Rust mock and ruins the foundations of the game that worked. Content was promised and never delivered. Still waiting for the SMG, saber tooth tiger, and flying bugs.\n(*Personal opinion* Things that could have saved Hurtworld) The devs should have tweaked and created more content for version 1. Simple things like random creature spawn locations, clothing coloring (to differentiate players since everyone looks like Ronald McDonald), adding new weapons and food resources.\nI really miss what this game USED to be. Fingers are crossed that the devs get their heads on straight and listen to the community instead of assuming what the players want. We don't want Rust, if we wanted Rust then we would play Rust.\nMake HurtWorld great again!\nIn its current state I would not recommend purchasing this game.

I recommend this to anyone, even casual gamers that dont have the time that games like rust REQUIRE.\nPlus theres no bugs or glitches that i know of that someone can exploit to steal your stuff and destroy your base.\n\nDay 1\nI spawn and the first guy i run into claims friendly so i let him know this is my very first server. He shows me around and teaches me the core basics of the game. Surviving the elements and the animals is a task so we decide to work together. Sharing resources and all. I unfortunately strayed away from him and another man killed me with a rifle, kinda my fault i got too close to his base unkowingly. So once again i spawn in the baron desert. After only 2 seconds i run into 2 guys hanging at a fire they claim friendly so i get closer. So i start talking to them and one decides to spear me in the face while im talking. Little did he know he just dug his own grave. I spawn in the desert again and one of them approaches me saying hey sorry buddy as he tries to sweet talk me i give him a taste of his own medicine and kill him with my hatchet as his friend comes running up. I grab the dead dudes spear and start fighting his friend. At this point i am low on health and know i am going to lose the fight so i book it into the mountains. Dude keeps telling me surrender and youll live. I just laughed and kept running. As i come around a corner and lose him i run into another guy on a rock i shout out to him \"help i got this guy chasing me, him and his friend are trying to continuously spawn kill me\" not knowing he jumps off the rock and says \"omg mrhash ive been looking for you, wait someones chasing you?\" it was the guy i had first met. I was so releived to see my old friend. As the guy chasing me finally came around the corner we both jumped him. Unforntunately i died but my buddy killed him and took everything he had. Then he picked up all my stuff as well and returned it to me. At that point we were blood brothers. So i went on a search to find him again. Once we had met back up we travelled far from the chaos and decided it was time to build. (giving us a place to spawn) We traveled on many journeys that night in search of materials and food. The elements were vicious but our teamwork kept each other alive. Timing everything perfectly. We finally had established a safe place sufficient to start a farm seeing as food was scarce for us in our biome. I decided to take a little break at this point, but upon my return he comes running up to me all excited \"I found a car i found a car!!!\"  so she takes me to the edge of our mountain base and points down at the nearby shipping yard. Right there in front of us was this beautiful dune buggy. I quickly responded does it have an engine? Unsure of what parts this car had we decided to investigate. But this area had been off limits due to the high amount of yetis that lived there. We decided it was time to take one on in sacrifice of getting that car. So we gather all our fruits and make as much gasoline as we can, equipped ourselves with food and weapons and went for it. Here we are finally infront of this amazing vehicle we quickly check it for parts and noticed this bad boy is ready to go. We pop the gasoline in the tank and take off for home. Little did we know the engine was damaged and didnt have enough power to make it up the steep mountain pass into our base. We make the decision to strip all the parts and store them til we figure out another option. As the sun comes back up we headed back to the car to make sure it was still there. Realizing we could push the car with our spears we begin jabbing the car up the hill. Using teamwork to force that sucker up there we were successful. We finally had our base with a garage, and a car. That first day had brought me and this fella together as one. Feeling so accomplished we decided it was time to clock out and get some sleep.\n\nDay 2\nShaking from what i might find when i log back on i click the join server button. To my suprise my new found friend is in our base farming and excited to see me. He says \"your not going to believe this\" i worry a little but he seems too calm for it to be a bad thing. He begins to tell me how he met a man who helped him out with some much needed supplies, then he tells me the man has givin us an engine. Not a broken one, not a weak one, but one of the best engines around.\nSoo excited i tell him lets go for a spin, i would very much like to meet this nice mechanic.We approach this new allies base and he greets me with arms wide open. He gives us access to all his supplies and even gives us a room of our own. We gathered with this mans allies and roommates to hunt down more vehicles and supplies. Bringing back plenty for everyone we ourselves decide to help out some unfortunate players that were experiencing some troubles with trolls. Pulling up in a new buggy with nice clothes and full set of guns i approach and share what i can. Turns out one of the guys harrassing these fine folks was none other than the man who killed me the day before. I couldnt help but laugh thinking about how karma was gonna be a real bitch this time around. We were fully equipped and had an army behind us.

No huge traffic or server crashes. Every once and a while a server goes down but it quickly comes back up. This is your basic survival game. If you were a fan of Rust Legacy than you will more than enjoy this game. Start at nothing, then end up with everything. They made C4 EXTREMELY hard to get so you have to truly hate someone in order to raid their base.\n\nThe best part about the game is the Infamy System. Let me explain what that is. You have your basic tools, gear (cloths) and items including resources and ammo and such.  When you're starting out and get killed by another player you will lose all of your ammo and resources BUT NOT lose your tools and clothing, basically the essentials. If you've killed another player you get infamy which means for 15 minutes if you die, you have a chance of dropping your tools such as guns, pickaxes and other things. This will stack higher and higher if the player does not let his infamy disappear first.\n\nThis makes the game so much better due to the fact that not EVERYONE will KOS.

It's like a curse, in which my wallet and my happiness must suffer. So naturally, I wanted to give Hurtworld a try. I was [i]compelled[/i] to. \n\nI logged into a server and immediately encountered a neutral player trying to shoo me from his gathering area. He threw his spear at me, missing, all the while communicating to me with voice chat to go away. Point taken, I high tailed it out of there half-naked and with nothing to my name. A couple nights later I had established some basic tools but died of hypothermia. I have not died since. You learn to prioritize resource gathering and craftables, to keep a campfire at the ready for the harsh cold nights. I encountered friendly players, who offered some spare leather or had a kind word in passing. But I also encountered my first hostile player, who tried to coerce me into dropping all my logs. I refused and he chased me with his bow. I turned on him, spear in hand, and wacked him over the head. He didn't like that. I chased him off with my stick and very suddenly a blinding dust storm kicked up. He complained about not being able to see and I used that opportunity to get away -- even though I was the one chasing him. It felt great, as a new player, to be able to defend myself against others. And even better to see how the environment had protected me and given me cover. Cool. \n\nA few hours of gameplay later and I have claimed a plot of land, clothed myself, crafted a back pack, built a small home, stocked up my storage container, created tier 2 tools, and am ready to explore. I feel I have met small milestones and there is a sense of accomplishment and survival. I have hunted and gathered my way to basic comfort and survived the few hostile players. \n\nWhat the future holds, I am uncertain. I'd like to believe I cannot progress through the game so quickly. I'd like to believe great dangers lurk where great rewards lie, but I have not explored far enough yet.\n\nHere's what I do know: The game is fun, it is a solid title for Early Access, the community isn't totally filled with jerks (at least not on the server I joined), and I can only hope the developers expand on this game as I want more of it. \n\n[b]-Pros-[/b]\n+While it is an EA title, it feels like a solid game with a full feature list. Highly playable.\n+Runs smoothly, no crashes, high frame rates\n+Combat is adequate\n+Survival takes some effort and thought during the first couple hours\n+Basic resources continue to be useful\n+Player community\n+I not YET encountered a cheater\n+The server I play on is not full when I want to play\n+Its fun\n+You keep your tools when you die, but drop your resources\n+HUD is clutter free\n\n\n[b]-Cons/Other Thoughts-[/b]\n-Hypothermia is a bit harsh\n\n-Overheating mechanic is ridiculous. I'd understand if you overheat from the desert sun. But instead you overheat from being near your campfire or firepit, which is required for cooking food and smelting ores. It is ridiculous that I can't be anywhere inside my house while the firepit is going or I will start to overheat. Overheating can very well kill you. This could turn into an interesting mechanic if water is required to cool down from the hot desert or player must find shade or equip special gear. Tedius, but could be interesting. As it is right now its downright annoying. \n\n-Some resources will appear at a certain distance away, but will not be there when you approach, and may reapper after wandering around a bit. Similarly, the LOD on creatures is questionable. Bors can look a bit like logs at a distance because they are boxy until you get close enough for their details to be clear. And sometimes they won't appear at all until right up next them. Minor bugs. \n\n-Building a home is nice, but needs some work. There are no stairs or ladders. And you do not get any of your resources returned when you destroy something you've built. Certain resource requirements make no sense.\n\n-Crafting menus could be improved on, but not really a con. They work as intended.\n\n\nOverall, for 20$ I am enjoying the game and look forward to playing more of it.", "timestamp_created": 1451006592, "timestamp_updated": 1451006592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862254559993743896", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19844165": {"recommendationid": "19844165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073130205", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7000, "last_played": 1640446886}, "language": "english", "review": "How to play Hurtworld: \n\nStep 1.

His name was Cat, and he was pretty cool. We hit it off, and end up helping eachother survive, and provide eachother with a number of usefull materials. We survived together for about two days, and I found myself getting pretty good (by good, I mean I had pants, and a shirt). One evening, at our little makeshift camp, a straggler wandered in. We told him to leave, and with some resistance, he retreated. He seemed semi aggresive, and he swung at us with a spear a few times before high-tailing it right the hell out of there. I found myself aiming at him with a bow. I ended up not shooting, just because I felt remorse, and decided that he should have another chance. We set up for the night. All of a sudden, we hear an arrow wizzing past our heads. The man had returned, this time with a bow. He obviously had much more time in the game, because his shots were pretty good. After an admirable bow fight on our part, he ended up killing us both, and looting our corpses. I could have prevented this if I had taken the shot.

I know this is a fact everyone knows, but it is a Rust clone, and to be honest, I'm fine with that. The game does some things better than Rust, some things worse. It's cartoonish appearance makes it interesting. Vivid colors and clear contrast is half it's charm. The hardcore factor is not really true though. There is nothing in this game that is hardcore. Within an hour of playing, you will know the game mechanics and how most necessities work.\n\n[h1] PROS \t[/h1]\n\n-Beautiful graphics\nAs I said earlier, the graphics are amazing. They need more polishing, but they are pretty nonetheless. Gun textures are pretty dull though. I would choose this game over Rust when it comes to graphics.\n\n-A sense of achievement\nThis is something the game nailed. When it's so easy to lose your resources, building a huge fortress feels amazing. The fact that the whole world is working against you makes every little upgrade worthwhile, and pretty satisfying. The simple upgrade from an Iron Hatchet to a Gold one is pure bliss.\n\n-Nice building model\nThe building in this game is actually pretty stellar. You shape your house as you please, and that's something we didn't have in Rust. (More in Cons)\n\n-Cars\nAmazing for transportation, really cool models aswell. (More on this in the cons)\n\n-Great open map\nThey really did a good job on the map. The hill areas need polishing, but the overall map is epic. Making a base in each biome is a must-do task. \n\n[h1] CONS \t[/h1]\n\n-The Servers\nOh my God. I realize that we are currently in the Alpha Stage, but the servers are garbage. With the rumor of new servers, I hope that I can one day edit this part out. You'll often find yourself shooting at a boar, just to find out it has teleporting abilities with will literally be a pain in the ass. \n\n-Cars\nI know I put ''Cars'' in the Pros aswell, and this is why; The chances of you ever getting a car in this game are so slim you would have more luck getting a car in Minecraft. The drop rates for car parts are garbage, and after 55hours of play with a whole clan of people, we have managed to get three wheels. Not to mention the sheer amount of bugs with vehicles. Sounds glitching, clipping through the map, randomly getting thrown out... If you are buying this game for the cars, don't bother.\n\n-''Infamous'' System\nI realize that this is here to make the game a bit more unique, but in my opinion it is one of this game's worst features. A rich individual can go to spawn and go bananas on some fresh-spawns without much consequence. This game's whole thing is it's hardcore factor, and this is where the hardcore factor goes away. Tools are harder to make, but you will always keep them as long as you don't kill anyone.\n\n-Community\nThis doesn't really go under the CONS area, because the Devs can't change this; but it is worth mentioning nonetheless. If you have never played games like DayZ, Rust, and like like, be prepared to be KOS'd. There doesn't need to be a reason behind your death, as long as the Russian behind the scope is trigger happy. The Infamous system counteracts this to a certain degree. \n\n-Bugs and Glitches\nI know this is completely normal in an Early-Access game, but nonetheless worth mentioning. The game is plagued with game-breaking glitches and annoyances. The whole Survive-bar is annoying as all hell. The Wetness factor and Temperature need so much fixing it shouldn't be in the game yet. \n\n[h1] SUGGESTIONS\t[/h1]\n\n-Party System / Friends\nEven though you can share your house with your teammates, there is no way to identify them. No way of adding them on a friendlist, or mark them some way. Forget playing together if you don't use TS3 or the like. (You should do this anyway) This should be implied as soon as possible. \n\n-Drop Rates\nSome fixing needs to be done with this. At the moment, they are completely horrendeous and need fixing. \n\n-Map\nThis game is in desperate need of some type of map. We currently have a ''compass'' which shows the user it's homes/bases, but no real way of knowing the area. Combining the Beacon and a map function would make this game a lot easier and more enjoyable to play.\n\n\nAll in all, this is a game worth trying. If you are a fan of Rust or DayZ, it's a truly refreshing. Even though there are a lot of Cons, I still love this game for what it is, and I hope they will fix some of these.\n[h1] Rating: 8/10\t[/h1]\n\nEdit; 2.

Your avatar may have some boxer shorts on, but they are part of the character model and you truly have nothing. So you start your journey picking up whatever tidbits are on the floor in order to build some basic tools, which would be fine if the harvesting wasn't partially RNG based. Often times, completely identical looking stones on the ground will give you different resources, so you can never be sure that you are ever getting closer towards your goal.\n\nOnce you have some Tools, perhaps the Axe, a persons first thought would be to hack at trees right? Trees must give wood, that's logical. \n\nWrong.\n\nYou can only harvest fallen logs in the world and dried up dead trees that exist in certain places in the world. Healthy trees cause your Axe to bounce off harmlessly.\n\nThe other resource node you can harvest look like sculptures of colored rocks, which require that you have a pick on you. Different colored nodes yield different quantities of resources, but you will never be certain of exactly what you will harvest due to the inane RNG harvesting thing I mentioned before.\n\nThis is further made frustrating in the way harvesting takes place. You left click on the resource node with the appropriate tool until the node breaks apart and only at the end of the break do you gain resources. If someone comes running by and has a higher level harvesting tool, they end up dealing more damage to the node and will manage to harvest your node before you could ever do.\n\nCombine this with absurd costs of various items and the rarity of certain resources, this creates a scenario where a player is likely never to know exactly what they need in order to get the goals they desire.\n\nWhich leads me to the second bit I despise.\n\nPlayer Killing:\n\nThis game handles player vs player interactions with a sort of karma system. When a player with no bad karma kills another player with no bad karma, they get a visible timer on them that shows how long they are marked. I forget the in game name of this mechanic, but suffice to say, this is something that is often abused.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nA player with no karma timer on them, when killed, retains all their gear and clothes upon death and spawns with it in their inventory. A player who dies while their karma timer is still active loses all their items.\n\nThis sounds like a nice way for non-violent players to play the game, but any player who dies still loses all their resources. Often times, groups of players will harass other players into killing them just so that their buddies can come and kill the now karma marked player and loot all his items. \n\nThis system manages to not solve the horrid KOS problem prevalent with these survival games at all and even makes the experience worse for those players who successfullly defend themselves only to then be killed and lose EVERYTHING as opposed to just their resources.\n\nIt's dispicable.\n\nThe last problem I had with this had to the frequent server restarts.\n\nEvery 20 minutes, it seemed, servers have to restart, which requires that every player on the server get disconnected, wait a few moments and then manually reconnect.\n\nPlayers only get a 5 minute warning of when this will happen, which is never enough time for players to find a safe area to be in before the restart.\n\nWhen a player finally logs back in, they may find that other players are there already and have killed the player while they were spawning into the world.\n\nIt's awfully annoying for a server to have to restart so frequently to start with, but then logging back into the game just to find yourself dead is just unacceptable to me.\n\nI do not recommend this game. 24 dollars is just not a sensible price when there are games in the survival genre that are much MUCH more developed and thought out than this game and also cost less.\n\nYOU GUYS COULD BE PLAYING SOMETHING THAT IS SLIGHTLY MORE FUN THAN THIS FOR SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THIS GAME COSTS!!\n\nAnyway, I didn't realy have fun with this game at all, I didn't find it's crafting intuitive in the least nor did I enjoy the combat or survival systems. The community was meh, but that's to be expected in these games.\n\nAll in all, I'd say look elsewhere for your survival gaming. This game is just not fun.\n\nEDIT 5/4/2016..\n\nAs someone was so kind to point out, this is an Early Access title and potential purchasers should expect problems with the product. So while I understand that an Early Access title is not finished, I am reviewing this game based on what is currently available and what I have played, not on what the game might be when it's finished.\n\nAs always, do your research on EA titles and wary.

There are a lot of people who are complaining about players who kill beginners at the starting-area. While I believe this is by far not as common as it was ... it is not a big of a deal if you do what the game is all about: sneak around, know that (in the beginning) you are weak and an easy target, be smart and make smart decision; in short: Survive!\n\nOnce you get the basics going, the game is a grind. You will be constantly grinding for ressources in order to get better gear, tools and build bases in various different areas. You can be in PVP-situations every time you play, but most times you have a choice not to seek a fight by sneaking around. \nOnce you have the ressources to build a base, the desire will hit you to create a big one. The building-system is awesome and for the first time since World of Warcraft, I did not get bored grinding because building is so much fun. \n\nHowever, just as you can get killed in a classic pvp-weapon-fight: Your base can be raided and destroyed as well. And it will. \nThe game is basically (!) a great experience if you'd like to team up with friends, it has lovely graphics and just all around a great feeling.\n\nThe reason why I would like to disadvise and warn you to buy this game is simple: Hacking. It's a HUGE problem in Hurtworld, it has ever been and the dev's don't take it too seriously. \nIf you build a game in which the core value is grinding and securing your stuff in your base - the least you want is Hackers who compromise the game by using scripts that enable them to see what you have grinded. There are numerous hacks out there and they are frequently used. Search for \"Hurtworld hack\" on youtube and you will find ones from even October 2016. \n\nHurtworld integrated EasyAntiCheat recently but EAC does not detect all scripts. In fact, cheating in Hurtworld is common. \n\nAs much as I like the mechanics and the potential of this game ... you have to know that from mid-stage in the game on, you will not be grinding for yourself, but for the hackers who will raid your base(s) soon.\n\nAs a developer, you can build the best survival-building-pvp-experience but hacking, especially frequent hacking, makes it all worthless.

This game is still functionally pretty basic, but for some reason it is as addicting as meth. Well, as addicting as my friends tell me meth is, since I'd never ingest illicit drugs. Oh, Christ....insects crawling under my skin!!\n\nSo, anyway. Where were we?\n\nThat's right: Hurtworld. So it's early access survival and yup, I just saw you cringe and I felt your pain. When I saw this one pop up, I also somewhat sarcastically rolled my eyes at the thought of yet another survival sim, once again let loose in early frickin' access. The fat Irish policeman in my brain was instantly twirling a baton and snarling, \"Move along, folks. Nothing to see here.\"\n\nThen I heard that this is an Australian game. I, Sir, was coloured intrigued.\n\nSo at the time of writing this review I have about 50 hours up, most of that lone wolf, and I've had it less than a week. And I'm enjoying every bloomin' minute of it. But, if it is still so basic, why?\n\nHere's some pros:\n\n[*] Graphic design is a little unique, kind of cartoony, but not annoyingly so;\n[*] Light and shade is spot on - seeing a campfire from a distance at night for the first time was a treat;\n[*] Runs well and has surprisingly few problems and glitches - thereby putting AAA titles like H1Z1 and DAYZ to shame;\n[*] The biomes are each quite different - from sandy deserts and chilly snow, to what looks remarkably just like the Aussie outback; \n[*] The crafting tree is intuitive, and all the weapons, gear and machines can be crafted;\n[*] The infamy system ties to the amount of player kills, which means the killer then gains a higher loot loss rate on death - this seems so far to have acted as a \"consequence\" to discourage the kind of rampant KOSing that seems ever-present in games like DAYZ and Rust - meaning that I've met a ton of players in Hurtworld who don't just automatically want to rape my corpse as soon as they see me;\n[*] The survival aspect is interesting, as you can die from freezing at night, heatstroke in the desert and/or during duststorms, poison, radiation, and from an array of animals...not to mention other players;\n[*] Base building is a treat, with tons of scope for some quite sophisticated structures;\n[*] Bases and stored loot are permanent (until wipe, of course) and bases can only be breached using very difficult to craft C4 - meaning that most people will only go after a base if the perceived rewards outweight the hefty cost of the C4;\n[*] Guns are extremely hard to craft, and I mean extremely;\n[*] If you die, you keep all your basic tools in your hotbar as well as your clothes - unless you're infamous, at which time you can lose any of these;\n[*] This game sells itself as hard-core, and in many ways it is;\n[*] Good friendly devs; and\n[*] Air-humping with friends...yeah, baby. You know what I mean.\n\nHere's some cons:\n\n[*] Missing some way to identify KOSers and waste them without suffering infamy - this could be addressed by perhaps adding a bandit type skin system similar to old school DAYZ and also tweaking infamy;\n[*] No free look;\n[*] Still feels like it could contain a lot more content (the devs have said there's plenty more to come), as it seems once end game is reached (guns), there may not be much to do (but I could be talking crapola, having not yet reached endgame content);\n[*] Still has sociopathic KOSers (which is also kind of a positive) including one little annoying bast*rd who called out in a reedy ten year old's voice that he was friendly, and then promptly speared me in the face when I felt sorry for him and stopped to help...Oh, I'm coming for you sonny, and when I find you I'm going to hit you harder than puberty will; and\n[*] Missing unique character creation and no female characters. I really want female characters so that my air-humping exploits aren't always so Brokeback Mountainey.\n\nSo, in summary, although this game is in very early release and there's more filling in of content to be done, it already runs great and is just so fun to play. The devs are obviously very invested in it, and already are talking about some great content they want to introduce. \n\nFrom the minute you spawn and start hurriedly picking up driftwood and stones to build a fire and avoid freezing to death, to the point where build a base and fill it with high end machinery, you'll have a blast.\n\nYou should buy it.

Many of its gameplay elements are similar to its more popular predecessors, namely games such as Rust, DayZ, and Ark. However, while Hurtworld does not introduce many new concepts to the genre, it takes these preexisting gameplay elements and polishes them up to a shine not often found in Early Access titles.\n\nMost of the work done in both the closed Alpha and Beta was to create a stable and optimized foundation for new content to be added to when the game reached Early Access; compared to other games, FPS is relatively stable even at higher settings on lower end machines, and because the server handles a significant amount of the game calculations,  are more reliable, albeit more slow. This means far fewer instances of players hacking, and more accurate hitboxes for PvP, though it also means ping will be the determinate factor for how long it takes for that rock you picked up to show up in your inventory.\n\nThere seems to be a great deal of planning that went into the overall progression and balance of Hurtworld. Although lacking in content and variety, the existing model and flow is generally more enjoyable. Rather than giving tools durability and punishing the player with the annoyance of repairing and recrafting the same basic item every 50+ uses, many items and tools do not degrade in health and remain in the player's inventory even after death. This means more of the player's time is spent collecting resources, building bases, and interacting with other players, rather than mass-crafting a number of tools to ensure they are able to cut down a few trees by the end of the day.\n\nOn the topic of PvP, because the focus of the title is survival from the standpoint of environmental and player interaction rather than from the standpoint of mass collection of raw materials, the infamy system does a relatively fine job of keeping high tier players from picking on low tier new players. Because tools, clothing, and weapons stay in your inventory unless your infamy is above 1, and because infamy is only generated by killing other players, most players refrain from wasting their infamy on kills that are not profitable from an objective standpoint. Instead, high tier players tend to focus their PvP, if they do decide they need to kill, on other individuals that actually pose a threat to them; those with guns, cars, and bases.\n\nThe art style is reminscent of TF2, with highly saturated colors, beautifully hand drawn art, and clean, low poly models. This makes the environment rather ironically comfortable to play in, and provides a warm setting to relax in when not in immediate danger, but nicely juxtaposes to the actual risk and threat of death. Similarly, the colors and shapes make distinguishing players and fauna a much easier task on lower resolution monitors, where noisy models and textures create messy scenes over the vast open world of most survival games.\n\nOverall, Hurtworld is a rare gem of polish and potential, and while it lacks in content, the promise of modding opportunities, and beautiful code framework that has been put in place for these new additions, and the general developer transparency, put this game at a relatively good starting place if compared to titles of the same genre. If you already own Rust, Ark, DayZ, etc. and feel burned out on this type of gameplay, I do not recommend this game, as you won't find much new here.\n\nHowever, if you're relatively new to the genre, or found the poor performance and clunkiness of these other titles did not suite your gameplay requirements, Hurtworld provides oddly satisfying gunplay and a reliable network free from many of the meta issues that plague other games on the market. I would recommend supporting these developers in the hope that the interest in the game spurns their updates to be released timely and regularly, with the same polish as the rest of the title.", "timestamp_created": 1449442913, "timestamp_updated": 1449442913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782351434230804443", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22789454": {"recommendationid": "22789454", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991352270", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3197, "last_played": 1547882300}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was given up on by the community, I think the devs just lacked too much in sense of anti-hacker security & so everyone decided to stop playing, including myself.", "timestamp_created": 1462342337, "timestamp_updated": 1462342354, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 192, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78228682279586792", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23371424": {"recommendationid": "23371424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044097354", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3567, "last_played": 1547412409}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to recommend this game, but after the incredible lack of updates in the last 6 months and the absolute terrible community I cannot recommend this anymore.

[/b]\n[b] The game in the current stage is in Early Access but still plays better than most Early Access Titles :) [/b]\n\n[b] Why is it well Pre-Planned? [/b]\nThe game in the current state is really well pre-planned you are not able to attack the PVE monsters at early game. You need to hunt for your food on easy mobs such as Dears or Rabbits . if You try to fight a Boar on a early stage of the game without a bow you are most likely going to die but that's not the case of it beging pre-planned but the really well balanced loot and difficulty.  Making anything that's based on late game is a real challenge recipes for crafting are really well planned so it's not easy or either very very hard for the basic items but items such as Riffles are not that easy to make and would require a lot of time grinding items.Building in this game is really good planned you can't grief somoene's house with just an axe you need to grind really really hard to get C4.C4 is not really that common as you may think and it requires a lot of time trying to get the correct materials to craft 1 piece of it.Last but not least the cars and temperature system , cars are really easy to find around rad zones (radiation zones)/ Towns. The trick to that is that you will need to find a lot of parts before you can drive this beauty and that's really based on your luck in towns cause the only way to get parts is from looting towns.Temperature System is really balanced you can't get rid of the cold with crafting some clothes, you are only going to get Cold Resistance so each night you are going to need to stay close to a fire otherwise you are going to freeze to death.\n\n[b] Death In This Game [/b]\nDeath in this game is based on how much Infamous you are.(You get more Infamous by killing people . I'am not 100% sure about this part but from what i red and learned myself. When you are not Infamous you drop only your items but the items in your Hotbar are still there after death that means if you had tools in your Hotbar you are going to keep them and also your clothes, backpack etc. When you get Infamous you are going to lose all your items on death.\n\n[b] Diffuculty of learning the game. [/b]\nThe game itself is really easy to learn you don't need to dive into tutorials on how to do certain things crafting is the most simple thing you could think off.You can get into the game and get experienced really quickly without spending hours.\n\n[b] About Hurtworld [/b]\nHurtworld is a hardcore survival game and the developers did a really good job on making it really a hardcore game.First 10 minutes when I got into the game it was really hard to survive at all i barely made it alive from the first night the cold was really hard to get through while running for supplies to make a basic camp fire my i was getting colder every single second.Every night you need to stay close to a source of heat otherwise you are going to die.Ofcourse there is a way to increase cold resistance but it's still challenging to survive the night.\n\n[b] Game Pros and Cons [/b]\n\n[b] Game Pros [/b]\n+ Really Really good survival it's rough to survive the first days and still challenging in the later stage of the game.\n+ It's really hard to get guns,So basicly pvp is bows and spears\n+ Cars are really balanced they are there but they are element of the end-game.\n+ The entire game is very well pre-planned.\n+ You can't get griefed easily and it's really hard to make c4 to grief somoene.\n+ There is a lot of PVE elements such as hard creatures to kill such as (Yeti and a bird with 8x times bigger head than normal birds)\n\n[b] Game Cons [/b]\n- Map is not the biggest but it's good for the current state.\n- There is couple of glitches such as your head can glitch through the wall of your own house and you can die from somoene outside.\n-Wipes,Wipes,Wipes...The game is in EA so there will be a lot of wipes while updating so get ready for it before buying :)\n \n[b] Do i recommend the game in the current state? : Yes.

It offers so much opportunity to improve on other games in this genre, but in the end, you are much better off giving it more time to see if it will develop.   As it stands right now, it is not worth your time or money. \n\nPROS:\n+ The graphic style, while a little cartoonish at first, does work.  It looks nice and objects stand out in gameplay.\n\n+ Emphasis on survival.  You really can die of hunger and the elements if you do not take care of yourself.\n\n+ It is satisfying to build up your equipment.  No blueprint BS, just build and buff your stuff.\n\nCONS:\n- It is DEAD online.  You need to enjoy working by yourself and getting your hat handed to you by the one or two quasi clans on the few servers that sport more than 3 people online at any time.  This is a major problem that causes the other cons to spiral down even quicker.\n\n- It lacks direction.  The devs have abandoned V1 and now work on V2, which they call Experimental.  Makes you think it is a beta version, right?  Well, it sure is, but it is the only one with anything new, too.  The Devs change course seemingly update to update on the game direction, making major shifts.  This has made the game have a continuous learning curve, and rendered most online guides useless.   More than anything, this game really does not know what it wants to be when it grows up.  It has begun borrowing from other games like Rust, but sometimes without offering any new twist on the ideas.\n\n- It lacks a community.  Remember when I said it was dead?  Most players have left until things settle down.  No one is bothering to write guides, etc. when everything changes in short order.  Long time players are split between one group that wants it to be more and another that tells them to shut up and let the Devs work.  The Devs have apparently said they have made the decision not to try to rebuild the player base at this time and work on the game mechanics instead.  This is a terrible mistake, and might really mean they do not know how to bring them back.  It has meant that the two remaining camps are now just an echo chamber, and it is hard for new ideas to emerge from the community, which to me is one of the major benefits of early access.\n\n- It is buggy.  Expect things that worked yesterday to be broken today.  Expect a lot of hot fixes and server restarts.  Expect long reported problems to remain an issue.  Expect your **** to suddenly disappear from your inventory, your furnace and your storage containers.  Base building, which at first seems such an upgrade to other games, will become a nightmare over time when you try to lay a foundation that will just not ********** snap into the correct position for no known reason.\n\n- And the worse for last, it is tedious.  There is no end game, no real goal during play.  You will farm and grind, build up your equipment, gaining that previously mentioned satisfaction and then... nothing.  The same six mobs will do the same damn thing, run in the same damn patterns and give you the same damn loot regardless of how hard they are to kill.  There is not a great variety to equipment, or different things to do with it.  How you use it really doesn't matter.  Perhaps the worst examples are the landmarks, some of which are radioactive (sound familiar?).  The first time you find one, you will be excited.  Then you will notice the textures are missing; the buildings look very bland.  Still you will race around looking for that sweet loot.  Nope!  Most have nothing more than a rock to crush or a log to chop.  You cannot enter the buildings.  You can climb a few ladders, but this just wastes a few minutes and leads literally no where.\n\nIn the end, you will feel like Tom Hanks in Castway.  Alone, bored, day after day the same, nothing to do besides talking to Wilson, except Wilson isn't even a vollyball.  He's just a moldy orange with a weird name.   There are thousands of games on steam for $25 or less that will be far more satisfying.

And year after year a new survival game comes out which is IDENTICAL to the last. \n\nBe warned, this game is considered a Hardcore Survival. This isn't your average \"Get everything in 4 hours of gameplay\" game. It's hardcore, the biggest initial challenges is keeping your hunger bar under control and staying warm. The players aren't the only enemies in question here. The terrign, the animals, the players are all out there to kill you, and it's your job to stay alive. Having said that, when you have aquired your clothes as you may know you keep it (unless you're infamous). I love the infamous system as it makes people think twice before shooting noobs. \n\nThis game is absolutely amazing, I have played 6 hours of it currently and will be playing many many more. Those that are saying \"Oh right, yeah another survival sandbox big deal\" think again my academically challenged friend, this has all of the best parts of Rust, Arma 3, ARK all mixed into one orgggggggasmic game.

On the third day, after we finally began to gain enough courage to venture our to far reaches of the map, we opened our door to find 4 naked men standing outside, and they rushed in. We had somehow left our outside airlock open, and the moment I saw them, I knew it was over. Their 8 year old voices screeched through my headphones as they ransacked our base, taking everything and destroying our walls. I sat their shocked, letting myself get killed over and over by these nude characters that had inflicted so much pain on my soul.

Each one will kill you if it gets bad enough. The gunplay is fantastic and realistic. One shot kills most of the time, so people who have survived long enough to get a gun basically rule the region. Cars are EXTREMELY hard to come by and build, making them just that much more satisfying to finally finish.

Is it good and stable in it's current release? - no. It says I have ~50 h on it. I have actually played much more on the pirated version, before deciding to support the devs. \n\nPros:\n\n+ There are two different gamemodes. Vanilla (base game, doesn't get updates often) and V2 (is more similar to Rust). The second one is more up to date, seems to be more balanced and overall seems to run better.\n+ There are cars, motorcycles and four-wheelers. Some servers have kits to make it easy for you to get them. Usually you will have to farm pieces to make your vehicle functional. \n+ Game is not as harsh as Rust. If you are not into PvP, on death you will only loose resources that you have in your inventory. You will keep all your equiped gear and weapons if you are not infamous. If you are into PvP, you will notice that there is a unique \"infamous\" system which I mentioned earlier. If you have it, you are basically marked as a bandit and you will drop random equiped gear after death.  \n+ Colorful and good looking graphics.\n+ Nice base building system. (Similar to Rust).\n+ Different biomes, with different resource nodes and more or less, different aggresive animals. (Only skin changes, not the model.)\n\nCons:\n\n- Guns are NOT balanced at all. People will bunny-jump near you and shoot you with a shotgun using only one round. (Because when you jump, its accuracy becomes better? What? Yes.) Assault rifles have the same accuracy as bolt action rifles. You just need to get used to it. (Balanced? Nope), same goes for the pistol, but for a lower damage output. Bolt action seems to be in overall, most balanced. \n- Optimization. Oh boy, you will lag a lot. (More frequent in \"community servers\") This will be especially noticable in close, face to face fights. :) (Most people try to abuse it, they will jump around and with added server/game lag you will most likely be on the other side of the stick). Prepare your nerves and attidude that this is just an unfinished game and shit does happen.  \n- Animals, I have been playing this game for two years and they still seem to be some what bugged. It is not as bad as it used to be, but they will try to make your day miserable. (In V2 most animals will run from you, in vanila they will attack you and if you are into PvP, get prepared to be overhelmed.) \n- Raiding. There are no secure doors in hurtworld. Doesn't matter how though your base is, doors only require one C4 to be destroyed. My suggestion: if there is /sethome command in the server, use it and just teleport back to your home when you leave (have an exit on the 3rd floor or something). Do NOT build wooden houses. Please. Unless you aren't planning to keep your precious resources there and just want to rp. (Which I would not recommend).\n- Cheaters, exploiters, hackers. you name it. You will encounter them. Wallhacks and aimbots (usually aimbots accure in PvP based servers) are there and people using them are not punished. (additional note, usually russians do it. Damn commies.)\n", "timestamp_created": 1514550007, "timestamp_updated": 1514550007, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688948452472686768", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19542148": {"recommendationid": "19542148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069117292", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3851, "last_played": 1450593699}, "language": "english", "review": "There's still a lot of work to be done on this game, for example no time limit for spawning back at your totem so if you're attacking enemies at their base and you kill them, they can just respawn over and over and bombard you with the weapons they still keep at death.
