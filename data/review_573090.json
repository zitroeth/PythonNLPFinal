During this \"q&a,\" multiple contradictions were made, which shows that the developers are only really \"updating\" in order to make it seem like it's playable, and they still support it. However, if you've played it before, even before the space dlc came out, you'll realize that it's only gone downhill. However, this game was alright when the weapons DLC came out, but a bit after that, it went downhill, and it's become an unplayable, buggy mess. It's about as bad as when it was in early access; it's early access was buggy, but the full release didn't change much, if anything. Playing with friends is almost impossible due to the lag, desynch, and overall very poor optimization of the game. I like how advanced and detailed you can get, but you need an advanced understanding of Lua to make anything. Mind you, in this recent so-called \"q&a,\" they've said they don't want to fix certain bugs because it'll break players creations. The Q&A has basically said we don't want to work on this anymore. They don't want to add new blocks to a building game. And major updates are going to become smaller, they said. Meaning major updates aren't going to be major anymore. The most recent one added two blocks, a fishing rod, and a vacuum. That's it. That's all, nothing more. I would recommend against buying. They won't listen to you, and they won't fix the game. EDIT: The reason I have so many hours is due to the builder being decent, it isnt super complex that youd have to have an engineering degree to do anything, and finally due to the multiplayer. The multiplayer was what made it fun, however the multiplayer has degraded to such a point its unplayable, and due to my understanding of the q&a and even the recent update, the devs dont plan on fixing it.\n\nTLDR: Don't buy; developers are abandoning their game, making excuses that contradict themselves, and it's buggy as hell to the point where it's unplayable; they are even lying in a pre-recorded stream.", "timestamp_created": 1708636840, "timestamp_updated": 1709315943, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 238, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797050595283508301", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161609026": {"recommendationid": "161609026", "author": {"steamid": "76561199203252859", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 26456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26456, "last_played": 1710086805}, "language": "english", "review": "So i have been waiting a long time to post this review because i never thought it would finish at the rate the game is progressing (and i will probably keep updating it -FISHING LETS GO-).

The wide scope for creations is amazing, the campaign is fantastic and the progression is so satisfying and ALL of the DLCs (in my option) are amazing addition to the base game.

There is just not much to do with the stuff that you build. The campaign mechanics feel shallow. After 1-2 rescue missions you have seen them all. There is no need to improve the design because a simple rescue ship with water canon can do all the jobs. \n\nOnwards to cargo missions, until you realize there is no economy going on in the backround like for example in the X-games. Just random missions with not much more content than \"Bring stuff from A to B for Payment X\". Also there is no infrastructure at the harbours. You have to figure out yourself how you bring that container on your ship/waggon/plane. One may say \"thats the challenge!\" I say \"the developer was lazy to put any effort in the campaign mode\".\n\nResource hauling is the same as cargo missions, just with the little difference that you decide what you haul and were you bring it.\n\nAnd as far as I am aware, that is everything interessting you can do in the campaign. And now the question, why should I invest hundreds of hours in building beautifully crafted designs, when this is everything I can do with it? Why build a sub to reach sunken ships when there is nothing to discover? Why build a plane? Why build a truck? The basics of engineering is to solve problems, so why are there not more interessting problems to solve with engineering? Why should I use nuclear power or steam power when the good ol' diesel engine can do the same with less hassle? Also you need to make the world react to the actions of the player for a game to feel rewarding. Give us for example the possibility to raid the traveling ships and planes and let it have consequences. At least give us anything to do with them..\n\nThen there is all the stuff the community frequently asks to add like sails, COMMERCIAL fishing, more SAR stuff. But hey, we got compressible fluids now! And here, look we made a space DLC that nobody asked for, so that you can directly compare us to Kerbal Space Program 1! (Spoiler: KSP does it better.)\n\nStarting the review I was unsure to give a thumbs up or thumbs down, because the Builder part of the game is the best you can find on steam. But the more I wrote, the more I am convinced to not recommend the game. I will change this to a thumbs up, when they add more stuff to actually do besides building.\n", "timestamp_created": 1712310287, "timestamp_updated": 1712310287, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666029274463653564", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158547097": {"recommendationid": "158547097", "author": {"steamid": "76561199106896910", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1738, "playtime_at_review": 1955, "last_played": 1713694482}, "language": "english", "review": "stormworks is one of the best ship and train bast game i have never seen a game so fun and so cool is awsome and the sinking for the ships is just so cool like the carl D.bradly and all of the DLC's are so cool i like doing mining its so fun and i hope starter players have a awsome time and the game is one of the best game i have ever playedand i hope new players have fun to and my frends to :)", "timestamp_created": 1708191012, "timestamp_updated": 1708191012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641438543796539307", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159746747": {"recommendationid": "159746747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198990487146", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5418, "last_played": 1710712411}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the modern gaming market.\nI love how instead of updates we get overpriced under-delivered DLC that tried to take a game that already doesn't have good direction into even more directions.\nThe developers of this game seem to hate the people that support them for some reason, and insist on charging you $10 for things that should have been a regular update to the lacking base game.\nThe only thing this game currently has as far as content is building the vehicles, the missions are a joke and boring.

Everything is completely broken, I'm actually not surprised when I discover a new bug, because that happens every 2 minutes or so. \n\nRopes and hoses are nuts, weighing tons and flipping boats when attached. Light sources emit light through solid walls. Creations completely freak out when reset to the workbench from a larger distance. And that's just scratching the surface.\n\nEach time a \"major\" update is introduced a large portion of the already existing game is completely broken. The devs then band-aid the newly appeared bugs, which in itself creates other bugs. The newly introduced pressure system with the Space DLC (which nobody had asked for), completely broke steam engines. And the developers' solution? Totally nerfing the steam engines making them nearly useless. \n\nAnd then we have the fact that after spending hours building an advanced creation you are left with nothing to actually do with it. Career mode is completely abandoned, there are like 2 or 3 mission types and they are boring as hell. To make the game more interesting there are natural disasters, or in short, a random tsunami every 5 minutes, which sends your boat on land if you are near a dock and you then have to start over whatever you were doing.\n\nAt this stage I can't recommend this game. Sure, it's unique, one of a kind. There's no other sandbox vehicle builder that's as advanced. But the devs never listen to the player base. Countless bugs completely ruin the experience.

But i don't recommend Stormworks due to its updates for the community, The Space DLC is good but it doesn't feel right, The Natural Disasters update was good, Tho it also didn't feel that fun, There was also the fishing DLC that came out lately but i haven't checked it out yet, Now the Weapons DLC is what i want to talk about, When the weapons DLC came out it was the greatest thing i imaged but it soon lost that happiness, There wasn't alot of features. It offered 4 guns, SMG, Rifle, Pistol, and speargun ( Including the Ammo For All The Guns And Implacement Weapons ) , It also offered  2 explosives, C4, and Grenades. Besides that it offered 7 implacement guns. In my opinion the Weapons DLC offered little, The devs probably could of made more weapons, Including implacement guns, More explosives/gear, And more weapon features. I think that the devs didn't really put that much effort into making the Weapons DLC, I'm not saying that all updates don't have effort put into them, like the Space DLC and the Natural Disaster DLC had tons of effort put into them, They just don't feel right [u] To Me [/u].

Only buy this game if you are one of three things:\n\n1. Extremely comfortable with in-game logic systems. If you can make working contraptions with Minecraft's redstone system or stuff like that without referencing tutorials, this will be right up your alley.\n\n2. Only planning on using things from the workshop that other people have made. If the build/design aspect of the game doesn't really appeal to you and you just want to hop in-game and rescue people, you should be fine; the workshop looks like it has a whole bunch of neat stuff.\n\n3. Really stubborn and kinda dumb. Like me.\n\nI bought the game without realizing just what the build system entailed, and boy did I get a nasty shock. This game does not have a learning curve. Nor does it have a learning cliff. Oh, no. It has a learning [i]abyss[/i]. You'll say to yourself, \"Self, this boat should be two blocks wider. I shall cut and paste as needed in the builder to widen it!\" And then, before you know it, you've spent 30 hours reading up on logic circuits and gear ratios, because that cut-paste thing you did messed up the logic, and now the boat won't start.\n\nSimply put, this is the kind of game that assumes you know how gear ratios work and that you can program an Arduino. Ha ha! Silly game! I drive a Honda Odyssey and studied history. Gear ratios and logic circuits are basically black magic.\n\nA smart person would have gotten a refund. I am not a smart person. I am, however, very stubborn, so I stuck it out, and finally learned how to make ships that work. They don't work [b]well[/b] -- at all -- but they work. And I'm glad I stuck it out, because the gameplay part of Stormworks is great, and building the boats and things itself is as fun as any other block building game.

I couldn't have been more wrong.  It's actually the greatest, most detailed model building game that's ever existed.\n\n     Whether we're talking aesthetics or engineering, the scale and depth of Stormworks is absolutely incredible.  At half the size of the smallest block in Space Engineers, Stormworks allows you to build small.  Of course you can build huge ships, planes, cars, submarines, helicopters, and even trains, but you can fill them with a level of aesthetic detail that's impossible in any other building game.\n\n     That's not where it ends though.  The actual engineering in Stormworks puts Space \"Engineers\" to shame, and I love Space Engineers, and I mean 3,000 hours love it.  Where most games would give you an engine or power block and call it a day, Stormworks allows you to create your own cooling systems, electrical systems, fuel systems, air intakes, gearboxes, clutches, all with a nice sprinkling of options and sliders to adjust them to your preferences.\n\n     But it doesn't end there... Hooking these components together is just the beginning.  Stormworks gives you the option to make these systems do EXACTLY what you want with a powerful and intuitive logic editor or Lua programming.  Want to add interior lights that come on when you open the door to your car?  Want a door chime?  Do you want a climate control system that you've designed yourself?  Want a crane to deploy your lifeboat if your ship starts to sink?  The creative options in this game are endless.  Truly endless.  Like I said, the depth of this game is like nothing else.  There is almost nothing you can't build, almost nothing you can't do in this game.\n\n     Oh, and there are also cameras.  And monitors that display video.  In real time.  You can remotely control things and talk to your friends on the radio that you've built yourself.  I could write a novel about how much I love this game, but you should really play it for yourself.\n\n     Long story short, if you're looking for the best building game on Steam or anywhere, or if you just want a game that allows you to sail beautifully detailed ships and drive interesting vehicles, you've found it.  Buy it right now.  Tell someone else to buy it right now.  Saying I can't recommend Stormworks enough is underselling it, and that's the truth.  Of all the games I own and play, I've only ever written a review for one:  Space Engineers.  It's an amazing game.

It has its issues, sure, but it has quickly risen to be one of my all-time favourite games. \nBest 15 bucks I think I ever spent.\n\n[h1] Short summary [/h1]\n[b]Pros:[/b] \n+ incredibly satisfying building \n+ almost endless design and system building possibilities\n+ physics; simplified and modified, yet relatable and the basis of everything\n+ simulated weather systems\n+ nice art style and atmospheric environmental effects\n+ loads of cool Workshop content and environmental mods\n+ frequent updates and community-voted feature implementations\n+ Video tutorials for basic game mechanics\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- performance issues with big creations and slow CPUs generally / single thread dependency\n- Multiplayer isn't capable of \"co-op\" building or many creations simultaneously\n- Career mission content limited\n- simplified physics, rare hiccups \n\n[h1] Long-winded review and love letter [/h1] \n\nIf you are looking for a physics based, complex and satisfying building game that doesn't limit your creativity by offering virtually unlimited possibilities of design that also allows you to use your creations, look no further. I've spent over 500 hours in Stormworks so far and can't imagine being bored with it any time soon.\n\nThe gameplay around the building isn't really where this game shines. The periodically spawned missions are relatively simple and repetitive, but give an incentive for new designs and spark ideas for optimising existing ones. They can provide pacing too if you play the career mode, as you will need to earn money for bigger and better creations and to maintain them. Career mode also offers a tech-tree if you choose \"Classic Career\" for progression and more of a challenge. Don't expect a story line though, there isn't any.\nCustom mode is exactly what it sounds like and can be great for prototyping or just for creative building without any limitations.\n\nThe missions are search and rescue themed, as the game's title suggests. They'll usually have you searching for people in emergencies and always have a time limit. So you'll need to figure out what sort of vehicle to build or take, if you can make it there in time, how much fuel it's going to take and what implements you'll need to find, rescue and give medical attention to the people you're trying to get to a hospital for example. Besides extinguishing fires, towing stranded vehicles on water and land, retrieving items or ferrying passengers there isn't a ton of variety. Though missions definitely impact differently depending on the weather. It's a totally different beast rescuing someone in the middle of a thunderstorm at night, in thick fog or on a sunny, calm day.  \nThe other way to make money is with cargo. You can ferry containers that have rewards depending on the distance they need to travel or you can buy and sell diesel, jet-fuel or crude oil. \n\nThere's also a bit of a survival aspect to the game, as environmental hazards like cold temperatures, sharks, fires or dangerous parts of machinery will hurt you and NPCs. Running out of fuel or damaging your vehicle without welders on board might leave you stranded etc.. You can turn all of that off independently though. \nThe weather can also get dangerous, as wave intensity is dependent on wind speeds and water depth. Small boats can easily be capsized by waves and planes and helicopters become quite a handful in strong winds.\n\nStormworks doesn't take you by the hand and offers an amount of satisfaction with your own creations and creativity like no other game I have ever played. It just hands you the tools and says \"have fun\". Something doesn't work? Figure out how it does yourself (Although the devs have put up video tutorials for basic mechanics), just like you would when making something work in real life. Often times solutions that work resemble those used in real-life, thanks to its physics system everything has to abide by. This incentivizes real world research and learning about physics / maths or engineering basics, which I think is awesome.\n\nThe physics are very inspired by real-world physics but are modified and simplified to balance the game, limit performance issues and keep it fun. Although, every once in a while you'll need to work around the simplified model and sometimes the kraken can strike too. When collisions are too strong or too fast objects can sometimes glitch into each other and spin out of control for example. If you don't provoke it, it's pretty rare for that stuff to happen though. \nI'd describe the feel of the physics a bit like the game looks - sort of a simplified, comic-version of reality. \n\nSpeaking about the visuals: I really like the art style and lighting in this game. The monochrome \"textures\" and voxel/polygon geometry makes your creations visually fit into the world very well and lets the blocky building mechanics feel sensible in a nice way, I think.\n\nThe building is where it's at with this game as I said before. \"Advanced mode\" is where it really shines. There are basically no pre-built components like a crane for example. Want a crane? Make whatever crane you want or could think of. Basic building blocks include things like servo pivots, winches, propellers, engines, batteries, gauges, displays and so on. You will have to wire electricity and trigger signals / data wires to basically everything. This also means everything is customizable by design. Pass a signal through a custom microprocessor and do whatever you want with it or just use basic logic to manipulate it. Use the reverse gear signal to trigger reversing cameras or write your own autopilot navigation systems within a LUA script for example. I've learned the basics of LUA scripting and a lot about real-life physics and engineering just by researching stuff I wanted to make in game. I have still to come by any idea that isn't possible to make in Stormworks; planes, trains, cars, boats, submarines, bases, machinery - whatever you can think of, you can make it. Unless it goes way past the games mechanics, defies the laws of physics or needs obnoxious amounts of processing of course.\n\nProcessing is definitely something that can become an issue. Very large creations or immense amounts of logic or moving parts slow down the game once your CPU can't handle it anymore. Physics processing has to be done on a single CPU thread because collisions can only be calculated when everything is together on one thread - as far as I've understood it. So, fast single core performance is king in Stormworks and gives you more freedom in how much stuff you can pile onto a creation / your screen. \nIf you're close to land performance will take a hit. You won't notice when there's enough CPU headroom, but when there isn't it can slow down to a crawl, especially when there's a lot of physics objects around. When the physics rendering drops below 60 fps (the physics fps cap) the game will slow down as it still calculates every frame (30 physics render fps = 50% usual physics speed). \n\nOverall this game is amazing in my opinion. It offers an amount of building freedom that seems unprecedented and lets you use your own creations in whatever way you see fit. Stormworks doesn't offer mountains of gameplay features, but incredibly well thought-out building blocks for your own challenges and successes, that feel almost endless. \nThe devs are continuing to improve the game very regularly and put new community-voted features to the test in the experimental branch for play-testing and feedback before rolling them out in updates together with bug fixes and general improvements. They haven't slowed down after the game exited early access either, which is just awesome to see. \n\nI couldn't recommend this game enough and hope my ramblings have convinced you to try it out, which you totally should if you are reading this. \n\nAlso: thank you Sunfire for making and continuously improving this amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1610479470, "timestamp_updated": 1611002603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.899634838104248047", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76132351": {"recommendationid": "76132351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011577119", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6167, "last_played": 1697902293}, "language": "english", "review": "EDI EDIT: GO GO GO!

For over a year and a half now, I've been having fun with one of the best vehicle sandbox games on the market. But in retrospect, I wish I had never purchased it, simply because of how much of my life it consumed before I finally realised that I was not happy with the status quo.\n\n\n[h2] The Good [/h2]\n\nStormworks is (according to my steam hours) my favourite game on the platform, having spent 1695 of them on the game learning how to build vehicles and have fun while I'm doing it. The depth that you can build with is astounding. The brains of every creation in this game is entirely up to you through the use of logic parts.\n\nEach vehicle that you can build in this game is as unique as the idea that inspires it, and with hundreds of parts to choose from, you will [i]almost[/i] feel as though the possibilities are endless. If you are fluent with programming languages, you can even use Lua to step the complexity up a notch to make some truly amazing creations.\n\nThe steam workshop for this game is very powerful, and allows even new players to enjoy the best that this community has to offer without the several thousand hours that these creators spend designing these vehicles and uploading them.\n\nIf you can program well enough, you can even use Lua to design new content for the game (or to expand on existing content) through the use of the addon editor, which goes even further to making the game stand out from the rest. And, of course, these addons can also be uploaded to the steam workshop for others to enjoy\n\nThe community can be extraordinarily helpful in helping players with any and all issues that they come across, and there are few things as engaging as finding a tight-knit community of avid players on some small community discord to bounce ideas off of and to interact with.\n\n\n[h2] The Meh [/h2]\n\nThe world is bland and uninteresting. The vast majority of it is simply empty ocean, and the entire game happens within a 30km radius around the main two areas of the game. Everything outside of this area is just a randomly generated scattering of tiny uninteresting islands, mostly serving as a featureless expanse to make the world seem larger than it is. Fine for a vehicle sandbox, but ultimately lackluster for a game area.\n\nThe physics of this game are above average at best. Particularly when you start to explore possibilities, you quickly find that many of the issues that plague other physics based vehicle builders are in full force here too, such as stretching joints and awkward collisions. Stormworks, however, puts players in situations where these physics issues can become real problems, and it does so quite often.\n\nThe game uses a somewhat unique method for keeping things stable in that the game's tick speed will decrease based on CPU use, meaning that 60 in-game ticks [i]always[/i] equates to exactly one in-game second. this causes increased reliability for all of your control systems, and allowing the game to maintain a smooth 60fps, even with enormous CPU destroying creations in the scene.\nHowever, this method has one major downside; the game will go into slow-motion whenever the CPU is overworked, and thats enough to knock this one from a \"good\" thing to a \"meh\" thing.\n\nThe career mode that the game has is bland and boring at the very best, and downright frustrating at worst. All 4 of the missions included with the game itself are randomly generated and randomly placed on the map, with very little (if anything!) to distinguish them from each other. After the first 10 or so hours spent driving vehicles around a featureless blue horizon, you really start to wonder [i]why[/i] you are even bothering in the first place.\n\nThe tutorial of the game might as well not exist. I'd even go so far as to say that if you know anything about the game genre, you would be better off skipping the ingame tutorial entirely. If I was a new player, this tutorial would definitely go in the next category..\n\n\n[h2] The Bad [/h2]\n\nLet me get this out of the way really quick before i start this portion of the review. This concept for this game is a gem, but in retrospect, the team of people who happened upon this diamond in the rough are just about the worst people who could have been chosen among this grouping of vehicle sandbox builder devs. My respect for them has been steadily declining with each update they release for this game. Most negative things I have to say in this section can be traced back to their inability to accept mistakes in some way.\n\nThe multiplayer in this game is horrible. By far one of the least stable multiplayer experiences I've ever had, and there's a good reason for this; This is a vehicle sandbox builder, and making multiplayer modes for a game like this is extremely hard. It's honestly a miracle that they managed it at all. However, its hard to ignore the state of Stormworks multiplayer as a slow, unstable mess that can only be enjoyed for brief periods in the creative mode, among two people who are geographically close.\n\nThe game uses a voxel grid for all of its building. These grid cubes are always solid and a part's logic connection nodes (used for linking components together to form those wonderful vehicle brains I spoke about a while ago) take up an entire voxel cube, meaning that dozens of parts have voxels in somewhat asinine positions where the model of the part you place may have stopped already. This makes compact construction significantly more frustrating than it already is.\n\nThe game also uses an extremely simplistic model for all kinds of aerodynamics and drag, both in and out of the water, resulting in planes that can take off without runways but that will lose altitude immediately after the engines are switched off, and boats that can reach nearly triple or sometimes even quadruple their normal speed if you can haul them out of the water with a hydrofoil, and submarines that can reach higher top speeds than their surface dwelling companions.\n\nThe buoyancy mechanics are supremely unintuitive, and due to the weight balancing of the game, vehicles with little options for adding flotation (float planes/helicopters specifically) suffer from this a lot, causing vehicles to sink as if they were made of lead. The compartment flooding that comes as a part of this is oftentimes even worse, often resulting in water that weighs twice as much as it should.\n\nThe Lua script editor included in the vehicle editor is horrendous. lacking even basic features like an undo button, and the scripts have an arbitrary character limit of 4096, often forcing players to make their scripts unreadable to anyone simply to squeeze extra characters into it. The addon script editor is just as bad, but has a character limit of 130 thousand instead, proving that the 4096 character limit is unneeded.\n\nhttps://geometa.co.uk/support/stormworks/3401/\n\n\n[h3] In Conclusion [/h3]\n\nMy overall opinion of is that its a decent game, and if you only care about bang for your buck, then you [i]could[/i] absolutely enjoy this one, provided you are the type of person who loves vehicle sandboxes, of course.\n\nBut, the actions of the development team who run the show sour the entire experience enough that I personally can't keep playing the game with the knowledge that the extremely subpar quality of each update is as good as it'll ever get.\n\n\nIf you read this far you must have a lot of time on your hands; this was a massive wall of text, for sure.\n\n\n\nTL:DR Good game, terrible dev team", "timestamp_created": 1642116696, "timestamp_updated": 1652840904, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 917, "votes_funny": 67, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870460629463195801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121591177": {"recommendationid": "121591177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198823072936", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 3354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3050, "last_played": 1685410369}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun!\n\nthose sirens tho, seriously shut up", "timestamp_created": 1662065420, "timestamp_updated": 1662065420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.868600189685821533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88982251": {"recommendationid": "88982251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283465139", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 354, "last_played": 1642595185}, "language": "english", "review": "1) Build machine\n2) watch machine not work\n3) Edit machine\n4) machine still doesnt work\n5) give up\n6) download machines from workshop", "timestamp_created": 1616560178, "timestamp_updated": 1616560178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 112, "votes_funny": 143, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864480674266815186", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78007501": {"recommendationid": "78007501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164575216", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7318, "last_played": 1705114996}, "language": "english", "review": "epic, but what would be more epic is better destruction physics", "timestamp_created": 1603444190, "timestamp_updated": 1603444190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 107, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864404916763305664", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129145308": {"recommendationid": "129145308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198951643186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 887, "last_played": 1664243768}, "language": "english", "review": "idek how to build the stuff i just like crashing passenger jets into trees", "timestamp_created": 1671856366, "timestamp_updated": 1671856366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 64, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86209571361541748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150777291": {"recommendationid": "150777291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198845638854", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11092, "last_played": 1710725627}, "language": "english", "review": "i got a helicopter\ni flew my helicopter\ni aimed my helicopter at a hospital\ni parachuted out of my helicopter before it crashed\ni got home\ni loaded up stormworks", "timestamp_created": 1700614975, "timestamp_updated": 1700614975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 126, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862401127815246582", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50256367": {"recommendationid": "50256367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149161848", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 282418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56549, "last_played": 1681929259}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played more than quite a bit now so I thought it was time to leave a review.

There's a huge world to discover and you'll be impressed by how detailed the physics is within stuff like airodynamics, fluid pressure, temperature and even underwater pressure. Pumping water out of an airlock while 200 meters under the ocean will no doubt take some time. \n\nThe community is small enough for you to easily come in contact with people on discord and share knowledge as people are always willing to help. Which is good since the learning curve might be a bit steep, but there's some good tutorial lying around to help you get started. And to quote an old slogan from a well known building game: \"The only limit is you imagination\", and your pc specs, and your skill level, but you'll get there.", "timestamp_created": 1555874377, "timestamp_updated": 1555874377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858347415924072266", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148110583": {"recommendationid": "148110583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194837293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 21070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 769, "playtime_at_review": 11843, "last_played": 1713129509}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game before the space DLC.

There is a lot of anger for the latest Stormworks Update and DLC.\n\nI completely understand why there is so much frustration and anger directed towards the devs.\nUnfortunately they never seem to understand why the community backlash happens with updates and DLC releases.\n\nMy own opinion is it's because Geometa refuses to directly interact with the Stormworks Community. They hide behind the motto of \"giving the community the tools\" to allow them to interact with each other as a self-supported community.\nI think this is wrong, and it makes things worse.\n\nI'm aware that the community of course will always be unhappy with some aspect of an update or change. However, I believe it amplifies all the negative knee-jerk responses simply because Deltar and Geometa literally hides from direct community interaction.\n\nFor example, Instead of coming out today with the release and doing a live stream explaining what changes were made, why changes were made and why they believe the changes made are for the better of the game - they dump massive changes and a dlc for the game and runaway.\n\nThis behavior is not new and Deltars has done interviews where he states that they intentionally stay away from interacting and acknowledging the community and it's various groups and members. (Roughly - the idea is a community that supports itself)\n\nOf course they send out keys to content creators with numbers to boost Geometa's sales and maybe once in awhile drop a name in a Friday update as long as said name is a cheerleader, but for the most part speaking with and talking to the \"actual\" community is something Deltars and Geometa avoids outright.\n\nCurrently there was some talk they are working on a hotfix(s) for today's DLC and Game Update. Something that really shouldn't be needed if the game was actually tested.\n\nAnd when I say tested i mean tested with community builders that have countless hours interacting with the game systems. Instead I believe the game was internally \"tested\" which I'm guessing revolves around implementing a feature and \"testing\" if it works as intended and not testing the game as a whole. I don't think they actually test changes by interacting with various builds and then communicating how the update is/will impact previous workshop content directly to the community.\n\nAnd of course as mentioned above - even if this were to occur, Deltars and Geometa does not interact with the community. Communicate directly with the community and walk us thru changes and how they may impact older builds and more importantly - why builds may have issues and how to approach the new changes and possibly update older builds.\n\nInstead as stated above - they drop giant changes and runaway leaving the community to do quality assurance and try to support each other without a clear understanding of the \"why\" and \"whats\" of the update.\n\nAnyway, in short, the bottom line is they need to stop hiding from the community and directly communicate with community and i don't mean fluff PR Friday update text copies. No other Dev at this level would behave this way with a community that truly cares about the game,..\n\n-Endo", "timestamp_created": 1697168316, "timestamp_updated": 1697168316, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 415, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837498962879180908", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82647557": {"recommendationid": "82647557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070208678", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 54178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20457, "last_played": 1702403953}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit: as of less than a month ago, I found a server associated with this game, named Lost Latitude.  It is a hardcore server that addresses a few of the issues listed below with custom scripts.  As such, I have started back to playing the game on that server for the time being.\n\n\nThis game is the closest thing we have to an actual vehicle building and simulation game that isn't a dumpster fire.  It has feats to actually accomplish and actually challenges the player with a mode other than creative mode and derivatives of creative mode unlike Brick Rigs.  Unlike Space Engineers, it does not take 6 hours to do a single task in the game and is not hamstrung by a complicated UI and resource management meta. However, because of an incompetent dev team, this game is still giving off signals that my time is better spent elsewhere\n\n\n- The developers made a decent game with a few gamebreaking bugs, and then decided to focus on updating it with needless fluff that introduces new, worse gamebreaking bugs instead of fixing anything in a timely fashion.  This has been their method of development before and after they \"exited\" early access.\n\n- Speaking of \"Early Access\", the meaning of why you would exit EA is apparently lost here.  The \"Release\" of the game was marked by the same buggy nature we all know and love, and tossing out the existing mission API for a new variant that to this day hardly anyone understands due to a severe lack of documentation.  All existing missions at the time were immediately broken and still remain on the workshop, which bring me to the next point.\n\n- A huge portion of the workshop is occupied by uploads that have been rendered useless by one of many updates that changed the core game.  They are not marked as \"incompatable\" and make it near impossible to find something functional or up to date with essential newer components.\n\n- This game will drop simulation speed for reasons that make zero sense, such as having a ship parked next to a land mass.\n\n- The pointless \"Experimental Branch\" is merely just a dumping ground for their \"more experimental\" ideas, while the main branch will on occasion have some untested \"surprise update\" added that also introduces yet another critical bug.  Due to a recent fire spread update as of the time I am writing this, my dedicated server now cannot remain up for more than an hour without crashing if 4+ players are connected, and yet they still focus development on new \"modular engines\" and more \"AI vehicles\" the latter of which cause server sim speed to nose dive when enabled.  You are no longer in Early Access.  Stop treating your entire playerbase like they are your beta testing slaves. \n\n- Speaking of dedicated servers, you must use Windows to run a Stormworks dedi.  Windows Server is an awful OS to rent a machine under, often doubling or even tripling the monthly price for the license and featuring an enormous burden on system resources to even run the OS idle.  Most decent game server hosting providers that offer a far cheaper Stormworks web panel rental will still charge $15/mo or more.  Windows emulation stand-ins like WINE have given me no success.\n\n- Lack of any server moderation tools outside of the bare minimum.  Vanilla Minecraft in 2011 had more tools than this.  You have to find or make a administrative lua script to have any method of keeping the peace.\n\n- Third thing about servers, there is no in game countermeasure for keeping someone from spawning a vehicle that has enough logic/electricity nodes and calculation running at the same time to kill a NASA supercomputer.\n\n- Kids, particularly walking talking \"Zoomer\" stereotypes that fell out of the Camodo/SpyCakes youtuber fandoms or some other horror of the web.  They contribute nothing productive to this game and annoy everyone else.  They make up the majority of the current playerbase due to everyone else getting alienated by the direction this game is going.  If you are if the company of someone that constantly utters classic phrases like \"can i have auth\", \"wher r you\", \"help me i dont know wher i am\" and spawns giant laggy workshop creations that lack any helpful navigation tools and does not know how to operate the vehicle for 2 minutes without slamming it into a lighthouse, you have my empathy.\n\n- This game's idea of PR is a discord community that is interacted with not by them, but a few volunteer moderators, and the worst excuse for an admin bot I have seen in years, randomly taking administrative action against users for stupid reasons like forgetting to comment lua code.  The only time you will see generally see the dev team say anything is during a weekly update, posted in the discord and steam community.  Want to bring an issue to their attention?  Post it on their issue tracker website, and pray that they stop working on the \"experimental branch\" long enough to read in a timely fashion.\n\n- We have lost a ton of creative talent (a factor that could kill this game) simply due to the way they are treated.  I can bear witness to a couple:  A retired US army engineer who made frequent uploads to the workshop was permanently banned from the discord for posting a image of a cat (which memes are permanently bannable for some dumb reason),  A web dev that made several tools to help with making vehicles and scripts for the game closed up shop and left after observing the antics of the dev team for a long time.  The straw that broke the camel's back was being muted by the discord bot for a reason so petty that it is impossible to remember.\n\n- Weapon DLC.  Don't even dare entertain the thought of selling DLC if you cannot get your act together with the base game.\n\n- Currency is shared between all players on the server in Career.  Humans are selfish and wasteful creatures.  There is a reason why hardly anyone publicly hosts a career server.  Some people have recently attempted to code a wallet system, but it is missing certain key features like earning money from missions.\n\n\nAs of me posting this, the developers have written that they are taking two weeks off for the holidays instead of making some quick fixes to the main branch regarding the server hosting issues I mentioned earlier.  My server's rent expires in mere days and I will not be renewing.  I am done trying to work around this game's issues and development sins.  This review will probably get the typical developer response I have seen on other bad reviews of this nature, saying \"We are more open to communication now/fixing bugs as we speak\" at some point.  My response is as follows: \"Actions speak louder than words.\"  I will check up on this game occasionally, but until I see some long term results, I will be recommending that people spend their dollars/time elsewhere.

There are countless issues with this game but I'll do my best to sum them up as I've seen them.\n\n[b] The Developers [/b]\nThe behavior of the developers over the past few years has been completely unacceptable. They regularly ban people from their Discord for criticizing them or their game, including some of the most active members of the community. Moreover, they often use XML-modded vehicles in the screenshots for their development updates; You would have to edit the game files to build them yourself. This is promotional material that, in my opinion, is misleading you to believe the content showed is in the base game. The developers also continuously add content that no one asked for while neglecting bugs, performance, and gameplay issues.\n\n[b] The Building [/b]\nWhile playing this game, you'll find that you spend more time on YouTube or Reddit or somewhere else trying to learn how to create something than actually creating it. [i] Everything [/i] in this game is complicated and poorly optimized. The game does not tell you how to do any of the complicated stuff and the item descriptions are next to useless. The complexity is dramatically compounded by the number of bugs in the game.\n\nEverything in this game is slightly off in some way. Want to build a submarine? The electric motors use a ton of electricity and don't produce much power, so it'll be slow and will run out of battery before you can get anywhere. Want to build a tank? Good luck building an engine that can move it more than a few miles per hour because the rolling resistance on tank tracks is enormous. Want to build a train? Have fun running a single route because even switching tracks is needlessly complicated. Want to build a large ship? I hope you have a supercomputer because the physics will slow down to a crawl.\n\n[b] The Gameplay [/b]\nOnce you have a vehicle you like, whether you've built it or downloaded it from the workshop, the gameplay itself is incredibly boring, bordering on nonexistent. The map is empty, being mostly ocean, and the landmasses are as desolate as the ocean is. There used to be fun missions to play until the developers removed them, reworking the mission system entirely. The missions we have now are boring and repetitive. Besides that, you can transport cargo or go mining (if you fork over $10 for the Industrial Frontier DLC), but there isn't really a point to doing so.\n\nMultiplayer can be fun for a while, but there aren't many active servers and it has poor performance with a large number of vehicles.\n\n[b] The Good [/b]\nThe community of this game is extremely talented, and there are some amazing creations on the workshop. A good amount of my enjoyment from this game comes from messing around with random creations.\n\nThe logic components are unparalleled in any other game. I have a degree in computer science, so working with the logic and Lua modules is very fun for me. It's not perfect, the GUI is difficult to understand and having logic interact with your physical components is more complicated than it needs to be. Even so, the logic is another bright spot in this game.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\nThis game doesn't know what it's supposed to be. It's way too complicated and there is little to no in-game help for new players. At the same time, the physics are subpar and janky (especially aerial physics) and the gameplay is uninspired. The game is riddled with bugs and other issues, and the developers are more focused on silencing criticism than fixing anything.

Every time i added something, something else broke. Added more powerful engines? Boat becomes unstable and barely turning. Stabilize it? Boat becomes faster and starts flying because tiny wings does that here. Get some downforce, adjust the propellers? Boat becomes slow. Gear it up? Boat becomes fast but starts oscillating.\n\nThis is the kind of thing you can expect from this game. This boat that i first made, started with electrical engines, then jets, then electrical again, and now highly optimized diesel engines, good gearing, and a well stabilized hydrofoil which allows me to go over 200km doing near 300 km/h over water. This took upto 100 hours to achieve (with my noobish building and my friend cleaning up after me and adding QoL changes), but god damn it's rewarding seeing this menacing boat we made outturn, outspeed, and outgun almost any other boat on a multiplayer server. The AI has nothing on us, we shred them.\n\nIf you can stick around long enough to actually grasp how amazing the vehicle editor is, how incredibly complex you can make something like a small boat, then this is the game for you. You can also pull stuff from the workshop (which most of the time, isn't that bad), but i highly recommend just going into the editor and start building something, you will eventually learn.\n\nThe editor is also like no other game. You can cut half your build, and it will include any connections for logic, electric, and other thing when you paste it back in. You can also copy whole sections and mirror them or turn them in any way you want and then attach it again without losing any progress. Coming from lower level block-voxel builders, this is truly a blessing.\nThe constant updates also helps keep the game relevant.", "timestamp_created": 1685376925, "timestamp_updated": 1685376979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821258842945098877", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123814578": {"recommendationid": "123814578", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998099312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 108326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3757, "playtime_at_review": 86431, "last_played": 1713661046}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT, 1 year later: Remember when this game used to be about WORKing in a STORM at SEA (the SW logo) to put out fires and rescue NPCs? No, you don't remember? That's ok, apparently neither do the devs.\n\nORIGINAL: \nI have played Stormworks for almost exactly a year now.  It is the best Worst Game I have ever played.  If the devs prioritized fixing the ever-expanding list of bugs and issues instead of building roadmaps that introduce polygonal pixel ponies, then the game might be much more accessible and satisfying to novice and veteran players alike.  \n\nFYI, since it's topical to this week, the new Industrial Frontier DLC changed the world seed generation algorithms, thus breaking all prior saves.  Such save corruptions have happened before in this game's life cycle; they will probably happen again.  Buyer beware.  \n\n - - - - - The Good\n\n~ Water physics and weather effects are pretty dope.  You might actually get sea sick.  \n~ Many missions are so difficult or frustrating (unintentionally) that you are likely to shout aloud with joy when you see those $3,000 reward popups appear on the side of your screen.  \n~ Forget playing brain games online to extend the longevity of your brain's health.  Just spend an hour in a Stormworks microcontroller (MC) and you'll have all of the mental exercise you need for a week.  \n~ Stormworks is like Kerbal Space Program except you can't go to space, so no player ever has to feel that failure ever again!  \n\n\n - - - - - The Bad\n\n# Career\n~ Unspent fuel is not refunded when you recover a vehicle back to the workbench, so your Career playthrough hemorrhages money under the radar.  This issue takes [i]every[/i] new Career player by surprise but the devs choose to ignore it.  \n~ But that's OK because you can just use the Scenario Editor to gift yourself free money crates to cover the phantom losses, completely invalidating all of the time and effort you put into making your Career a career.  \n~ Winches used to (with the aid of a pump) be able to pass water through them in either direction.  A patch in July of this year broke this functionality but the devs never fixed it.  Thus, any compact firefighting helicopter can not use the ocean to fight fires, nor replenish their water reserves from the environment.  And trust me: fighting fires with a helicopter is a MAJOR, MAJOR mainstay of your Career activities.  \n~ So Career is broken.  \n\n# Exploits\n~ If you leave Career behind and go to Custom (\"creative\") mode, then you can edit day/night cycles, weather effects, vehicle damage, and give yourself infinite resources to make vehicle building and testing much easier.  But good luck ever again seeing the charm in Career.  \n~ Air jet engines, minus an exhaust nozzle, never get hot, making them a must-have go-to for high performance vehicles, whether land, sea, or air.  \n~ The relatively new steam pistons come with so much god smacking torque that, if you don't immediately convert all of your heavy vehicle propulsion over to nuclear+piston, then you're an idiot.  \n~ The devs ROUTINELY use false advertising marketing images to make their game look cooler than it actually is.  Long, sweeping air fins, dramatically slanted pipes, sleek jet cockpit canopies -- none of these actually exist in game.  They are all achieved by editing XML files.  As anyone will tell you as soon as you start researching how to do this, editing the XML breaks the collision meshes of the parts, making them no longer water tight.  (And slanted pipes cannot transport power or fluid.)  This creates all kinds of problems for many aspects of normal gameplay, especially in Career.  \n\n# Quality of Life\n~ You need to become a LUA computer programmer just to do anything remotely fun with Monitors.  Sure, you can download MCs from the workshop.  But, if you ever want to edit what you downloaded, you still have to reverse engineer someone else's LUA script shorthand.  \n~ There is no flashing neon sign anywhere to let you know that holding down the left Ctrl key while in the vehicle editor is the magic formula for turning lead into gold.  On that note, why the flipping hell is there no keyboard shortcut for traversing the camera in the editor?!?!?!?!!?  Having to depress the mouse scroll wheel while doing carpal tunnel gymnastics with my other mouse buttons just to drag the cursor three blocks to the left is not cool.  No, it's not an acceptable excuse to say, \"Well, that's the default for this or that game engine which shall not be named.\"  Do better.  Depressing the mouse scroll wheel sucks, period.  \n~ The devs introduced combat into a rescue game.  ...Yeah...  Enemy AI can chew through PC performance like crazy, but the sliders to adjust AI types and spawn densities can not be adjusted on the fly.  No, no, no!  You can only adjust them when you create a brand new gamesave (world seed), after which you then have to play for dozens of hours to get back to a similar state of combat you were in before just so you can see if your slider tweaks were sufficient.  (WTF?!)  This exact same problem exists for things like annoyingly frequent natural disasters, the numerous popup alerts for forest fire missions, etc.  \n~ Roads are little more than strips of black paint over jaggedly tessellated ground.  The devs' solution to this seems to have been to build an entire new, flatter continent?  Um... OK?  But even there the roads are still treacherous.  \n~ The descriptions of many parts are so vacant, cryptic, or misleading that they may as well be written in cuneiform.  \n~ Some parts just don't work as intended.  One good example: rocket fins generate physical motion that goes in the exact opposite direction that the build arrows, fin animation, and Newton's 3rd Law would all suggest.  Have fun figuring out that chess grandmaster puzzle in the fourth dimension.  \n~ One of the most problematic issues for game performance is wrecked or stranded AI vehicles.  It remains a highly requested addon that we be given a button to clean such vehicles, yet no indication exists that such a button is forthcoming.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on multiplayer.  \n\ntl;dr: Stay far away from Stormworks unless you want the same kind of hair tearing, blood boiling, sleep depriving agony you might get from an abusive romantic relationship.  The game [i]can[/i] be fun, especially if you play with other real people who can laugh along with you at how absurd it is.  Yet, after the initial \"wow factor\" wears off, you'll spend hundreds of hours of gameplay and another good hundred hours of YouTube research trying to re-reach that fun threshold.  Maybe if you are the type of player who enjoys putting 80+ hours into designing a vehicle that you may get less than 2 hours of actual gameplay out of, then this might be the game for you.  No shame in LEGOs for adults.  But a game that gives so little should not demand so much.

Storms feel like storms, deep sea feels terrifying, and consequently the time spent building a vehicle that can deal with the game world feels legitimately rewarding.\n\nThe editor is a joy to use and the build system makes sense. Example; place electric door, place button, place battery. Connect electric from battery, to door, to button, then connect signal from button to door. Now button opens door.

The devs are out of touch with their community and ignore the community's requests. (for example, additional mission content.) When called out on it, they resort to banning the users. The game is seriously lacking content for the survival mode and the only redeeming feature is the creative building. Wait for a sale if you are set on getting it.\n\n\nEdit: Small text addition to the TLDR and added some additional thoughts to the end of the review. (Can't be bothered to fix grammar)\n\n\n-=Sorry for the grammatical errors in the post, its 3AM at the time of writing and I am on 3 hours of sleep due to exam week. Should have just written a paper for my class lol=-\n\nWhile I would have recommended the game in the past, the developers have done little to improve the user experience and have proceeded to ruin aspects of the game in an attempt to \"improve\" or \"rework\" them.  The developers have gotten lazy, they take months to release new meaningful game content. (missions and parts) This would be normally fine and acceptable for developers. However, the content updates they release are half baked pieces of trash that usually tend to not work properly or are so meaningless that they might as well have not been added.  The game will seem really cool and fun when you first start to learn stuff. You will spend hours searching for YouTube videos and articles to learn how to build systems in this game.  The complexity is fine to a degree, but by the time you have finally amassed enough knowledge to build vehicles that meaningfully function, You will have invested 10-20 hours if you are lucky. By this point you might start realizing the game is slow and extremely boring. (because it is) The lackluster amount of mission content plus the barren and very boring map design, all make playing the game feel like a chore. This is worsened by the fact that it takes anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours depending on the mission. To add more fuel to the fire, want to play on a different map? Well you got to shill out more money to buy the Industrial Frontiers DLC! Wanna play with weapons and maybe have vehicle on vehicle combat? Buy the Search and Destroy DLC! Want to participate in the Halloween event mode? you must own all DLC in order to play it! WTF! (Note for the devs(An event is supposed to be for the community to enjoy, if it uses DLC content, the event should be free to play for a period of time. This will allow players to experience new content (which is rare as explained prior) and will advertise your damn DLC. Afterwards, you can then make the event mode a permanent feature accessible by only those who own the DLC.)) Instead, the developers decided to gatekeep the event and made it so players had to buy all the DLC to play it. This is not all, the DLC is also half baked like the regular content updates and are so unbelievably underwhelming, you will wish you could get a refund. Except you can't, because you already spent hours trying to figure out how the shit worked. The Search and destroy DLC is nearly impossible to enjoy solo because the \"Friendly AI\" feature does not work as it should and the amount of enemy vehicles you run into at once is ridiculous.  Despite its many issues, I enjoy the game's building and creative mode as they allow a wide range of freedom and creativity through complexity.  Also, the community surrounding the game is amazing and will often have a solution to a problem you may have with a build. Sadly, the actual game play, especially for survival, is seriously lacking content. So while I enjoy the creative mode, I dislike the survival mode as well as the direction the game is in heading right now. So, I cannot currently recommend the game. I would however, recommend you to wait until there is a decent sale on the game before buying if you are interested in the creative mode.", "timestamp_created": 1669968476, "timestamp_updated": 1672023070, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 233, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.80155789852142334", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130095928": {"recommendationid": "130095928", "author": {"steamid": "76561199226969202", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 9139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1295, "last_played": 1710117913}, "language": "english", "review": "7/10 multiplayer is broken but you could run this on a potato pc/laptop if needed", "timestamp_created": 1672825788, "timestamp_updated": 1672825788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801642835140228271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55857220": {"recommendationid": "55857220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351133682", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 5535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 900, "last_played": 1651334072}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun to play with yourself, because i don't have any friends :(", "timestamp_created": 1572265834, "timestamp_updated": 1572294772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 71, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801604866981506348", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50925384": {"recommendationid": "50925384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069594836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1000657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4648, "playtime_at_review": 115000, "last_played": 1713768321}, "language": "english", "review": "One of them Games you can Play for hours. make 0 progress but still have fun with it", "timestamp_created": 1559121542, "timestamp_updated": 1559121542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801411628723144531", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76353627": {"recommendationid": "76353627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097370099", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 17778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5968, "last_played": 1674796929}, "language": "english", "review": "By my 4th hour I really wanted a refund\n\nBy my 40th hour I had a successful vessel and a bushplane in the works\n\nBy my 80th hour I was exploring the arctic in a steam locomotive\n\nAs I come up on 100 hours for this review, I will be starting ideas for an aircraft carrier\n\nActual review: this game is deceptively complicated, on the surface its a block based building game, under the hood its a complicated balance of dozens of factors each of which have a hood to open up and discover more factors. For me, a lot of the reward from this game comes from building something that works. Getting your first working engine, building your first flying machine, towing your first oil tanker, saving your first wounded fisherman, incredibly satisfying. I've not even done career mode yet, I'm just having fun making more new vehicles.\n\nCONS: You need to be creative to like this game. Of course it's fun to sail through 3 meter waves in a thunderstorm, but you need to sink a lot of time into designing a vehicle to do it. If you don't have the patience for that, there's no game for you here. \nIt's very easy to do things wrong and there's almost no indication when or what went wrong. Fuel pump on backwards? Air intake not linked properly? Radiators overloaded? That's is all on you to figure out. There are some methods you can use to problem solve but when I was first starting it was extremely frustrating to not know why my engine wouldn't turn over. You'll need tutorials for this game. Assistance isn't present when your engine blows up from overheating. Only you can prevent forest fires and only YouTube tutorials can prevent engine explosions. \nMultiplayer is more or less just showing off your vehicles to other players. Sure you can build a vehicle to be crewed by several people, but they cant help you build the vehicle. It would be nice if more than 1 person could be editing a vehicle so that way people could customized and optimize different parts of a ship. Maybe I know engines better than my friend and he knows how to use the radar scripting so he builds the bridge of the ship and I build the engine room.", "timestamp_created": 1600728570, "timestamp_updated": 1600728570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.79903864860534668", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43844216": {"recommendationid": "43844216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074557311", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 207648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "playtime_at_review": 6099, "last_played": 1713789921}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really awesome game.

Then they got rid of the rather linear campaign, gave us a handful of missions, told us to make the rest, and did not even keep the perfectly good missions that were in the original.\n\nNext the weapons dlc came.  Which was ok I guess, I personally did not care much, as this is supposed to be a game about search and rescue.  But at least I could finally defend myself against sharks with a spear gun.\n\nThen came Industrial Frontier, which is mostly empty, but adds... I mean forces mining on you, if you want coal for steam engines and nuclear reactors.\n\nLast came Space, and it was largely a waste of space on my hard drive (or would be if I bought it, which I did not).\n\nThe mechanics of this game are largely broken.  Engines are extremely under-powered and consume crazy amounts of fuel, which also produce crazy amounts of smoke as a result, and steam/nuclear is even worse.  To build things like sea planes requires extensive knowledge of game glitches.  The buoyancy is roughly half what it should be.  And you better know XML editing if you want your vehicles to look nice. And I have had to mod many of the parts to fix things like the engine power problem, excessive weight of blocks.\n\nThen on top of it the devs LOVE to deprecate old, but perfectly fine parts for no good reason.  Want to build a tug boat, LOL you cant because the current winch ropes freak out if you put too much tension on them, the old ones worked fine in many ways but are hidden.\n\nCustom engines can be hair pulling when they suddenly don't work, maybe because you forgot a part, or maybe because this time the script you use to run the engine suddenly decides it isn't going to work properly (I have literally wasted hours trying to bug fix engines, that I know works perfectly fine, and is hooked up correctly, but today just will not work, sometimes replacing the script block works).\n\nMoving parts have a tendency to glitch, particularly when you are near them.  Like one time i was making a self loading train car using pistons and large rotors.  Sometimes the parts just refuse to work, loose all power, glitch out of themselves.  Suddenly the pistons of my rail car wont work. but if i run off 1 km or so they suddenly work again.\n\nThen there are the tires.  We have begged the devs to fix the damn tires. They slide around like they are on grease if your vehicle weighs too much and have terrible traction. You can fix this problem by editing the traction of each wheel in your vehicle's XML file, but why is this nessiary\n\nThis could be a nice game, if the devs would have expanded on basic gameplay aspects, actually fixed things that have been broken for ever, fixed the huge problems with engines and mechanics of parts, and added certain parts (like 3 block wedges and undepricated certain parts). But sadly they do not listen much to us.\n\nAs a building game it isn't to bad.  Very irritating at times, but not too bad.

When first discovering the game it was for people who did want to go through missions and build vehicles which were designated for solving the problems you may encounter during the missions. So you had to add a crane, cargospaces, a winch, a sub or a helicoper depending on the mission, and ending you with the ultimative multipurpose rescue vehicle.\nSince the release of 1.0 the game is solely designed for people who spend 100+ hours on building one vehicle and releasing it on the Workshop, without playing the campaign or missions.\nAs the game had a storyline before 1.0 now it has 4 types of missions which can be split into, transport persons, extinguish fire and transport person, transport a vehicle and transport a container. Two of the mission types, transporting containers and transporting vehicles not returning enough credits to progress in the campaign for over two month without getting fixed, says alot about how the developers are interested in career mode.\nSo its now a building only game, which sadly is not even good in building only. most stuff you can find in the WS uses glitches to trick the gamephysics.

As mentioned previously, Stormworks is a coastguard simulator, in which you have to save lives, rescue people and all that jazz. If you're playing actual (\"classic\") career, then it has a very satisfying progression curve, in which completing \"missions\" earns you research points, which in turn allow you to research new items and then gain access to them in the building inventory. Since 1.0, there have been procedurally generated missions, which are engaging and non-repetitive, as well as other ways of making money, including transporting containers around the map. Altogether, the gameplay is good, not much more to be said.\n\nNow to talk about the real reason most people play Stormworks. It's building system, and extensive vehicle support. The game contains four main vehicle types, Ships, Aircraft, Trains and Road vehicles (Also off-road but you know what I mean). And these are all built within the [u] excellent [/u] building menu, which is hands-down the best part of the game. It is incredibly extensive and powerful, allows a great deal of accomplishment, and has full Workshop support, yet is also very intuitive and easy to pick up. The physics for the vehicles that you spent weeks building are a different matter. They are quite horrible, to put it simply. It is near impossible to drive road vehicles, planes work nothing like you'd expect, and trains with an output of many thousands of horsepower struggle to pull trains of 2-3 coaches. They are truly laughable, and the devs really need to fix them before they add another 700 new features to the game. The best physics simulation is that of ships and boats, although Stormworks fails to accurately account for weight and various other things, it is [i] very [/i] easy to get completely immersed as you cross the ocean in your little tanker, with no land in sight.\n\nAs for the graphics, they're OK. I have nothing against poly-graphics, it looks friendly and welcoming, and Stormworks can look very pretty if you turn the graphics up a little. But this brings us on to by far the worst aspect of Stormworks. It's absolutely appalling optimisation. Though the recent 1.1.23 update helped significantly (you can now sacrifice physics realism for better performance), it still manages to get slowed down (like the actual physics slow down, when did you last see that?) with only a small handful of vehicles spawned in, even on high end computers. And it doesn't even stop there. The framerate, though acceptable by all means on mid-high end systems, is that of an all guns blazing, AAA, Ray-tracing enabled, 128x Anti-aliasing title, not a humble poly-graphical casual one. It makes me think why bother with the simple graphics, when you can have similar performance with ultra-realism? It does present benefits with regards to building, I know, please don't maul me in the replies.\n\nHowever, I'm going on a bit. To conclude, Stormworks is a very good game, with bucket-loads of potential, and a fantastic premise, but it is plagued with bugs and poor optimisation, which should have been fixed well before the full release, and need to be fixed very soon to keep it relevant and get it the attention it deserves. Overall though, Stormworks: Build and Rescue gets my thumbs up, and I recommend it if your computer is well above the minimum specs (they are pretty far off, my computer is quite a bit more powerful than the minimum, yet I normally get 25fps with graphics on absolute rock bottom).", "timestamp_created": 1620748072, "timestamp_updated": 1620748218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny":

times in secret with updates.\nPeople might not notice many of my creations but many well known creations utilize my microcontroller especially those aircraft instruments.\nSome people know that I was banned from the official Stormwonks discord but not many people know the actual reason.\nSome said I was involving in a website attack but actually I was not and there was no attack.\nIt was a place outside of official Stormwonks discord where people were doing free speech.\nOne of the dev woke up at night in panic and feared of possible website attack and disabled the database causing whole website to stop working and banned people from the official Stormwonks discord blaming them for attack.\nThere was no discussion about such thing but people actually were talking about how the game capture their computer data when user click on the link to issue tracking which does not look safe for anyone's data.\n\nBack to game issue, my PenguinO's WarGame Script or PenguinO's Weapon System (PWS) was originally part of my dedicated server for immersion role-play.\nThe Amplified Damage System was also part of dedicated server that gives penalty to vehicles that collided and took damage.\nRelease of my scripting with explosion was originally aimed to give the dev more time to tidy up the game and extend the release date of Weapon DLC while I keep people content.\nHowever, these attempts of dev trying to ruin the explosion control raises suspicious that the paid Weapon DLC won't offer much more than scripting of features already implemented in game so it might not worth buying anymore.\n\nSupport of the game\nThere is no proper support channel of the game other than on a discord (the official Stormwonks discord) which dev/admin keep banning people for invalid reasons destroying the only support channel for the game that has low quality to no documentation at all.\nThis game won't go far without contents from many makers.\nThis game won't attract new people much when experienced players are holding their place.\nKick some experienced players out to make room for new players.\nKeep people shut up from talking about early access unfixed bugs.\n\n\n--- Original part below ---\n\nThe development path of the Stormworks game is questionable.\nFrom a very old version, there was minimap that was a fully automatic rotating forward up map with direction compass,\nit was removed on some later version.\nControl surface for aircraft used to be functioning correctly during early v0.7.x became broken that they only provide drag at higher speed but still far from sound barrier.\nBug reports were there but issue is never fixed or noted.\n\nCritical decision error on v1.0:\nCertain parts of the game now uses resource pointer hard-coded in executable (.exe).\nFor example: custom buzzer*\nCustom buzzer is a very creative option for people which allow creation makers to choose any sounds file included with the game to be used in many situations like race start signal horn, car horn, siren or even sound effects for artificial guns or cannons.\nCustom buzzers are all gone for now.\nOther critical decision error is the game now require all mission makers to code mission script like a programmer.\nNon-programmer or non-IT related people might not feel happy with this.\n\nMinor flaws:\nSeveral terms used in game are misleading.\n\n\nI like the game but just cannot recommend it at this state.\nFeatures got removed but bugs were added.\n\n\n*To clarify the custom buzzer mentioned:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TpbaFzO3s\n\n\nv1.0.10\nScript console/chat box is now bugged\nThere is no error catching function for in-game lua script\nOnce error happens, the whole script stops or misbehaves until force a reload\nProvided functions (mission script/server script) like server.getPlayerPos() sometimes gives error when target player keeps moving and changing motion/direction.\n\n\nv1.0.20\nMany things are getting improved.\nI would want to recall the \"Thumb down\" but I still cannot give \"Thumb up\" until mission editor provide GUI mission scripting for non-programmer users.\n\n\nPS: Steam does not allow \"No Thumb\" I think...\n\n\n--- UPDATE ---\n\n\nWhen I take a good look again, this game is totally not suitable for anyone:\n- new to PC gaming\n- new to computer system\n- not having strong sense of learning\n- have no programming basic\n- have no/not enough knowledge in science\n- expecting official support response\n- expecting game that

This inevitably led to the creation of fire-fighting jets and cargo airships, utterly impractical designs that were nevertheless cool as hell. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the reason Stormworks was created but that\u2019s the enjoyment I\u2019m getting out of it, designing utterly absurd vehicles to resolve the simplest of problems. If it were a bit easier to bring my creations to life, or less time-consuming to see them do their work, this one would be an easy sell for just about any budding builder. But as you\u2019ll see, there\u2019s a lot of effort involved in even the simplest tasks.\n\nThings seem to keep going wrong on a remote and scattered archipelago, from oil rig fires to sick crew at sea. You\u2019re just the clever bloke to solve all of these problems, because you\u2019ve got a magic fabricating workbench that can create any kind of land, sea, or air vehicle you could want. Building the right vehicle for the job is key, as recovering lost cargo and extinguishing fires call for very different approaches. Here in Early Access you\u2019ve got two main modes to approach Stormworks in, the no-holds-barred Creative mode and a Career mode that locks parts and construction behind completing missions and accumulating cash. No matter which you go for, though, you\u2019re going to be doing a lot of building and a lot of crossing the open ocean.\n\nConstructing a vehicle is a matter of assembling shapes and components in a grid to form exactly what you want. For a simple boat, you would shape the hull out of cubes and inclines, place propellers, engines, and a pilot\u2019s seat, and then connect up all the logic bits to make the different parts work. The constructing part is quite easy, thanks to a clean and intelligent interface that seems to know where you want to place things and how you want to orient them. If that were all there was to it the design aspect would be a breeze, but there\u2019s logic and wiring to worry about, too. Engines need to be started by buttons, propellers need to be linked to power sources, your controls need to be assigned by button and axis to the fins or rudders or gyros controlling the vessel, and so on. Those are just the basics, too, because the \u201cadvanced\u201d mode also has you worrying about fuel lines and fluid dynamics.\n\nThe result is incredibly detailed vehicles that actually operate like their real-world counterparts, assuming you can engineer them to similar complexity. I\u2019ve grabbed a few planes and ships from the Steam Workshop and the potential here is flabbergasting. There was a 737 with a full pre-flight sequence of switches and starters, as well as control readouts for altitude and fuel and orientation. There was a submarine with functional ballast tanks and bulkheads and cabin lighting. It\u2019s terribly exciting to have a game where all of this is possible, but it can also be frustrating when it appears to be required. I\u2019ve been struggling with designing a simple helicopter because of how many logic inputs the rotors require, and you also have to manually balance the main rotor against the tail stabilizer in terms of power to ensure the thing doesn\u2019t go careening off into the horizon.\n\nWith practice anything is possible, and this is shaping up to be the kind of game that inspires that kind of dedication. It\u2019s not quite there though, at least with regards to the Career mode. The promise is excellent on its surface; you start off with a simple base and dock for creating boats, and take on basic tasks like cargo delivery and search and rescue. As you complete missions you earn money to build larger crafts and entirely new islands with larger construction facilities. You also unlock new vehicle components, which seems like a great idea except the order appears to be random. That becomes a problem when you get faced with missions that seem to be designed around aerial approaches, but the game hasn\u2019t decided to give you any propellers or control surfaces to work with. The core mission experience is also long trips across the ocean to your destinations, so some rebalancing in vehicle speed or map density could help the pacing immeasurably.\n\nI\u2019m griping about these things because I really quite like Stormworks, it\u2019s just proving hard to stick with at the moment. There\u2019s plenty that needs improvement during Early Access, and plenty to love already like the wonderfully simplistic graphics and powerfully churning sea. The weather effects like storm surges and rain do a lot to make you feel threatened on the high seas, and there are options for vehicle damage and sharks if you want to add risk to your long ocean sojourns. Right now this is mainly a game for sim grognards, the folks that want to build realistic rescue choppers and who don\u2019t mind flying them over empty seas for five to ten minutes at a stretch. I\u2019m hoping it becomes a bit more accessible for folks like me, because I\u2019ve got a great idea for a fire-fighting VTOL that I\u2019ve had kicking around for years and I\u2019m not quite sharp enough to bring it to life here.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

The devs then made an announcement saying they admit they should have tested the non-space update part of the game (the part people had already paid for), but they were too focused on the new features. Props for at least admitting failure, however, this is not the first incident like this... they fail to learn from their mistakes. Let me remind you that [b]there is no publisher forcing deadlines[/b] on the dev team - the deadline to release the DLC was put in place by them - so they chose to release the update and DLC [b]knowing large parts were untested[/b]. They then claim the review bombing of the game was a targeted attack by a vocal minority that was unfair. In my opinion, if you release broken, bad, updates, receiving bad reviews is absolutely par for the course. They then complained about receiving \"death threats\", which, fair enough, is terrible, but they seem to have taken it as a chance to (again) invalidate a lot of the [b]very valid[/b] criticism (even the non-extremely phrased criticism). Many people are very passionate about the game, they want to see it become better and better - updates such as these lead to extreme tension between the community and developers. The devs are notably [b]terrible[/b] at receiving, accepting, and improving from criticism.\n\nThey have had testing branches before, they get rid of it every time after not receiving \"the feedback they are looking for\", whatever that may be.\n\n[b]If the above is to tell you anything, it is to indicate the continued trends of the game and its developers[/b].\n\n------ Previous review from 28 Mar, 2021 -------\n\nI [b]do not recommend the game[/b], however, I will start with the good to be fair.\n\n[h3]The good of Stormworks:[/h3]\n\n- A pretty amazing community around it that has 100% kept the game alive. You can find people who can help with design, logic, Lua, and much more around the community and the majority of people are nice and willing to help. \n\n- One of the absolute best logic systems I have seen in any game. You get a lot of control over different sensors and components and you get to wire them up with AND gates, OR gates, binary composite, Lua programming, etc.\n\n- A very interesting concept where the player creates their own vehicles for their own company/organization to complete missions\n\n- Custom mission creation which [i]could[/i] allow the creation of lots of different awesome games within the game\n\n- The ability to build many types of vehicles from tanks, to trains, to planes or even random things like wind mills, generators, buoys, etc. Chances are, you can find a way to build nearly everything in the game, take a look at the workshop\n\nWhile all the things listed above make the game sound amazing for programmers, artists, and engineers, the devs have been leaning on those positives as a crutch hoping the good points of the game can keep the community content and entertained. Lately, the devs have been working hard on implementing new features, however, there are many, many problems with the game that are much more urgent than adding nuclear engines.\n\n[h3]The bad of Stormworks:[/h3]\n\n- There are [b]countless[/b] unbalanced parts in the game (super drag, low buoyancy, completely ineffective solar cells, etc.) that have been dismissed by the dev/admin team for seemingly ridiculous reasons. For example, when asked why certain things didn't weigh realistic amounts of kg, the admin team responded by removing the kg from the game in order to, and I quote: \"stop discussions of mass\"\n\n- There are [b]countless[/b] bugs that have been dismissed, ignored, and I suppose just silently made lower priority than adding new features (that will certainly come with more bugs)\n\n- The game left early access out of nowhere and the stability of the game has not improved much at all. The stable branch is like any other game's experimental branch and the experimental branch is like a dev testing branch, just public as the devs don't appear to do any internal testing for many, many parts of the updates\n\n- The [url=mcro.org/issues/1]issue tracker[/url] used by the devs is absolutely unacceptable. It is very slow, insecure, violating of privacy and data laws, and just an overall mess. The search bar was removed from the site after someone performed a XSS attack that replaced it with a rick-roll, making it even more unusable. This, combined with the frequency of bugs, is enough reason to not play the game, it's that bad\n\n- The devs only leverage one YouTuber for promotion/tutorials/Q&As (with the devs) and their name is MrNJersey. They have become basically an untouchable figure in the community as the devs will support them endlessly and they will support the devs endlessly. If the devs make a mistake and post a very broken update, MrNJersey will post a video acting as if everything is working as intended and a [i]small balance[/i] will be coming soon. Jersey's tutorials were also put into the game and there is even a function in the addon Lua API to see if a player has been notified about their existence in the game. Jersey also hosts the Q&As with the lead dev, Deltars. The videos are 45 minutes of Jersey pitching absolute softball questions and letting Deltars smash every answer out of the park, no addition questions asked. Jersey will ask how the new issue tracker is coming, Deltars will say it is on the way and will be better, Jersey will not ask how it will be better and just say \"amazing!\" and continue to the next question. It is almost like a dictator's propaganda at this point, it's that bad\n\n- Many players, including me, have left the game and community recently as we are tired of the above issues and there is no improvements in sight. Some of the smartest, most helpful, and best players in the game have left recently either on their own accord or due to being banned/muted on the dev's Discord server\n\n[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]\nIf you only plan on messing around in other people's creations, the game could maybe be worth it for you. If you want to actually build stuff in the game, you will spend the first 1000hrs understanding the basics and improving but you will quickly come to the same realization many of us have soon after. Perhaps the game will improve in a year or two...\n\nIf you want even more context, I highly recommend reading this:\n- [url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210328164102/https://www.stormworks-forum.rocks/t/the-games-future-and-considering-leaving-the-game/113/5]Discussion with me and some great experts of the game[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1616951711, "timestamp_updated": 1697505163, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761033833026885986", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88540179": {"recommendationid": "88540179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198992279225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 21416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6513, "last_played": 1684595655}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has turned me into an engineer.", "timestamp_created": 1615908476, "timestamp_updated": 1615908476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760508716106414795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72560637": {"recommendationid": "72560637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027584793", "num_games_owned": 1305, "num_reviews": 215, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1607089105}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit: With the release of 1.0, this review is out of date.

The proprietary files and limited parts makes modding stormworks difficult and not rewarding. being a player with almost 3000 hours in game, it is safe to say that it was was worth the 20 dollars, but I don't recommend this game for anyone that wants to push a game to its limits with building skill and/or modding.\n\nI'm sorry i have to change this review, but I feel that i must be honest.", "timestamp_created": 1600005849, "timestamp_updated": 1615774684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758039593696594238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "152559348": {"recommendationid": "152559348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070762993", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 11971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10952, "last_played": 1711859810}, "language": "english", "review": "After having much love for this game over the years and all the fun I've had with the weapons DLC that came out two years ago, I'm sad to say that I'm greatly disappointed with the devs implementation of the recent updates/dlc. \n\nTwo months ago or so, the space DLC was released. With that, there were updates made to the fluid mechanics and a new addition being pressurization, which has changed how many creations on the workshop function, how submarines are able to function, and the buoyancy of most vehicles. On release, this broke many creations to the point that they were unusable. Previously functioning creations now simply sank or rolled over instantly because of the changes. Eventually, devs released a fix to the buoyancy mechanics, though many creations still do not function properly as they once did, and others still behave differently than they should. \n\nMore frustratingly for me -- I've always loved the destruction aspects of the game, the ability to have megalodons spawn in and attack your ships, ship collisions cause them to take on water and eventually sink, and with weapons, having naval combat was finally a possibility. While other games like sea of thieves exist for more tryhard competitive players, this was one of those games I'd hop on for a few hours a week to mess around in sandbox and sink ships, then return every few weeks to see what was new on the workshop and experiment with other user's creations. Now, not only are a good number of workshop creations completely unusable, but a recent update in these last two months (or collection of updates) have made it so that even fully destroyed vessels, do not take on water or sink. You could open every door on the ship, capsize it, blow it full of holes, and it will stay afloat as if nothing had happened (although electronics, engines, or other systems can be fully inoperable), nothing can really get them to consistently sink anymore. I've found maybe two out of dozens of creations that if left long enough fully submerged, will eventually flood inside, only through left open doors and nothing else, damage alone still won't cause them to flood. \n\nMy guess is the new pressurization mechanic is preventing air from escaping through damaged blocks, despite water previously being able to travel through those blocks, air cannot, meaning that the pressure within the vessel stays the same and water won't flood the ship. Even the ships that are fully submerged or capsized with doors opened, the pressure seems to prevent air from exiting and allowing water due to some limitation in coding or the game engine. I've asked around on reddit, the official discord, and steam discussions to see if other players are having the same issues, and it seems a good number of people (those who arent playing just for the \"rescue\" larping side) have said they cant get ships to sink anymore either. \n\nReally unfortunate but to enjoy a game and support it for so many years, just for a core mechanic to be changed in such a way that it takes all the joy of what you enjoyed about the game in the first place, is really disappointing. Not only should this had been tested in beta before release, but the fact that it hasn't been rolled back over the months following release until the mechanic actually functions properly, is mind boggling. Some find enjoyment from it, but in practicality, there is nothing to explore in space and the change to include pressurization in the game adds nothing, it's only broken more creations than whatever they were trying to introduce, so it should just be removed at this point. \n\nSad to say that I won't be touching this game again until they can get it fixed, but with how slow they are to roll out changes such as this, it'll probably be a few more months before it's even looked at.", "timestamp_created": 1701318570, "timestamp_updated": 1701318570, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.756424605846405029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55159299": {"recommendationid": "55159299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152601244", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 40445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20122, "last_played": 1695347970}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking for a game to have fun with boats and other vehicles or just to sink them all, then this is the game for you. 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1568748484, "timestamp_updated": 1568748484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.755793988704681396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50691331": {"recommendationid": "50691331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198841885866", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1972, "last_played": 1694886066}, "language": "english", "review": "i really want a always open server", "timestamp_created": 1558125577, "timestamp_updated": 1558125577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754145383834838867", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120618731": {"recommendationid": "120618731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417039584", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 12271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2309, "last_played": 1707045671}, "language": "english", "review": "beans", "timestamp_created": 1660488245, "timestamp_updated": 1660488245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753288328647613525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105471364": {"recommendationid": "105471364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152457723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1779, "last_played": 1677360145}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Starts career with friends, goes to save people from flaming boat, on our way to the hospital friend attaches rope to boat and falls off.
