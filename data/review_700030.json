However, the reality of the game falls short of these grand ambitions, highlighting the developers' apparent lack of commitment to delivering a polished product.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues with Life is Feudal is its numerous bugs and technical issues. From server instability to frequent crashes and game-breaking glitches, players often find themselves frustrated by the lack of reliability in the game's performance. These issues not only disrupt game play but also hinder players' ability to fully engage with the world the developers have created.\n\nFurthermore, despite ongoing promises of updates and improvements, Life is Feudal has seen limited meaningful content additions since its initial release. Players are left feeling that the game lacks depth and variety, with repetitive game play loops and a lack of meaningful progression beyond basic survival mechanics.\n\nThe monetization strategy employed by the developers also comes under scrutiny. While micro transactions are common in many modern games, Life is Feudal's approach often feels predatory, with paid content offering minimal value (20$ sub  price)  and sometimes even exacerbating existing game play issues.\n\nThe community's frustration is evident in player forums and reviews, where criticisms of the developers' lack of communication and transparency are widespread. Many players feel abandoned by LTG , with promises of fixes and updates frequently going unfulfilled.\n\nIn conclusion, Life is Feudal falls short of its potential due to a combination of technical issues, lack of substantial content updates, and questionable monetization practices. While there are moments of enjoyment to be found in its medieval sandbox world, they are often overshadowed by the feeling that the developers prioritize profits over player experience. For those seeking a truly immersive and polished gaming experience, Life is Feudal may not be the ideal choice.\n", "timestamp_created": 1711572787, "timestamp_updated": 1711572787, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794140636920928955", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1712842432, "developer_response": "In order to address the issue of the game's monetization being seen as predatory, we have added in a 7 day free period for everyone, which we hope will let players judge whether or not they enjoy the game.

This in my opinion is unacceptable.\n\nthis is a copy paste of a thread i started on the discussion forum that got deleted on the forum for trolling. It goes like this.\n\n\" Note to de devs: I will copy this thread. You deleted my last thread wich did not contain any sort of profanity or lack of respect, nor was it in any way in violation of steam user agreement. I will put up a complaint to steam if you delete this one too. \n\nAs of now if you delete your current character, you lose the ticket to Abella that came with it, if you want to play again you have to buy a new one for 10$. that mean unless you pay that price you are forever stuck on newbie island. You are in fact buying a character/ticket, not a character slot.\n\nFor those of you who have lost your tickets to the main island due to character deletion. I sympatize with you. It is not a fair mechanic. The fact that they charge you 10 dollars to get a new ticket is absolutly wrong and i have a better solution. \n\nThey are saying that the reason why they are implementing this is because of the alignement sysytem (karma) to prevent players to just be able to do evil deeds and just create a new character without having to live with the consequences of their deeds. I am all for that. i 100% agree, but not with a pay wall. there is a better way.\n\nIf you alignement system is so important, make it a time penalty of 72h to a 7 days period. if you delete your character you have to wait 72h to 7 days to create a new one and play again.\n\nwhy? \n\nSimply because players with money will be able to just pay their way back in, with my time pnealty it does not matter how wealthy you are, you would have to wait. This is way more hindering for the player and his guild.\n\nIts a simple, fair, gamer friendly, suitable for your so beloved ticket mechanic. its not as profitable as your current method though, but the player paid its base game already. And then you have the premium sub, the pay to skill up faster method, the skins you can buy. I think that enough, you dont have to put that cash wall on character deletion. what you need is a time wall.\n\nAgain, my system in is much better for what you are trying to achieve game wise, although it is not as good financialy. i would be a lot more concerned about my in game actions if i had to wait 7 days instead of just having to pay 10 dollars to play again.\n\nHave a good day, may your game prosper and grow as much as your wallets.\"\n\ndevs decided to delete the first thread and when i started another, locked it for trolling. \n\nUnacceptable.", "timestamp_created": 1515983150, "timestamp_updated": 1515983150, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1220, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946232616901397705", "comment_count": 68, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49022126": {"recommendationid": "49022126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030577952", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 98932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 75453, "last_played": 1590611307}, "language": "english", "review": "So as you can tell by my hours played, I really loved Life is Feudal. It's a fantastic concept, 100% terraforming, amazing crafting systems and a grind that would make a masochist blush. It is a truly epic medieval simulator. \n\nHowever, 'loved' is the correct tense. \n\nAfter waiting almost a year after launch of the 0.1 update, with the 0.2 update the developers have gone and royally screwed what little player base they have left. I played on PvE RP server Epleland, a server that will not be updated with new PvE content. Yes that's right. They are keeping a dedicated server for PvE that contains none of the new PvE content in the 0.2 update while forcing their other servers to join a new map that is x3 times the size, for 'thousands of players'...there were only ever 2.5k players at launch and that number has steadilyfallen over the past year. All of this while failing to fix fundamental issues with the game such as server crossings, lag, poor performance and the bare-bones of ANY new content. \n\nOn top of that, the company that produces the game, Bitbox, is possibly one of the shadiest operations I have ever encountered. Along with the initial cost of over \u00a325 (the game has just gone free to play btw with no announcement to the community) they require you to have a subscription service to access some of the key features of the game, this subscription comes in at more per month than titles like WoW and provides about 5% of the content. There is an in-game shop also, with some discounted skins for armour costing as much as \u00a325...for a skin. There were movable in-game decorations you can purchase through the shop (some of the only new content released in the past year) that Bitbox decided to change their terms and conditions on making them fixed permanently in place, meaning the \u00a3100's people spent with them in good faith are now simply dead pixels sat on dead servers that Bitbox killed a few months after revealing this deception.\n\nIn short, DO NOT BUY.

However, there are few things we need to clarify. First of all, as we explained a while back, most of the proccessed game data is synchronized on the server side. This means that players cannot do that would effect theirs or other players' characters in any way. As for whatever limited ways players found after those long years to play around with their game clients, we are already working on it. And regarding posting video materials on discord, as we have stated many times, the only proper way to report such issues is by contacting LiF Team directly. We always appreciate such reports. And as we always did, we still enforce the fair play and deal with players that were caught in the act of violating the established rules. \n\nAnother thing is the matter of subscription, which you do not require at all to enjoy the full game and have access to all of its features. The game also do not enforce playing multiple characters. It is an option for those who come with intention of playing solo and still wanting to have their own one-man guild. The whole idea behind the purchased Tickets to Abella is the Alignment System which regulates player behavior and prevents sensless mass killing with no consequences outside of conflicts between guilds at the state of war. Global politics and warfare is what is meant to be the heart of the game, which is why solo gameplay is not among key features of our game, but it's still a possibility. \n\nThe statement regarding us punishing players reporting the exploiters is a false one. We are always on the lookout for exploiters and deal with them accoridngly. If you report such occurence to the LiF Team directly, you can be sure such report will be thoroughly investigated. \n\nBest regards."}, "45656118": {"recommendationid": "45656118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042299856", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 20411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20088, "last_played": 1542271696}, "language": "english", "review": "Dear players and here you can read why nearly nobody is playing this game:\n\nI tested it 325 game hours, just to be absolute sure, that I didnt miss any fun part. And no I didnt, there is no fun part. \nI really wanted to give this game a positive rating. But by all means, its impossible. \nMy ML is german, but I really wanted to write this in english, so I can inform as many players as possible. So sorry for not so detailed description. Its no hating, its pure disappointment of how greed destroys a potentially nice game.\n\nI really liked the idea of a medieval game, with enjoyable town building, and cool combat, selling your goods, and have a relaxed time. If you also like this idea, dont ever buy this game. Because it has nothing to do with it.\n\nI really want to know all people that the \"this game is hardcore-statement\" of the Devs is absurd.\nThere is nothing hardcore or challenging about doing 500xtimes the same absolute boring poorly animated action all 5-10 seconds.\nIts just plain stupid. Its worse than the most bad low budget handy games.\n\nOn top, at high level you grind days for one % of skill progression with good food in your pocket. And with one death, hours of your spent lifetime is gone.\nWhich means you can never go fight with your Crafting Character for fun, you NEED a second character for combat.\nAnd here it comes, ding ding ding, you need to spend money for that. You dont want to loose experience, which is intentionally hard to gain to make the devs more cash. Ding Ding Ding, just for 20$ a monthly fee you dont loose exp. Isnt that awesome? Your outfift looks like crap? dingdingding just for 50$ you can look a little better, continuing your boring grinding.\n\nThe big world is so unmotivating to look at. Just plain land with some trees. In the desert even worse. Absolutely nothing. It gets even more boring if you pass land where player once farmed. Abandoned big squares of brown ugliness.\n\nThe logic of item/buildings creation ist completely broken and only just broken by the Devs for the reason of make you grind hours of hours of hours. Standing at the same freaking pixel, and do always the same unbelievable boring unenjoayble shit, producing nothing you need, anyone else needs, or cares about.\nYou cant build anything important for enjoyable gameplay unless several characters with different jobs are at lvl60 at least.\nFor example: You are a farmer but are unable to give fertilizer into your fields unless you are lvl 90! That means at end game you are able to fertilize.\n\nWhere a Hunter can already produce fertilizer at early skill state for you, you cant use it before you hit lvl90 in farming.\nIt means: Youre not farming at all the most time, youre shoveling the shit out of you to get good fertilized soil from the map, which is rare of course. Why should it be else. Then throw it on the ground, it is then instantly at plowed state, which makes the plow skill useless, because you wont ever use it. Never. Really never. Just take a shovel with a lvl 0 character. Pick up earth, throw it down, done. Magically plowed. \nOh wait shoveling is a complete other skilltree too and has nothing to do with farming? Oh thats so fun! So Nonsense.\n\nI also skilled other jobs to the last tier. All and everything is boring and not fun, its not more than just occupational therapy with absolute no variety. It makes me so sad, and angry. I just started this game, cause I had absolute nothing else to game. Would I have had something else im interested in, I would have stopped this game after 50 hours. Its the time you start to realize this game is pure wasting of money, time, and joy of life.\n\nThe combat system is beyond doubt the unfuniest and most clunky ive ever experienced. You have to look in directions you want to hit. That means you look away from the enemy. Bow even worse. You cant hit shit from 2 foot distance at lvl 30 Bowmanskill. Bowskill is the slowest to be leveled on top of that. And you still cant hit shit.\n\nI repeat again: I really liked the idea of a medieval game, with enjoyable town building, and cool combat, selling your goods, and have a relaxed time. If you also like this idea, dont ever buy this game. It has nothing to do with it.\n\nThe game would have a huge fan community with thousands of thousands of gamers. But the Developers continue with their stupid xp grind, no fun at all, everything goes super slow and super unfun, super unlogic craft needed buildings order system.\nThey would earn so much more money, if the actually made the building and lvling system fun. But they dont want to make a good game, they just are greedy. So they desperately squeeze the money out of the 200-300 players which play this game, and stupid newcomers who maybe spent 5-10$ for some skin. Good I didnt. They loose more and more players. And do not realize they need to make a biiiiiig turn around. \n\nBe ashamed. So sad. It had such potential. I never was aware how magnificent some Devs can cripple a potential good game.\n\nshame on them. \nChange everything or watch yourself go under. Theyre already dead with that little playerbase and theyre loosing players daily. They need to do something now or be remembered as the worst DevStudio ever.\n\nAs if they would care right? Theyve already sucked up all the money and get paid by the last stupid players still gaming and paying for this.\n\nSo sad.

You have to go make two tools, find and mine some ore, and use the forge to make a tool. He even points to a mine in the village to the north. Sounds okay, right? After all, we're just learning how the game works and all, shouldn't be too hard.\n\nThe first steps are getting those tools. Tooltip says I need flint and branches and plant fiber. Okay. Click on ground, here, there, over there.... no option to gather anything. 30 minutes of dividing by zero, and I pop into the Discord chat and ask. I get a video link that tells me to press F3 and run outside the village border in order to gather stuff. This border is a several minute run, and you will be doing this a LOT.\n\nI get to the edge of the border, and good, I can get plant fiber and flint practically anywhere. As for branches... I need a tree or something, and the land is barren. Logs, stumps, and trees too young are everywhere. Players had laid waste to it already, and some found an exploit to do this inside the village territory, too. It takes several minutes of running farther away from the village to find trees to make branches. Okay, managed to make the shovel and pickaxe. Now to get to the mine for ore.\n\nRemember that issue about being within the village border? The mine the blacksmith tells you about is in the territory. You can walk in and see exposed iron everywhere, but you can't mine it. BRILLIANT. No tips, information or whatever provided to give me any clue where to look. Even online sources are too vague or they expect me to have a skill I don't have (Prospecting) to find nearby ore. Pop back into Discord, ask about it, get told \"along the shoreline\". Wat. Alrighty, I trudge my arse all the way to the coast and it's ravaged for miles. Little bag poops everywhere, tons of fish caught and dumped on the ground. I finally come across a used mine dug by someone and voila, iron ore acquired. Now I need charcoal as the next step.\n\nTook an hour to get back to the village because that's how far I had to travel to find ore. I get back and someone lured a bear and wolf there, in an attempt to grief other newbies. I read up on making charcoal because the quest tip is woefully unsufficient - requires a kiln and billets to fuel. Wow, the blacksmith has several kilns and there's a pile of wood nearby that I can actually work with! I cut up some billets, waddle my way to the kiln and... oh, that village territory thing. I can't use the kilns in the village. No one can. Great. Not only that, but you can't drop stuff in the village, and those logs I sawed up? Overburdened, slower than molasses, until I left the village border again to dump it.\n\nI'm so close, so I push on. I need a kiln made by someone else, or myself. Clay, water, plant fiber, and a flat 3x3 area? I will show dis game de wae my broodahs.\n\nI get outside the village, flatten some land (that wasn't too hard to figure out), and lay the groundwork for the kiln. Huh? I can't build. Why not?\n\nRequires 30 Construction skill. I'm new, I'm at zero, and that completely defeated me. I gave up, obviously deciding this game is not going to get any money from me, but I kept doing other quests for some sort of \"sense of accomplishment\".\n\nI did a quest for finding the cook's children. It hints they're to the SE at swampland - misleading and will cost you hours - they're just near the fields straight to the east. They want a shack made for them, which I somehow prevailed... but their dialogue as a reward suggests they gave me a ticket off the server to Abella. I'm not kidding, the devs literally left in text reward dialogue suggesting players earn their tickets off tutorial island to the mainland(s). But, you don't actually get one. They instead gave me a \"baromsag\" (slang for BS) wrapped in a red ribbon. Very funny.\n\nI mean, I could tolerate it being this bad if it were entirely free... but it's not. It's a ticket system designed to make players pay more than once, and it was rushed to Steam after two months of delays. This game will not last long.\n\nThrough all of that, I met only four players. Two were AFK all the time just standing around, one kept trying to attack me, and the other was just a run-by. Zero interaction or communicating. What a tragically beautiful wasteland.\n\n[h1][b][u]Newbie tips I learned the hard way:[/u][/b][/h1]\n\n- Never rely on the village for crafting anything except cooking or gathering logs.\n- Never overburden yourself unless the travel distance is very short or you're outside the village border.\n- Gather 40 plant fiber, make two simple cloth, right-click them in inventory and craft primitive boots/wristbands.\n- If you don't have materials, you can't look up crafting recipes. It's stupid. ALWAYS KEEP GOOGLE HANDY. The wiki is out of date as well in many ways.\n- Lure animals to the shore and stand in the water. They stand there while you beat away. Big animals are pretty OP, and one headbutt from a deer crushed my ribcage (crippled debuff) for 4 hours.\n- Run along shoreline for all the fish you can ever cook left behind by other players.\n- Hazelnuts gathered from hazel trees are usually plentiful and very filling, and very little weight.\n- Press L to open skills/stats/equipment tabs, somewhere there you can drag/drop Pray To the Gods skill to your hotbar (which the game completely ignores).", "timestamp_created": 1515897042, "timestamp_updated": 1515938293, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 290, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895232081413269043", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39287337": {"recommendationid": "39287337", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994167191", "num_games_owned": 503, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 502, "last_played": 1596751884}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]BUYER BEWARE!\nTHE FORUM HAS BEEN CLEANED OF CRITICISM MINUTES BEFORE THE RELEASE!\n[/b](Referencing screenshot at the end of the review!)\n\nHey you!\nYou're obviously trying to figure out whether you'd like this game.\nTake a seat around the campfire and\nlet me give you some words of advice & warning then!\n\nSince the very early beginning of the MMO the developers have\nshown that their means of earning money is by squeezing it out of their community\nwith any anti-consumer opportunity they can get.\n\nThat's a rough sounding claim, but let me show you a pattern with the following examples of problem-solving on the developers end:\n\n[b]Problem:[/b] Acquiring skills is very slow.\n[b]Solution:[/b] Exp-boosters in Cash-shop!\n\n[b]Problem:[/b]: The skill-cap is restricting my gameplay and making us not competitive in a PVP surrounding.\n[b]Solution:[/b] Buy more characters!\n\n[b]Problem:[/b] The start is wasting hours of my lifetime.\n[b]Solution:[/b] Equipment in cash-shop!\n\n[b]Problem:[/b] I lose a lot of skill-points when I die.\n[b]Solution:[/b] Skill-loss-protection in cash-shop!\n\n[b]Problem:[/b] I lose more skill-points on death when I kill a lot of players because my alignment is low.\n[b]Solution:[/b] More expensive Skill-loss-protection in cash-shop!\n\n[b]Problem:[/b] Life is Feudal: Your Own backers during Early Access were promised \"Beta-access\" but we dont have the server capacities for all of them yet.\n[b]Solution:[/b] Oh boy!

You are STUCK with that one character no matter where you spawn or who you spawn near. If you want a new character, you gotta cough up even more money. If you delete it, you have to spend an extra ten dollars to get a new character. Despite what the support staff claim, I've had over a dozen people confirm there is no warning about having to make an extra purchase when you delete the character.\n\nI'd love to tell you about how this game plays. I really would. But I can't.\n\nWhy you might ask? Well, I'll tell you why. I haven't played enough, and now, I can't. Not without spending another ten dollars plus the thirty I spent to get the game.\n\nWhen you create a character, you start on a tutorial island to help you learn the basics. Beyond some quests with NPCs to learn how to craft tools, farm, hunt, smith, etc. there is not much to do. And by not much I mean basically nothing. There is no 'game' on these tutorial islands. It's a tutorial. You're meant to stay here til you're comfortable, and levelled up a bit, then you travel to the main continent of Abella. This is where you can actually play the game. This is where you can set up your home, figure out what kind of life you want to live, and develop your character how you want.\n\nThis is also where you can join a guild, because you cannot possibly do everything alone. Your character can't be a blacksmith/farmer/carpenter/soldier all at once. It will take so long to train, and training just one skill already takes an incredible amount of time. It would be better to specialize and cooperate for the combined success of the guild.\n\nThis is where my problems arose. I spawned in perhaps the worst part of the map. One giant, unforgiving desert full of hungry wolves. I had no guild lined up at the time, but it wasn't long before I found a guild interested in taking me in. Problem was, they were quite a walk away. Almost an hour of just WALKING to get to my guild. In a desert full of rabid, man-eating wolves. As well, there is this concept called Judgement Hour which is not defined in game. Without google searching, it sounds like something out of The Purge and would make just as much sense. If you do google search however, you find it does not involve guilds not at war. But, like the other main issue of this review, it doesn't tell you that in the game.\n\nSo this perfect storm left me stuck in a desert with no way to get to my new friends. I died quite a number of times trying to make an hour long trek just so I could BEGIN the long process of grinding to learn farming and animal taming.\n\nI oh so innocently thought that, hey, maybe I should just make a new character. An entire guild of almost thirty people said this would be a good idea, because there IS a system in place that allows you to spawn directly to your guild's land claim with a special code when you're teleporting to the main game world. Again, I was not in this guild at the time.\n\nSo, I delete the character after being given a warning that said ONLY that I would lose the character and could not get it back. Nothing else. This detail is incredibly important.\n\nUpon creation of my new character, I waste no time with the tutorial and go straight to the place to teleport to the new area. I enter my guild's code, go to teleport...\n\n\"You cannot teleport without a ticket. Would you like to buy one?\"\n\n...What?\n\nAnd this, dear readers, is where the issue lies. There is no warning for this when you create a character, teleport it to Abella, or delete it. The support staff on the official Discord will tell you other wise, but so far I'm at two people working for the developers saying yes and about fifteen people in my guild who've checked and say no. I've discussed this issue with two support staff members, and both were incredibly condescending and rude, and blatantly ignored any solution I suggested to this problem.\n\nThey claim the community voted for this solution to prevent trolling, but in doing so they're basically barring the game from growing at all. If I know anything about MMOs, it's that people often make a few characters when they're new to see what they like best, and if they have no notion of the ticket system, (which they won't, because it's barely mentioned anywhere or, as far as I've been able to tell, not at all before trying to bring over a second character) they'll suddenly find they can't play the game without handing over even more money.\n\nSo, no, I do not reccommend this game. You basically have to spend hours looking for a guild to join before you can even play it just to make sure the one chance you have to play isn't wasted. Any game that charges you more than once to play the game is simply not a game worth getting. Period.\n\nEdit: And, as seen below, the developers did \"try\" to give me assistance. When I finally managed to get in contact with one, they were friendly and tried to find out what my issue was.\n\nUp until I told them the issue. Once I dropped that, they went completely silent without any other word on it...While still being very obviously active on the Discord! So it has become apparent that this choice wasn't made so much by the community, as it was by the devs being greedy to take advantage of people who would not know better while also conveniently glossing over the fact this system exists!\n\nSo, no, with the developers making a point to ignore this without helping or looking at other solutions simply to continue their greedy ways, DO NOT buy this game!", "timestamp_created": 1534079873, "timestamp_updated": 1534954655, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 156, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.882956743240356445", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71769444": {"recommendationid": "71769444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024161813", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 54284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52742, "last_played": 1598661862}, "language": "english", "review": "Was a fun game at first, but after almost 1k hours I can honestly say PHk this game and its developers.

It is not a fair mechanic. The fact that they charge you 10 dollars to get a new ticket is absolutly wrong and i have a better solution.\n\nThey are saying that the reason why they are implementing this is because of the alignement sysytem (karma) to prevent players to just be able to do evil deeds and just create a new character without having to live with the consequences of their deeds. I am all for that. i 100% agree, but not with a pay wall. there is a better way.\n\nIf you alignement system is so important, make it a time penalty of 72h to a 7 days period. if you delete your character you have to wait 72h to 7 days to create a new one and play again.\n\nwhy?\n\nSimply because players with money will be able to just pay their way back in, with my time pnealty it does not matter how wealthy you are, you would have to wait.

I joined a guild where the leader was a complete tyrant both as a character and person. I joined the Epleland RP server (without realising it) but i loved it. I was playing with the first guild for about 1 week before I had enough of the leader and I was not alone. I left with more or less all members except his loyal lap dog and 2 new players and made my own guild with the rest. We had fun until a russian clan started to harass every other guild on the server. They had a lot of members in the early days when there were about 15-2000 online daily. They would ride into your claim and force you to be their vassals or they would kill you. If you refused they would constantly raid you and kill you making you lose skill points you grinded hard for. They did also use glitches, hacks and exploits to do all from shooting bows in rapid fire to glitching through gates and walls. They were reported several times and video footage of them cheating or exploiting was uploaded but removed by the devs who never listened to the player base unless they were russian or part of that russian grief clan.\n\nIt led to a huge war against them resulting in their loss. That ordeal took about 3 month, then the player base had dropped to around 1200 players.\n\nAfter the fall of the Russians some other players started to make bandit characters who rode around killed anyone they saw and as the russians they were very toxic about it. I remember seeing several new claims every week, new nice ppl to chat with and get to know. Once the bandits started to ride around everyone sealed off their claims with a wall so you never saw anyone, they griefed your area by placing stuff in front of your gates and so on. That led to a lot of new players to quit because they could not progress at all since they kept getting killed. This lasted for around 4 months, by then the player base had dropped to around 500.\n\nI did keep playing with some friends, mostly the ones I had since the beginning but it was boring. After grinding for weeks to get a skill and to make a building just to face the task of farming all the material to make it with a low playerbase. Ex we decided to make a keep, and I remember spending almost a full week of no-lifing mining and shaping granite and transporting it to the buildsite. The game was beautiful but was extremely time consuming, i met several players who left because it felt like a second job, they had 1-2h a day to play and that was consumed by one task like reaping the fields or feeding the animals.\n\nLater when the population was below 75 due to godenland opening and people left Epleland they introduced not only a farming and tree-planting calendar but also a completely new claim system dividing our claim from 1 expandable circle to rectangle parts chopping our claim in 9 different claims, forcing the last 3 of us to try claim it all to save our buildings from being looted or burn down.\n\nI think i did play it for about a year, when they decided to close Epleland I convinced the devs to hold an event for the remaining players and the last 20 of us gathered and had some fun before the server was shut down.\n\nIt was a great game in the beginning, I got to know so many friends. I got to see amazing kingdoms and innovative layouts. It's a shame that it was so grindy, slow paced. It was a shame that the actions of one large clan of toxic players could ruin the entire atmosphere of the game. It went from friendly, social interactions to fear, sealed off camps and hostile interactions. I still miss the old days, when I rode with my knights on our rare warhorses (before people started to train better ones) encountering 3-4 players building a farm or just a hermit making a cabin. It ended too soon and left nothing but a bitter taste of wasted time but with a small sweet tingling sensation of all the good encounters.\n\nI do not recommend it due to the grind, hostile community, lack of dev progress and the fact they didn't lift a finger to enforce their own rules. I also can't recommend it because of the grind, a solo player will get burned out fast due to the materials needed to make a simple house or tools. You need a larger group to play with where you cover all jobs, if someone quits or gets bored you are forced to either make a new character or hope to find another player to specialize in that skill.\n\nI am King Canif, former leader of Knights of the Eclipse, first of his name, famous lancer and commander from the battle of the Eclipse and the coalition against PLAYHARD and the Redmantle bandits, ruler and caretaker over server 31!", "timestamp_created": 1606436450, "timestamp_updated": 1606437086, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870819330215454102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39502005": {"recommendationid": "39502005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007368280", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 101, "last_played": 1516513185}, "language": "english", "review": "I've got over 1000 hours in the Beta, and I have to say this game is one I love to hate and hate to love. I've poured a ton of money into the game for character slots and subscriptions, and I will probably STILL be playing it next month because of the people I am with and the time we\u2019ve invested, maybe even the next month and the next month, but I still CANNOT recommend it.\n\nWithout going into a huge diatribe here are the major problems.\n\n1. Server Stability is shit. Highly populated servers (as in zone servers, not world servers) crash constantly and are unplayable. You'll spend hours trying to log in with a TIME OUT error only to have the server go down within a short time or be perfectly fine, only to be booted randomly and unable to get in.\n\n2. Hacks and exploits abound and go unpunished unless they cause massive amounts of work for the devs. Basically, if you hack the API and delete realm claims, that's bannable. Having a toon that is invincible? \"We need video/logs/screenshots/timestamps.\" Swapping weapons while running? \"We need video/logs/screenshots/timestamps.\" Using console command codes to force the game to its original state in order to walk through walls before they \"load in\"? \"We need video/logs/screenshots/timestamps OH and that code doesn't exist! (Yes it does, and everyone knows it).\"  Use unstuck to purposely glitch through walls?  \"We need video/logs/screenshots/timestamps, OH and we fixed that, so it doesn't happen, so unless you do the above it doesn't exist.\"\n\n3. Code is unbearably shit. Crossing zone server boundaries causes crashes, multiple people crossing through zones at once causes unbelievable lag/crashes/rubberbanding, stumps apparently cause massive lag if they aren't removed, crossing server boundaries on horses/horse carts causes them to disappear more often than not, and the list goes on. \n\n4. Developers don't care about the North America servers. They claim that the problems with server stability are due to the provider, but won't change providers. They claim that NA players don't want to PvP, but they can't institute Judgement Hours or Instance battles that don't end up crashing the entire world server/multiple zone servers. They refuse to do hardware upgrades for the NA servers. Basically they only released to NA for a cash grab.\n\n5.  10000 people is a sham. They have a \"200 characters per zone server\" limit that they need to have because their servers can't handle more players. There are entire clans that have more toons in the clan than the server's limit allows, AND game design fundamentally requires you to have a lot of toons in guilds in order to be able to level up realms.\n\n6. Customer service/Tech support is a joke. In order to be able to have anything handled you need to provide a list of items that the average player doesn't even know how to look up, let alone provide. House explodes due to server glitch? \"We need a list of data in order to prove it wasn't your fault.\" Have an entire keep pounded in, but it won't \"finish\"? \"Oh, there's a bag (that's supposed to despawn) 4 layers below the base of your keep, I guess it got buried. Delete the keep and dig it out. Oh, and no we won't replace the resources.\"\n\n7. Chinese RMT bots abound and are not banned. Multiple guilds and websites are up, with thousands of Chinese/Korean RMT bots running around causing havock, glitches, exploiting game mechanics, duping, and the like, and nothing happens to them. \n\nIn short, the game is very addicting in its \"Minecraft for Medieval Fans/Adults\", but it is so fundamentally broken on every critical level, it never should've been put into open beta, let alone Steam early access. With the devs track record of abandonment, I highly doubt anything will be done to fix these fundamentally broken issues with the game.

It forces people to play together and form guilds, which is something that attracted me to the game. It has the potential to be the next big thing in the MMO market;but it won't. The game has a single major flaw that is planned to remain for a significant amount of time, long enough to kill the game and any form of a community. The issue is each server is capped. I play on NA Buyan, the original OBT server for NA. The games breaks down Buyan by server \"tiles\" and then caps those tiles at 200 players. As part of a large alliance that has over 200 players, this results in the game being unplayable. Let's say we plan to attack a guild on judgement hour (a 2 hour long free for all except a certain claims)-We take 40 of our best players 3 hours before the event starts and begin moving into the tile and in the process fill it up to the 200 player limit. As the event gets closer, more and more people log in to defend their claim and now our planned open world raid is 40 versus 4. We slaughter our enemy and burn down months of work in 2 hours. Now they also understand how this cap works and the goal is to log as many people on as possible and sit in your base for hours before an attack, boiling our hardcore medieval world down to the premise of 'Who can log on earlier'. BUT WAIT! The lead of the game, A gentleman who goes by Bobik comes out and states \"There were no plans for large open world fights! We plan to instance these battles to reduce lag.\" The costs for these battles are crazily prohibitive, unless you're capping your server and pulling resources, preventing players from being able to log a character on in that tile. It's also easily defended against, as people have to enter your tile to place it. This is the most pressing issue in regards to PvP and PvE, as preventing players from being able to play at all on a character is easily possible and as the game grows, it limits the ability of everyone to play the game. \n\nSolo Player-Unable to obtain all necessary resources and defense to make the game enjoyable.\nSmall Guild-Unable to defend possessions, being set back weeks each time you're attacked and constantly have to move as large guilds push you out of the tile to reserve resources and the ability to have players login\nLarge Guild/Alliance-Listen in your chosen voice chat for hours as people cannot play due to full server tiles, constanting spamming Connect in the hopes that another bug has forced a player's game to crash, opening a spot. \n\nIt also has a shop that allows x2 xp an hour once a day, the ability to negate skill loss for griefers with fat wallets, and a 10$ per character cost. \n\nThe in game guild/personal permissions are also broken, allowing players to steal your resources or preventing your friends from being able to help you build or let them use something. \n\nThe game closely follows the No Man's Sky approach, where you hype your players up and empty the wallets as quickly as possible.", "timestamp_created": 1516154675, "timestamp_updated": 1516154675, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 214, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.829613864421844482", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43946841": {"recommendationid": "43946841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112683681", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 103448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74015, "last_played": 1535661868}, "language": "english", "review": "I do not recommend this game, admins and dev let chineses cheat without punishing them. they watched them live cheating and said it was ok to bug exploit . so i do not recommend this game cuz no matter how you build your base bad people will be able to use cheat to pass throught things they are not suppose to and they also let them aimbot so even if you hide correctly the arrow will get you in the head throught the walls this is the worst game i ever seen", "timestamp_created": 1533475629, "timestamp_updated": 1533475629, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 112, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824455976486206055", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1533553664, "developer_response": "Hello!

I've poured a ton of money into the game for character slots and subscriptions. Now mainly because preferences true but also recent changes im feeling obliged to put my review so people know what they will deal with.\n\n1. Server Stability is horrible. Highly populated servers (as in zone servers, not world servers) crash often. They have greatly improved in recent, but still there are problems.\n2. Exploits abound and go unpunished unless they cause massive amounts of work for the devs. Having a character that is invincible? Swapping weapons while running? Using exploits to climb the wall or spawn in side claim murder and destroy during JH? Entire guild griefing? Expoliting mechanics? Its normal here\u2026 \nOverall im used to it yet for people that don\u2019t want to deal with it - beware\n3. Server Crossing zones causes are quite often not possible to cross, multiple people crossing through zones at once causes unbelievable lag/crashes/rubber banding, stumps or even trees cause massive lag if they aren't removed, crossing server boundaries on horses/horse carts causes them to disappear more often than not, and the list goes on. \n4. Games is advertised to have 10 k players per server but simply not possible for the moment. They have a \"200 characters per zone server\" limit that they need to have because their servers can't handle more players. There are entire clans that have more peeps in the clan than the server's limit allows, AND game design fundamentally requires you to have many peeps in guilds in order to be able to level up realms.\n5. Chinese/Russian boting and hacking. I heard multiple guilds and websites are up, with thousands of Chinese/Korean RMT bots running around causing havock, glitches, exploiting game mechanics, duping, and the like, and nothing apperently happens to them. Russians also tent to do it often. Like I saidi don\u2019t care but if you go into this game and expect to play NOT using exploits to win \u2013 then you are for rude awakening by the guys that do.\n6. Very green players (carebears- not trying to be offensive here) friendly. If PVP aspect sound alluring for you don\u2019t let you guard down. This game is not PVP \u201cfriendly\u201d even on PVP servers. Devs constantly work to take care for their player base don\u2019t kill each other which is usually good think \u2013 however it greatly reduces and diminishes PVP. At first to damage an enemy you had to use exploits (there were not much choice). Then devs made it harder to use it basically making PVP almost nonexistent. Only major outcry Unit and formation system is non-existent forget what you saw in trailers it\u2019s just show-off at least - for now.\n\n7. Every update there is always something new bugged or not working correctly. No matter how much they fix something new always brakes \u2013 basically it\u2019s one step forward two-three steps back.\n\n8. Broken promises and player outcry ignoring(f.eks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDgJPmqqv88). They grately changed from initial vision its no longer \u201cHARDCORE PVP\u201d focused game it even was given title OF PVE RPG with some elements of PVP.\n\n9. Dividing community even tho initial design was to create synergy between PVE/PVP devs divided playerbase for PVP/PVE and each with their own server. PS PVP is still very toned even on PVP server.\n\n10. Constant monetization of EVERY DETAIL AND WITH LUDICROUS PRICE. Don\u2019t get me wrong there game need to make money and I\u2019m one of those guys that is convinced there are no P2W micro trans here. However devs seem think ONLY ABOUT MONEY. Lets just say that typical skin price is estimetly around 40-30 bucks.\nAnother problem was born when equipping skins was pointless because of lazy tabards. They cowered everything and therefore buying skins were pointless. So they made flags (yay finally) \u2013 that costed 10 buck for unlock AND added skin for flags (ofc .for money as well). Do not even make me talk about changing servers from PVE to PVP and not giving peeps free tickets and profiting from this. Did I mention that they also profit from selling early alpha tickets? List goes on\u2026\n\n11. Until recently there was info about new MAJOR PATCH in may which ofc. is postponed \u2013 like usual and it will have tons of bugs - like usual. Everything is fine and dandy slaves/clergy (you can see it on official web). However, they will change very important thing by DIVIDING world for red and green. These changes annihilates economy from red world (which is already almost non existent) switching all economy to green world. Now player will be forced to play on two servers. And who will ofc profit from transfers. (normal player will be able transfer twice a week premium every 2 days). Or buy two characters.\n\nAND BELIEVE ME LIST GOES ON \n\nJakkus Jack The Jackal", "timestamp_created": 1528744193, "timestamp_updated": 1528744193, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822564542293548584", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42258411": {"recommendationid": "42258411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084115718", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 76408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9516, "last_played": 1573506092}, "language": "english", "review": "The issue for this game is easily described in one simple word \"Bobik\" \n\nThe main developer is a arrogant angry little man who listens to the player and then does nothing about it, every decision made for this game is cash related.\n\nthe original adverts said 10 k people on 1 server, 2 weeks ins the deal was change to many server struggling to house 2k players. original players had to pay for new characters to move to the new servers,\n\nanything travel related ingame has been killed by the developers in a effort to stop you from wanting to cross a server border. \n\nPVP is near impossible now since they change the rules via \"Tweaks\" in every patch. but lets no being to look at the many improvements they have brought in which make no sense. to many to mention, but if you do want to play go read the patch notes and see. \n\nCrafting and skills, to plant a tree you first have to become a expert farmer before learning to plant trees, although you are best off cutting them down as a artisan as they cut trees faster, dont worry though you will have put your skills into natures lore and not artisan, so you need to a friend to help you. \n\nnatures lore is also a great idea if you want to collect herbs and become a healer, so click on the floor and run around in a circle for 8 hours due to the improvements in \"collecting things.\" and make a tonne of herbs, but you will want to heal people which levels up very slowly, first though, remember the improvements in \"Collecting things\" click on the floor and run around collecting plant fibre. you will need only about 8000 bandages to to get to level 100. thats right a surgeon in real life will have been through med school and worked his way to the top before you are level 100. \n\nnow lets look at the in game store, if you want to never loose skills when you die. great, get 20+ alignment and pay for the montly subscription, I know what you are thinking, if you get 40 alignment and die without the sub you wont loose anything, nope, you will still loose points unless you pay, no matter what. \n\nhowever the store does house some really nice skins for your armour, so go rob daddies credit card.... no not that one. you will need the platinum card,  I considered buying a nice helmet skin but for around \u00a340 for a fricken skin I thought better of it. \n\nback to the developers. so they decided that the game will be better if you have alignment loss for hitting none war targerts, so people just leave there claims to fight, that way you loose alignment no matter, what, the players asked for the ability to pray for it back above -50, Bobik listened, and made it so you loose 10 alignment if you leave a claim, erm, if you leave they can still give you perms to access everything, no difference was made in this decision other than to punish they people already getting shafted. \n\nBorder crossings, each month they announce the fixed border crossing, everymonth you loose something while crossing, and no replacement, \" we don't replace items lost due to known bugs\" you then find a new bug \"we cant replace an item thats not a known bug\" \n\nthere are many other things i want to mention but to honest I have lost the will to live even thinking about this, We had a kingdom with around 140 people, each one lost the will to go on. \n\nLook I could go on for hours. \n\nBobik and his team have robbed and thats no slander, its the truth, they changed the goal posts and screwed every player that has played this game, he should do the right thing and refund every player every penny. \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1527282410, "timestamp_updated": 1527282410, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 128, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821326553821563721", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60141491": {"recommendationid": "60141491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022297845", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 10571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10571, "last_played": 1534010605}, "language": "english", "review": "Just terrible.

Terra-forming on a huge map with just the tools you made with your hands has an appeal by itself, not to mention the PvP possibilities with the combat physics, all of it seems tantalizingly entertaining. And it is, to a point - even though the player population is low, there's ample opportunity to meet folks, interact, trade, or just shoot the breeze with someone you don't know, simply because being out in the wilderness on your own for long stretches leaves you pining a little for some human contact. Or beat them senseless, if that's your thing. \n\nIt's also entirely made for community interaction - surviving by yourself is difficult at best. You'll definitely want to make friends, or if you have the money, buy alts and rotate them in and out as you need. But solo play is a very slow slog and won't get you far along in anything. \n\nIt is not an easy game, and it's most assuredly not for everyone - diehard terraformers with a taste for role playing a medieval peasant will certainly enjoy this concept and game, and this is no small thing. The gaming landscape is littered with dessicated corpses of medieval-themed games that just didn't get it right.\n\nBut where LiF fails is its implementation. The interface is punishing, just to quote another review, but most damning is the simple launching of the game - just simply logging on to play can be a tedious exercise in waiting for a slow download of a patch or map file at speeds in the neighborhood of 4-100 kB/s. \n\nYou read that right - KILOBYTES per second. It makes AOL seem positively speedy. \n\nThe LiF Dev Team has promised to fix this, but whatever fix was in certainly wasn't the kind that improved the gamer's experience in just accessing the content. \n\nWhat really makes this excruciating is the constant updating; updating maps, equipment skins, themes, whatever. Updates combined with slow download speeds make for a grueling experience in a game that prides itself on the grueling already in the game. Getting gamers to the content rapidly has to be among the paramount concerns of any game publisher; unfortunately this team doesn't seem to have learned that lesson in the previous 4+ years of its 'early access' trial. \n\nAdding insulting injury to this mess is the banners on logon for the microtransactions, skins and special discounts and such. Really, guys? You made me wade through a whole slew of updates on a premium subscription and the first thing I see after raging through your launcher interface is the opportunity to buy more pain? How about you just give me my last hour back trying to get into your game?\n\nAnd therein lies the tragedy - great concept and a game worth playing for a niche' community, but the implementation of this game is just too painful to bear, at least in this current form. It's sad - I really like this game. I want to love it, but the game launcher experience fills me with dread every time I sit down to play.

Servers are unstable, the game is full of bugs, most of the bugs have been around for months (the devs know about it and they are \"working on it\"...for months)\nI feel like I'm done with this game... when it gets better I may return, but as I said, in it's current stage it will just make you angry and dissapointed.", "timestamp_created": 1527804872, "timestamp_updated": 1527804872, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.791184782981872559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39296104": {"recommendationid": "39296104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045873334", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1515808368}, "language": "english", "review": "!!!Warning, long-ish review ahead!!! (TL;DR at the bottom)\nOh no, a negative review on day one. How could this happen? Well, this isn\u2019t actually day one.  Life is Feudal MMO Open Beta tests have been open to certain people for about 2 months, and Life is Feudal YO (the \u201cstandalone\u201d game that just ended up being a way for the devs to fund the MMO as well as test certain mechanics) has been up for around 3 years now.  I personally bought YO on the first day it came out on steam, but there are people in this community that have been testing and supporting this game even longer.\n\nI have some regrets about posting this review, because I have more hours in LiF YO than any other game, and YO happens to be the game where I have had most of my best gaming moments.  This game has a great concept and solid basic structure, and could easily be the best MMO I have ever played if they hadn\u2019t made so many mistakes along the way.  Of all the medieval games I have ever played, this game has (in my opinion) the best skill based melee combat of any medieval game (I have played M&B and chiv, and LiF has more than them mechanics wise), especially when it comes to group fights.  However, the combat and PvP in general have always had massive flaws in both class balance and functionality (lag, crashes, IBs not working), although the class balance is slowly getting better (emphasis on slowly).  PvP functionality, however, is only getting worse.  The instanced battles, which are 100v100 battles that can damage an enemy\u2019s realm and eventually let you take them over if you win and siege them, are currently broken and work 1/10 of the time, and the instanced sieges are not in the game.  During the closed beta, instanced battles worked more often than they do now.  Judgement hour, which is the only time you can get over someone\u2019s walls, often results in the servers either crashing or having unplayable ping, which negates the point of it completely.  A lot of people get very competitive in LiF because of the player skill based mechanics and the risk of losing everything you own, but due to most forms of PvP not working, all a group can do is taunt another group in the official discord.  If you ever beat a group while you are roaming in the MMO, don\u2019t expect them to ever fight you again if they can help it as their walls will protect them for as long as sieges aren\u2019t in the game.  The game currently lacks long term risk, everything anyone builds at the moment can be rebuilt fairly easily if your group has the resources.  Nothing is really permanent.\n\nPvP is the only true end game for LiF, and they have made it nearly impossible to do.  Sure, you can go around roaming trying to catch people outside their base, but if you want an actual fight outside of the instanced battles, expect the odds to be heavily against you.  There is no PvE content here, people call crafting PvE, but PvE implies you will be fighting against an NPC.  Crafting is required for PvP in this game, so it might as well be looped into PvP.  The animals in this game are mostly for crafting purposes, and there is no threat out in the world other than people and bad server performance (and the occasional bugged out bear/wolf).  There are no dungeons in this game, no dragons, no monsters, but evil tribal NPCs are planned. However, I wouldn\u2019t expect these NPCs to be much of a threat if the have the same path finding as animals currently do in the game, getting stuck on objects or just bugging out completely and becoming immortal.  Role play is a thing that a lot of players try to do, however, there are little to no mechanics in the game that actually support role playing (which is fine imo) so most role players make up their own roles and it's just a cluster of people\u2019s mismatched stories, worse than a twilight fanfic.  The term role play in this game doesn\u2019t really have a meaning anymore, and most people just use it to describe people who don\u2019t PvP (again, because the only real mechanic in this game is PvP at the time being).   \n\nAs far as in game economy goes, there is none.  All currency is used for right now is supporting claims.  Regional resources, which was the devs idea to make people trade across the map, usually just turns into people setting up camps in those other zones to get the resources they want.  Anything a guy in the southwest region of the map can make, someone in the northeast can make as well.  There is no real economy, and no way to damage an enemies economy once they have their resources locked down.  Don\u2019t expect to play as a trader, because major alliances can do whatever you think you can do as a small trading group 10x faster than you can.\n\nTL;DR, the main draw of this game, PvP, is not represented well enough.  You cannot play this game with the expectation of good, daily PvP, in its current state it simply will not happen.  The game is plagued with bad servers, long downtimes, terrible ping, imbalanced weapons and classes, and downright disfunctional or unimplemented NECESSARY mechanics.  Give it another 2 years before it is enjoyable as an MMO, because currently the grind feels more like a job with no reward at the end than a game, which is not how a game should feel.  I can go on and on about what is wrong with this game but it would probably be pointless since this review will most likely eventually get deleted anyways.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, YO is my favorite game of all time, but the devs have made way too many mistakes to salvage this great concept.  I expect if this game doesn\u2019t make it that this will be the end of the potentially greatest game genre ever.\n\nAnd yes, I did download the steam version of the MMO just to write this review.\n\nDisrespectfully, \n\nThe most jaded person in all of LiF\n", "timestamp_created": 1515808353, "timestamp_updated": 1515808353, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 125, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785555660724639893", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47842843": {"recommendationid": "47842843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055106240", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 376, "last_played": 1545614217}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't bother.\nThere is a lot that could go right with this game...but the cash grab dynamics seem to inhibit it. \nWhen I went from the newbie erveer to the main there were 0 people on there. \nI found myself ill equipped for the first time out so, as I've done in the past I deleted the toon. \n\nThen I had to pay to just get back into the PVE realm again.

I both enjoyed and hated my time in this game. I bought this game when it was first announced on steam, well before it was the MMO it is now. For the most part the game was still pretty basic, but you could do plenty. My first time in the game I was lucky enough to meet up with a small settlement of players. I think there were four people and I was the fifth. When I showed up I think all they had was about two shacks and a few beds/ tents. We needed ore, so I was thrown to the mines. I was the newest guy, so it only made sense I got the grunt job. I managed to work my way up to a master miner/ terraformer. It was kinda cool how everyone had to pick their own role. We had a hunter to hunt deer, a farmer working on crops, one guy focusing on combat, and another miner along with me. As time went on and we got more people a few of us started moving up. Obviously the original four were the leaders, and me being the next one I ended up being kind of like an unofficial leader. I held more authority than any of the people after me. It was cool how the heirarchy basically built itself. Eventually we started to work on some walls and got some decent housing. Broke down some old shacks and replaced them with houses with multiple rooms and beds. We were living good. Then a server wipe happened and we lost everything. I sank like 60 hours in one week on that settlement and have since stopped playing it. \n\nI came back in a few years later, or about 3-4 months ago. I ended up joining on some purge day, which in my opinion is fucking retarded. It went on for over two hours and I basically couldn't do anything. The whole server just said, \"Fuck it, kill everything on sight.\" So natrually I ran for over an hour and someone would kill me. I went up to some settlements saying I was new and just looking to join some people as a grunt. Killed instantly at about 10 different settlements. I stopped playing for the day and went back in. Pretty much the same thing happened over and over again. No matter who it was, they instantly tried to kill me. And it's not like some bandit, I'm talking about a knight who's fully kitted who's a master swordsman. Literally no benefit to killing me, nothing to steal, nothing to earn, no reason. I since stopped entirely. \n\nI do want to get back in, but the player base/ community is toxic to new players. For that reason I'm giving this a thumbs down. The game has amazing mechanics and it's probably the most in depth game I have ever player. But loney ass kids need to feel important by killing new players.

It was a hardcore PvP open world experience that was akin to EVE Online in the sense that there was true loss upon death. For several years, major aspects of the PVP in this game were largely unchanged. This was dramatically altered in November/December 2017 during the \"Open Beta.\" \n\nIn short, the changes resulted in a limitation of \"raiding,\" which in the LIF world, is defined by scaling the walls of your enemy and engaging the economic center of their activity. Such raiding could take place at any time of day, forcing players to be on their guard, construct their bases intelligently, or set guards to watch for roaming bandits. Only one month into the Open Beta, this was made all but impossible during \"normal time\" by the removal of the wall-scaling mechanics, which were not replaced by any craftable in-game item. As a result, the only way to enter your opponent's base was during what is called \"Judgment Hour,\" a preset time of the week where the raiding mechanics are re-implemented. With the new servers open for Steam Release, it lasts between 1-2 hours and, again depending on the server, takes place between 1 and 4 times a week. \n\nThe issue with Judgment Hour, however, is that it allows your enemies to prepare for a specific time of attack, thus eliminating the element of surprise. Additionally, with current server hardware, if more and more people are incentivized into logging in at a specific time, the servers suffer and lag is a perennial reality for the times that are \"designed\" to accommodate base-raiding PVP. Why did the game go from a \"hardcore PVP\" game to one that forces that PVP, which was enjoyed by thousands of players for years, to take place at specific times? \n\nSome players would say it is the \"RP\" or \"PVE-er\" influence in the game, accusing the developers of pandering to them for money rather than long-term vision, which has resulted in widespread community feelings of betrayal. Although I wouldn't necessarily attribute such intent to the developer team, I would strongly recommend that you wait for developer commitments before offering your money to their team. \n\nThe next issue is the current state of the servers. The Life is Feudal: MMO is a 21km by 21km persistent map divided into nodes or \"tiles.\" Each tile is supposedly its own server in itself. However, the realities of the game make it so that the tiles are not built equally. Northern tiles, for instance, suffer from longer winters and therefore shorter growing periods, which incentivizes players to search for fertile tiles to build their settlements. Although this scarcity of resources is one of the few areas of the game with proper economic incentives, it leads to overpopulation of certain tiles while others remain practically abandoned. Furthermore, unlike in EVE Online, where major battles can be supported by rearranging server resources to a particular node, the LIF: MMO has not demonstrated similar capabilities. \n\nThe end result? When an invading army enters a tile, players either disconnect, lose their horses, experience rampant \"rubberbanding\" or suffer from all three. \n\nBut perhaps the worst reason to not play this game is the general lack of economic incentivization. In short, there are very few resources that must be traded in order for a guild to be successful. Although \"regional goods\" may exist in some capacity for certain items, in theory fostering trade, the majority of goods can be produced in-guild, safely behind walls. The game's current structure allows a guild to \"claim\" deposits of clay or ore, erect walls around such deposit, then harvest them behind largely relative safety with only the odd Judgment Hour to force them out of their daily routines. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that many other crafting abilities can be done safely behind walls. For instance, entire forests can be grown within the safety of a defensive curtain, negating any incentive for foresters to go out into the world into a natural forest and bring back lumber.  \n\nWhen players can close themselves off and engage in vertical AND horizontal integration with little need to emerge from their castles, the game world suffers. In EVE Online, mining in asteroid belts puts an individual at risk. In LIF:MMO, that same miner can erect walls around their mine and harvest in safety. While some might argue that this is good for people who want to craft, the reality is that it limits player to player interactions, makes the game world feel underpopulated, and typically results in burn out once players construct their dreambase. Building in a vacuum is very easily accomplished in LIF: Your Own and should really have no place in an MMO. \n\nThis is a core design flaw. The solution would be to implement more reasons for players to leave their base, or disable basic gathering actions (such as mining or logging) from taking place within the safety of a claim. This would force guilds to dedicate defensive teams for the miners and loggers to protect them from raiders, who in turn would have more incentive to explore the world to attack their enemies' economic inputs. \n\nThe grand vision of this game should be a world where trade caravans crisscross the map, where players negotiate and build alliances, where crafters are protected by combat personnel off of their claims, and where the economic might of a guild is vulnerable. Everything else--sieges, combat, diplomacy, etc.--flow from these critical aspects. As it stands, trade caravans are rare, players build alliances without much reason to, crafters are protected by their walls and don't need to venture outside of their base with proper base construction, and the economic storehouses and workforces of guilds are essentially untouchable. \n\nMy advice is to wait for this game to address its economic incentivizations, wait for the staff to invest in better hardware, and wait for developer commitments to the future of the game so the money you think is going towards one vision of the game isn't just co-opted into a different vision entirely.", "timestamp_created": 1515782334, "timestamp_updated": 1515782438, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 213, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751753449440002441", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39591998": {"recommendationid": "39591998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023896911", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2645, "last_played": 1517266232}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say?

Most of the complaints are from past players that dislike either how easy it is or about microtransactions, or they are new players that think a game that is meant to be a grind is extremely grindy. There seems to be confusion on what this game is, and people who are complaining about that grind must not have actually looked into what this game is. SO here is an honest review, from someone who used to dislike it. \n\nI played originally when the MMO was released. It was... very buggy. Couldn't recommend it then as it was really broken. However, over the year or two its been out the game has changed DRASTICALLY. For the better, in almost every regard. In fact, it's so good Im going to go point by point how this game is great and try to refute what some of the complaints are. \n\n1. \"The game is a grind fest\" - This has been changed where, yes it is a grind, but it isnt NEARLY as bad as it used to be. How the leveling works is you get 500xp for fishing up some fish. From here, you choose which skill you want to apply that in, whether it be gathering (to get better fish), or mining. You can accumulate 500k xp, and it will apply that XP while you are online or offline. This means, you can accumulate a ton of XP, go play another game, and come back and have progressed numerous levels. You get a ton of XP for basic actions, so its really not that hard to progress. You gain XP faster than you expend it, and it takes 3 hours to go from 0-30 in a stat, 24 to go from 30-60 and so on. You gain XP faster than you spend it, so you literally can gain the xp and go play something else or roam around and explore while you progress. People complaining about this must not be doing much. \n\n2. \"People keep raiding me\" - So, with this new map, they introduced a really cool new system that REALLY helps out new people. They are \"Green zones\" that disallow combat and raiding inside of them, as well as having a market where you can sell items to the \"crown\" and get a decent amount of money for them. All this time, you are getting that XP to apply to a stat that you want to do. With this money, you can get a personal claim and claim quite a decent amount of land to do whatever you want. Dig a hole to china? Have fun. Build a nice enclosed base? Sure. Literally do whatever you want, and its not like the tiles cost a ton to maintain either, its very reasonable. \n\n3. \"Microtransactions? WTF\" - Most of these are cosmetics. Sure there are some XP boosts, and theres a benefit to the monthly subscriptions, but this is a MASSIVE game. Literally took me 6 hours to walk across half the world. Half. Not even the full thing. This whole thing can be terraformed as well. Obviously they need some way to make money. The XP boosts dont really do much, solely because it still takes a forever to apply the XP you get, and it only doubles the XP gain for an hour. The rest is cosmetics with no real advantage. Seriously, people complaining about microtransactions here are really missing the point of the game. \n\n4. \"PVP sucks\" - Theres lag comp, meaning that what you do has to verify with the server to prevent someone hitting you from 500m away. Theres 1 world wide server, so this is really necessary. Believe me, I was in this boat a while back with a small mod I play when they introduced it but after seeing its impact its actually positive.\n\nSeriously, give this game a shot. Its so unique and amazing to see the world. I spent an hour walking through mountain paths seeing the untouched land around me, except for the road that one person decided to path. A road. Through a mountain and valley. Where they had to carve out the mountain, terraform the land etc, to get to one small little village. The dedication is amazing. The scale is massive. The concept is amazing, and it forces trade and interaction via how the world is laid out and how resources are allocated. Please, give this a chance. Dont hate on it cause someone said \"microtransactions are expensive\" when its literally almost all cosmetic or it has little impact.   \n\n\n*TL:DR This game is magical. The microtransactions are almost all cosmetic, the scale and scope of the game is huge and amazing, interactions are forced and its not just a PVP world where everyone kills everyone. Theres also cool ways to claim your own land and make it out on your own. Its also not NEARLY as grindy as people make it out to be, even less than Runescape or other games of that nature.

But you will have to dedicate 95% of your time to this game to achive anything OR... you can buy a subscription! Dont like that server you picked? Change the server and wait a week or pay 10$ for a ferry ticket! The community is toxic, the players kill on site no matter what server you play on and the amount of grinding needed to just become decent at something is disgusting.

The problem is once you start the game and wish to play with your friends you cannot because everyone says you need to join a guild and use their high quality food for the stat gain. So once you join the guild you will be forced into slavery and cannot do what you want to do because they will have work for you and you will just be a slave for 90% of the game. The map is huge for no reason because the player base will never be high enough. They have two servers which splits the player base in half which is a really dumb move seeing how each server is the same just with claim changes and the fact that they do not have thounsands of players just around 200. The giant world feels pointless because of it. Have fun running for 2 hours trying to meet up with your friends as well. If you think you can join the RP server and have fun you'd be wrong. Go to the PvP server and get enslaved as well or killed on site. You lose EXP for dying as well. So that 5 hours you spent grinding up a skill will be reset if you die. Fun.

So if you ask in \"Help\" for example, players can read and answer ingame aswell as on Discord.\n- A true medieval survival sandbox experience. Do whatever you want. Ride a warhorse into battle? Go for it! Become a monk and live on top of a mountain from the fruits the land provides? I am not saying it's easy, but that's not what you were going for anyways, right? It's all in here, and I like it.\n- Actually F2P. Leveling up your skills takes more time with a free account than with a premium (subscription, see \"Con\") account, but that's about it. Some people complain about some ingame store items, but there is literally nothing there that would give a paying player an advantage over a free player, besides \"time\". That is also true for the often criticized \"skill loss insurance (if you die, you lose an amount of skill points based on different variables, unless you have a \"skill loss insurance\". However, skills can be gained back - it is just a matter of time).\n- FREE 1x \"Ticket to Abella\" for the first character you take to the mainland after the tutorial (or straight away without playing the tutorial, this is a sandbox game after all, do what you want). After that, create a second account to get another free character to the mainland, or spend roughly 10 bucks for another ticket on your first account. Your call.\n- YOUR OWN PLOT OF LAND, easy to pay for with coins you earn ingame. Currently 100 tiles (big enough, trust me), for free accounts.\n- FREE ingame coins, earned just by crafting random stuff and selling it at one of the market places \"to the crown\", i.e. like to an ingame NPC giving you money for your items. I easily made more than a gold (equals 100 silver) in two days by just crafting beginner stuff and cutting down trees and selling billets to \"the crown\". For reference, 20 silver paid for 26 REAL LIFE DAYS of owning my 100 tile plot of land.\n- Player market: Instead of selling \"to the crown\" you can often make much more money by selling to other players. Go check the trade post and browse the \"Buy Orders\" created by other players or go and create your own \"Buy/Sell Order\".\n- Nice graphics, including nice weather effects, matching the different seasons.\n- Weather affects crops, lifestock, tree growth etc.\n- Complex crafting, farming, building system. In the beginning you tend to go into many different skill trees, to get you started, but sooner or later you specialize, which means you cannot do everything on your own, or at least not with one character - which encourages players to interact, trade and also can make your character valuable to others who seek someone with your skills.\n- Very grindy, and for me this is a Pro. I know that's not everybody's cup of tea, but this is my review, so... BUT! The game is by far not as grindy as for example Wurm Online, which for me makes the grind actually entertaining. ALSO your skill(s) keep advancing while you are offline, as long as you have unspent XP on you.\n- Well designed skill tree(s), in three main categories: Crafting; Fighting; General (where under \"General\"  you find skills I would call \"secondary skills\", like Swimming, Riding, Praying, Arts etc.)\n- Huge \"Safe Zones\" where PvP is disabled and individual players (not guilds) can claim their own plot of land and build, farm, do whatever they want.\n- Humongous \"Non-Safe Zones\", where only guilds (not single players) can claim land and build, fight, lay siege on each other and conquer territories to collect taxes, etc. Please note, that does not mean as a non-guild player you cannot enter those territories - it just means you cannot claim a personal plot of land there. Also, PvP happens, so be warned.\n- Interesting and complex lore, albeit it is still EA and probably evolving over time (3 different \"races\", a whole plethora of gods that you can pray to, a \"Genesis\" for the world you live in, etc).\n- PVP: Thought through PVP skill tree, with different, very distinct roles. Huge PVP battles (you can temporarily support guilds by joining their \"arenas\" and fight alongside them for their cause, or actually join a PVP oriented guild for more regular battles). Guild wars are incentivized by territories that can be conquered and earn guilds \"taxes\", for example.\n- There is more I like but much of it are just the little details (tatoos for your character, little ingame \"events\" like your character sneezing so hard it throws him/her off their feet, etc.). I appreciate those little things.\n\nCon:\n- Subscription model: The current base fee for a monthly subscription is roughly 20 bucks. That is insane compared to other AAA titles, that are also fully released and not \"just\" EA. For me personally, the game in its current state does not offer enough to justify that amount of money every month.\nAnd for those saying \"Duh, that is to support the developers and development of the game\" - no, that is to cover the regular cost of staff, servers and maintenance. \"Supporting the developers during EA\" is what you do by buying the \"Pagan\", \"Pilgrim\" and \"Zealot\" Starter Packs, ranging from 30 to 94 bucks (depending on your currency).\n- Menus and number of clicks you need to perform actions are often not too intuitive. I got the hang of it, but I think it can easily frustrate new players when they find they are not able to do things they feel they should be able to do, just because it is hidden somewhere in the menus or skill trees and they are unable to find what they are looking for. I actually account many of the negative reviews to that exact issue.\n- Number of players - this game and the game world is perfectly suited for thousands of players, however, the numbers are just not there (yet?). Marketing and attracting new players needs to be a top priority, but keeping new players entertained after they downloaded the client and joined the game for the first time, is equally important (see point directly above, about frustrating new players).\n- I miss some things ingame, but that is just because it is still in EA, so not really a \"Con\", more a reminder about EA to you (for example an ingame mail system to send players mail (maybe introduce a post office in bigger towns and settlements) and more NPC's, NPC houses, maybe some \"quests\" but not really obvious ones, just ones you find by interacting with NPCs like in the tutorial and of course in line with the sandbox setting. I have so many ideas - @Developers, if you want to hear them, I am happy to tell^^).\n\n\nLast but not least, about the wild claims some people make in their negative reviews. You may like or dislike the game, I am fine with that. You be you. But spreading false information and making claims that sound like \"facts\" but are just plain wrong is not going to help anyone. So if you as an interested player come across such \"reviews\", keep in mind, this game is not a brainless hack'n'slash. It is not for everybody and not everybody will be willing to put in the effort and try to figure out how things work (even just leaving the tutorial island seem to be an obstacle for some).

Here comes the most shitty thing ever - by buying the cheapest edition of the game, or if you got it for free as an apology for [i]Your Own[/i] still being broken, you get a single ticket. [u]Now how that works is ridiculously greedy.[/u] You start the game, make a character and get dumped onto a starting area, a tutorial, a noob island. You can't really build there, you can't really own land there and it's small, well compared to what the MMO offers normally. In the centre are a pillar of light and a talking statue that warps you into a live server, where the meat of the game is. \n\nSo some months ago the game went into alpha or beta and I got a tip - I own the previous game, I get this one for a low, low price of free. So I went to the dev's website, logged in with my Steam account, got my game, downloaded it and started playing. The game run nicely (much better than [i]Your Own[/i] ever did), and I had a lot of fun, clearly, it's the superior game to its predecessor. I spend a month, maybe more in the game and it's a grind, like seriously, you have to commit to playing this game and only this game and still, you need friends.\n\nThe game came to Steam Early Access, and there were changes. Beyond more players, more servers obviously. Now, I'm currently in Europe, we had one server, now we have three. And here's the most painful to me part - [b]the server I was on, the standard, vanilla server as it was, was turned into a PvP server.[/b] There's a standard one and a Role Play one (really wish I could join that one). Thing is I can't transfer my character. I can make a new character, but I had only one ticket, so either I'll stay on the tutorial island or... fork over some cash for another ticket. 10 EUR (10 USD for you, over the wet, deep water thingy). Now it wouldn't be a problem if I chose the server I am on now knowing well in advance that it's a PvP server, [b]but I didn't[/b]. The server changed and there's nothing I can do about it. [b]They gave me a free ticket, took it from my hands, wiped their asses on it and now they're telling me to eat it or buy a new ticket.[/b] I contacted support, basically got a \"deal with it\" answer, tried to tell them how unfair it is and... silence. Mind you, that whole thing happened when the game came to Steam, it's been what, a week? Perhaps more. Radio silence.\n\nLet me stress this out here... I played a crapton of free to play MMO games. I don't mind microtransactions there, but to pay for a new character? Yeah, sure, it's a thing but even the most exploitative free to play MMO games out there give you at the very least two character slots and the ability to delete one if you want, here if I'd delete my character, with months of work put into him, I'd lose the free ticket anyway, because... [b]it's a ticket, it has been spent, it's not a slot[/b]. Anyway, I'm done waiting for their support to get back to me in this matter, but given some of the other reviews I see here, I don't see myself getting a character transfer or another ticket. Not unless I pay them. And mind you, this isn't a free to play game... not at all. \n\nI like this game, I'd play it with enjoyment, I'd buy it if it weren't given to me for free... and I'd regret doing that. These developers aren't to be trusted. They treat the player base, the community they have built, like nothing and that - I will never support. \n\n[h1]Don't waste your money on this one.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1516462952, "timestamp_updated": 1516463068, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723987817764282227", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70636131": {"recommendationid": "70636131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028974236", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 130962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 847, "playtime_at_review": 114466, "last_played": 1713799684}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game had so much potential. It has a wonderful and fiercely loyal community and the developers are completely undeserving of it anymore. Throughout the production of LIF:YO (the scaled down version of the MMO) everything was fantastic. This indie dev team struggled for 2 years to get horse carts to work on an engine thats only positive feature is its price. Cudos to that conviction. \n     HOWEVER, shortly after the MMO launched for testing, it became more and more about the in game store. Through out development there have been alot of suggestions and talks about certain items and structures to flesh out the rather bare late game skills. (i.e Crowns for jewel crafting, Churches for Architecture, Fancy clothes for tailoring, ect.)\nInstead, in its current state, years later, those skills are still largely barren with architecture in particular only having 1 thing to craft, a fountain that has been in the game since YO.\n     That is not to say these items are not in game, on the contrary they are available in the in game store, available for purchase and are not tied to any skill what so ever. You can level up your skills to architecture 100 for months and here is a fountain, but fresh spawn into the game, drop $80 on decoration kits and BOOM have a church!\n     Which brings me to the prices. As I stated the church is $80 USD of decoration kits. Fancy clothes, $45 USD. A Crown to be king/queen of the noobs? $25. And these are not skins. These are things you can just spawn in anytime, as many as you want, but only you can use them. If you want skins, well your'e in luck. For just the low low price of $39 USD you can have a full set of . . . novice padded armor in 1 of 4 styles. And I do mean low price. Because that is the cheapest armor skin. if you want Royal skins, you're looking at a price tag truely fit for a king at $199 USD.\n     Now as I said, this game had alot of potential. I loved this game and the community. And I own several of these skins including royal, Ive bought decoration kits for alters, outhouses and yes, even the church twice because the first one was destroyed in game by another player. Its no surprise that when Amazons NEW WORLD announced itself 80% of the community jumped ship for that, but now that New World has changed direction alot of players are talking about returning IF the dev team changes course and starts implementing these feature into the game and not the store. Here is hoping they can see the long term potential of making money off of more players playing in lieu of the short sighted milking of the ever shrinking fans.\n     TLDR, I cannot recommend this game for any new players in its current state.\n                                             Much Love, Rinnzu Roadmaster.", "timestamp_created": 1591893095, "timestamp_updated": 1591893095, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721545636653900146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44058510": {"recommendationid": "44058510", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974347837", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 24545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23414, "last_played": 1535412452}, "language": "english", "review": "The game mechanics are completely broken, you build a castle and you dont even get to use it until it's already too late. siege warfare does not work so they force you to fight through an instance battle mechanic which puts you on a random map every time rather than your defenses! it's so laggy you can't hardly fight in them. the community is rediculously toxic. cheating is rampant and the devs comment on this is until they can get around to fixing something just goo ahead and use whatever exploits you find. stay away from this one you will only regret any time spent playing this title!", "timestamp_created": 1533958162, "timestamp_updated": 1533958162, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720640182495117188", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39492247": {"recommendationid": "39492247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122982673", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2203, "last_played": 1516477018}, "language": "english", "review": "Read the reviews.

In that time, I haven't seen any meaningful progress, especially where it counts: server lag, stability, PvP mechanics, guild vs. guild mechanics, etc.\n\nPros\nThe game does one thing other MMOs need to take note of: character specialization. Because this game implements a skill cap for crafting and a separate skill cap for combat, it allows you to spec your character to be a master of one or two things, or a generalist that can do lots of lower-tier skills decently. This means you have to collaborate and group with others. It eliminates the issue when everyone is the best or can be the best at everything.\n\nCons\n[list]\n[*]The game lags like crazy.\n[*]Login issues are constant.\n[*]Large-scale PvP is impossible.\n[*]The combat system is bad--there's hardly any player feedback for hits. Combat devolves into people using long, two-handed weapons and just horizontally swining to ensure hits.\n[*]Plate armor is the only armor worth getting because the game lags so much and player speed is barely changed when wearing it. This makes nearly all other armors and combat specializations worthless.\n[*]East coast NA gets a constant 150+ ms ping, making melee block/parry/strike real-time combat impossible.\n[*]In-game UI is clunky and makes it hard to interact with the world and others.\n[*]Devs tend to be unhelpful even when you lose 4+ hours of work due to a direct in-game bug.\n[*]Premium skins look terrible and cost way too much compared to other MMO premium stores.\n[*]While the game claims to be one, large server with 10,000 capacity, it is actually just a bunch of smaller servers with 200-person capacities linked together.\n[*]Crossing from one grid on the world map to the other almost always disconnects you and forces you to restart the game. Imagine doing that every time you loaded into a dungeon in WoW.\n[*]Siege and instance-based combat with other guilds is a nightmare. Signing up for them is buggy and it often results in one side having significantly more players than the other.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, this game's small successes aren't worth the price tag, time, or energy in its current state.

There's a incredible feeling from tending to the ground, shaping the ground, mining stone and timbers to make walls and a home and eventually making a castle who's scale is impressive to say the least, crafting weapons and armor, and fighting your enemies. \n\nSo let me begin to say the game is fun to play but not if you play solo. Most people who are \"solo\" get recruited in by nearby clans who actively have recruitment groups going around. This is because of the first issue I have with this game. \n\nThis game is insufferably grindy, which makes sense for a MMO title, but at the same time, it makes this game literally impossible to play effectively if you play solo. You WILL get raided and your stuff WILL get destroyed, or it will degrade and destroy itself over time. Playing with a guild is the only way, and even then, you will be sinking copious hours into the game doing repetitive manual labor for a clan just so that they can keep walls repaired and whatnot. Logistics becomes insane and the game's endless, eternal grind leaves much to be desired. \n\nOne session with the guild, we dug and formed dirt, for 4 hours, to level out an appropriate area to lay down walls for the castle. 4 hours of work, to set the foundation. By the time I went to bed that evening, we hadn't even begun on the walls. The game is just beyond me as far as how insanely grindy it is. It is so grindy that at the time I was playing it, the game's grind actively encouraged people to set up an autoclicker and leave the game running while they were at work, but that leads to my second issue with the game. \n\nSkills. Everything is locked behind skills, and some of the skills don't even make sense. The grind to get these skills is done through training which is either done by practicing with another person (wouldn't recommend as you end up killing each other) or by whacking a dummy target. You will whack dummy targets for hours and hours to level up skills that ultimately only let you actually use weapons and armor that you want. The overall usefulness of this is literally to just make you grind for hours to use a sword you like, or half-decent armor.\n\nThe combat controls are ass. It's very clear that the overall design for combat was meant to be similar to Mount and Blade, third or fist person melee combat based around four directions for strikes, up, down, left right. However the blocking mechanism in the game is entirely timing based, which is essentially impossible to use given the game's servers have crippling lag issues, so it's actually more likely for you to dodge an enemy attack from lag than from using a shield. The hit detection and damage systems is also bugged to hell and back in this game, and very little has changed. \n\nThis leads me to bugs, bugs everywhere. Sadly, this game has barely improved in that, and doesn't look like it's going to improve significantly anytime soon. It hurts me to say this because the concept of the game I actually love, but the game's grindy insane requirements for time I simply don't have the time and patience to give. \n\nAs most people can't sit and play games for 12 hours straight every day just to help maintain buildings, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

Only one island left - PvP, are within the ever-green zones where the player can attack.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis game is not for occasional players, it\u2019s not for those who want to have everything immediately.\n\nI am not going to list what\u2019s in the game or what is missing in the game. I'm just going to tell you about those game reviews.\n\nPRICE:  Game is free. You DO NOT pay monthly. You only pay once per character (9,89\u20ac), when You want to transfer character to advanced server. I will describe it during my review.\n\nThis is feudal time simulation - SIMULATION - not just a game.\n\nYou can try the free game and learn mechanics of game on the newbie island (for free). You can try all the game mechanics (quests given by NPCs, free building, hunting, bathing in the lake \u2026) there.\n\nTo play and enter PvP or PvE server games, you need to have 9,89\u20ac in your Steam Wallet. The game is still in the BETA, so one character is enough for you.\n\nFor those 9,89\u20ac, you can buy a ferry ticket to another island: Godenland-PvP, or Epleland-PvE. From Epleland you can go to Godenland (for free, no additional payment), but not the opposite way \u2013 it\u2019s impossible. When you move from Epleland to Godenland you lose a few skill points, so you have to think about where to go.\n\nIf You don\u2019t want to be attacked by other players, you have to play on PvE server.\n\nIn any way, you need to be in a guild. If You will not be in a guild in PvP server \u2013 someone will kill you.\n\nIf you will not be in guild in PvE, everything will take long time (except 2 professions, in which You are good). In guild You lose some freedom. You must build for the guild not for yourself.\n\nYou have to decide in which professions you want to be good (You can have 2).  It can be changed anytime, but if the archer-defender changes to a knight attacker it takes a long time. If you do not want to fight at all, you will learn to farm or hunt, there are many options, everything can be changed but it takes a long time.\n\nYou get skill points even when you are OFFLINE. If you are offline you are not on island - so it's not like ARK where you character stays in the game.\n\nSo about choosing and navigating to the server:\n\nIf you just want to touch the game, try newbie server \u2013 it\u2019s free;\n\nThere is a ferryman who need pay to get you to another island (You click in the game, and you will be redirected to steam store);\n\nRight in the game, you can buy coins (10,000) - which is the 9.89\u20ac. This will give you a single character transfer without any bonuses. (You can upgrade only one skill at a time, bonus \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 adds more options);\n\nThis is probably all basics. Do not be disgusted with bad reviews and try the game. You only need 35,3  GB of HDD. This game is long term simulator, not a 100-hour affair.

Ever wanted a horse that took 10+ crossbow bolts to kill? A horse that can withstand 10+ hits from a spear, poleaxe and ride on while the lancer needs to score two on the ANTI-CAV to kill it. Did I mention the player on the horse takes littel to no dmg, unless from arrows as its nearlly impossible to hit him from the ground. Did I mention their are bugs to heal your horse and when it finally dies you can spawn another one you been riding around with in your pocket. Balanced.... Everything was a really good until they decided to make horses spawn about 10 per day for a stable and have the forsite to not limit the horses per stable, instead we can store them in a cart... You heard right in a CART a horse goes in STORAGE, not one... Noooo I can fit 15+ horses in a CART and carry three on my person running around LOL. They claimed no magic... I think the best part was a horse hitting a bear trap and the rider putting it in his pocket and respawning it out of the trap.... Nothing ANTI-CAV works, If you played mount and blade your lance never breaks either, you just lance everything forever, moving faster, hitting harder and having more HP shields (horses) than anyone else lol. I hope they sell this game before they ruin the whole concept and people avoid the sandbox pvp, building games due to REALLY shit development that didnt even try to make a game. The only realism is the work, crafting and base building which is a second job and stresses most guilds into a fighting itself. They also created a map it takes hours to find anyone on with population that even at launch couldnt support or cover it... I still play YOUR OWN, you can somtimes find someone willing to fight on the ground and experience a truly one of a kind melee system.... They should of built on that and added a PVE element that gives players something to do other than builds bases and grief other players. Little to late, with 80 people left on the MMO buyan server. \n\nBest part they just destroyed all the players who were taken a break cities.....

It throws you to the wolves with no idea how to play but thats easily addressed and once the learning curve is handled you can find thousands of hours in enjoyment. Its the community or lack of a community rather that is holding this game back I like so many left when the game started to drag on in development and the direction wasnt clear. The grindy nature has mostly been addressed but the devs to listen to their community and a developer that is wiling to give the player base what they want always have the potential to bring a game back from the dead. Hopefully they'll listen to the advice below. And bring a great game back together.\n\nNeeded additions:\n\n- A blend between the old Active XP system and the new Passive XP allow the same passive growth as well as actively grinding out a skill while doing actions related to a skill set to raise.\n\n- A Consolidated map. With an average player base of aprox 500 concurrent players the map is so large that i can search for hours and not even see a single kingdom let alone one with people on.\n\n- An incentive for players to fight. Currently no real reason other than their own entertainment. Would be nice if there was strategic regions that people could fight to claim that only one kingdom exploit creating clusters of players around those resources and forcing both cooperation and conflict between players.\n\nRecommended Additions:\n\n-NPC armies, With the absence of a strong player base, combat is all but impossible to find outside of Arenas. The ability to either raise people similar to animals or to purchase, enslave etc. and form a unit that will follow the players orders will allow a single player on each side to fight battles larger than the game seen at its peak. For example imagine I accumulated 30 Humans of military age. Forged 30 suits of armor 30 weapons and trained these 30 people either passively or by knocking them over the head with a training sword a few times. I could then form these into a unit that will maintain a shield wall or cavalry wedge or archery line etc. and use these to create large battles maybe only 10-20 people attached to a single player it could make all the difference. This resource will be expensive and losing men will be costly since equipment training and a resource that takes time to mature is expended. But will make battles more immersive and strategic If I could even train a handful of archers and put them in my towers or a few spearmen at my gates it would make all the difference.\n\n-More NPCs in the way u have wild animals or Gnolls to have people in the wild like bandits that will attack the player.\n\nQuality of Life Additions:\n\n-Since the game lacks the actual player base it once had a way to make a lonely world seem atmospheric is NPCs. Whether they're wandering about cities standing at crafting stations stacking bricks near a warehouse fishing by a river arguing outside of a market or walking the roads players built.

Not even a pop up window to say, hey, be careful about taking damage since you cannot speed up healing. You just have to wait several hours to regenerate or find someone that's invested weeks solely into healing skills. You can't even repair basic trash gear easily.

Literally, hours of auto running and hoping a wolf or archer doesn't kill you on the way or you have to start all the way where you spawned.
