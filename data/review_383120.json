I said \"Wow, somebody made my game??\". I played it in its first earliest access before steam. I abandoned development of my game, because this was literally It. And it was glorious! I played like 1000 hours during the past 10 years. There was and still is nothing like it. I built a spaceship the size of a planet. It had 10 other Capital Sized ships which i also built docked inside its massive hangar doors and around its exterior hull. Full amenities inside for all crafting. It was a mobile world. It took me so long, it was awesome. I transferred my save to 4 new computers over the years. To me, this is the best crafting/survival game on the market, even still. There is SO MUCH you can build. You can do whatever you want, limited only by your imagination. And I kept waiting for the game ruining bugs to get fixed. And I've waited nearly 10 years. There are several severe bugs which ruin this masterpiece. The AI only fires directly at your Core Blocks, regardless of shape or size of your ship or bases. It's indescribably bad design on that part. The Clipping is another HUGE problem. Any moving vehicle will clip. You will fall through the hull of your ship if its moving unless you are seated. Now paid DLC? Nonsense dudes! You need to partner with a team that knows how to code decent FPS mechanics and ballistics, and fix the (SIMPLE) issues your players have been telling you about for 10 years. You went from being Legendary to Lame, and it's embarrassing. I had to uninstall and I'm sick about it. Fix this and it becomes one of THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE! Nobody cares about your stupid new DLC, Reforged Eden already did a better job than you on that. Pay the Reforged Eden team to finish your game for you properly please.

They kept adding new graphical features update after update, instead of adding more content. \n\nThey added better textures before they added same size grid-to-grid docking. They still haven't added the ability for an entity to move around on a moving grid, one of the top 5 customer requests since alpha 15. Animations have only marginally been improved. AI functionality hasn't been improved, their aiming accuracy was adjusted so that they miss sometimes instead of perfect aim.\n\nI told my friends, 100%, the reason they were so laser-focused on graphics, world generation details, and graphical system additions was to plump the game up for a sale to someone.

It has many strengths, and a few weaknesses. I reminisce about the old days of Alpha 6 when I first started playing. Back then things were straight forward...less complicated. POIs didn't have shields, and you didn't either. For better or worse, Shields were introduced, first to players, then immediately after to POIs. I'm not sure if this was a net \"win\" or not.\n\nMass/Volume and CPU became a thing...A thing I still hate, and I've had ample time to get used to it. Luckily it can be turned off in single player, and Servers can choose to include or dismiss it. I struggled to enjoy and embrace it. I failed. It's very limiting and I like to build *Grand* in a way no other game I've found really has the ability to do. CPU kills that, and mass/volume ensure that your substandard base/craft will be all the harder to build. Luckily there are servers that do actually leave those options ticked off.\n\nAnother unwelcome change, was to outdoor spawns..speaking specifically of faction based ground wondering troops...mostly around Zirax strongholds, but also there are some other random others thrown in.  This increases the frustration level of approaching a POI, which is generally also shooting at you with big whopping turrets. 100% frustration, 0% fun. This change has absolutely no redeeming qualities.\n\nWe *still* (after years, and years) can't stand up in a moving vessel, disconnects still leave you in one sector and your ship in another..and there are several other really stifling bugs.\n\nIt sounds like I'm really ripping Empyrion...but actually, I am not. \n\nThe things I've listed here are the worst bits. Basically everything else about the game is great. \n\nNowhere else can you build like you can in Empyrion. With the proper settings you can build extravagant crazy things and then massacre your enemies, or occasionally get massacred. \n\nThere are tons of great mods..and mods often make the game. There are blueprints in the workshop that are true works of art, for those of us not terribly adept and stacking one block on another.\n\nAll in all, I still love the game, even for it's faults and flaws. I hope that someday they'll iron out some of the glaring bugs, but with a little knowledge and preparation you can really negate or mitigate most of them.

Lmao!\nYes, I played it a lot in multiplayer, and used it as a rather relaxing, mind-clearing pastime in single player... and you probably should approach a review from someone with 1200 hours as: \"Opinions on something he likely has extensive knowledge on\" rather than \"Why you play so long if you dislike? lol!\"\n\nWith that out of the way: I cannot recommend this game for three very specific reasons:\n\nFirst, the gameplay is, let's be honest, absolute garbage. It hasn't gotten better during the alpha, and after the alpha magically became a final release to eventually begin pumping out useless DLCs (a la Space Engineers...) it got even worse due to the core mechanics never improving one bit as the development progressed. If you want a good game, this ain't it. It's (yes, brace yourself, I'm gonna say the thing) *objectively* a badly designed game, clunky, with horrible mechanics and poorly thought-out and disgustingly ugly UI, not to mention insane system requirements for a game that looks like it came out in 2005.\n\nDo you want to walk on your moving ship or board enemy ships and capture them naturally? Nope, you can't. \nDo you expect decent hitboxes both in space and on land? Denied. \nDecent (or even working) enemy AI? Hah, in your dreams. Everything is, forgive me the use of the word, retarded.\nEngaging, fun flight model? No, everything moves awkwardly and in the same exact way, with just different speed caps.\nGood camera? Ugh, no. It will freak and spazz out every 2.1 seconds.\nGood controls? Nope, unintuitive and clunky.\nEngaging exploration? Different colors, same things in each and every system, with player-made ships put in the game with no thought.\nInteresting and fun combat? No, DOOM, Descent, Freespace, X-Wing vs Tie Fighter and others literally did it better in the nineties.\nDo you want an interesting campaign, cool story and lore? Nope, it's all a mess... with broken quests, awful dialogues and childish writing.\n\nSecond, the dev team has clearly shown they are moving in the wrong direction... and at a glacial pace. Instead of focusing on having solid gameplay that isn't completely broken (the game has constant issues with teleporting assets and a plethora of various others rage-inducing bugs) they just added more stuff... and I'm not talking about something that changes the game in a significant way, but just... fluff. New blocks. New textures (which would have still been ugly, even if the game was from 2005.) But the gameplay loop is ALWAYS the same:\n\n-Gather resources with your clunky tools.\n-Build a vessel, then a base.\n-Attack a POI and loot or scavenge it (Point of Interest, usually defended by stupid AI.)\n-Build a capital vessel.\n-Maybe attack other capital vessels. (Which are still a mess to loot, and the jankiest experience you could ever find in a post-2000 game.)\n\nThere. You reached the end of your journey. Now keep looting POIs and \"explore.\" Which is Empyrion's way of saying: \"Mindlessly kill stupid AI, farm POIs for the sake of having more resources or tackle braindead capital vessels who just mindlessly turn to face you while you kill them, and can only defend themselves due to having a lot of turrets. Empyrion is the kind of game that tells you: \"Make your own fun.\" Game, I'm here to have fun, you should be the one providing it. I played it 1200 hours just because I don't have anything else to do - don't be like me. Invest your time in something that actually respects your time and your investment, instead of taking you for a ride.\n\nAnd then there's the attitude of the developer and their choices, the third reason I can't recommend this to anyone. Eleon is a small developer, sure... but that's not an excuse. Not anymore. Not with Valheim, Palworld, Project Zomboid and all those other major titles that cost as much (or less) than Empyrion and are thoroughly enjoyable, with a good gameplay loop and much more content being available on Steam.\nThis is showcased even better in regard to the recent release of a \"DLC\" for Empyrion called: \"Dark Faction\" which I would say is a fitting name because that's exactly the kind of thing that happened to Empyrion as a product, it joined up with a dark faction (Tencent and Funcom.) They could have added new major mechanics, like walking on a moving spaceship... nope, never going to happen. Better AI... nope. Just a scenario with endless grinding and more reskinned monsters plagued with the same idiotic AI... but they added MELEE combat. Which literally no one has ever wanted or requested. And they of course paywalled the new weapons and mechanics (as bad as they are) due to it being a paid DLC for a game that looks, plays and feels like a beta... or an alpha, even.\n\nSo, just don't buy this if you want to support developers who value your time. Don't support devs who put a game out of alpha and Early Access then blatantly keep referring to patches as \"Experimental.\" Play Valheim. Play Palworld. Hell, play Minecraft. Just think twice about giving your hard-earned money to people who don't know what the hell they're doing.

To the developers credit, they persevered after a failed Kickstarter campaign and did produce a game that does have some great bits in premise, but what should have been placeholder middleware coding, etc. became the foundation of the game. Because of this there's a lot of bugs, poorly designed mechanics, etc. that simply can only be tweaked so much and never truly fixed or improved without a complete from scratch redo. It's become more workaround the bugs / limitations than actually fixing them while they have spent years constantly redoing the starter and tutorials which are still fraught with problems, meanwhile neglected finishing the main storyline that hasn't seen any new additions in approximately 3 years. Console commands and manually skipping a mission / part of a mission due to bugs is still a common occurrence. Despite them saying this game is out of \"Early Access\" for years now, it still very much plays and acts like an early early access game that hasn't been in development for long, not the having been in development for almost 10 years that it is. \n\nThe only saving grace is that there isn't another game that has everything that Empyrion does (despite its bugs / issues) and there is an active modding community that makes some great custom scenarios for when you get tired of playing a random start scenario that skips out on the story and a large chunk of the issues. However, the whole random start sandbox part just becomes build ship, fly to planet you like, build a base, build a larger ship, rinse and repeat until you've built something that can destroy anything you come across while working around weird limitations/restrictions choices the devs have made and still dealing with an infuriating amount of bug that still come up, some ever from the very start of development...again because it's middleware and there's only so much you can do with it.\n\nEstimates are the game has sold somewhere between 900k-1.3 million copies, there's no reason why they couldn't have expanded the team with more experienced developers capable of coding, etc. and grew this into a top tier quality game.\n\nThere is little to no communication with the community outside of their little protective bubble and outside of that bubble they have no issues with silencing any negative criticism and constructive feedback is often looked at as being hostile / their response is this is how we want it aka it's our way or the highway.\n\nDespite all of the unfinished / issues with the game they have decided to release their first paid DLC that amounts to being a custom scenario with it's own story (instead of finishing the main storyline) but it also adds a melee mechanic, but only for the dlc while that is missing from the base game.", "timestamp_created": 1706760885, "timestamp_updated": 1706760885, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578481078147888184", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158680612": {"recommendationid": "158680612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011294676", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 14619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14619, "last_played": 1708304446}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to enjoy playing this game for the crafting and base/ship building.

It's disgusting and buggy, with gameplay that revolves around combat when the combat is 0-recoil weapons shooting at NPCs that get stuck inside walls (and sometimes shoot through them as a result)\n\nThe only good thing about the game is shipbuilding and base building, where you basically ignore the terrible quests and combat system and just make something cool to fly around in for a while.  Of course, once you've built a ship, the only thing to do with it is take it on quests and hope the quests don't require you to get out on foot instead of using your fancy new ship (most of them do)\n\nThat said, the base/ship building *is* one of the best in the genre, and you can make some really cool stuff.  But there's nothing to do with it, unless you want to take it into PVP - and then by design, you can't have a cool ship, it needs to be an optimized death cube.\n\nAs an example of the game's jank, you can't swim.

It is so broken and hostile toward the player that it's hard to put into words. I bought this game when it first came out maybe 7 years ago but could only play it for a few hours because it was one of the few games that made me extremely motion sick. I chalked this up to the ~75ms delay between mouse movement and movement registering on the screen. I decided to try it again, and that delay is still there but I found as long as I'm not in tight spaces like mining underground I can deal with it.\n\nMore than half of your playtime will be alt-tabbing into Google to try to figure out how to do something. The game is just a big learning curve and offers extremely little help. For example, the game provides you the beginning of a tutorial to show you have to make a basic hover vehicle. It has you make a \"HV Frame A\" and then says it will continue the tutorial once you've placed it down. It doesn't. An hour of Googling later I have this cute little frame with hover engines, an RCS cube, thrusters stuck all over it and it looks like a disasterpiece. Get in the cockpit and it won't power on. It needs a core. Stick a core on and it still won't go. I scoured the controls for some sort of \"engine start\" button and couldn't find anything. I Googled \"how to turn on a vehicle in empyrion\" and eventually stumble on the Wiki list of controls that says to push \"Y\". Ok, fine, now it works.\n\nHere is my condensed playthrough:\n\nI take the hover vehicle and run into a town of people, who give me my first quest. I have to get this guy a list of different food that includes eggs, which as far as I can Google are rare/not available on the first planet/moon. So I build a space ship from a complete template to get over to the desert moon, where eggs exist, and come back to complete this crazy overcomplicated task for just a first mission. The second mission has me hack a console at a comm tower, which fails and seems to permanently softlock the mission. For the remainder of your playthrough, you will see details about this mission stuck in your HUD. That's it for missions.\n\nI fly back to the desert planet to explore and then a drone with a cannon destroys my cockpit after I get out. I destroy the drone, and manage to scrounge up some parts to build a new cockpit. But not before I get a radiation burn - there are some numbers on the right side of the screen that are supposed to tell you how much radiation you're suffering but that's never explained. I Google what to do and you're supposed to take a shower or take an antiradiation pill or something. So I immediately fly back to the starting moon because I think I had a pill back there. Game doesn't tell you that a radiation burn will progress to poisoning and then you die about 5 minutes after getting the initial burn if untreated. My space ship had just entered into the starting planet when I died. I chose to respawn at my last location, which is in the ship. No, it just drops me to fall toward the ground from underneath the ship, which is now stuck half a mile up.\n\nI can see my space ship up in the sky, but no way to reach it. So I head back to base and build another cheap ship so I can fly it up to the stuck ship to get it down. While that's building, I found out I don't have any pills and have to figure out how to make them. Game just says you craft them, but doesn't say how. I looked everywhere - personal constructor, portable constructor, large constructor, food processor, nowhere. Wiki says food processor, so I clicked again and figured out what's going on - you have to click a tab to get to medical products. However, when you walk up to the processor and click it, these tabs don't load the first time. You have to back out and go into the processor again. This seems to happen every time you click on the processor after it's loaded in. OK, whatever.\n\nMy new cheap ship is done so I fly it over and land on top of the stuck ship and press \"y\" to turn it off. Wait for things to settle down and get out onto the other ship... only to find that instead of having me get out near the cockpit, it just drops me back down through both ships and falling toward the ground looking up to see both vessels stuck. Alt+F4. Reload and find that, of course it saved at that exact point. Uninstalled.\n\nThis seems like a game that could be insanely fun, right up my alley, but at almost every turn it's like you're fighting the brokenness of the game to try and have this fun. I wouldn't have had my time wasted by a broken tutorial system. I wouldn't have Mission 2 stuck on my HUD for eternity because the game softlocked it. I would have made antiradiation pills if the broken UI didn't mislead me, so that I could prevent the radiation poisoning I was not informed about. I could have spawned in from \"my last location\", inside my vessel a half mile up, instead of having to waste more time getting another vessel stuck up there.\n\nAnd wait, there's DLC for this?

They have a wide variety of in game designs to get Ideas from with the ability to make blueprints of Captured ships and buildings to then Duplicate elsewhere. These blueprints are accessible in past, current and future playthroughs. \nThe ships are complicated and specific rules you need to follow to have them work, and for me a world with out rules, can not exist! But for those who dont like rules, there is creative mode and God mode. So have at it. \nThe campaigns are involved and rich in storyline. You just want more! Which unfortunately, they never actually finished the base game storyline. They left you with a doosey of a cliffhanger.\nReplayability is definitely there. But the number of bugs in the game are extensive and random to say the least. I have to save frequently so when a quit or continue error message pops up, I have a way to reload without losing hours of time played.\nSometimes quest objects do not spawn, which would usually makes it impossible to complete. But this developer put an override in the quest tracking screen to make progress possible without having to restart the playthrough if you dont save frequently or delete all previous saves for storage space.\n\nI give this game an 85%. I have not been able to stop playing it since I started.\n\nLast comment Ill make is that the Dark Faction DLC is not finished yet. Read through the reviews. The errors are crazy and their variety is almost infinite. Only main story is available, No other content is active in the game. No way to positively increase rep with anyone, no explorer tokens, No side quests. Its a one and done currently and they havn't finished the F1 PDA info yet so if you get stuck, there is no explansion or hints how to complete it. I had solar systems load with no planets, faction npc spawners load rogue units that are OP and kill you with 2 shots.

This is not a copypasta, but a real experience.\n\nAt the time of this post, I have 742 hours of gameplay. Most of that has been spent playing cooperatively with 3 close friends.\n\nWe'd start new universes on the hardest difficulty, working together to find materials and scratch out rudimentary base defenses before the drones, Zirax, and various indigenous tribes came and tried to make jewelry out of our organs. We had wild adventures in the wilderness on our hoverbikes, fighting off raptors and spiders and zombie aliens. Digging up ancient ruins. Cleansing horrible biological experiments gone wrong. Exploring strange new worlds. Seeking out new life, new civilizations. Stealing their stuff. Committing war crimes against the Zirax Empire. Don't worry, they totally deserved it.\n\nWe built elaborate underground bases. Turned mountains into fortresses. Constructed capital ships that were works of art. Space-based ship construction facilities. Giant farms with jump drives. Mining outposts on distant moons. Starfighters, cargo hoppers, unstoppable killing machines. We owned the stars. Especially the stars we took from our mortal enemies, the Zirax Empire. Freaking lizards. Die.\n\nOne of these friends was enduring frequent complications from leukemia recovery. He would mine entire asteroids by himself due to being constantly awake from steroids. He loved to call it roid rage, and that joke never got old.\n\nA few months ago, his body finally gave in. He passed away peacefully, surrounded by family. We wore Jedi robes to his funeral. I still have our dedicated server sitting on the box I hosted it from. I keep wanting to fire it up and continue the adventure, but you have no idea how difficult that is now.\n\nAnyway, Eleon has created something truly wonderful here. There have been bugs and development struggles over the years, but no other game like it has captured the essence of cooperative gameplay for me like this one. It has a bit of a learning curve, but once you figure out the tech tree and get proficient at slaughtering wildlife, it really opens up. Some of the blueprints in the workshop are absolute works of art. For the more creative types, you can build anything you can imagine, paint it any color you want, strap engines and weapons to it, and even put gaudy flashing signage and obnoxious blinking rave lights all over. The planets are beautiful. The sunsets/sunrises are beautiful. The galaxy is beautiful. You can leave your base behind and frolick about the galaxy, living out all your favorite space pirate fantasies. You can pretty much do anything but build a submarine (for now!) Oh, and there are dinosaurs. Lots of dinosaurs.\n\nMost importantly, you can have a great time with your friends. You never know how long that will last.

Although the game developers (Eleon Game Studios) called it \"Released\" in July 2020, it's not. Perhaps they should have had a beta test phase to avoid confusion. There are problems with pathing of NPCs. There are broken missions. The graphics are not well optimized. The various weapons may not have the expected affect. In summary, as of December 2020, Empyrion feels very much unfinished. However, if such concerns do not bother you, you can still have lots of fun playing. The game has a huge following of players and creators to help you get the most out of your experience.\n\nWho might like playing Empyrion?\nThe game is complex. Really complex. It will be hundreds of hours before you feel competant. There are no strait-forward guides (yet) to explain game mechanics. Much of what you do and build will be trial and error. However, once you have a decent understanding of how things work, you will be able to move about the game with little effort and die much less frequently. Did I mention you will die frequently? If you like a challenge and figuring things out on your own, this game might be for you.\nThe game can be grinding. You're required to harvest all of what is needed and that can be a huge amount of various materials. For this reason, I recommend playing with wieghts and volumes turned off. In my experience, it can take ten times the effort to gather resources during early game and tends not to be much fun. The purists out there will call me crazy, but I perfer my games to be enjoyable.\n\nI plan to camp out on my starter world and build an empire uncontested!\n\nWell good luck with that, but the game will force you to fight for your place in the galaxy. As soon as you build a base, which you will need to build better things, you start to be attacked by the local Zirax protagonists. Ultimately, you need to defend yourself with bigger and better weapons than your opponents. When you partake in various missions you will quickly find your success dependant on how well armed you are.\n\nI'm creative and I'm going to build a beautiful super ship capable of dominating all around me.\n\nGood for you. Go for it. When you're done put it on the Workshop for all to enjoy. However, I found the game does not really work that way. Most likely, you will start with a supplied starter ship and modify it to perform the next task. Your creations will follow function more than form. Not that you can't have both, but it will probably be late game before you can introduce some nice esthetics to your designs. You can spawn in already created ships from the Workshop, but generally speaking they tend to look better than they perform. Personally, I encourage the player to build for themselves and get to know how the individual parts function together. Then, maybe, you can spawn in a cool looking ship and modify it to your needs.\n\nI played Empyrion Galatic Survivor and aced it! What possible challenge is left to me.\n\nCongratulaions! You've just graduated from pre-shool. Now go to the Workshop and subsribe to the mod called Reforged Eden. Everything is ten times harder. The weapons are more effective, as are your opponents. There is more of everything, except what you need, so it takes much longer to become dominant. Rare items are much more rare. So be prepared to have to discover what is needed. However, the payoff is huge with more advanced tech to help to bend the galaxy to your will. Just be aware, it takes huge amounts of experience points to unlock the best tech. After 500 plus hours of Reforged Eden I am still finding new things to explore and conquer. \n\nConclusions\n\nAlthough I would not consider Empyrion Galactic Survival a finished product, this game is well worth playing. It is by far the most value I have had in video game. It can be a little boring at times but adjust your gameplay accordingly. My perferred style is fighting and looting to get new resources. However, you could easily progress by exploring and harvesting. Once the developers have a completed product, I fully expect the modders out there to bring endless senarios for you to enjoy. Overall I give Empyrion Galactic Survial a 8 out of 10 with the possibility of 10 of 10 when fully completed.\n\nHopefully, you found this informative, and I look forward to seeing you in-game someday.\n\nEdit:\nAs I have nearly completed both vanilla and Reforged Eden 1.5 there some thoughts that need expressing about this latest release.\nFirst thing is WOW! Reforged Eden has had a wonderful visual upgrade. It really has been a joy to play.\nHaving said that there are still some frustration with some things:\n\nSome missions and POIs are way too hard for single player mostly in Reforged Eden, and makes me wonder if there can't be some way to change the spawning behaviour if there is one one player.\n\nYou still need to enter \"God Mode\" sometimes to get out of trouble. Like falling off of your ship or POI (point of Interest) while far of the ground. There needs to be a teleporter or respawn to easily put you back in your ship instead of waiting for it to run out fuel and fall to the ground. Generally speaking you should never have to resort to God Mode in the game.\n\nEleon - You NEED to start fixing long time problems rather than adding cool posters. While adding content is nice, bugs interrupt good game play and significantly detract from an otherwise excellent experience. Please spend some time listening to your community and addressing some issues like the inability to crouch.\n\nThere. I said what I needed. I'm off to Decayed Space to get me some Progenitor Technology.\n", "timestamp_created": 1607720081, "timestamp_updated": 1629834383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 325, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.954478204250335693", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17606917": {"recommendationid": "17606917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027436446", "num_games_owned": 818, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 28744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3000, "last_played": 1646472333}, "language": "english", "review": "SMALL UPDATE Jan 2016 - Check comments for details!\n\n[ SUMMARY ] :\nSpace Engineers meets some StarMade and the exploration aspects of Shores of Hazeron.\nI DON'T RECOMMEND buying this game right now, unless you're a HARDCORE FAN of sandbox and space games. I really mean that. Don't say you weren't warned.\nI DO RECOMMEND watchlisting or following it if you like sandbox games in general. \nIf you want more details, read further to understand.\n\n[ BACKGROUND AND DISCLAMERS ]:\n- Me and Empyrion: \nI got to know Empyrion through Scott Manley's Youtube Channel 2 weeks before the Steam Early Access Release, and decided that I would most definitely give it a go.\nI went through ~97% of the game - I got all the resources I need and explored (probably) everything, but didn't build a Capital Ship yet.\n\n- The Team: \nEmpyrion is made by 3 indie devs. They pushed through a failed kickstarter, and here is the (early) result. They seem nice, and determined.\n\n- This Review:\nI'll first describe the game with as little personal notes as possible, and in the end I'll give my take on whatever I find necessary. This way, I save both your time and mine! :)\n\n[ REVIEW ] :\n\n> INTRODUCTION:\nYour capital ship crashes on an alien planet. Left with a escape pod, you must gather resources and craft your way back to space.\nCrafting, mining, building, hunting, surviving, running for your life when things go wrong. You'd like that, wouldn't you?\nEmpyrion provides a very immersive and fresh experience for those who like survival and sandbox games.\n\n> GAME FEATURES:\n\nSURVIVING is your first priority and your constant goal in Empyrion. You must find Water to generate Oxygen, hunt, scavange or forage for food, and find Promethium Ore to make Fuel to power all your operations!\n\nMINING is crucial. You'll need to find resource deposits and strike the earth in order to build your base, vehicles and personal items. Mining is done by equipping your drill and digging - vehicles don't mine yet.\n\nCRAFTING and BUILDING is a main part of the game. Much like Space Engineers, every final item is comprised of components which you must craft first. Removing a block will return its components, so remember to bring your Removal Tool to rip those expensive components from ships and bases you find in your expeditions!\nBuilding your base is straightforward, and can end up looking pretty nice.\n\nVEHICLES are critical for survival, exploration and progress. You can build a hovering Ground Vehicle, Small Vessels for interplanetary and atmospheric flights (as well as small-scale combat and raids), or Capital Vessels for (not yet implemented) intergalatic travel and serious combat operations.\n\nCOMBAT can happen on ground or in space. You can also be inside a ship or on foot, which makes things great: what if you leave your ship, but get flanked or surprised by the enemy?\nYou can also hunt wildlife for food and resources. \n\nThe EXPLORATION vibe is definitely there. Even on initial release, you can't help but wonder what awaits you when you look at the night sky - or when seeing a weird building from a distance when you're still a survivor with just a escape pod. Maybe you could cannibalize or take over whatever that thing is, and turn it against your enemies (or against the unsuspecting wildlife)?\nIt's something I was looking forward in a survival sandbox space game for ages.\n\n> GAME ASPECTS:\n\nGRAPHICS: Very good for an indie game, but could definitely look better. Yet, I wasn't bothered by it.\n\nSOUND:  Decent, but needs mastering, attention and variety - which are probably planned.\n\nINTERFACE: Simple and straightforward, if you have played any similar games you'll be ready to go in minutes. The lack of a tutorial or proper in-game instructions WILL make things harder and more tiresome for non-hardcore fans. Be ready.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Survive, mine, craft, build, fly. The gameplay and progression already feels nice, and the game doesn't take you by the hand. You're free to do whatever, whenever, however you decide.\n\nBUGS AND ISSUES: There was a big number of release issues and bugs, some people even had their savegames corrupted or fallen out of the world. I didn't experience anything gamebreaking like that, but there's a lot of minor things that can get on the way of your fun. Still, it feels more polished than many Early Access titles I've played.\n\n> PERSONAL NOTES:\n\n= Positive:\n- Regarding GAMEPLAY: Even though story and quests/missions are planned, I love how YOU choose where to go. \nThere's an obvious way to go about things (\"now I need X ore that's only available on Y planet in order to build Z item\"), but you can ignore that and end up getting end-game gear by your own means and creativity. I REALLY hope this doesn't change with development.\n\n- Random, non-scripted \"events\": Sometimes, circumstance might surprise you. You might be distracted and hear a weird noise, and a squad of drones are coming for you..and you forgot to craft a better gun and more ammo. This sort of stuff is what could potentially make Empyrion the best space sandbox out there, but it only happened one time..and I was probably lucky.\n\n-  Currently, I believe food and oxygen requirement is well balanced: you won't have to run every 5 minutes back to base, but if you neglect your needs you might find yourself in deep trouble. Which is always fun.\n\n- The game has a good selection (for an Alpha) of weapons. Choices for personal weapons include Assault Rifle, Sniper, Rocket Launcher and Laser Rifle, and ships have both (automatic/manual) Turrets and fixed weapons like the Gatling Gun, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Cannon or Rail Gun.\n\n= Negative:\n- The Unknown: There's a LOT of work to be done before it makes sense to buy and play this game. How commited is the team? What is the roadmap and milestones? Will the annoying stuff ever get fixed? There's a lot of questions like these, which are critical for EA titles to answer first.\n\n- Annoying bugs/half-made features: Crafting takes a LOT (and I mean, A LOT) of time and requires you to manually craft EVERY SINGLE COMPONENT. Removing blocks take AGES. Mouse-wheel doesn't work. Flight model feels bad. And so on, and so forth. This makes playing the game rather painfully after the first hour or so. Is player convenience a priority?\n\n- Space-Flight and Space-Combat must be redone from scratch. Both as an astrounaut or in a Small Ship, space-flight is terrible and space combat is insanely bad. Getting near an enemy in space will break your controls and make you lag and wonder what happened.\n\n- Community, Hype and Fanboying: This kills games. I've seen criticism be bashed simply due to hype or 'fandom'. There's a real HUGE amount of things to be done and fixed, and dodging/dismissing feedback and criticism is not the way to go. I didn't see much developer interaction (on Steam forums), and I hope people get more of it.\n\n> CONCLUSION:\nThe core concept and gameplay from this Early Access title definitely deserves to be noted and followed, but it doesn't make sense to buy it yet - unless you're really, REALLY into it.\nPeople who played the very first moments (before building an actual base, vehicles, and getting to space) loved it - and I did too. But after these ~2 first hours, the current state of the game presents itself.\n\nThere's A LOT of work to be done in Empyrion, more than people seem think or talk about. There's many critical issues to be fixed or developed, and it's still unknown wether the ACTUAL content (planned storyline and progression) will make any sense. There's no human/alien 'sentient' NPCs or any trace of a story/quest system, and the space part of the game is really terrible and not developed at all. This is why I can't recommend you to jump head-first into it.\n\nTherefore, put your expectations in line, take a deep breath, and make your choice.\nThanks for reading! :)", "timestamp_created": 1439942700, "timestamp_updated": 1451762037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 508, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.951092898845672607", "comment_count": 44, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42418789": {"recommendationid": "42418789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068371685", "num_games_owned": 1373, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 15289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4697, "last_played": 1702478884}, "language": "english", "review": "I actually had this really long lengthy review but then deleted it. You only need to know a couple of things.  \n\nIt is an incredible premise for a game with lots of potential and the devs are still working hard on creating that. \n\nYour goal is to build, whether it be a super awesome extreme fortress on land or the same in space and explore to build more things. If you don't want to build then go to the workshop and get the prefabs. Then your goal is to mine, so that you can build. \n\nYou will always be hungry. Sure, go hunt for meat and when you're ready to eat it you'll discover that it has spoiled and you will probably die.  \n\nA spider will bite you and you will be poisoned and probably die. \nA worm will bite you and you will get a parasite and die. \nA scorpion will sting you and will die.\nA raptor will give you an open wound and you will die. \nWhen you go back to get your bag with all of the stuff that you desperately need to survive - whatever killed you is corpse camping so you will die, and over and over in an endless loop until you say screw it and forget the bag. \n\nYou will spend hours building the simplest of bases and be proud of what you did. Then you go off to explore only to come back to rubble as drones have flown in and destroyed everything and without the stuff in your bag like medicine, you will die. \n\nYou manage to get the resources to build a space ship! You get in and load it up with all of your goodies so you don't die and take off to the moon! No atmosphere means no baddies, so you get on your bike to go and scout for rare resources and find a wreckage! So you start taking that apart because awesome heated steel is great for armor. You get a full inven and head back to your ship, only to find that drones have attacked it and everything that was in your cargo holds is gone, your fuel tank was destroyed, your oxygen producer is gone and your suit level is slowly going down. Your \"Survival Constructor\" only makes a couple of things like steak and ammo, but to build blocks to fix your ship you'll need the next level up...which requires a base to build one. So you go to make a core only to find that you need 5 copper - of which the moon you landed on does not possess. You stand there in shock of wondering what you're going to do. Then the cold sets in and you see frost start to form on the outside of your helmet. \n\n....and then you die\n\nBut I can't stop thinking about it. I know I can persevere, I can do this. I've played countless hours of 7 days, the Forest, I got this. I know what I need to do. \n\nSo you start over, completely fresh. \n\nThis is literally just PVE. Have not ventured into PVP areas yet. I keep telling myself like any other survival game, that the hardest part is the first days. But there was a point where I was 45 hours in with a base on one planet and a ship with warp and settled down on a snow planet to build an outpost and was then slaughtered by a patrol ship equipped with around 30 plasma cannons that could literally snipe me from 500m away. I had a cannon turret....then it CC'd me for an hour before I gave up and left everything there....to go back to my home base that was attacked by drones. \n\nBut I'll keep playing, for some reason I find it enjoyable. I want to have a massive floating fortress in a planets orbit and jump in scout vessel and drop orbit to build an outpost and put my mark on it. \n\n....but I'll probably die \n", "timestamp_created": 1527832264, "timestamp_updated": 1527832264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 328, "votes_funny": 312, "weighted_vote_score": "0.94974362850189209", "comment_count": 29, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24541513": {"recommendationid": "24541513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019139528", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 494977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1416, "playtime_at_review": 155326, "last_played": 1713793190}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought Empyrion on sale and didn't really know what to expect from an early access Alpha game. I find myself really enjoying the game and even if development stopped tomorrow I figure I've more than got value for my money. It plays very well for an Alpha. In over 200 hours gameplay I've only had one crash and the game recorded and sent a report to the devs. The next day I had an email asking for more info - good dev response. Updates are coming through regularly and add more content and fix some of the bugs.\nIt's a survival game. The back story is that in the near future humanity has kind of ruined good old Earth. The melted Antarctic ice cap revealed a crashed Alien ship. Using tech from the ship Earth poured all its resources into building several colony ships and sent them out to find Empyrion - a paradise shown on the incomplete alien starmaps. You are the captain of one of these ships. A hyperdrive malfunction throws the ship off course and you crash into the planet you choose at the start of the game.You, the sole survivor, land on the planet in a survival pod with limited supplies. You have to gather resources and establish yourself on the planet. One objective would be to return to space and proceed with your original mission to find a new home for mankind. You could also just chill on the planet until you run out of resouces - it's all up to you, the game is open and doesn't force choices on you. Aliens will attack you on sight and you can raid their bases for resources and equipment. Some of the wild life is hostile, some is not. A good tutorial guides you through building your first base and your first vessel.\nI really enjoy Empyrion's open design environment - I think that is what makes the game. Although there are a few basic blueprints, you have to design and build your own bases and ships.  I find the testing and improving of my designs to be a lot of fun and very engaging gameplay. Building is intuitive once you get used to the block system Empyrion uses for construction. You can make a blueprint of your designs and use it to build a duplicate. I also believe blueprints can be shared amongst players although I have not done this.\nA good example of Empyrion game play is mining. You need a lot of resources to build stuff, and aside from common metals like iron, cobalt, copper, silicon, gold, etc., Empyrion has included some exotic \"alien\" metals that you have to go off-planet to find. Unlike some games, extracting the ore is not as simple as walking up to an ore body, clicking it, and walking off with your bags full. In Empyrion first you have to find the ore which involves physically coming within 500 metres of the ore body, so be prepared to travel a possibly hostile planet. Then you have to tunnel into and excavate 3D ore bodies and by the time you are done you will have a really DEEP hole in the ground. How you approach this can determine whether you return to base with a load of ore or starve to death at the bottom of an empty mine, having expended all your drill fuel and being unable to return to the surface. Oh yes, you can starve to death in Empyrion. You can also suffocate in space if your oxygen runs out. You can die if you fall too far.  Raptors will eat you. Aliens will shoot you. Plants will poison you. It is a survival game after all. It's not all danger though. You can kick back on the gun deck of your base, enjoying a veggie burger and space fries while watching the rising sun blaze a river of gold across the lake. Great sunrises and sunsets in this game!\nIn its current state you can travel to several planets, moons, and asteroids within the system. I don't know what the devs have planned for the game, but the warp drive panel and maps have grayed-out slots for galactic travel.\nThere is lots of content in the game that is not yet explained in the tutorial. Even after 200 hours, I'm still finding cool stuff by accident. I've often thought \"I wish there was an easier way of doing this\" and then by \"fat finger accident\" found that there was an easier way. Cool game! One drawback is that this game is sucking up way too much of my time. I recommend it highly!\n\n\nUpdate: March 11, 2018\n\nIt's been a couple years and over 2000 hours of gameplay since I wrote this review, so it's time for an update. There have been lots of changes in the game since I wrote the first review; it has been an interesting ride.\n\nFirst of all, this is NOT one of the sad abandoned early access games that litter the Steam store. The devs are extremely active and very responsive to the player community. I began playing this game on Alpha 3; it is now on Alpha 7 and the devs are working on Alpha 8. Each release has progressed the game in the direction chosen by the devs but has also incorporated improvements suggested on the forums and addressed deficiencies identified by the player base. Regular updates roll out within each major release to fix bugs; the devs are very active. \n\nWhen I wrote my first review I had only played single-player mode. Since then I have only played multi-player mode. As other reviewers have noted, once you have visited all the planets and looted most of the alien POI's the SP game runs out of objectives. That's where multiplayer kicks in. The MP servers are a vibrant mix of PvP and PvE players and the ship and base designs that people come up with are a source of endless inspiration (and amusement truth be told). Hard-core PvP players utilize game bugs to design ships and bases for maximum advantage, other players set up PvE trading empires to make credits not war. Lots of stuff to do on the MP servers within the player communities and each server seems to have a unique atmosphere based on the concept of the server owner. I've played on many servers and all have been a great experience.\n\nThat being said, there is one caveat for MP. Everything is built of various shaped blocks, each block composed of a number of triangles. One of my medium-size Class 4 capital vessels contains 12000 blocks and 26000 triangles. As this ship moves through space the computer has to calculate the position of each one of the triangles. If you want 60 FPS, it does this 60 times a second. No problem in SP witha decent computer, but imagine 10 of these ships in a MP playfield. They are in combat and shooting at each other. Triangles are being destroyed, so the server has to include that into the calculations. The load on the server is , erm, heavy to say the least. If  you want a good MP experience you have to chose a server that has the equipment to handle the load. This is why many of the more populated servers have limits on ship size and the number of bases and ships each player and faction can own. It is also why the \"universe\" is composed of a number of individual playfields and isn't seamless. The devs have made major improvements in this area to reduce the load and eliminate lag and I personally haven't run into many lag issues in Alpha 7, but it is still a potential problem. \n\nOverall, a great game with a fabulous MP player base and community. Every time a major Alpha release rolls out there are so many changes it's like getting a whole new game and I get to play it all over again!  I continue to sink way too many hours into this game!", "timestamp_created": 1469556961, "timestamp_updated": 1520787148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 412, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.9474906325340271", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32078630": {"recommendationid": "32078630", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971992249", "num_games_owned": 651, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 23249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18972, "last_played": 1566522082}, "language": "english", "review": "Updated review for Empyrion Alpha 8.5!\n\nEmpyrion has gone through a lot of positive changes in the past couple of years. This was originally a fun premise without much polish. It has become significantly better in recent iterations of the game, and is now one of my personal favorites. It is still in *alpha* which means that features are being added, and the devs add features constantly. They listen to the community and add the things that we want the most (auto-miners, repair bays, repairing to blueprints, etc).\n\nThere are still four classes of vessels, but the distinctions between them are starting to blur a bit. It used to be that capital vessels (CV) were the only ones that could warp between planets. Small vessels (SV) were recently given a short-range warp drive, so players can explore different planets without a massive investment into a CV. Hover vessels have also been given a bit of a buff, but they are still slower for planetary exploration than SV, which is a bit of an issue for the larger planets.\n\nThe planets are now much, much bigger than in the original versions of the game! There are no more force-field like barriers near the poles of the map and where the map loops around on itself, which is a huge plus for immersion.\n\nPoints of interest (POIs) are more fun to explore with added neutral and enemy NPCs. They look and behave less like original Doom enemies and are more fun.\n\nThe heart and soul of the game is with exploration and building. If you like to design and build bases or ships, you will love this game.\n\nEmpyrion is still not well optimized for low-end PCs. It may chug even on higher end machines. Don't expect AAA-level graphics, either. The fun of the game is in the gameplay, and it delivers on a wonderful vessel-building experience.\n\nIf you buy the game, definitely check out the Steam Workshop content for player-created blueprints for nearly everything. They will give you inspiration for your own designs, and you can publish your own blueprints easily from the game.\n\n============= Below is my original Alpha 6.0 Review ====================\n\nThis is a review for the 6.0 release of Empyrion. The game is very much a work in progress, and there are a lot of bugs. However, the idea of exploration, mining, and raiding is very much alive with Empyrion. You can also build creations in four classes--bases (BA), capital vessels (CV), small vessels (SV), and hover vessels (HV). There are plenty of block types to work with, and you can build beautiful and functional creations.\n\nThere are more than a few space-themed games out there, but Empyrion is one of my favorites because the developers put a lot of effort into this game. I've contacted them about plenty of bug reports and feature requests, and they respond FAST. This game is very much in the growth phase. They're adding new features regularly. It's fun to see it develop.\n\nThere are a lot of issues that I have with the game, but the developers are fixing them one by one. This isn't ready for prime time yet, but it's fun to play even at its current state. Expect some issues and don't be afraid to learn and use console commands to fix problems.

Even better, EGS has partnered with the Tencent-owned Funcom for \"marketing.\" The announcement thread attracted criticism and was, of course, locked.\n\nShills insist this unholy union can't possibly result in monetization like battle passes and microtransactions, because ... come on, guys ... Empyrion isn't even the type of game that can work with a battle pass. Neither was Conan Exiles, but uh ... never mind. Oh, and concerns about spyware from a Chinese-owned corporate arm of the CCP are, like, totally unfounded conspiracy theories.\n\nIt's funny that this new DLC features \"updated melee combat\" with swords (which I'm sure will be brilliantly animated and have nothing to do with Eleon's new partnership with the maker of Conan Exiles). Meanwhile, awful gunplay and movement don't even get mentioned. Instead, we're told Funcom grants the \"opportunity to raise the bar for both the quality and quantity of our content.\"\n\nWhat that means is anybody's guess, but something like Zirax Coins, a Galactic Emporium and a Galaxy Pass wouldn't surprise me.\n\nI'm out of space, so this is probably the final update. Buyer beware.\n\nUPDATE (July 2022, v1.8):\n\nAfter not playing Empyrion since posting this review (nearly 2 years ago), I recently reinstalled and clocked just under 30 additional hours. Nothing I originally wrote here warrants revision, and I still don't recommend the game to anyone seeking \"galactic survival,\" but I tried to give the current version a fair shake.\n\n* Some of the graphic changes result in a game universe that's downright beautiful at times. The gas giant's rings, as visible in the skies of the starter moons, are a stunning sight, and all the terrains I've encountered so far have been interesting and plausible. Characters are still blocky abominations, but the universe itself is a looker.\n\n* Unfortunately, performance continues to degrade, even though the PC I play on now is far superior to the one I used for Empyrion back in the day. This is further evidence to me that the \"released\" version of the game was just another alpha, and it arguably still is.\n\n* Eleon has attempted to craft a story, complete with a brand new tutorial, NPCs and interactive dialogue. It's crap. The writing is trite, boring and amateurish, like it was written for kids, but with none of the charm or clarity one would expect from a competent children's author.\n\n* Not only is the writing bad, but it is presented through a UI that is an eye-bleeding mess of colored text and exclamation marks.\n\n* Water is now animated and looks nice, but still has no discernible physics. Drowning at the bottom of a lake?  Just dig a hole.\n\n* There are some new weapons (like a crossbow and flamethrower), but none of this matters since the combat and first-person mechanics still fall prey to all the criticism I expressed two years ago.\n\n* The Empyrion experience remains of amateurish quality compared to many similar titles. It can still be fun in co-op, but the devs have done very little since v1.0 to actually make the game better. Making changes =/= improvement.\n\nOriginal review below.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nUntil today, Empyrion was in Early Access for five years, and I suspect it will remain in an EA state for years more, if not perpetually.\n\nI've reached high-tier survival maybe a handful of times in all the years I've played this title, with most of my 600+ hours having gone into early to mid-game efforts whenever a new alpha drops. That's not to say I don't play for fun. I do, almost exclusively, and I wouldn't keep checking in if I thought Empyrion sucked completely. FWIW, the building system is engaging, and exploration can be loads of fun in co-op.\n\nHowever, there's a notion going around that players are somehow unreasonable when they're critical of Eleon Game Studios or the game after X number of hours played.\n\nA certain fanboy/moderator would apparently have everyone believe that his own 16,000 hours played is somehow reflective of the immense quality of this game, and anyone who has hundreds or thousands of hours is in fact a living testimony to Eleon Game Studios' unrivaled greatness.\n\nMeanwhile, in the real world, Empyrion is clunky, bug-ridden, amateurish and frustrating even at its best.\n\nI'm usually fine with that. Kenshi is one of my favorite games of all time, after all. But \"You played X hours and got your money's worth, so shut up,\" is not an argument. \n\nVersion 1.0 is not a complete game, and shouldn't be portrayed as such through deliberately confusing manipulations of common game dev nomenclature.\n\nHowever, if \"shut up\" is the official fanboy/moderator/developer position, then my official position is a negative review, and a strong recommendation to look elsewhere for sci-fi survival.\n\nFew similar games do as much as Empyrion on such a massive scale, but nearly every game I can think of does what it does, within its own scope, better than Empyrion.\n\n- The first-person mechanics are perhaps the worst I've ever seen. Playing Empyrion doesn't feel like moving around as a character, but rather gives me the sense of a camera on wheels. Animations are ugly or nonexistent for basic tasks. It would've been a damn shame twenty years ago. Today it's inexcusable.\n\n- Characters are hideous and hideously animated. Despite the first-person woes, don't even think about playing this in third-person.\n\n- Combat is an uninspired, impact-lacking mess. Weapons feel like BB guns, and even saying that feels like an undeserved insult to air rifles. If there's one single gameplay element that kills my Empyrion joy faster than any other, it's the awful, pea-shooter combat. This is unforgivable, because combat is central to the game unless you're only in it for creative mode.\n\n- The AI is rock-stupid and blatantly plays by different rules. Enemies can magically \"hack\" (take over) your base from long range if they can't reach your core, and their base and ship weapons are superior to player weapons in almost every way. Fighting against NPCs is essentially a matter of learning how to cheese. Recent attempts to create end game content have exacerbated this problem.\n\n- Unity Store assets are still commonplace. I mean ... whatever, I guess. I couldn't afford to make my own game assets, either.\n\n- Physics\u2014what physics?\n\n- Flight model\u2014what flight model?\n\n(It's been brought to my attention that I should point out there technically is a so-called flight model. Sadly, there's no real sense of mass or weight. Never was, and neither the \"flight model\" nor atmospheric engines that were added with it changed this. The same floating camera phenomenon that applies to walking/running also applies to every class of vehicle. I say this as a flight sim fan who thinks Space Engineers and No Man's Sky both did a decent fakery job with flight, and I would have been fine with something similar in Empyrion.)\n\n- Bugs. Everywhere. Various systems are glitchy.\n\n- No volumetric water. Dug a hole at the bottom of a lake? Congratulations, you've made a permanent air pocket that you can build on and live in just like on dry land. This also means you can't create a Minecraft-style backyard pond, or build a Subnautica-style underwater home. I mean, you *can* build underwater, but it's just depressing.\n\n- Canned environmental sounds, probably from the Unity Store (I can't confirm this). It's weird to be on a completely alien planet, but hear crickets and howling wolves.\n\nThis is all stuff one would expect of an ALPHA product, of course.\n\nIf you just want to build stuff or walk around on some same-y alien worlds, it's hard to say Empyrion isn't worth twenty bucks. It's huge with lots of moving parts. If you're looking for a deep game with polished (or even competent) survival and action mechanics, investing time in Empyrion might leave you some combination of irritated, bored and sad.\n\nReview subject to change, but I wouldn't bet on it.", "timestamp_created": 1596659524, "timestamp_updated": 1704904147, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3239, "votes_funny": 112, "weighted_vote_score": "0.940976798534393311", "comment_count": 574, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "155645469": {"recommendationid": "155645469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069589358", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 16586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16586, "last_played": 1703024564}, "language": "english", "review": "Partnered with FUNCOM to start releasing DLC for a game that is total jank, full of placeholders, and a non-finished main story.... wow great. \n\nThe reasons I forgave the jank was because it was a small game studio that was not trying to milk its community for its unfinished game. \n\nThis game was not ready by any means for its change from EA to full release and its most certainly not ready for PAID DLC.

Cockpit, check. Thrusters, check. Oxygen, fuel, stabilizer, rail guns, check. Fridge? Check. After all the pieces were carefully placed together I stood back and looked at my small ship. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but it was functional.\n\nI took off for my first flight, got the hang of the controls, and started flying. I didn\u2019t have a destination. I didn\u2019t need one. I could go anywhere on the planet. Literally, anywhere on the planet. I flew low just over the trees and then soared over the mountains. And just as I cleared a peak, that\u2019s when the blasts came. Cannon fire flew past my ship and I started to panic. Dipping, diving and barrel rolling, I managed to escape the onslaught coming from the nearby alien base.\n\nMy ship had sustained damage, and I knew that it wouldn\u2019t be able to take another beating like the one it just had. So I found a safe place to land, took out my multi-tool, and started to repair my ship. But I noticed something in the distance. It looked like an old, broken down building. I took out my assault rifle and decided to check it out. As I got closer I realized it wasn\u2019t a building, it was part of a massive crashed space ship. And it must\u2019ve been there for a while because it was embedded in to the earth, and vegetation had started to grow inside of it. I broke down walls and used my jet pack to explore the remains of this once glorious ship, looting the storage crates as I found them until my inventory was full.\n\nI went back to my ship so I could drop off some of my loot and go get more, but when I got to my ship, my cargo box was missing. It must\u2019ve been destroyed when I took the heavy fire. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. So I thought, what the heck, let\u2019s see if the O2 container will hold inventory items. Nope. How about the fuel storage? Nope. How about the fridge? Yep. I was able to temporarily store my inventory items in the fridge so I could go back and get more loot. Sweet.\n\nAfter the looting was done, I loaded up and headed back to my home base. Landed, unloaded, and knew that I had to beef up my ship and take out that alien drone base. So I took out my trusty motorcycle and headed to the nearest Iron deposit to mine for more materials. On the way back I narrowly missed an attacking alien spider, and also stopped to do some hunting for food.\n\nI got back to my base and saved and exited my game, knowing that the next time I played I was going to build an even better space ship and then exact my revenge on a local evil alien base, which is a whole new story altogether.\n\nThis was one of my most enjoyable gaming experiences of my life, and I\u2019ve been playing video games for almost 30 years. This game may not be for everyone, but I was able to live multiple epic sci-fi adventures that you only read about in books.\n\nPros:\n-A whole galaxy of FULL planets to explore (including moons)\n-Points of interest on each planet (bases, crashed ships, temples, etc)\n-Great crafting and building\n-Better graphics than Minecraft\n-Limitless content and replayability\n\nCons:\n-No real tutorial (I spent lots of time on the internet trying to figure out how to play the game)\n-Somewhat buggy, but nothing gamecrashingly bad\n-Could use a few minor tweaks (there\u2019s no gun reloading animation, etc)\n\nHonestly, the biggest thing that may turn people off is learning how to do everything.

On its current path, that no longer applies.\n\nI don't write reviews - ever - so if you're reading this, consider how drastic the cumulative failures have been in order to wring this out of me. The devs have not only stopped listening to their players, but are turning a deaf ear to their own staff now. Whatever Empyrion Galactic Survival might have become, that game is dead.\n\nJust to highlight a few of the massive flaws currently at play:\n-A \"CPU\" system they claim is meant to encourage vessel \"specialization,\" which does nothing of the sort. Instead it restricts builders, penalizes creative / aesthetic design, and thanks to rare loot-/trade-only components, gates larger ship progression behind insane grind and/or unfathomably low drop rates. Those big, awesome ships you see in the screenshots? A portrait of lies - don't expect to build anything like that under the current system.\n-New \"flight mechanics\" that tie your ship's maximum speed to its weight / acceleration. Build too big or carry too much cargo, and you'll find you can't even move fast enough (IN SPACE) to achieve Warp velocity.\n-A complete disregard for feedback if it isn't what they want to hear. The devs have a three-part release system consisting of \"Closed Alpha\" testing, \"Experimental\" testing, and then the Public release - this may as well be a straight-to-public method since time and again they have pushed ahead with bad systems despite overwhelming negative feedback during each phase.\n\nIf you had asked me even a year ago, I'd have heartily recommended EGS as one of the best in its genre. The building system is superior to any other I've encountered, and the ability to paint and texture individual block surfaces puts this game head & shoulders above the competition. Yet for some unknown reason, the developers are utterly determined to choke, restrict, and limit that creative potential through arbitrary and unnecessary game mechanics.\n\nShould this change, I will gladly revisit my review and alter my recommendation accordingly.

I want to talk my friends into playing it with me. I have put a lot of hours into playing, spread out over many years. I have even been interested enough to polish some of my in game designs for posting on the Steam Workshop. My stupid conscience won't let me give it a thumbs-up though, because this game is clearly another example of a great idea that isn't getting the time and resources it needs to realize its potential. There are a multitude of these half-realized dreams on Steam, and it really makes me question the Early Access concept in general. Players like me pay to fund development of these games, instead of paying for a finished game, with no guarantee that the development will ever actually happen. Maybe we paid for some dev to live and work for awhile and then just move on to another project. Let's call that what it is: A donation to an artist, not the purchase of a product!\n\nEmpyrion does some things well. It really is a galactic survival game, where you can begin as a castaway astronaut with nothing but some hand tools, lost on an alien world. You can explore neat-looking landscapes, harvest materials, fight AI people and monsters, and build bases and working vehicles from scratch. You can construct a spacecraft, and fly seamlessly from planet surface to orbital space, and then from there fly freely to any nearby asteroids or moons. When you develop sufficient technology, you can build ships capable of traveling faster than light and visit other planets and, beyond that, a whole galaxy of star systems with their own planets. You can build everything from tiny ships to huge ones, and stage battles between spaceships. \n\nIt does all of this well enough for me to keep coming back once a year to see how development is coming along, despite my continual disappointment with the state of the game. Basic game mechanics that you use for harvesting and constructing feel clunky and unfinished. Some basic things, like the system for creating artificial gravity on ships and space stations, have been left unfinished for years, with no indication from the devs whether they will ever be improved on. Recent updates seem to be focused on minor visual tweaks (just now adding schools of fish to bodies water?), which really should have been done years ago. The \"experience\" and player progression system is slapped-together and serves no purpose. You could remove it completely and not change the gameplay at all. The end-game is almost non-existent here. Once you get the ability to build whatever you want, you realize how few block choices there really are in the game. Big bases and ships end up feeling empty, there aren't a lot of devices with actual functionality, so spaces end up filled with useless decorations just to make the space look like it serves a purpose. AI currently is 2-dimensional, interaction with AI players is minimal in the extreme, and all AI creatures behave more or less the same in combat, meaning you can use the same tactics in every danger situation and win easily. Changes voted up by regular players on the game forums are just ignored by the devs when they don't feel like addressing them.\n\nInstead of adding art to the game, the devs should be polishing and filling out the game mechanics, making the basic game feel more varied, and giving it a meaningful sense of progression. In this kind of game, players can make their own art, but they can't fix a broken foundation.\n\nGet to work for real or throw in the towel!", "timestamp_created": 1654445245, "timestamp_updated": 1654445245, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 640, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889629244804382324", "comment_count": 46, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78965528": {"recommendationid": "78965528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059478360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 209120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185286, "last_played": 1702417583}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played Empyrion a bit over 3,000 hours over the last 3 years, and I just keep on coming back to it. It's very much like Minecraft with space flight, guns, and real enemies.\n\nYou start out by crash landing on an alien planet, either with or without a breathable atmosphere, your choice. At first it's a challenge just to get enough food to eat and air to breathe while avoiding or killing the local wildlife with a wimpy survival tool. As you level up, you learn to make better weapons and you can build a small base to protect you from the the occasional inclement weather, including acid rain or radiated fog. You can also raise about a dozen different kinds of crops by building a farm in your base, which will help you stabilize your constant need for food and medical supplies.\n\nAfter a while, you can build up enough resources to travel around your planet by ground or air and discover the aliens that share the planet with you. By killing them, trading with them, or doing them favors, you can change how they view you. They may raid your base or trade with you for things you need depending on your interactions with them.\n\nUsually, I find myself befriending some of the aliens and becoming bitter enemies of the others. Raiding the settlements of your enemies can be very profitable. On the other hand, there are resources you need to build bigger better ships and bases that can only be had by trade.\n\nFinally, you are ready to reach for the stars, literally. Your first trip off planet is really scary. This game does a great job of making space huge and unforgiving. Make sure to take enough air and food when you go to the moon for the first time, or try your hand at asteroid mining. The alien factions are also in space. Many of them have orbital traders or other installations for you to visit, or destroy.\n\nBut it gets better. Once you are in space, you can build bigger, more powerful ships. Either small ones just to get from place to place, or huge ships complete with a farm and all the comforts of base back dirtside. You can step beyond the need to ever need to set foot on the ground again. You won't want to do that though, since there are other planets to explore within the solar system that will have resources generally unavailable on your starting world. You can have bases on multiple planets, their moons, even floating in orbit, as well as the ship you use to travel among them.\n\nBeyond the solar system, you will find other solar systems. Each of them with worlds similar to your starting system and few new twists to make it worth exploring them all.\n\nNow the best part of this game for me is playing with friends. My wife loves it. My nephew and niece love to play with us when they visit. There is something for everyone. My wife can spend her time farming and gathering resources while my nephew and I explore the local ruins and fight the aliens we don't like, and my niece goes around shooting animals for fun. We've only played on a local server, but it is very easy to set up just by choosing game options, and my computer can handle four players just fine.\n\nAll in all, it's been worth what I've spent on the game even at full price. There does come a point where you've maxxed out your development and the challenges become repetitive, but it takes a bit to get there, and I always get the urge to come back in a couple months and fire up a new game.

I was about halfway there when I had a great idea and decided to go to one of the little alien towers near the lava planet that looks like a satellite, I took out what I thought were all of the massive plasma rocket cannon thingies, pulled in close to go salvage the core and be on my way, when suddenly I heard a big huge explosion, I was face to face with a huge plasma turret which had been hidden on the other end of the satelllite. Just like that my ship was without any fuel tanks to power up with, my emergency ship parts at the time did not include fuel tanks, only RCS, generator, & a couple directional thrusters. I was distraught, there is no way to get back down to my large constructors on Akua to repair the ship. I'm going to lose a whole days worth of preparation and it's gonna be a sad day. That's when I checked my inventory one last time and saw a spare core, it was at this time I knew I only had 1 option left. Assault the massive alien base that looks like a giant satellite on foot, with nothing but my assault rifle, 250~ bullets, & my trusty remove & repair tool. I set off towards the gigantic intimidating space station, the closer I got, the more I knew this was going to end with my backpack floating around in space, lost forever. The base was absolutely covered head to toe with those giant plasma rocket turrets, usually the bases on a planet have 5-6, sometimes even 10 turrets that can destroy a basic SV in 1-2 hits, this base had at least 30-40 rocket turrets on the outside. I charged the station, zig zagging up & down, left & right, just narrowly avoiding what felt like thousands of missiles and plasma blasts. I slammed against the side of the station and immediately used my remove&repair tool to bust inside, where I was met with a space station full of automatic turrets that were shooting the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of me and causing me to panic. I cleared the first room of turrets and took a moment to think, my oxygen was running very low, time was getting shorter, at this point I figured I'd never forgive myself if I came all this way for nothing, so I pressed on. I went through a hallway in to a room that was covered in turrets, I took them out with my assault rifle from afar, upon walking in, I hear and see a huge explosion right in front of me, one of the massive plasma cannons outside had shot a hole in the wall of the space station, blowing up several fuel tanks and almost killing me. Short on oxygen, health, food, & ammo, things were looking grim. Eventually, I fought my way to the top of the space station, where I was overcome with joy when I found a small room containing the core, a fuel tank, and 2 constructors. I did it! I replaced the core with my own, threw some fuel in the tanks, & made myself a brand new fuel tank for my SV. I have never felt so victorious in any game ever, against insurmountable odds, I managed to fight my way though a hail of gunfire, giant face-melting missiles, & a dwindling oxygen tank to salvage my ship and my mission. I returned to Akua to make some much needed cosmetic repairs to my ship, as well as a lot more armor covering just about everything on the ship that can explode when shot by those horrifyingly powerful turrets. Learned my lesson after that, always have a plan b in this game, because if you're not prepared for just about anything, you're going to have to pull some crazy \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 like that in order to salvage the situation :P", "timestamp_created": 1441944622, "timestamp_updated": 1441944622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 307, "votes_funny": 175, "weighted_vote_score": "0.883252084255218506", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36322831": {"recommendationid": "36322831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037520939", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2792, "last_played": 1610814462}, "language": "english", "review": "Saw this game off and on. Reviews went back and forth. Game has been in development for a long time. Still Alpha.\n\nDecided to Finally take the plunge anyway.\n\nFirst Impression was a very rough and unfinished (obvious because of Alpha) band-wagon game just trying to throw some stuff together and half-heartedly be in the mix of the survival, craft, open-world game craze.\n\nMy Son hopped on with me for a LAN Server game.\n\nWE ARE HAVING A BLAST.\n\nAt first I told myself this is a cheap product. I was wrong.\n\nYea, enemies need to be smoothed out and their movement sucks. But the shear amount of what I'll call \"isolated complexity\" going on is incredible. What I mean by this is no, there is not background trading, world affects, faction relationships, universe political or local/global leader influences yet. But WHERE the player is active (Points of Interest, Villages, Capitols), there are several events taking place....\n\nEx: Being on some random planet, no clue what to do. Getting killed by basically everything. Can't even Imagine that we could actually build something and go to space at some point. Find a POI ....in this case a random Communication Hub with some Radars and Cannons. Die about 30 times trying to get inside. Running around feeling like kings looting it after such a dismal start. An enemy freaking Dropship comes and drops off Alien Assassins to kill us. Realizing we can destroy the Base's Core and REPLACE it with our own to now OWN it and now the same cannons the were killing us moments prior, are now shooting down Drones that were sent to destroy our newly claimed home.\n\nIn this game, you live and learn. And the fun is figuring it all out.\n\nWe spent hours making what we thought was an awesome home. It was all wood. (By the way, the combinations of shape designs you can have makes for some of the best base/vehicle building I have seen in a survival game.) We were happy to just survive an entire night for once without dying. \"Warning: Drones have been sent to destroy your base\".....umm...ok??\n\nYea. Our base was shot to hell as we fought bravely with our pistols to defend it.\n\nThen we realized we were mere ants to the world. And we learned how to make better materials, and stronger everything.\n\nEven the mining is pleasing. You literally can dig your own cave or tunnel network.\n\nThe possibilities this game allows you to pursue is incredible. Hell, there is even a gun that lets you change color and texture of blocks! And I'm not saying just from Blue to Green. There is some complex textures that even \"power on\" when power is applied and glow with circuitry design....oh...and did I mention there is even Custom Signal Logic you can do within your Custom Built Base or Ships (there are different classes of vehicles that allow to travel different distances as well) that allow you to control entire network by switches you install.\n\nThere are a ton of features to balance. Oxygen, Temperature, Food, Armor, Radiation, Ammo, Repairs, Power, Fuel. All while trying to make your base, vehicles stronger and better.\n\nAnd yes.\n\nEventually you can build something (or select a prefabricated design if you aren't comfortable going custom yet) and simply takeoff, and fly up.....into space. To a moon, an asteroid, another planet, another system, and blow up or land at even more POI's along the way or spaceships.\n\nI hope the development continues.\n\nAs for the \"Grind\" issue. My Son and I had no complaints.\n\nWithin a few days of gameplay, being complete beginners, on a Hard Difficultly setting (except enemy difficultly...PS...currently all this does is increase their health to the point where it will take fun out of the game due to the insane amount of ammo it takes to kill the simplest things.) we have taken over a few bases and JUST got into space with our made spacecraft. Heck, they even have technologies that make your tools better and more efficient, and automated bots that can assist you in gather resources.\n\nSupposedly this was easier to do before. But the amount of effort required as the game currently plays created an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation to accomplish space travel. It was rewarding and satisfying.\n\nWe couldn't even fathom doing so when we first started. There was plenty to learn and do just being on the surface. And doing so, while knowing we could \"leave\" all the while if we learned how, and built our way to success, made for an amazing experience.\n\nYa there is weird crap that happens and some things that don't make any sense. But it doesn't detract from the experience really, or leave the player feeling too jaded.\n\nDevs. Keep it up.", "timestamp_created": 1509978490, "timestamp_updated": 1509978733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 125, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.882318258285522461", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18691533": {"recommendationid": "18691533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006474677", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 41671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24189, "last_played": 1672458068}, "language": "english", "review": "I\u2019m not here to sell it to you.

That said, there are some things that it lacks. A plot for one. If you want a story (as of right now) move along. If you are expecting perfection, move along. If you\u2019re expecting a million dollars, get in line, send me half, or move along.\n\nI read through several reviews of this game before and after purchasing it. Those who have played the game for less than an hour have generally (and undeservingly) given negative reviews. Yes, this game has issues. It\u2019s not perfect (*2). It has some flaws. But to insult a game based on less than 60 minutes because it\u2019s not perfect or does not fit your play style is not entirely fair.\n\nThose who have played 40+ hours and have given it negative reviews; I have read them and can relate to most of their frustrations and experiences. Read them! (*3) You may find that what you and the reviewer expect from a game that (currently) costs about $20 are similar. If they sway you away from buying the game, that\u2019s fine. \n\nThings to help you with a decision:\nDo you/did you like Minecraft; before the Ender Dragon and \u201cbeating the game\u201d?\n\nDo you like survival games? Imagine Seven Days to Die - in space, without the never ending hordes of zombies ripping your base (that you spent 20 hours on) apart in minutes.

Figure it out on your own, or pull up your trusty search engine and start researching. Either way, there\u2019s lots of trial and error.\n\nAre you expecting perfection? This game is well made. Hell, I\u2019d imagine a few big name companies releasing it \u201cas is\u201d with all the hype and a very large Zero-Day patch followed by several patches and DLC\u2019s later to make it a real game\u2026 It\u2019s not perfect.

Very well too.\n\nAre you okay with dumping hours and hours (20-60) into a game, knowing that there\u2019s a possibility to  lose it all when a new patch comes out? All in the name of progress?\n\nAs of right now, this game is Minecraft in space. Similar to Space Engineers, but not quite. While there\u2019s no real goal other than to survive, it\u2019s going to be more than that when it\u2019s through. It reminds me a lot of SDtD: the textures, the crafting style, etc. But it\u2019s more enjoyable because there\u2019s not random zombies and hordes spawning every 15-30 minutes hell bent on tearing apart all you\u2019ve worked for. Although, there are \u201cwaves\u201d of drones now every 20-30 minutes. They\u2019re pretty easily overcome and there\u2019s a warning too. \n\nDo you enjoy developer support? This game has it. I have emailed the game developers on several occasions and have received plenty of personal replies back. It lets me know that my voice matters. I\u2019m contributing and not just some a stupid consumer who has nothing offer. The community is helping and the developers listen!

Some of these times have been my own fault. I didn\u2019t know any better, or I didn\u2019t prepare, etc. People who complain about losing hours of work because of this or that happening, should take advantage of the \u201cbackup\u201d system. People who tell of losing weeks because of corrupted save files have my sympathies. I too, have lost hours of play time because of corrupted saves. It\u2019s pre-alpha.

No block deformation, no piston and rotor, just ships flying and colliding like solid bricks (but without the inertia).\n- While Space Engineer is aimless, [b]Empyrion has both a nicely tuned progression and an enjoyable gameplay loop[/b].\n\nBy progression, I don't only mean the artificial locking of technologies into an XP eating skill tree, but also the more organic usual way of having harsher biomes provide new material, needed for higher tech blocks, enabling you to reach further places.\n\nThe gameplay loop starts, as with most survival, with you dying to nearly everything, and barely able to scrounge tiny amount of ore. Then eventually managing to build the barest of ground vehicle, enabling you to harvest faster and more safely, then upgrading it and your homebase bits by bits, then eventualy moving to a tiny flying ship, reaching for the moon, getting the special metals you need to build a mothership, at which point the gameplay start having less emphasis on mining and more on raiding dungeons to loot epic weapons.\n\nEmpyrion has POI, which stands for Point of Interests, which are computer controlled bases, and more or less act like MMO dungeons. First you'll need to destroy their outter turrets with your fighter ship, then enter on foot, blasting aliens and doors, emptying loot crates, eventually destroying the core to disable the whole base and allow dismantling it. These POI usually respawn after half a day, so that even on busy servers starter planets you'll find enough pristine ones.\n\nDetails may vary, as you're free to handle them however you want: Some POI are friendly and can be looted with no fight. You may prefer to start the attack with a landbound hover ship, or with a turret covered capital ship, on foot hiding behind hills, via tunnel you dug, etc.. You may want to attack with disposable ships, then once the exterior is safeish, bring your bigger vehicle to act as a respawn, requip, and loot drop point. Sometimes you may cheat through interior fights by sneaking a specially designed super small ship. Or expend enough heavy munitions to bluntly blow through several layers of steel with your heavy ship-mounted weapons until you blow the base core. POIs are filled with enemy spawners, so you need to either explode each spawner you find, or blow up the endroom core, to pacify it. And usually the end room has some epic loot in red/purple containers, with obviously more difficult POI offering higher rewards. After the initial progression, I found most of my game time spent exploring those POI, which is a much more fun endgame activity than other similar games have. Even though the FPS part isn't on par with a pure FPS game, its integration with the rest of the game made it meaningful and rewarding.\n\nOf course there is PvP for those who like them, with often both PvE and PvP playfields on the same server, which helps with not having newcomers not being steamrolled by vets on arrivals. But sadly, as with most PvP survival, it's actually less about player versus player and more about offline raiding, using whatever exploit is available at the moment.\n\n[b]So, while the technical part of the game leave to be desired, I appreciated how the developper delivered an actual game instead of an empty sandbox.[/b]\n\nI mean, even elements which you'd though purely cosmetic such as furniture actually have gameplay impact!

The worlds are massive on their own, and then add to that the ability to fly into and around space, and land on other planets. You can even dig downwards and bore out tunnels in the voxel based worlds so we\u2019re talking really epic in scope. Players can build constructions like bases or even ships, using a piecemeal block by block style of construction. As long as the vehicle or base meets certain requirements such as having an engine, thrusters, or whatever, it means the player has complete freedom to design insanely complex, functioning projects. What\u2019s more, destruction in the game is also piecemeal, so a poorly designed ship that has exposed critical components could be taken out by a single explosion. This creates a cool incentive for the player to design tactically and efficiently.\n\nSo needless to say, the game is complex. Like, insanely complex. All the usual sandbox survival tropes are there; a need to harvest food, mine resources, construct buildings and so forth, all while braving hostile lifeforms on the planet. But Empyrion really takes that to the max with the depth and complexity of resources needed to construct larger projects. This isn\u2019t new for survival games of course, but Empyrion has it in spades. On top of that, there is also a tech tree to unlock newer and better technology blueprints, resulting in even more complex constructions. This leads to a situation where building a large project requires a lot of time in what will be a significant grind-fest, but it also makes the payoff that much more rewarding.\n\nAnd therein lies the dilemma; This game will not appeal to everyone, especially those who are more casual about their survival sandboxes. I\u2019ve put a couple of hours into it but I feel like I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface. I believe its fanbase will be those who are looking for a deep but vast survival experience that\u2019s gonna kick their arse until they learn to master it. It\u2019s not friendly to new players, but it is rewarding to veterans.\n\nIn terms of graphics, it\u2019s really nothing to write home about. The game looks very indie and there are a lot of jagged edges. The landscape are beautiful though, in a very eerie way. The terrain draw distance is amazing and peering off into the distant mountains really gave me a sense that I was on some vast, desolate world, but unfortunately the object draw distance is not great, even at maxed out. Likely this cap is for performance reasons but I found it led to some immersion breaking popup of enemy and flora. The audio is fairly good overall, nothing too jarring, but I found the weakest part of the game right now is in the animations and AI. I noticed some creatures have very lose animations and while being attacked one creature even gave up on animating altogether. I should mention everything is still in Early Access right now so this is no doubt going to be something improved upon at a later date.\n\nAt $20 I would recommend this game to solid fans of the genre only. It\u2019s not a game you are gonna boot up for a quick blast. It\u2019s a game you\u2019re gonna put a day into, and then be comfortable that you understand the basics. A rewarding game, with a steep learning curve.", "timestamp_created": 1533263153, "timestamp_updated": 1533263153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 98, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874727368354797363", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118479318": {"recommendationid": "118479318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262712135", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 9508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5579, "last_played": 1662136637}, "language": "english", "review": "I never heard of this game until update 1.8, which was when it started appearing in my recommended feed on Steam. I was hesitant to pick the game up at $20 seeing some of the reviews mention glaring issues, however the overall experience I've had has been phenomenal.\n\nA word of caution before I go into more detail: this game is prone to bugs and crashes, make sure you backup your save data regularly.\n\nTo start of, the one aspect this game excels at is the sense of exploration. The system for generating structures utilizes a blueprint system wherein both players and Eleon can assign a \"POI\" to it for the game to have a chance of spawning in. Essentially this creates near infinite replayability as each game you create will always be unique as you explore a vast range of structures. A key point to understand though is certain structures spawning are contingent on the planet type, thus requiring you to explore the galaxy in order to experience every one of them.\n\nPlanets are also pseudo random generated in the sense that specific planet types are governed by the type of star system. For example, ocean and ice planets won't spawn in star systems with a high heat output and lava planets won't spawn in low heat systems. The amount of light a planet receives is also affected by the luminosity of the star, so if you set up camp near a neutron star you can expect to receive very little light from it.\n\nLuminosity has little impact on gameplay as the only object affected by it is solar panels. Surprisingly planets do have a day/night cycle caused by the planet itself spinning rather than the approach some games take by having the sun orbit the planets. This means any space station constructed with fixed solar panels will have an infinite source of solar power.\n\nEmpyrion utilizes a blocked based building system with two sizes. Hover vessels and small vessels utilize the smaller block set while capital vessels and bases utilize the large block set. Despite the limitations of a block based building system the vast array of block shapes at your disposal and a deco block system means the only limitation is your creativity. It is entirely possible to recreate iconic ships such as the Normandy from Mass Effect or the Tachi from The Expanse, if you have the time and patience to do so.\n\nOne final pro to note is the integration of the Steam Workshop into the game. Eleon fully understand that the primary reason behind Empyrion's success is the dedicated community releasing some of the most intricate and power creations on the workshop. This is supported by the ability to outright spawn in blueprints by providing enough resources rather than needing to follow a hologram guide in recreating the design. If you have the time, definitely check out some of the creations from Artemis and Spanj.\n\nNow onto the issues with the game...\n\nAs noted in several other reviews Empyrion lacks the necessary polish required for a game in a full release stage. This is evident by the mess that is the PDA system which contains: inventory, quest logs, local map, system map, galaxy map, codex information, blueprints, and the tech tree. The most egregious entry is the quest system as the overall formatting is reminiscent of early 2000s design. In time you'll learn to navigate the PDA effectively, however it's in desperate need of a redesign.\n\nAnother issue becomes evident as you advance through missions. The implementation is rather rudimentary as each step in a mission can and will break if you fail to pass the highly constrained trigger. In some instances a mission might completely break or repeat itself regardless of actions taken by the player. Eleon have even acknowledge the missions are an issue by allowing players to debug complete steps so at the very least you can complete a broken mission.\n\nAnimations and sound are areas in dire need of an overhaul as well since both lack depth and complexity we'd expect as standard for games in 2022. The sound system especially appears to only be 4 or 5 layers deep with frequent cutting the more densely packed the area you're in is. Animations tend to break often as well or are lazily implemented as you'll soon see when encountering your first NPC.\n\nThe overall graphics and models are mediocre at best with both having a mixture of high and low quality. The graphics are of the same quality as games released in the early 2000s with low res textures completely dominating your attention over the few high res textures. Hitbox models also rarely line up with the actual textures meaning you'll frequently hit blocks with your weapons despite have a clear line of sight.\n\nOther issues include the rather simplistic AI, poor weapon integration, inconsistent difficulty, inconsistent rendering (hello random trees), basic multiplayer framework, extremely basic economy, and an unintuitice tutorial.\n\n\n\nTo sum everything up, Empyrion is a diamond in the rough that is consistently being updated and improved. For an indie game studio Eleon have produced a game that I feel provides a better experience than some AAA titles released in the past year.\n\nOverall I'd recommend fans of the sci-fi genre to definitely pick this game up. While fairly rough at the time of publishing this review its definitely worth adding to your collection and seeing what Eleon is capable of doing.", "timestamp_created": 1657323333, "timestamp_updated": 1657323333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.87335360050201416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101376841": {"recommendationid": "101376841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043318340", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 26800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9964, "last_played": 1640581502}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the thought of travelling in space and time.

Then you simply have to survive.\n\nThere is so much potential in this game. You have to really be willing to put the time in because once you are properly into the game, it becomes increasingly more difficult to get what you need. \n\nThe difficulty of [b][i]Empyrion - Galactic Survival[/i][/b] definitely increases the more you play. You can change the options of your world before you start playing. So, if you like more of a challenge you can set everything to difficult from the get go. On the other hand, if you just want to play around with the creative side of things, there is also a Creative Mode which just lets you build stuff. Its more or less fully customisable to the kind of experience you want. However, the game gets much harder once you start delving into space travel and attacking alien bases. And the learning curve is rather crazy but it really works for this game.\n\nGraphically, the game varies from being quite ugly anywhere up to being breathtaking. The creatures and objects are decent enough, it\u2019s in the environment where some of the textures look a bit rough. Lighting is very good though, the way the sunlight changes the landscape is a genuinely lovely thing, even if the night times feel a little too dark, in my opinion at least. It\u2019s a good thing you can construct lights. As far as the sound design, it gets the job done. Some creatures/aliens get a bit repetitive when they are grunting as they pass your base walls. For the most part, the controls are simple enough. Standard controls to move around and nothing seems counter-intuitive. \n\nIf you enjoy science fiction, exploration, lots of mining, and the ability to build and shape the world around you, I think you will get on with [b][i]Empyrion - Galactic Survival[/i][/b]just fine.

Too bad, go build another and accept the loss..or quit\nUseless epic weapons that can't be repaired\nExcessive, and I mean EXCESSIVE deadly status effects\nLimited depth once you've messed around with ship building\nLimited tech\nAnnoying, repetitive music on a loop\nToxic PVP and equally toxic elitist community\n\nI really wanted to recommend Empyrion but this game is basically unfinished, but the fact remains this game varies from being alot of fun when things are going right without issues, then can quickly break your entire progress in a 'split second' when it doesn't, take for instance my final straw was minding my own business checking out an asteroid to farm in a mostly safe area,  an enemy CV just 'pops' up out of thin air and kills me and my mining SV in literally 2 seconds, and I'd like to say that is a rare thing...its not, this is because a large portion of the game relies on enemy spawns,  mining an asteroid?  Scanned for hostiles? All clear...start mining and 'pop' enemies spawn and unless you have a heavily armed and shielded ship, you could be dead in seconds and the same goes for ground combat with all manner of enemies popping up out of thin air. \n\nMeaning literally entire hours, days or even weeks can be flushed down the toilet in mere seconds if you are unlucky enough, or suffer some severe gamebreaking bug.   In single player,  you can at least literally save frequently enough and make a backup of that save file so if something exceptionally severe happen to your game, you can at least save scum but outside of that - it really is entirely possible to lose days and days worth of progress and most often, its not the players fault. \n\nWhen exploring POIs,  this happens frequently too with broken spawns,  enemies just popping up out of thin air and don't get me started about the ridiculously bad status effects and nonsense the developer thought was a good idea,  what kills you in this game most of the time isn't monsters, or being shot but dying of starvation because you get hit once,  status effect - parasites this time?  No your freezing cold? Oh you have an open wound? Most status effects also lead to more status effects so basically if you don't have access to a veritable array of med packs, detox kits, decontamination kits and other stuff then status effects *will* kill you and often in 20 seconds to a minute. \n\nGunplay is also a huge problem, with enemies having exceptionally high accuracy at all times whilst player weapons are either weak, suffer from serious spread issues or just generally bad.  Let alone limited options, whilst enemies are often overpowered, can spawn in thin air and larger dangerous monsters can quite often insta-kill  you even if you are wearing Heavy Armor with mods,  since enemies AI is atrocious and basically always know exactly where the player is at all times, making bases either super difficult at first until you learn the base layout and spawn areas making finding the same base poi again trivial. \n\nEnemies also make no real sense either,  and that I get the unity engine has a lot of limitations here, but the variety of enemies is really really limited,  and they vary in terms of annoyance with little baby scorpions moving so fast and tiny they are a pain to shoot, and yes they too can stack you up with deadly status effects,   weapons themselves are weak or pathetic like the T3 minigun and you'll see this issue pop up in treads constantly too,  I personally had to add a combat rebalance mod to make weapons just a bit better.\n\nExploration can be fun, arguably this is the main focus of the game outside building bases and ships,  lots to explore, *if* you don't get bored easily,  the main gameplay loop is scan area,  check out, find poi? Explore poi, leave area rinse and repeat until you find a major POI then its either die a few times whilst exploring and eventually clear the POI, find a few epic weapons and a ton of resources then rinse and repeat. \n\nWhilst the space gameplay loop is pretty much the same except that is significantly riskier since you, your ship and everything inside it is at risk of permanent loss,  no 'elite dangerous' style insurance as your ship and contents pop up at the last save point,  basically if you die in space, you have 3 options.   Accept the loss, build another ship and crawl back what you lost,   reload an earlier save game at the cost of potentially SIGNIFICANT time lost, or  basically quit the game and move on.    This hardcore aspect of space survival is intriguing for most people, especially akin to souls-like players and that is fine with a risk vs reward system but the system needs to be bug free, and this isn't at all with so many things like even a simple mining an asteroid can trigger a spawn and if you get unlucky or even very early in the gameplay cycle it can literally be devastating and even gamebreaking entirely, even using \"cheats\" like godmode does not protect your ships, only you so really at the end of the day? What is the point of spending hours to build ships to have them destroyed in seconds during a bad encounter,  for all intent and purposes Empyrion is more like a souls-like combined with a Rogue-Lite space survival game that is more hardcore than it really should be.\n\nSpace portion of the game could be so much better if it wasn't so buggy and exceptionally punishing on the player when it bugs out,  just yesterday playing co-op my friends teleport bugged out and was forced to use cheat codes in order to actually just repair the game to a playable state, these bugs are not that common but still - shows something is wrong.\n\nIn closing,  Empyrion is basically the dark souls of space survival,  and sadly have to say this is one of the best space survival games because the genre is so horribly under represented with AAA developers never touching this genre, even Starfield isn't going to be like Empyrion because of the extensive building aspects. \n\nEmpyrion could have been so much better if it wasn't for the bugs,  the punishing gameplay cycle which often hinges on you possibly losing serious amounts of playtime if you don't have a recent save game then once again, too bad so sad.    If you don't mind the possibility of losing potentially everything, and like a challenge albeit a one sided and often pretty unfair manner then Empyrion is the game you might enjoy,  its got a lot of potential but some of the major quirks and issues eventually just makes it more frustrating and less fun rather than engaging.\n\nEmpyrion needs basically more tech, more levels beyond 25+,  fixing of bugs,  more options for players including ability 'not' to lose everything in single player if you die because, lets face it - bugs can happen.   Empyrion also needs better difficulty sliders, ranging from at easy giving the ability to respawn with your ship/possessions through to classic hardcore, with many settings in between to tailor make your experience  because I see the threads all over the place complaining, but at the same time just accepting this games building is fun, everything else isn't. \n\nEmpyrion should still be considered in a early access state.", "timestamp_created": 1680728409, "timestamp_updated": 1680926774, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 164, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864779353141784668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146083632": {"recommendationid": "146083632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080527460", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 14617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14617, "last_played": 1632693672}, "language": "english", "review": "If No Mans Sky is Coke and Starfield is Pepsi Empyrion is RC not as many people drink it but if you do you enjoy it.", "timestamp_created": 1694382266, "timestamp_updated": 1694382266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864540219306945801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29075813": {"recommendationid": "29075813", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968518286", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 14655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13198, "last_played": 1600416314}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok. Now that I've put in 200+ hours on this game I feel that I can justifiably review this game with zero prejudice. This is what No Man's Sky wanted to be. This is undeniably my favorite game I've ever played. (I've played a lot of different games, I have roughly 100 on my steam account) the developers are extremely active, there's usually a weekly update. They care about your ideas and thoughts as well. This is a survival/crafting game single or multiplayer. There's single player mode, multiplayer mode, and creative mode where you have unlimited resources and you can make bases and ships and tweak them to your liking without having to spend hours mining. There's a lot of workshop content, bases, ships and such. You can harvest ore, build your base and a few ships, load them up with supplies and take off to a new planet, you can EXIT your ship and walk around and do whatever you want! Not only is there PVP, but there's also AI NPC's. Bases and drone ships and such. The AI is actually challenging. Try taking over your first lunar base, I promise you'll die a few times. They are constantly making improvements and adding new material. I highly recommend this game. I bought it on sale for $10, but honestly I have long since gotten my money's worth out of this game. I'd happily pay $60 for this game. Additionally, you can make your base look however you'd like. The blocks are editable to change their shape and you get texture and color tools to change the textures and colors of the blocks. The game is in alpha, there are many bugs, but none that would persuade me to stop playing, and they are usually addressed by the next update. Like I said this is my favorite game, I think you should try it. I will happily address any questions you have regarding this game. Just send me a friend request or a message.\n\n10/10 would smash.\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to add that I hear this game compared to space engineers a lot, which I've also played.  They are two completely different games that focus on completely different things.  This game is more evenly balanced in my opinion.  While I feel space engineers main focus is on building.  I personally didn't enjoy space engineers as much, although it has its strong points as well.  If you're going for multiplayer though, hands down get Empyrion.  Don't get me wrong, space engineers is a great game as well, I just prefer Empyrion for my play style.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_bWEfW6PVzE", "timestamp_created": 1483754608, "timestamp_updated": 1486393609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 102, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863813221454620361", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70874516": {"recommendationid": "70874516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084529085", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 12866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3669, "last_played": 1703817457}, "language": "english", "review": "With Alpha 12, Empyrion is like No Mans Sky except with extensive ship building and base building and station building.

That user has no ties to the developer which I am aware of, nor do I. I was not asked to review the product. It simply sates my OCD to do so.\n\n[h1]I all but wrote this genre off until Empyrion.[/h1]\n\nI'm one of those heretics who was bored by Minecraft, ARK, and The Forest, Different people enjoy different things, and for some, crafting/survival games are largely focused on the survival. For me, the crafting is what I love the focus to be on. I need a purpose aside from aesthetics to craft the stuff, the stuff has to interest me, and once crafted, I need to enjoy what I crafted. The aforementioned games don't appeal to me for that reason, while Subnautica totally does. It was the first crafting/survival game I liked (Terraria was decent at times, too). However, all the rest I either played or watched on YouTube turned me off on the genre. I had given up on it.\n\n[h1]Arsenal Excellence[/h1]\nEmpyrion has many weapons to craft, Unlike many of these games, you get guns, and the game doesn't make you wait until 20-30 hours in to get them and have a decent ammo supply. Heck, you start with a pistol. There's only one melee weapon: the chainsaw, and it's intended for cutting down trees, really. The shooting mechanics are okay, though hardly on par with any \"legit\" first person shooter. It works well enough, though, and shooting a pack of space raptors to death with well-placed headshots whilst running backwards is pretty fun each time, despite its simplicity in mechanics.\n\nYou can craft several basic versions of pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, a pulse rifle, a minigun, and quite a few more. The guns worked quite nicely, and were pretty fun to wield. I will reiterate that this is not a technical gunplay marvel, but I had a nice time here.\n\nPOI's, or \"points of interest,\" are locations you can visit, typically filled with enemies and goodies, some of which are impossible to build and can only be found in these or bought at traders, such as night vision goggles (so good), armor mods that give you defense against extreme cold, etc. If you take out the \"core\" of the base, you can even break down the entire base for scrap to use in building whatever you like! These bases seem to always have multiple turrets which can kill you very, very easily, even on the lowest of difficulties, so you might wait until you have an SV...more on those later.\n\n[h1]As Difficult as You Want it to Be[/h1]\nThis game is not masochistic torture porn like a lot of crafting/survival games. Or at least, it doesn't have to be. There's a difficulty slider you can fiddle around with when opening the game, letting you make enemies more powerful or weaker, giving yourself fancy goodies when you start or beginning with next to nothing (I actually did that one.), etc. There is quite a lot of customization and it allows people with different interests to have an experience closer to what will make them happy, as opposed to a uniform experience that will please some and alienate others. It gives you a level of freedom that is refreshing for the genre, though I do realize a few of these sorts of games have that feature. So for those who want to have a hellish time, you can do that...heck, you could even start yourself on a planet with no oxygen and terrible starting supplies if you want to really fight to live.\n\nOn the topic of difficulty and player preference, yes, you do drop everything you're carrying when you die. That tends to really annoy me a lot in games. I love making progress, and losing all my stuff I had on me is aggravating. The good news is that your items are marked on your HUD, they stick around in a little box where you died for about 25 minutes or so, you can respawn within maybe 100 yards or so of where you died by choice, and as long as you didn't go on a total suicide mission the first time, it should be easy enough to get your stuff back. I played well over 100 hours, and there's only one time I couldn't get my stuff back...and that was because I didn't know how to use the jump jets (jetpack) to move around in space...heh, more on space later.\n\n[h1]Mine, All Mine[/h1]\nI hate grind in games; despise it. That said, sometimes you can find a grind that mesmerizes you and sweeps you off your feet. Perhaps not everyone can experience that, but for me, it was the mining in this game. A friend and I would mine, and while drilling ore, we kept wanting to stop, but we just couldn't. We were watching the rock walls reshape and the ore pieces fall in chunks on the ground, and kept digging and digging. We actually hollowed out a massive ore deposit (just the two of us) with the starting drills, which took us about 3 hours. It went on a little longer than we would have liked, but we couldn't help ourselves. If mopping blood in Viscera Clean-Up Detail mesmerizes you or gives you a satisfying feeling, this might too, because it felt similar in terms of the level of satisfaction for me.\n\nLater on, you can build an \"HV,\" which is short for Hover Vessel. Essentially, it's a hovercraft, and they move quite quickly, serving as a nice means of speedy transport, and more importantly, slap some level 1 drills on the front in a smart layout, and you'll be tearing through the rocks and ore, automatically collecting it in a box/device on your HV in huge quantities. Zip back over to your base you've built, which is quick and easy, since you can move so fast in your HV, and store your goodies in boxes you can build and label with some nice storage space inside.\n\n[h1]Space, the Final Frontier[/h1]\nSmall Vessels, or \"SV\"s, are essentially space ships. You can build them, though you will need some parts, fuel, and oxygen to leave the planet. You can spend dozens of hours on a planet with plenty to do, and then when you build a ship, you design it yourself. It's actualy not difficult at all. While you could import a design easily, I preferred to make my own. As utilitarian as I am in these, there was this amazing since of pride and delight that I had from successfully constructing a tiny, laughably-designed SV, getting it to take off, making modifications, and finally leaving orbit! It was a total thrill and I was wide-eyed and giddy. I will never forget how good it felt getting into space, and just sitting there with my engines off, floating. Then I look, and there's the moon that's always been in the sky. Well, I fly right toward that sucker!\n\nI brought plenty of oxygen, and I stocked an adorable little mini-fridge with snacks for my trip. I found new ores that couldn't be mined on the starting planet, so I happily mine those, and rare equipment now becomes easier to make, improving what I could craft greatly. There were more points of interest there, too, which was fun, and a bunch of blue crystals. Now I'm master of the planet, [i]and[/i] the moon. Mind you, this is dozens of hours of content for me between the planet and moon. Finally, I decide I'll go to another planet, so I design a Capital Vessel \"CV.\" It's a warp-capable ship bigger than a house, and you can lay it out how you like! It was daunting, but I did it and loved the simple but useful end product. You can even make a landing bay and park your HVs and SVs inside it to transport to other planets!\n\nFinally, I warp to another world...and I'm basically done. I can go to other planets and moons, but there's nothing left to do except get more stuff. There is no new tech for me to build, and without honest story objectives, I'm essentially \"done\" in my playthrough. It feels a bit disappointing and empty at that point, but I'm a hard-ass with games, and will whole-heartedly say that I had a fantastic time with what there is to do in Empyrion. I'd play through it again from scratch sometime, I imagine. The usefulness and feeling of progress makes the game for me, and if you liked that about Subnautica, Empyrion might just be for you.", "timestamp_created": 1507255746, "timestamp_updated": 1507434369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 257, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860869646072387695", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26029819": {"recommendationid": "26029819", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993974726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 144073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67825, "last_played": 1709303970}, "language": "english", "review": "After spending over a thousand hours in this game (Most of it in multiplayer), I decided to sit down and write a review in the hopes that others can share in what has been an amazing experience for me. Empyrion is in its early stages but the developers have shown that they care a great deal about their product, and what they deliver is already a quality survival experience as close to \"The Martian\" as you can get. Empyrion provides much of the content that NMS promised, and fans of Firefly, EVE online, or Space Engineers who are looking for a more interactive, survival-oriented, story-driven experience full of emergent gameplay should have a great time here.\n\nThe crafting system is incredibly complex but also far more approachable than in Space Engineers, boasting thousands of unique items and mechanics that stand to help customize your efforts to keep breathing and build your way to the stars. Other players and the factions they create will develop personal relationships with you as you choose to share designs, resources, or arms in achieving goals together - such as travelling to dangerous PVP planets in search of rare ore, or in raiding any alien POI's you discover along the way (Most of my time on our server is spent cruising around in a cargo transport I designed for myself, looking to rescue players in tough situations or performing supply drops for newbies). And if you're worried about non-consentual PVP, be aware that you only need to avoid PVP flagged star systems and you will never have a problem. Rare ores can be obtained through trading with other players on the in-game marketplace!\n\nFor the solitary minded, you can build bases, small vessels, capital vessels, or import your favorite content from thousands of user-generated designs on the workshop. The blueprint factory system makes importing designs as easy as dumping resources into a menu, and submitting your own design to the workshop is equally simple.\n\nDevelopment is steady, with one major update happening about once every 30-60 days. The roadmap for what the devs intend to include is ambitious, but so far these guys say what they mean and do what they say. When they say a feature will be added, it gets added. The mechanics are in need of some balance and refinement and the planets are simple, but the developers are working hard and achieving much, and they do still find the time to go back and tweak things for the better quite often.\n\nIf you're a fan of sci fi, space, fantasy, survival, and designing your own architecture or spaceships, then for 20 bucks this game is a steal.", "timestamp_created": 1476455551, "timestamp_updated": 1476455745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.859823822975158691", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25202988": {"recommendationid": "25202988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010367135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 706, "last_played": 1472352807}, "language": "english", "review": "Empyrion: Galactic Survival is an early access open world space and survival game developed and published by Eleon Game Studios. You play as a human who blasts from space into earth in a survival pod. You can explore the planet, survive, gather resources, build bases and build things like gardens and fuel tanks, and build space ships. This review will cover the content, the developers engagement on the project, and the negatives.\n\n[h1] [b] Content [/b] [/h1]\nEmpyrion features a ton of content for the player. People refer to this game as 'No Man's Sky, but with 3x the content' and while I have not played that game, I can safely say this game successfully incorporates a variety of factors including survival, building, and exploration. But, evidently at this stage the developers have focused on more exploration and building than survival because there is an abundance of building and resources and a lot of planets to explore, but it severely lacks in survival elements. At the beginning of the game upon exiting your survival pod, the game provides you a play of a very well-structured tutorial. It teaches you the complete basics on surviving, how to gather resources, how to build bases, and how to build a ship. They are also very descriptive, sometimes in borderline with too much detail, but for the most part you learn a lot from it.\n\nI will briefly explain each component. The survival component includes a health bar, food bar, oxygen bar, and stamina bar. Each of these represent different things, so health is your characters health, oxygen depletes when you are in space or underwater, food is a necessity. Food automatically depletes, which so does stamina, but stamina can regenerate over time. I played only on a Player vs. Environment server and survival is quite basic, defending against a very scarce variety of enemies. Resources are large, but there is not an abundance of them and regular meteorites crash into planets providing resources. Each planet has different resources, which of some overlap, which means there is a good sense of freedom to explore and travel to get those materials. \n\nPlanets are diverse and beautiful. They all have different attributes like different environment colours, different terrain, and size varies. The interesting concept is that despite playing on a PvE server, some planets are PvP so if you are looking for the best of both worlds, the game allows you to experience it. Spaceships are disparate and are highly detailed. There are three types of spaceships, Capital Vessel, Small Vessel, and Hover Vessel. All have different attributes including external size, internal size and how much can you fit in there. I love the spaceships because they are not overly hard to build if you follow the tutorial, there are an abundance of spaceships thanks to the Steam Workshop, and they look beautiful.\n\nEmpyrion also incorporates a skill tree. This skill tree allows you to progress through levels and earn upgrade points to unlock better cockpits, or better weapons, or better ships, and so forth. There is plentiful amounts of skills, which differ, and provide a refreshing aspect as you progress further into the game. Notably, these skills include unlocking various things to help you base build. For instance, a base needs a constructor to transfer resources into materials or food, which also needs a fuel tank and a generator to power it. In other words, bases require different components to expand and operate. Base building is a great feature in this game and I think this really nails down the popularity with the game.\n\n[h1] [b] Developer Engagement [/b] [/h1]\nThe developers are incredibly ambitious and understand it cannot execute a roadmap similar to zombie survival games in which there is too much content over fixing and improving the core and performance of the game. Therefore, I have noticed that these developers are active and regularly respond to community queries and very regularly post updates on the status of their roadmap. For instance, today they put out a survey based off events at Gamescom which asks the community how much they play the game, single player or multiplayer, and what large feature do they want and what small feature do they want. In other words, it seems there core vision for the game is still in effect but they want to implement features and fixes based on community wants, which is a great touch to this game. \n\n[h1] [b] Negatives [/b] [/h1]\nPer the early access part of this title, I understand that a lot of features are relatively basic. For instance, there are no gun reloading animations and there are very few enemies to combat in PvE. Furthermore, performance is subpar as I have noticed FPS from 23 in drilling mines to 40 when flying. My graphical settings were on fastest instead of best, so the developers do need to further optimise the game. I am looking forward to watching this game progress in development.\n\n[h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1]\nEmpyrion is a strong early access title. It features an abundance of content that stem from survival to exploration to building. There is also a large amount of planets that have differing attributes to defining features from diverse resources to one planet being PvE and others being PvP. The developers are very responsive and driven to further work on this game. I did not notice any bugs, but I did notice the basic nature of many features and the lack in optimisation of performance. At $19.99, if you play with friends, I totally recommend this game. If you play single player, don't expect as much enjoyment but do expect at least a solid 30 hours of play. \n\n[h1] [b] Rating [/b] [/h1]\nI do not rate early access titles.\n\n[h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1]\n\t- The elegantly designed spaceships.\n\t- The entire mechanic of the game in which relates to exploration.\n\t- Disparate planets that differ.\n\t- Steam workshop.\n\n[h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1]\n\t- Many features are simple, which of some need to further expanded on.\n\t- Performance optimisation.\u000b\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

[SE 2.5m blocks for large and .5 for small]  This results in large builds with large blocks ending up much slicker and less blocky, It also means you need to place alot more blocks for the same size ship.\nThere is going to be a levelling up system and theres alot of blocks still missing in the game, but it has more blocks and items than SE does right now in pre-alpha so it can only get better from there.\nThe AI in the game is pretty good for there first version, alot of fun with the drones in space around the Xentor station, you can go to 3 planets and a moon at the moment, and asteroids,  the planets are being seperated at a later stage in development when the procedual map generator is put into the game.\nThe performance of this game on a good pc is awesome if your used to SE performance.\nThe developers are very friendly, Eleon Game Studio read there forum often and respond to alot of posts, its awesome to see that.\nLike SE and KEEN I wish Eleon the best with this game and I hope its very successful for them and I thank them for the hours of enjoyment I have ahead in survival. My current game is 4 weeks old has multiple big bases, a big ship, multiple small ships, stuff going on on all the bases, and its not lagging at all. Fantastic stuff. Playing on amd 9590 and 16g ram with r9 290.\n\nGame has alot of different creatures in it already, alot of them will attack you, be armed or suffer, there are alot of plant models already in the game, but you can see there are still alot more to come, like trees, you can collect all sorts of things, most of the plants you see around have a use and can be harvested, the creatures [ ai ] are pretty good for pre-alpha, a few of them are deadly, there are drones that hunt you if you go into particular areas.\nYou can collect meat from animals you kill, parts ammo and fuel from downed drones, you can build your base or ships block by block to whatever shape you like, Empyrion has alot of curved blocks already, it has interior decorative blocks as well, you can really replicate sci fi show ships with ease in Empyrion because of the extra time the developers have put into interior blocks, nice job devs.\nYou can build on the planet, under ground, in water, under water, or in space or on an asteroid or in an asteroid, so building is very free range.\nWater doesnt flow, yet.\nLava doesnt flow, yet.\nThe graphics are pretty good, DX9 or DX11, both look nice, alot of blocks are placeholders but still look pretty good, the game is high definition textures, and has a performance mode or quality graphics mode that it can be played in, the options for video are getting better every few weeks, the patches are big, alot of content and alot of bugfixes, the developers are very friendly and have added alot of player made structures to the game and my impression is they want more for there huge universe they need to fill.\nFlying mechanics in Empyrion are much more precise than SE, a little arcade like even, makes for much more enjoyable dogfights, alot more fun to fly ships in Empyrion in my opinion.\nHavent had much to do with the hover craft, built a couple , over the lakes there alot of fun to race, but I use an SV for survival hunting.\nHoping the developers get super filthy rich from this game and fully develop it, Empyrion will be a master piece when its completed.\n\nEDIT November 2016\n\nEmpyrion has had its multiplayer backend of code for the game completely overhauled , the focus has been on much larger universe/solar systems and more players in the game.\nEleon have done an outstanding job and we are seeing servers with up to 100 players on them now, the dedicated server software works on multicore CPUs and even multi CPU server systems giving Unity, Empyrions game engine immense processing power over pretty much all of its rival games in this genre.\nEmpyrion hass also had a new block system incorperated, and now it can host literally hundereds more blocks than it could before, Empyrion has had dozens of blocks added sinse my first review, new texture system, new game mechanics, over 100 new server rules, over 500 bugs squashed, its starting to introduce mechanical blocks now also, we have an Offline Protection block that is a rotor in development, shutters, doors, hangers doors, dozens of sizes with the unique block system Eleon have put into Empyrion, LCD screens repair blocks, auto miners, completely re-worked the humble HV so its much better for flight and Star Wars pod races are so realistic now its just awesome.\nIf you play this sort of game, Empyrion wont dissapoint you, its a steep learning curve, but only because the alpha game has so so much content, once you get the hang of it, more fun than you can poke a stick at !\nIm now at over 6000 hours and play Empyrion Everyday, best game ever made for me.\n\nEDIT... 2019\n\nDevelopment is still going strong, the game is evolving into something very special, Eleon are focusing on Mid game for most of this year, we now have wireless logistics and a new flight control system inbound, my hours now are around 15,000 or something the game is highly addictive.\nThis game has literally had a few thousand updates since 2014 when I joined the test crew, the updates now have more content and are just as frequent, but now we are starting to see the really big features get sorted out, if you would like to check out some of those thousands of updates here is the link, \nhttps://empyriononline.com/forums/patch-notes.7/\n\nMulti docking system should be in this year or early next year depending on bugs, the AI has taken on a life of its own in the last year or so, I cant see any games on Steam with as much content as Empyrion, for the same price or less.\nThe AI will continue to improve and updates to the AI will basically never stop.\nThe game has been in development for a long time, games in this genre with such huge hopes and dreams usually take over 10 years to complete, SC, ED, levels of complexity but Eleon are using a business plan like MCraft did and its been very successful and so the finances of the game stay solid for development, usually the longer an EA game goes on, the less chance of a proper full release where you get what you expected, not with Empyrion, you are getting far far more than was ever envisioned in 2012 when it was first thought up by its founder Luke.\nSo ignore the estimated development time on Steam, its simply wrong, and the specs of PC for the game are a little higher than whats posted on Steam also, do not try to run this game on intergrated graphics cards, you will cry. And then cry some more. Until you buy a 4GB video card to run it properly.\nThe game is so awesome, the devs are great to work with, take constructive critisism pretty well on there forum and listen to there playerbase, and they do the odd survey here and there to get a better idea of what players want, and players can still build POIs and ships for the developers tp be added to the vanilla game, giving the game AWESOME diversity through its structures.\n\nGrab a copy if your into space survival building games, its got a steep learning curve but once you nail that, its thousands of hours of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1438845511, "timestamp_updated": 1569962675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 222, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857456326484680176", "comment_count": 46, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73864316": {"recommendationid": "73864316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026888435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 10448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10034, "last_played": 1655621101}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Today is the day: we are leaving Early Access, starting into the post-Alpha development phase.\"\n\nSince when does post alpha = full release?!\n\nSpace legos are fun but, this is not a \"game\" yet.

The developers have fine tuned some aspects and dumbed down others.  I have 1500+ more hours played than what currently shows although during one of steam's updates or one of empyrions I lost them.  All in all I have 4500 hours of play through and though I love it, there is a definate love/hate relationship between us.  The game itself has not advanced quickly at all.  \n\nAs far as features and items and enemies being added to the game, there are only fine tuning changes that have been made.  There is a large arguement within the community about how the game should be developed and albeit the development team takes surveys and takes them seriously, the empyrion community or rather those that vote fought tooth and nail to have this game setup as a single player experience instead of the incredible multiplayer experience it should be.  Mind you it is only my opinion, but there are thousands of hours of play available in a multiplayer game, and with the features that are currently available this game has less than 40 as a single player title.  But back to basics, in the last three years the game has been fine tuned save things like lag shots happening in space constantly even though the development team claims its not a problem.  It is a huge problem in multiplayer PvP.  It makes fighting against another player almost pointless as you might as well flip a coin as to who is going to win with a shot to a player's cockpit through a ships hull that should be impossible.  Well friends and I have tested triangle counts, different specs and ships with every shape of block available to eliminate them and the reality is that as of now, that is not happening.  Since the developers seem to be set on making the community happy and the community voted a long time ago for single player the available servers are only as good as their server owners make them.  \n\nThe HWS servers are owned by people that work very closely with the developers and this can be seen as an advantage.  There are some hard working people out there putting servers up (Which they pay for by the way) and adding content to them that are not in development as far as I know.  Different server owners have come up with some incredible things but unless you are part of the HWS crowd, you don't really get much support.  So there is the disadvantage.  So to finalize, is this game worth the money?  At half price, This game is a must buy.  \n\nDo I think this game is going to be coming out anytime soon?  Sorry, I am laughing way too hard to give that an honest answer.  The game has no core and no heart.  What I mean by that is, if this was a single player experience, what is the point?  The game has no real begigning, no middle and no end.  Although the dev team has worked on creating some tutorials and some beggining missions, once you have a working capital ship that isn't made of straw you can defeat any and every enemy stronghold in the game.  As for multiplayer not having an end is a plus and the point is to conquer your enemies and take over everything.  At any rate, this game is far from being a finished title and major updates happen very, very slowly.  They joke in the commerical that people come here to avoid No Man's Sky's failures and when No Man's sky came out I would vouch that this was the better game.  However I wouldn't say that now.  One is definately better than the other.\n\nI hope you buy the title but be warned it has flaws and they might not go away.\nCheers!\n\n<Edited for the English Nazis by pressing return>", "timestamp_created": 1559987493, "timestamp_updated": 1585164193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 160, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852899432182312012", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106977489": {"recommendationid": "106977489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045145422", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 52209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51971, "last_played": 1688218600}, "language": "english", "review": "Mechanically very similar to space engineers, twith a few important differences.

I have spent maybe 700 hours of that just building and it has been a fun thing.  I have played since before versions i can't remember.  v 0.1xx something i think.  We started with very primitive blocks and certainly different rules and weights of gameplay.  As of current release today (0.8.02) this game has changed and improved in many ways.  \n   -- this game is still in Early Access, expect hiccups, imbalances, missing features -- \nI know that as a builder who has built maybe 60 projects but published only 6 or so that I must expect game bending/breaking features.  I am ok with this as i digitally signed an agreement to put up with this sort of thing.  I have many projects lost due to version changes that renders previous landsets unspawnable (yes one could spawn a new block in new version and copy old folder stuff over type thing but i'm ok with starting anew with fresh inspiration) but once saved as a blueprint the work is saveable.  \n\nSingle Player Survival:  I love this mode, getting to the point of hopping from planet to planet and back to your base has been reworked a lot over many versions.  It is nice now that Small Vessels can make short range warp hops while Capital Vessels are needed for the long warp jumps.  The thril of finding an enemy base and capturing it while off home world can't be explained until you've done it.   You build the CV, you load it with SV or two, you explore planet, you attack and loot enemy base, return to your CV, return to your Home Planet and deposit loot,  Re-fuel, Re-stock food, re-stock Ammunition, and make ready for next sortie.  Repeat 5-10 times.  Once you reach this point of fully stocking your base with all the resources you could need it loses the survival aspect and becomes a how can i make everything perfect stage.  The perfect fleet, the perfect set of bases, the perfect rows of SV and HV in case something happens...  -- back to the this is a developing game part --  The devs are always coming up with new stuff and a roadmap.  They ley the roadmap out to see and view if you so choose to partake.  I know in the future there will be more features coming so i'm not worried or put off yet.  \n\nMultiplayer:  I've spent a few hours and didn't enjoy it all.  I guess if ihad friends already it could be ok.  I spent most of my time being dead once i left safety.  I should give it a try again as it has improved i hear from early days when mounting dozens of each weapon type was a thing and making ships flying asteroids with gun ports.  \n\nThe future:  The future looks bright, great improvments to graphics, weather, enviromental factors.  (Remember when we could sit on top of our bare rocket motors/warp coils and not suffer radiation, heat damage!)  Planets can now be much larger with varied biomes that seem to make sense.  \n\nI could go on and on with many features, quirks etc, but it would get boring quickly reading it all.  I will summarize with:  This game is in Early Access, Beta yet is already so rich wtih features and behind the scenes wizardry that it is hard to think of it not succeeding in the end when it releases.\n\nThank you for reading this.", "timestamp_created": 1526151173, "timestamp_updated": 1526151271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851856350898742676", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22457468": {"recommendationid": "22457468", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997724945", "num_games_owned": 4619, "num_reviews": 174, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1460837810}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Empyrion - Galactic Survival[/b] is a space open world survival game with randomly generated planets and with heavy crafting and building elements. When I say open world, I really mean it, in the sense that if you have some sort of spacecraft you can fly across space and land on any planet you choose. \n\nThe game offers you two different game modes at the moment, creative and survival. Creative is what you\u2019d expect, build and do whatever you like, your imagination is your limit. As for the survival mode, you\u2019re able to choose different seeds to create your worlds and you can also choose where you\u2019d like to begin your adventure, in a more friendly planetnet with a breathable atmosphere or in a more deadly desert planet that is perfect for hardcore players. Since I\u2019m not really someone who is very creative or that enjoys building, survival is always what I go for in these types of games.\n\n[h1][b]The core:[/b][/h1]\n\nOn survival mode you\u2019ll find yourself looking for oxygen, food and other resources. The game provides a pretty in-depth tutorial covering survival, base and ship building. Food can be acquired by hunting, gathering or farming and it can get spoiled. This can be prevented by either cooking or by storing food on a fridge. The oxygen can be obtained by placing a O2 generator on water, which then will begin producing bottles of oxygen. Resource gathering is pretty simple since you start with the tools needed, simply aim and click with the right tool to the place you want to mine. Still, every tool requires a certain type of charges to use so be careful not to waste all your charges before you\u2019ve gathered the resources needed to craft more. One thing I really like about the game is the fact that when you discover a ore deposit, it will be marked on your map which is a 3D representation of the planet you\u2019re in. If you check the map, you can also see how many, and what type of deposits you still haven\u2019t found on the planet.\n\nEmpyrion also has some other mechanics which make it somewhat more challenging and engaging, such as stamina, a jetpack and blueprint \u201ctrees\u201d. You use stamina while sprinting so you have to keep an eye out in case you\u2019re being followed by some mobs and run out of stamina. Nonetheless, you still have your jetpack which, despite making you unable to run, allows you to escape tricky situations including when you get trapped while mining downwards (never dig downwards). By performing simple actions such as gathering resources or crafting you\u2019ll gain experience points, these will allow you to level up and gain points which you can use to unlock certain blueprints/recipes on some sort of \u201cskill tree\u201d menu. \n\nAssuming you have the required blueprints and materials, crafting is pretty straight simple since the game tells you what a certain item needs in order to be crafted. Building is likewise pretty straightforward, you just select on your hotbar the block you want to place and click where you want it, and you can also fly a drone to help you build in more tricky spots where your character can\u2019t properly reach. If farming is an option in a survival game, I tend to go that route, thus I must say I quite enjoy how farming plays out in Empyrion. Basically you place \u201cgrowing plot\u201d blocks, place whatever seed you want and then you have to make sure that a light source is 2 blocks above it. The plant won\u2019t grow immediately of course so you can go on another errands while you wait for your crops to be ready to harvest.\n\nOne minor complaint I have with the game is the fact that there are no reload animations. Still, I\u2019m sure this is due to the Early Access nature of the title and that is something that will be implemented soon. That said, combat is serviceable at best, you just aim and shoot, the weapons have pretty much no recoil or authentic feel to them and I believe this is something that should be worked on. Despite the dynamic day and night cycle (where if you look at the sky you can see the other planets far off), I didn\u2019t notice any change in mobs behaviour which kind of disapointed me.\n\n[h1][b]Verdict:[/b][/h1][list]\n[*]Huge amount of things to craft\n[*]Space and planetary exploration\n[*]Overall decent performance - except a few slowdowns when visiting new areas\n[*]Well done ambient and background sound effects + pretty great main menu theme\n[*]Detailed tutorial, which welcomes newcomers\n[*]Dated visuals - as far as I care, the game looks somewhat dated\n[/list]\n\nEmpyrion - Galactic Survival is the closest thing to what I want from a game that combines space and planetary exploration. Even if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t like building, you can just import creations from other players from the Workshop, in the form of blueprints, and get them in your world.

Starting stranded on an alien planet, with only a couple resources gathered from your escape pod, you'll have to hunt, build and fight to survive. Since there is no real main story, players are free to go anywhere and do as they please from the very beginning.\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 [b]The Good Side[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*][b]The final frontier, full of possibilities[/b]\nThe galaxy is filled to the brim with things to do, discoveries and dangers. Procedurally generated, thousands of solar systems await. Many alien factions have each their territories, reputation criteria, trading habits and distinct style - being friends with some means being disliked by others. Locations are present in each planet and solar system, ranging from stations, to derelict ancient ships, abandoned labs and more. Be a paladin and free the galaxy from tyrants like the Zirax Empire, or just mind your business on a remote system, or again become a trader - the choices are endless.\n\n[*][b]Engineering is hard, if you want it to be[/b]\nEmpyrion has many depth levels for all player needs. The basic survival and crafting systems are friendly enough, as they have many quality of life and automation features. For those in need for a deeper experience, there are systems such as custom circuit-building with logic ports, individual configuration of each machine behavior, control groups and advanced parts. It's not that complex to build a working space vessel or base - but it can become so if one wishes, while remaining accessible for those wanting a simpler gameplay.\n\n[*][b]An extra coat of paint[/b]\nI have rarely seen open-galaxy games with this scale and depth, having so relatively few problems. Empyrion is excellent at this with no game-breaking problems, generally a good polishing level. There are some minor and moderate inconveniences from time to time, however. If we want to make a direct comparison, No Man's Sky is much more broken than this game.\n\n[*][b]Wait, this was just the tutorial? You joking, right?[/b]\nThe tutorial section of this game is probably the longest I have ever seen, lasting multiple hours at the very least. It does cover very well all the mechanics, from simple to the most advanced, making you ready to face what the Galaxy has to throw at you. It is exhaustive... but also exhausting. Still, you will definitely need it as figuring out certain things alone is pretty difficult. \n[/list]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2214401583\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 [b]The Bad Side[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*][b]What is the life of one race, compared to the stretches of cosmic time?[/b]\nThis title lacks heavily on endgame stages progression. Once you acquire the necessary technology to build a spacecraft, there won't really be any more real progression from there. Alien worlds and distant stations will offer great challenge, only to find the same items you could on the starting solar system. You will find yourself with a potent capital ship, only to soon realize there isn't anything to look forward to.\n\n[*][b]Not entirely done yet[/b]\nDespite a good polishing level, Empyrion does feel unfinished and rough in several occasions too. For instance, certain resources, crafting materials or items will not have any use, being placeholders part of something never implemented. NPCs found around do not talk most of the time, react, or even die at all in some cases. Hell, you can scrap people with your recycler tool and turn them into cash, really. There are many small things that make it partially feel like not everything was fully integrated as intended.\n\n[*][b]Fool's Errands[/b]\nThe game does have a quest system, entirely optional, that unfortunately has trash rewards unless very early in game. Such quests can be a decent variation but in the end become a chore without a real point in being done at all.

A handy planetary map displays found points of interest, allows custom markers, and also shows territory borders of factions. The same goes for space maps, only in a 3D way. While exploring you will find materials, locations, enemies and environment hazards such as radiation, heat and more. Some zones will not be accessible easily until you have the proper protections. Until late game exploration is definitely rewarding in terms of loot, experience and knowledge. \n\n[b]Crafting[/b]\nIs done via a series of menus, and generally with the aid of machinery such as constructors. Once your base is set, containers are automated to transfer resources between each other, other than automatically making byproducts for the end component, from raw materials. It is a comfortable system that removes much of the tedium often tied to crafting in this genre. Some configuration is needed for this to work properly but once done all is largely automated.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nCan be in first or third person, and uses an array of turrets, ranged weapons and tools. From simple bullet pistols to potent plasma cannons, there are different weapons for diverse needs, some more effective against shields, or armor for example. Enemies are generally lethal and inflict severe wounds and illnesses often - combat is dangerous in Empyrion. Attacks to your base from hostile factions can happen, but most of combat is done in dungeons and space, with other vessels. This latter one is disappointing, slow and clunky though. It is the main source of XP to level, and a nice diversion from building.\n\n[b]Building[/b]\nIs done using a grid and blocks of all imaginable shapes and sizes. The variety of shapes and functions allows the creation of complex structures. Terrain is freely manipulable to build underground if needed, and almost everything can be dismantled, destroyed and harvested - from trees to entire cities. Some faction structures will need you destroying their Core before you can start dismantling, and the same goes for player bases.

However, by the end of the 24th century, the Earth will be far from being a paradisiacal place...Overpopulation, runaway climate change and natural resource exhaustion had lead to political instability, riots and looting, war over resources, hundreds of millions of refugees, severe droughts, famines, mass extinctions of many species, and ecosystem collapse.\n\nIn the year 2402, a team of researchers discovered the wreck of a starship in the Antarctic, hidden up to this time under a thick cover of ice. Apparently, the ship belonged to a technologically highly advanced alien race and was powered by an unknown form of energy. Also a star was recovered whose symbols were similar to those used in ancient cosmologies to describe \"Empyrion\" \u2013 the land of plenty. The star map seemed to point to a location far away in the Andromeda Galaxy about 2.5 million light-years away.\n\nGiven the increasingly desperate situation on Earth, the \"United Council of Humanity\" decided to focus the remaining resources on Earth on a unified effort to build a fleet of starships with the aim of establishing contact with the mysterious aliens and finding Empyrion. All ships were equipped with an alien energy cell to power their experimental hyperdrives.\n\nFinally, in the year 2473, the fleet of starships is ready and you are the first commander of the frigate \"Helios\". After you activate the hyperdrive, however, something goes wrong an unknown force takes control of your ship... Subsequent to reappearance from hyperdrive, your ship is disabled and drifts in the orbit of an unknown planet somewhere in the Andromeda Galaxy far away from the destination that was indicated by the map. You have lost contact with all other ships of your fleet. Gravity pulls your disabled ship towards the surface where it crashes.\n\nThe impact separates the ship into three pieces, they plumment to the planet and all crewmembers are killed. You are the only survivor. Find a way to leave this hostile planet and uncover the mysteries of Empyrion.

It sounds like a lot so let me break it down in categories and give my opinion about them:\n\nExploration:\n   The exploration side of things in Empyrion is fairly enjoyable, it is entirely procedurally generated (Not the Poi's tho), so\n   you have an entire GALAXIE to explore! There is a lot. Altough...the planets become a bit boring after you've explored a \n   few solar systems (Cuz you've basically seen every type of planet).\n   Speaking of types of planets, here are some of the types:\n   Radioactive planets\n   Ice planets\n   Lava planets\n   Tropical planets\n   Sand planets\n   And temperate planets\n   There might be more, these are the ones I remember.\n   Oh...and there are also moons.\n   So the exploration is a positive point.\n\nSurvival:\n   There are a few survival elements, but its not the main focus, don't go in looking for the type of survival elements like\n   Green Hell. You have to watch your health, you have to eat, if you are not on a breathable planet, you have to watch your \n   O2.\n   There is no need to drink, but in the recent updates, the food you eat give a LOT less nutrition, so it definitely is a big \n   focus cuz you run out of food super fast.\n   There also is a good healing system, there are a lot of different injuries and diseases, and there is different items to heal \n   specific wounds. \n   Survival elements : Positive point.\n\nProgression system:\n   Now this is...not that great. You have a classic levelling system, gain enough XP, you get a level. But the XP gathering \n   system is bad, the only way to gain levels fast is trough raiding and fighting alien outposts. everything else gives little to \n   no XP. \n   Also, there are only 25 levels, each level gives you some points you can spend to learn new tech in multiple categories. \n   But getting to level 25 when you have some decent gear is very fast, I guess that if you are new to the game, it will take \n   you max around 20 hours, probably even less.\n   Progression system : Negative point, add more levels.\n\nCombat system:\n   Also...not that great.\n   You have a decent number of weapons, but the only ones you really need are the Shotgun and the Sniper, oh and maybe \n   a rocket launcher. Other than that, the Assault Rifles, the Pistols and any other guns are utterly useless (In my opinion). \n   There is also no melee combat in this game.\n   So how do the weapons feel, well the enemies are VERY easy to kill, even the toughest are easy with a Tier 2 Shotgun. So \n   you can take out a horde easily. And the AI is kinda dumb.\n\nAI:\n   Speaking of AI...not good.\n   The AI is not very smart, they just stand there trying to shoot you, wich they rarely do.\n   There are multiple alien factions, the Polaris ( Wich you are nice too at the beginning), the Talons (Nice too), the Zirax \n   (The only on i think you start off not friendly with), there are also two more alien factions, but i have never encountered \n   them, so i can't tell. The only ones you will fight against mainly, are the Zirax, and they are easy to kill.\n   There is also a honor system, you can go to friendly to bad with a species if you kill one of them or if you harvest \n   ressources in their territory.\n   So AI: Negative point.\n\nBuilding!:\n   Alright, the building...is...GREAT! You can build bases block by block, you can build hover vessels, small vessels and the \n   huge capital vessels. And all that from scratch! There is so much different types of blocks, different angles. Its just so \n   good. It is the main focus of the game, and is kinda what is holding the game together, whitout the building, the game \n   would be incredibly short, but you can loose hours trying to build a badass Capital vessel. There are also warp drives, \n   shields and a lot of weapons for your ships and bases.\n   So if you like building, you'll love Empyrion's building.\n\nShips:\n   The ships control well, and it is a blast fighting with your ships. Here is a lot to say, so im just gonna let you discover it by \n   yourself :).\n   But it is a positive point.\n\nGraphics:\n   Not bad, not good.\n   The graphics are outdated, they haven't updated them  a lot since the release in 2015, so the models are not very good, \n   the textures don't look great and the lighting and effects look bad. Its not a big bummer for me, but is definitely not \n   photorealistic looking.\n   Negative point.\n\nMultiplayer:\n   I have played half of my hours in multiplayer and it makes the game better, it lags a bit, but once you get going, it is easy \n   and very enjoyable.\n   Positive point.\n\nAnd finally, the Steam workshop.\n   Now this is also one of the best things about the game, you can upload mods and any construcion you made, so you can \n   find pretty much any ship, from a lot of franchises, like Star Trek, Star Wars, Halo and much more. If you buy this game, \n   you have to take a look at the workshop, there are 100 000 mods on it approximately.\n   So definitely a good point.\n\nFinal note:\n   Empyrion is a good game, so for any fan of sci-fi or building or exploration, you should check out this game. Another \n   thing is that there is almost no story, so don't go in expecting to find much.\n   So imma give this game a 7.5/10\n   \n", "timestamp_created": 1615761024, "timestamp_updated": 1615761024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.8446197509765625", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41524491": {"recommendationid": "41524491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259746326", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 10034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7167, "last_played": 1624824372}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome for people that love building and creating.

Some are good and some are bad and every once in a while I find one that really just surprises me at how good it is....Empyrion is one of those that has surprised me at just how good it is.\n\nThe survival aspect of the game is great....it has some of the usual aspects of most sandboxes such as mining, leveling, crafting, farming, base/ship building and exploration.  Most of these are similar to other games so I will touch on each of these briefly.\n\n[h1]Mining[/h1]\nMining is done by scouting out the planet and a scanner locating deposits. Once a suitable deposit of ore is found you use a drill to extract the ore. It does take some time to mine much like most sandboxes, but oddly it seems more satisfying in Empyrion to me than other games even though I cannot pinpoint exactly why. Once you are done with the drill you can then press \"T\" to pickup the mined ore to take back to base from processing said ore into ingots.\n\n[h1]Leveling/Tech Tree[/h1]\nThere is leveling and a tech tree that go hand-in-hand.  Basically, you start out at level 1 and as you do certain tasks suchs as mining, building or farming you gain experience towards the next level. You also gather points that you can spend learning new things to craft via the Tech Tree in the game. This is broken up into various tabs such as Hover Vessel, Space Vessel, Capital Vessel, Base, Decor and a few others. So each time you level you get to learn new craftable items. While this is not something new, it is still great fun! \n\n[h1]Crafting[/h1]\nCrafting is done via Constructors. Constructors are large multi-block structures that craft items for you. These constructors come in various sizes and versions. At the start of the game you get a simple \"Survival Constructor\" and as you progress through the game you gain access to create more advanced constructors.  The more advanced constructors are slightly faster and the top tier constructor allows for auto-assembly of items by automatically constructing pre-requisite items for whatever item you may want to build. It saves quite a bit of time.\n\n[h1]Farming[/h1]\nYou can farm in the game via seeds, growth boxes and grow lights. You simply put a box down place a grow light over the box and plant the seed and over time plants will grow and produce food. You can grow things such as tomatoes and wheat to more exotic plant life found in the game. You can then use the food you harvest in a Food Processor to create food some food is simple one item recipes while some are more complex and give extra bonuses.\n\n[h1]Base/Ship Building[/h1]\nThis is one of the areas I love in the game. It's your typical build a base, build power, build a support system for you and your base. There are some great blocks to use for building such as curves and angles like most sandbox games along with turrets, that are both automated or manned, O2 generation, water filtration, medical bays, cargo boxes and various other exciting things. \n\nShip building is probably my favorite aspect of the game. You can build various ships such as Hover Vessels (HV), Space Vessels (SV) and Capital Vessels (CV). Each of these are as you expect, HV's simply hover over the ground and allow you to move around the planet faster than walking. SV's allow you to fly around the planet and even exit the planet's orbit and fly around a specified area around the planet including asteroid belts around the planet and any moons that the planet may have. CV's are the largest ships and allow you to add warp drives to them that allow you to visit other planets and systems. CV's also allow you to dock SV's to them so you can use your CV to transport SV's to other planets for exploration.\n\n[h1]Exploration[/h1]\nThis is another great aspect to the game. When starting out you start on a single planet and can explore this planet finding alient life, alien bases, attack drones of various types, ore deposits, plant life and other players.  What I think sets Empyrion apart from some of the other sandbox games is the existence of numerous planets each with its own type of plants, aliens, POI's and ores.  Some items can only be found on these planets and are required to fully craft everything in the game, so it makes for great fun hopping in a Capital Ship and warping to another planet and exploring it.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd highly suggest Empyrion as it just does everything right and since it is still pre-alpha (surprisingly because the game is well polished) I can't wait to see what awaits the game in the future.  With what seems to be a very active dev team I feel purchasing this game would well be worth it if you enjoy sandbox style games or even if you just like space-based games that allow you to fly and build ships no matter how large. If you are looking for a great sandbox...give Emyprion a shot, I am sure glad I did and I'm pretty sure you would too.", "timestamp_created": 1456504104, "timestamp_updated": 1456504320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842394471168518066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32404858": {"recommendationid": "32404858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049490615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 87620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21648, "last_played": 1691038017}, "language": "english", "review": "///It's been fun but it seems this review has been buried by users and the powers that be.

If this is how easily good reviews go down even with the new regulations in place then whats the point of even bothering to type one. Review below for all those who can even find this.///\n\n(i refuse to make the low hanging fruit joke about this game comparing to another very similar one)\n\nNot gonna lie, the SURVIVAL CRAFTING EARLY ACCESS SANDBOX is gonna turn people away but i do wish that anyone who reads this review gives this game a shot.\nThis game is what no ma.....*ahem*...this game accurately represents the embodyment of what survival games all collectively wish to be eventually, a whole heap of amazing. A little forewarning though, this game WILL be compared to way bigger and more feature filled titles such as Space Engineers and will probably be eclipsed by the latter till somthing outstanding happens, till then i'll review the game as everyone should by stating the pros and cons in a very fair and unbiased way.\n\nPreaching aside, now for the thing you came here for...\n\nPROS:\n- Full creative freedom to construct the most epic buildings, hovercraft, small spacecraft, space stations, and capital spacecraft all with a staggering ammount of blocks of various shapes and misc gadgets.\n- Very intricate crafting system.\n- Plenty of weapons and tools at the players disposal from hand held to ship mounted.\n- Expansive playing field.\n- Raid alien structures many which are armed with laser turrets, alien infantry, and airborne autonomous drones and can contain the best weapons in the game along with crafting items for a possibly needed boost of progress.\n- Satasfying number of planets to explore with some having moons and all having previously mentioned alien structures.\n- Planets feel alive with their atmosphere, fauna, and flora.\n- Workshop full of creative people and their every vessel.\n- Very player friendly developers who not only strive to complete their game but let the community have a hand in developing it by creating buildings and starships that have in fact made it into the game as prefabs or NPC vessels.\n- A \"to do\" list that will make jaws drop.\n\nCONS: (note all cons that are rendered null will be removed)\n- Not the greatest graphics wise (though people like me can live with what others can not)\n- Foot soldiers somtimes have an all knowing on where the player is when being elsewhere in a building or ship\n- Enemies who bite and scratch have a rather bologna range for their attacks on occasion, happens mostly when an enemy strikes as you're backing away.\n- Can't visit the poles of the planet (this is very justified with a little research and plans to remove this soon).\n- Worlds have moved from procedural generation to premade landscapes that, while awesome in their own right, severely limit planet variation from infinity to a few. The first thing ever that i genuinely hate about this game.\n\nThis game went from a \"meh ill give it a shot because i can't run space engineers\" to \"omg i'm gonna tell everyone about this\" in about a day of gameplay and ive had an increasing amount of fun ever since. This game is deffinately going somwhere in terms of development and dispite me probably going to be far past done and bored with the game when multiple solar systems makes the scene i will still continue to cheer the devs on as they potentially stamp out no mans sk*forced coughing*.....other survival games.\n\nEmpyrion is an adventure you should consider embarking on and do try out the carebear tears flavored oxygen too.\n\n8 bottles of lizard mule milk out of 10\n\n(EDIT1) I should probably make note that the dev team isn't this huge studio that can produce updates like theres no tomorrow so a modicum of understanding should be had. If this turns you away then so be it but constantly complaining about the state of the game isn't going to do anything for anyone especially if people give vague and illegitimate feedback. I do not speak for Eleon but i can safely say they are pumping out fixes, updating whenever they can by reading constructive feedback, and ensuring the brightest future for the game.\n\n(EDIT2) Despite the recent plummet in ratings i still think this game is headed for greatness. I know a lost cause when i see one and empyrion is nowhere close quite yet. Reccent changes have not been entirely favorable but this subtracts nothing from the bigger picture.

I can't overstate how amazing it is for that kind of play.\n\nIt is an utter and embarrassing failure at providing a survival experience beyond the first 2-5 hours, depending on whether or not you rush/whether or not you're good at survival play. I wouldn't be surprised if there are people who can go from crash landing to flying around in space in 30-odd minutes.\n\nLong version:\n\nThe game's primary draw is ship building. I know that sounds weird, since it seems to consider itself a survival game, but it isn't at all a survival game. Enemies (which are members of some kind of xeno race with so little personality they didn't bother to name it) have essentially no AI, and most put up little resistance as I rampaged through their strongholds taking everything of value. Some of them inexplicably one shot me until I got the right armor, and others stood there doing nothing as I killed them. As a whole they're not much of a threat.\n\nAfter a few hours I had reliable sources of oxygen, food, fuel, and crafting materials. I made my way into the air, then into space, and built a capital ship. It was ugly and utilitarian, but I learned some important things about design as I went. I took it into another system and beat down an enemy drone boat or two, which was fun the first couple of times. The problem there is that a cheap, agile fighter with a few gatling guns can easily wipe out any enemy space force. Why bother with an expensive capital vessel? I started to get bored.\n\nIn disgust I went back to my home planet and gathered materials, then started playing around with new ship ideas.\n\nIt. Was. A. Fucking. Blast. \n\nYou have no idea. And not a short term blast...this lasted for a couple hundred hours. I wrote down ideas and drew models of ships and built them. I couldn't wait to get home from work and try something new. Finally my ideas were too big to be done in an evening; they took days and weeks of planning and play. It was like when Minecraft was new, except you get to actually fly the machine you've built. \n\nThis is where Empyrion shines. You have all these parts, some of which are purely cosmetic, so you can customize the look and function of your craft. There are even ways of setting up triggers for events to automate certain things in your ship. Force fields. Giant guns. Various types of lights.\n\nInstead of building a bunch of specific types of block, you have a generic type that can be customized however you want. A steel cube can become a cylinder, or a curved corner piece, or dozens of others. It's a great way of doing things. Forget having to craft steps or whatever. Empyrion puts few barriers between you and the expression of your ideas. There's a creative mode, but I didn't bother, since survival was already so easy, and I'd already gone to the effort to gather a ton of resources.\n\nAs for survival style play, the framing is certainly here for that. This could be the best game of its kind, in my opinion. Boot up Astroneer and see how little say you have in how your industrial machinery is configured. Try Deep Rock Galactic and see that you can't alter your base in any way. Nothing I've seen even comes close to the control you have in Empyrion.\n\nSome thoughts on Empyrion's future:\n\n1. These guys need to decide what their game is. When you get in and see just how well the base/ship building features are, compare the love that went into them with the abysmal state of the rest of the game. The animations (what few are there) are amateur. The art is largely generic. The sound? Please. Put on some Netflix while playing this one; you won't miss much. It's a bizarre juxtaposition. It's like finding incredible FPS mechanics in a Tetris clone. The game has a massive and un-acknowledged identity crisis.\n\n2. They should give us a plot, and not some generic scifi horse shit. Find someone who knows how to write. This game deserves that.\n\n3. Every aspect of the xenos needs to be rebuilt. They're an insult. There were games with better AI during the first Clinton administration. Enemies should work together, fight back against you, build bases and ships, mine resources, and all of the other things you're doing. They're too static.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1521258073, "timestamp_updated": 1521258073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841867744922637939", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149261476": {"recommendationid": "149261476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126921446", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 119262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2758, "playtime_at_review": 48874, "last_played": 1713790040}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to be honest I've not played a game this fun since Rebel Galaxy or Vanilla World of Warcraft back in 2004.\n\nSomething about Empyrion feels very immersive. I think it's the hunger your character gets, I think it's all the various status effects you can get, the need for oxygen in your space suit. Maybe it's the fact that you can build a ship from a planet surface, fuel it, put whatever parts you want on it, then take off enter the atmosphere and keep going right on up right into space.\n\nOnce in space can then warp to a nearby moon for planet in that solar system (with a Small Vessel equipped with a warp drive) .

It's better than Eve Online, it's better than Starpoint Gemini 2, better than X3: Terran Conflict, better than Star Citizen, and honestly it's better than Bethesda's new Starfield.\n\nThey're bugs but personally I've not experienced very many. I once got a terrain bug on one of my bases after I took my single player saved game and went into creative mode, I saved the game before taking myself out of creative mode - when I came back the terrain had changed and my base near water was now not near water. The game developers warn you about this happening when you go into Creative. I've experienced more bugs on multiplayer than single player 'Vanilla' / Default version. Most of the bugs I've experience seem to be server specific, related to quest not completing, or have been around for 5+ years. I only know they've been around that long because I play with a veteran who has played for 6 years.\n\nI look high and low for good games to play. PS5, XBox X, gaming computer are all at my disposal.

Before trying this, I thought No Man's Sky (the one in 2020, not the launch one) was the top that these types of games can reach.

Every block type has its mass and HP. Thrusters use power, generators use fuel. You need oxygen. All machines need power to operate, and can be interconnected together using interface itself, without needing to build blocks that represent logic gates or wires. You can create blueprints which act sort of like prefabs, so you just instantiate a blueprint with enough materials and voila; also, if you don't like building, you get a healthy number of built-in prefabs.\nBest of all, harvested materials last a LONG time so no need to go on grindy trips just to grab more ore or whatever.\nYou'll get attacked by factions that are unfriendly to you, but you can increase/decrease your reputation with them to change this. \nAll in all, I am 25h in at the moment of writing this review, and I've barely scratched the surface.

In E: GS you begin your fight for survival on a barren, desert planet called Omicron next to your escape pod which is beyond repair. In the distance you see the remains of your Capital ship and exploring the planet not only reveals ore deposits but it also reveals strange structures and hostile drones wandering the planet. \n\nNow you're probably thinking why on Earth should anyone be interested in yet another Early Access game, simply put E: GS does something no other survival game, to my knowledge, has done; it gives you three entire planets to explore as well as the ability to travel around in Space. The next thing that might spring to mind for you is how is this any different to Space Engineers? E: GS is fundementally different to SE, E: GS is more focused on the Survival side of things whereas SE is more focused on the creativity in building side of things, plus SE doesn't have planets. \n\nSince some of this game's issues are more serious than others I'll split my negative section into two, the first section having a much larger impact on my overall verdict than the second.\n\n+E: GS manages to add something new to an already crowded genre and it does it reasonably well\n+You're given a great deal of freedom in regards to crafting bases, vehicles etc. So long as you have the key components for whatever it is you're building (key components are listed by the starting block for each thing) you can add whatever you want and make it look however you want it to look and still be able to use it, though practicality is often something worth considering with vehicles\n+Speaking of starting blocks, each large project (i.e. a base, a ground vehicle, a small cruiser or a capital cruiser) has a corresponding starter block which provides the ship's foundations. A starter block gives you access to a menu detailing your project's stats, such as power consumption, but it also gives you a list of the components which your project MUST have in order to function, such as a fuel tank or a cockpit\n+There are already a lot of different items which can be crafted ranging from tools and weapons to thrusters and generators\n+The three planets are all very different to each other, each one with its own distinct appearance as well as different creatures and plants\n+The game's controls are, for the most part, good though using the mouse for turning in vehicles sometimes feels a tad bit sluggish\n+The devs are already updating the game frequently, hopefully that'll continue throughout the game's development\n+E: GS already features multiplayer and there are plans to improve it over the course of the game's development process\n+The four planets are procedurally generated. What does this mean? While the four planets will always be the same, everything on the planet's surface will be randomized everytime you play with a different seed, e.g. where resources can be found and where enemies spawn\n\n+/-E: GS' graphics aren't awful but they aren't exactly easy on the eye either, it doesn't take away from the game as a whole (hence it's in the neutral section) but considering the fact there are currently no solid plans to improve the game's graphics it is somewhat disappointing\n\n[h1]Major Negatives:[/h1]\n\n-Crafting items is unbelievably tedious, which is a problem in a game where so much of the gameplay is based around crafting things. Every major item, such as a generator, requires several different components for you to make it, some of these components require other components to make them, all of your components require some sort of ingot or equivalent item and each ingot has to be made from the ore. At face value it isn't awful but when you add into the mix the fact that you can only craft one type of item at a time, the fact that most things take between 5-20 seconds to craft one unit of and the fact that the crafting machines have small inventories for you to store raw materials as well as completed items it starts to become clear why E: GS' crafting system is its biggest problem\n-The four currently available worlds feel empty, apart from the occasional hostile structure or drone and the creatures that inhabit these worlds there is literally nothing to see on the worlds other than the ore in the ground. Futhermore, to counteract this ore deposits are very spread out, a nice idea in theory but frustrating when a round trip to get more ore takes 10 minutes while you're still on foot\n-Despite the fact that silica is one of the most important ingredients in crafting (used in some capacity to make pretty much every major component) it's seemingly incredibly rare which is rather frustrating when you run out of it and have no means of finding more\n\n[h1]Minor Negatives:[/h1]\n\n-Unlike in Space Engineers, colliding with terrain in a vehicle has no effect on the terrain though it does still damage your vehicle\n-There's currently very little in the way of character customisation\n-Sound effects are pretty hit and miss as to whether or not they sound realistic and apart from on the main menu there's no music in the game\n-The in-game menu can't be accessed while the game is paused which means if you wish to tweak your settings or controls you can't do so unless you want to risk not pausing your game\n\nVerdict:\nWorth Purchasing On Sale (6.5/10)\n\nE: GS is a good survival game which gives you a lot of freedom when it comes to building things and surviving but it's currently let down by its tedious crafting system.  E: GS has a lot of potential and hopefully the game will only get better as time goes on but for now, wait until a sale unless you're willing to look past the game's major issues.\n\n[b]Review Copy Provided.[/b]\n\n[i]No drama, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/justreviews]Just Reviews.[/url][/i]\n\nEl K.", "timestamp_created": 1439408042, "timestamp_updated": 1441320723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 193, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840379297733306885", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112288390": {"recommendationid": "112288390", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968595115", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 14377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14377, "last_played": 1647375509}, "language": "english", "review": "It pains me to do this.

They have a good game progression, splitting the stages between on foot, HV, SV, CV, multi-planet.\n\nThe game gets almost unplayable laggy near spawned in structures.

Then kaboom. Two drones, one laser, one plasma, blew my ship to shreds and I am now floating in free space with nothing but a handful of emergency rations and the limited oxygen supply in my space suit. A silouette of what appears to be a research station just outside the nearest asteriod belt catches my eye and I immediately turn towards it purging the last few pounds of O2 in my space suit to gain forward velocity. The two drones lurk behind me relentlessly firing.\nAs I get closer to the research station, I notice it's heavily armed with auto plasma turrets and AI drones. I am almost out of O2 now, the immediate future feels very grim at this time. I push on. If I could just sneak past the enemies and slip into the space station, I could probably find an O2 station and a few mre rations to get me by temporarily. I'm approaching the near vicinity of the turrets detection range now and all turrets begin attacking in sync. Now I'm pissed. They blew up the ship I spent hours perfecting, then chased me all the way through the asteroid field, and are now joining forces with this hostile facility in a mutual effort to end my existence. I'm now almost completely out of O2, so I use the last of it flying around the turrets in circles until they literally shoot each other trying to hit me as I purposely time the cycle of their shots to dodge at the right time. But what their scanners didn't pick up is that this man is Chuck Norris. So I destroyed the AI core and replaced it with my own, and powered up my new space base :) \n\n\n\nIf you are a fan of sci-fi entertainment and voxel based sandbox games, buy this game now. \n\nFirst of all, this is one of the few early access games out there that is not only regularly updated but actively developed by the dev team. Now for the content review.\n\nEmpyrion is a free roaming sandbox game, where you fight for survival in an open universe. You begin the game plummeting through the atmosphere in a small escape pod watching the surface of the planet you chose get closer and closer. After crashing down sometimes on land or at the bottom of an ocean, you leave your vessel behind and begin your journey.\n\nIn Empyrion, you can freely build bases, hovercraft, space vehicles, galactic space travel vessels, even space stations or asteroid mining facilities. The sky is the limit, as you can easily build anything you can imagine using the unique construction system. The beautiful part about buiding is the simulated physics. For example, if you have too much weight on one side of your ship, you will directly feel that imbalance when you pilot the vessel. The placement of all objects, balance, thruster force and direction, are all factors that affect the way your ship flys, including turning speed, and even precise directional acceleration. You have full access to fuel consumption, power generation, power drain and other data directly from the cockpit. Take my word, the ship system is amazing in its complexity and is very satisfying.\n\nDedicated servers are out, so you can host, join a public pvp/pve, etc.\n\nCrafting. Oh yes, the sweet sweet glory of crafting. As you level up, you earn points that are used to upgrade your tech tree, unlocking more blueprints at the various types of constructors available. The crafting system is very polished. The devs really put hard work into making it not feel grindy and making it fun and rewarding. There are TONS of awesome sci-fi themed items to build, not even including all the weapons and vehicle materials. Too much to cover all details here.\n\nMining. \noh.my.god.....\nYou have to either watch a video or buy this game now to see how rediculously amazing it is. Finally!!! You can freely mine any shape or direction or size you want without stupid little blocks everywhere. Thank you devs. Much appreciated.This is exactly what we sandbox addicts have been craving. I feel like the guys and gals that made this game sat down with each other, and agreed to build a familiar sandbox game this time with all the shitty issues addressed that other similar games ignore . You know what I mean guys...\n\nSorry my phone is on 3% and I dont want to lose this review text so I gotta end this now. Look at my time gamers... trust me and indulge in your sandbox addiction and buy this twenty dollar jewel right now. Thank you devs for making and continually improving this fulfilling experience that me and my brothers thoroughly enjoy!\n\nEDIT:\n I apologize for not already mentioning the fact that you can fly directly off any planet with NO loading screens. Having seamless transitions makes this game very fulfilling as you explore the universe and random POI's (points of interest) which are randomly generated and mostly hostile facilities that you can find anywhere. Some of them have a VAST underground complex that quite frankly, is very difficult to conquer. Most of the poi's that you find have plasma and machine turrets that will kill you and blow up your ship so be very careful flying around these. Park with a mountain to cover your vessel from enemy fire and then go on foot to pillage and loot and DESTROY THE ALIENS. There are so many adventures to be had in Empyrion.

This means others can download your designs as well and use them in-game too by pressing F2 and going to that menu! \n\n- The customizeability when making bases, hovercraft, small vessels, cap ships is really nice. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou have to ask yourself sometimes though...\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo you want to put 4 turrets ontop of a small hovercraft and paint them gold, then paint the ship like an american flag, all while telling the automated mini-gun turrets to shoot at anything that moves, turning the ship into a hovering democracy dispenser? WELL YOU CAN DO THAT. \n\n...BUT WAIT a passenger wants to shoot one the automated minigun turrets and burn through ammo like it's toilet paper on taco-tuesday. Well Lucky you! Because they can take manual control over any of those turrets and go buck wild, unless you lock them out.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAnyways some game features:\n\n- Consistent updates from the developers.\n- There are space stations and other life-forms out there!\n- Evniromental Hazards - Extreme Heat, Extreme Cold, Radiation Storms (Radiation can Kill you)\n- There are neutral and hostile A.I Frigates, life forms, stations, and critters.\n- The graphics are really impressive for an Early Access game, gun animation while walking / ruinning could be better, but it does not bother me at all, being an Alpha.\n- The crafting actually makes sense in this game.\n- Building things, ships, bases and hovercraft is NOT that complicated\n- Want to make it complicated?  Do you like digital logic and XOR, NAND, OR, AND, etc Gates? It has that too!\n- Lens flares from engines and thrusters will blow your mind.\n- Base Structures must have foundation supports, otherwise they will fall over, this also applies to your roof, walls and balcony. so basically, you can't make a free floating minecraft box as your home.\n-You can trade for things using gold on a space station.\n-You can press Left ALT + O and save a ship design as a blueprint on the workshop and share it with your friends.\n- You can get infected with parasites and live out your shunned space fantasies of fathering parasitic alien children!

(This is a slow crafting station and can't autonomously make advanced items)\n- Pick berries, Mine some rocks, Pick some sea-weed. (All give good XP)\n- Set up basic shelter. (Press F2, research into \"Base\" items)\n- Upgrade Basic shelter into a base with a constuctor. (automatically can make items from raw materials like Iron)\n- Build a motorcycle bike.\n- Loot nearby installations if possible.\n- Learn to farm, make food, store food in fridges. (Farming = easy xp).\n- Gather enough materials to build a hovercraft / use blueprint for one on the steam workshop (Level 10 ish).\n- Upgrade hovercraft to have mining tools on it.\n- Easily mine an entire mining vein with a vehicle, giving 1000 + ore per visit.\n- Build a small vessel, leave the planet for the first time. (Don't Forget to keep it pressurized)\n- Get materials only found on Asteroids / Lunar areas.\n- Start building a basic capital ship with a warp drive on the starting planet with your base.\n- Make an equivalent of a mobile base on the cap-ship.\n- Dock your beloved hover vehicle and small vessel in the Cap-ship.\n- Warp cap-ship to new planet and explore with your friends.\n- Encounter enemy A.I Cap-ships, small vessels, space stations that either like you, don't mind you, or want to kill you\n- Explore, Build, Accidentally lock your friends outside of a cap-ship while they are E.V.A'ing and repairing things.\n- Accidentally warp out of system without your friend on board.\n- Friend doesnt have an E.V.A Module on their suit and dies from freezing to death in space.\n- 10/10 would leave E.V.A.ing friend behind again.\n\n=============================================================\nAGAIN:\nPLAYING WITH FRIENDS MAKES THE SURVIVAL PROCESS MORE FUN!\n\nDon't have friends that play? \nJoin a public server, most of the time everyone is super friendly and would love to help you out, while showing off their awesome ships / bases!\n=============================================================\n\nIf you read this far, watch a broadcast of this game and consider buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1498197603, "timestamp_updated": 1506037806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.83208930492401123", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99254089": {"recommendationid": "99254089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198893123299", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 14390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8213, "last_played": 1705488563}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is as if No Man's Sky, 7 Days To Die and Minecraft had a threesome and some how all three of their DNA were merged and they gave birth to this game.

Spending the entire (in game) night scared witless, only daring to venture out at dawn, I remember planning my exploration and the actual thrill of discovering new areas. Nothing, however, prepared me for the sheer awe experienced once I\u2019d mined and saved enough for my first CV and entered Mr Ice Cats Polaris for the first time. Empyrion had me here, hook line and sinker. My SP adventures were the stuff of legend, packing up my stuff and moving around the galaxy building my extravagant underground bases and reliving my Lego creativity some 40 years later.\n\nI was then going to write about renting a server with a few mates, about how we were all quite happy building stuff dotted around our planet, visiting each others new gaffs and trying to outdo folks with more and more extravagant builds. Never before had I ploughed so much time into a game \u2026 well, apart from Tribes 1 & 2, but that\u2019s another story I don\u2019t have time to tell.\n\nThen came HWS.\n\nIn all honesty, I could have written pages and pages about my time on HWS, I utterly loved it. In fairness, I LIVED it. I would have told you about arriving there, on a PVE planet with the boys, continuing the building competitions, trapping the wildlife to make a zoo (The Amazing Bob), building a massive phallus in the centre of a lake and a smaller one for the top of my mates base (photos available on request), the hours spent repeatedly digging out bases only to have them filled in once more, stocking OCD with endless supplies from the Autominers, getting into trouble for the old Medic Chamber exploit, our first experience of the legendary Nikola Tesla cleaning out one of the lads with yet another exploit and ultimately all of us being far too scared to venture into PVP. I could also have told you about the rescue missions, the mishaps and the belly laughs, but as I say I was only INTENDING to write a review.\n\nHad I been ACTUALLY writing a review, I might then have gone on to write about ACM and how, after all the lads had left the game, I remained. I would have mentioned meeting Zelutz & his Millennium Falcon and venturing to Neptune for him to be shot down by Scorps Turrets, loosing most of his stuff yet gaining the friendship of one of the funniest and nicest guys we\u2019d never met. You would have been told about us meticulously planning and building our first base in PVP on New Years Eve 2016, only to find it utterly pillaged upon our return on New Years Day 2017, about watching Benzo try and explore our rebuilt base, receive a rocket for his trouble, then join us and you absolutely would have been told about the legendary Neptune Trader Wars in which a bunch of friendly Trader factions got together to annihilate some cocky players who thought they could threaten the little guy. Dark days indeed, filled with camaraderie, hilarity and ridiculous on planet CV battles.\n\nBecause I really don\u2019t have the time to write a proper review, I cant really move on to tell you about how the little guys got together to form one of the larger and hopefully now legendary factions of HWS. I might have told you about the renting our first Planet, building our awesome HQ (still featured on the homepage of HWS Website) and recruiting the legend that was Nikola Tesla. Tesla injected order, organisation and PVP know-how into ACM. I would have loved to recount the tale of how he taught me to search for bases built 40k plus out in space, about how I found one, meticulously planned and organised an assault over 2 days and actually managed to plant an explosive on our own CV core instead of the enemies during the ensuing attack. Had I been writing all this, I\u2019d have been laughing about that and the countless subsequent stories of triumph, disaster, joy and frustration even now.\n\nThe problem I have is that the hours I\u2019ve spent playing this game, in fairness, were a total waste of life. I was supposed to be running a business and instead I eventually somehow found myself admin on HWS. If the hours disappeared playing the game, they positively evaporated with the work involved behind the scenes of the biggest server in the Empyrion Galaxy. Run primarily by two incredibly talented, innovative, motivated and resilient guys, HWS consumes hours like an American Muscle Car uses gas and there are only so many you can give before RL starts to be an issue. Still, I managed to contribute stuff that still appears to be hanging around, which is nice.\n\nConsidering all of the above which, believe me, is a Brief overview of my experience with Empyrion you can understand why I simply don\u2019t have time to write a review. I don\u2019t have time to champion the amazing experience that this small bunch of devs have given me over the course of 3 years. I don\u2019t have time to congratulate RexXxus and Jascha at HWS for the incredible home they continue to give to the game and I really don\u2019t have time to mention the brilliant community revolving around this game, the fantastic designs and the awesome guys and girls I\u2019ve (not) met playing Empyrion.\n\nAnd all for 15 quid. \n\nIf Carlsburg did computer games \u2026 \n\nEpilogue: as well as not having time to write reviews, I alas also dont have time to play currently (since9.0). That said, I keep up with the development and occasionally skulk in the shadows of Empyrion and HWS Website to read up on whats going on. I've experienced a great deal of progression with Empyrion: bugs, game changing implementations and features and the resulting frustration or elation. Change is sometimes hard to swallow, but there has been no single change to Empyrion that hasn't resulted in a better experience moving forward, whether it took a little while or happened instantly.

When I first started playing Empyrion, it was still in Early Access. There were plenty of bugs, but enough of a game that it was playable and enjoyable. \n\nIn the beginning the game was all about survival and it had some great elements of a survival game. The player starts with nothing, and had to find food and shelter pretty quick to survive the deadly predators and the radiation storms. Next they'd build a motorcycle to get around a bit faster and start to find ore deposits. It took forever to dig out the ore with the survival tool, but it felt balanced. It was unlikely the player had been able to get a real weapon, so they were limited to the survival tool\u2019s limited weapon abilities. While mining the player had to worry about spiders or something following them into the ore cave and attacking them. At the same time the player had to scavenge for food, and might begin a farm so they'd have steady supply of food to eat. Eventually they'd get enough resources to build a hover vehicle - and the first time I started whipping around the planet in one of those, it felt amazing. You could bounce off hills to go soaring through the world. There were \u201cbugs\u201d that felt real. If the player wasn\u2019t careful they could flip over and might have to take the motorcycle to go get a thruster to put on the hover vehicle\u2019s side to give it enough torque to flip back over. You could also find yourself under water, and moving an inch at a time to the closest shore, which took forever but realistic. \nAnd finally with a hover vehicle the player could get to the other factions. At that time there was no galaxy, and only 3 or 4 factions. Each faction had territory on the initial planet. When the player found a faction they wouldn\u2019t immediately trust the player and trade with them because they simply didn't trust the player yet. The player would have to kill predators in their territory or kill the faction\u2019s enemies and gave a reputation with them. Eventually the player\u2019s reputation rose and they were finally able to trade. Once of the most important items to buy was ammo for a multitool. The ammo was too expensive to make which made this a milestone moment in the game. The multitool allowed the player to finally retrieve blocks, allowing you to salvage crashed capital ships and other POIs of abandoned buildings, etc. \nFinding and building fuel was a challenge, which made the player appreciate the low fuel consuming hover vehicle. After many hours of playing, the player would get to build a small ship and head into orbit. There wasn't much up there, but it was exciting to go anyways, another milestone. The next step was to create a warpable vehicle. I can't remember when the small ships gained the ability, but I'm pretty sure it was only capital ships in the beginning. The cost to build the blocks for the ship was high, making the player salvage crashed ships around the planet to get the blocks to build their first beautiful capital ship. Might not be much of a ship, but it would get into orbit, and warp to the other planets in the solar system. At that time warp lines were static. You couldn't just warp to any planet in range. You had to follow the path, which made sense in some ways. If the planet was on the other side of the sun, you couldn't warp to it. The other planets didn't have much on them back then, but they did have rare resources that were needed to improve vehicles, adding shields, etc. \nAll and all, going from a player that was scavenging for food and shelter, to a player flying around the solar system was a great feeling, and made a great game.\n\nThat was in the beginning. The game has had many updates since then and has suffered badly from feature creep. \nOn August 5th, 2020 the game left early access. The tag \u201cearly access\u201d allowed the many bugs in the game to be explained away as the game was not \u201creleased\u201d yet. But upon release the game was still littered with bugs, and lacked the polish of a finished game. Almost a year later there are still major bugs in the game. Ships that collide, don\u2019t take or cause any damage, and sometimes become \u201cmerged\u201d. NPCs that fall when there is no gravitational field.  Or invisible barriers preventing the player from moving or salvage parts of a ship that has not completely stopped moving.\nThe game has a forum for submitting bugs, and I have submitted a couple dozen bugs. Some of the bugs I submitted that were clearly bugs but were being categorized as not a bug for reasons that didn\u2019t actually make sense (like indicating there is a workaround or the bug wasn\u2019t important enough). This is the sign of an overwhelmed team and an unpolished game suffering from numerous bugs.\nBut it is not all bad. A galaxy was added which was exciting and well done in my opinion. Players could now warp to any planet or system within a 30 LY range. But this is also when the game lost its survival feeling. It became very easy for a new player to get into a capital ship and start warping around the galaxy within a few hours of playing. Food could be bought from vendors at cheap prices, removing any need to farm. Ores could be bought from other traders, removing any need to mine. Salvaged weapons and armor could be sold for a disproportionately high amount of money, making it easy to survive. Although the motorcycle is still in the game, it is never used (might still be in the tutorial but that\u2019s about it). Fuel became very cheap to buy from trading stations, allowing players to use their capital ship for all ventures, and making hover vehicle obsolete. Repairing ships became too easy \u2013 by saving a template of a completed ship, the player could take there almost completely destroyed vehicle to a trading station, get a cheap price, and instantly repair the ship back to new. For example, an almost completely destroyed capital ship could be completely repaired for less than selling one suit of heavy armour. The original survival aspect of the game and the importance of the original features became obsolete. \nIn the original game, everything could be mined, retrieved, destroyed, etc. Enemy based could be captured and raided. It was an \u201cI can do anything in here\u201d game. As the updates came, more and more things broke that feeling. Asteroids were added. Some can be mined, but the majority (99%) can\u2019t be mined, destroyed, or used in any way. NPCs were added that do nothing and the player can\u2019t interact with. Space stations were being built with common blocks that can\u2019t be damaged, captured, or destroyed, even by the strongest weapons. The game has lost a lot of the original \u201cI can do anything in here\u201d feeling.\nFeatures were also being added that didn\u2019t make sense, like satellites that are only found orbiting the star of the system. A new Data Hoarder trader was created, where you could sell the hacked data from these satellites.  But you can\u2019t get or hack data from any other bases, ships, or NPCs, making it feel very incomplete. Similarly trading goods were added, but the game lacks an economical engine to change the prices based on supply and demand, making the trading system very simple.\nSo where does the game stand today? It was a beautiful survival game, well designed and had a clear objective. It has suffered badly from feature creep and bugs that should have been addressed before moving from \u201cEarly Access\u201d. When playing, the game has a hollow feeling, like the game has lost its purpose and soul. It feels like a game that grasped for the stars and barely reached the moon.\nThe competition for this game would be a mix of Space Engineers, X3, and No Man\u2019s Sky. From a quality and completed perspective though, it does not come close to any of these games. It is hopeful that the Empyrion team finds their focus again and is able to bring soul back to the game.\nI've marked this not recommended only as there is no option for \u201cits ok, but it's not what is was\"\n", "timestamp_created": 1626916308, "timestamp_updated": 1626916308, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 238, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826541900634765625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116691927": {"recommendationid": "116691927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044922235", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 164039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18474, "playtime_at_review": 50209, "last_played": 1713799356}, "language": "english", "review": "Empyrion is:\n\n1) An inde game put together by a small team running it all by the seat of their pants.

With the raw materials, you can also spawn blueprints that have already been created by you or others from the workshop.  It can be fun just to go creative and spawn ships you have collected into library to explore them and try them out.\n\n4) A harvesting game where you dig into voxel based planets and asteroids for resources. \n\n5) A procedural game where no two saves create the same universe.\n\n6) An exploration game with lots of points of interest to discover both on the starting planet and in the universe that waits you when you achieve space flight.  Lots of different types of suns and planets with different characteristics.  Several factions of NPC to interact with.  Points of interest spawn randomly all over the universe.\n\n7) A salvaging game where you can rip apart your enemies ships and bases and make them into your own creations... or sell the parts...or scrap them.  You will also find derelict ships and buildings.\n\n8) A trading game where you can find various resources or devices and sell them to traders for profit.  Or, you can buy things from traders and sell them to other traders for profit.

Tutorial still trash/broken, more bugs than before, bugs from initial launch on Steam still exist, English text/story still pretty poor - honestly just too many issues for a game that has been in Early Access for this many years...\n===\n\nCan you have fun - yes.  Could you have more fun playing something else - definitely.  Should you buy this - maybe.\n\nI've owned this game since it appeared on Steam.  At one point I posted a positive review while it was in Early Access, but then other better games came along and this one failed to fix a lot of the bugs and issues that existed - I changed my review to negative and uninstalled the game.\n\nSome time passed, they made some updates.  I tried the game again and did not like some of the changes made, but as I didn't really play long I deleted my review while still uninstalling the game - thinking, I'll let it 'bake' a bit longer and come back to it.\n\nWell, here we are and I find that the game still has some of the bugs from Early Access.  The tutorial, mission structure, and various other plot devices are still a hot mess and even mods can't seem to fix some of this.  To be clear - this is NOT Space Engineers and it isn't meant to be, but that isn't the problem.\n\nI don't know if the devs simply have no desire to fix longstanding bugs or that they don't know how to.  I DO know that they should be able to fix things like the fact that there are dialog boxes that pop up when you are doing something else only to disappear before you can read them - especially when some other dialog boxes pop up, pause the action, and require you to click to progress.  They could also fix broken story elements, the quirkiness with building, balance issues, and a host of other things - but to date, they haven't.\n\nAs I said, the game can be fun.  It can also be frustrating.  Mods can only do so much due to the 'baked' in bugs and limitations.  If after all of these years I thought they'd fix the bugs and iron out the other issues, I'd be recommending this game to everyone.  As it is, my suggestion is you wait yet a few more years and see what develops.\n\nWhat I would like to see is more automation and balance in the systems.  Why do I have to manually process/craft fuel and move it to the generator, why does the generator and fuel storage emit radiation even when using biofuel, why isn't there more automation overall - I mean, are you telling me we got to interstellar travel by hand-feeding fuel into generators...", "timestamp_created": 1618491956, "timestamp_updated": 1655689465, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 157, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819734573364257813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44330672": {"recommendationid": "44330672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010413810", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 43008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41447, "last_played": 1702034203}, "language": "english", "review": "Empyrion is a sandbox scifi survival game where you get to design and build spaceships, travel between planets, mine, build a base, and raid aliens and other players.\n\n[h1]NOTE[/h1]\nThis is an early acces review and will be updated as the game progresses.\n\n[h1]GENRE[/h1]\nSurvival\n\n[h1]CONTROLS[/h1]\nMouse and keyboard in third person perspective.\n\n[h1]GAME MODES[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Offline Single Player and Creative Mode\n[*] Online Multiplayer\nYou can host your own server without purchasing the base game. You can do this via Steam tools.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]CHARACTER CREATOR[/h1]\nThe character creator is quite basic. You choose gender, and there are a couple of preset faces and bodies to choose from, hairstyles, skin and hair colour, and colour of your outfit.\n\n[h1]POINT OF THE GAME[/h1]\nYou start the game in an escape pod plummeting to the ground. You then have to make your way to a wreckage which you will scavenge for a mobile constructor and various other items.  You need to watch your hunger levels and start to build a base, a small hover vehicle, and small spaceship. Later you can build a capital vessel and also find alien settlements to raid.\n\n[h1]GOOD POINTS[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Once you understand how to build ships (needs a proper tutorial), then this is probably the most fun part of the game.  You can get really creative designing and building SRVs, HRVs, and capital vessels.\n[*] SRV dog-fights with your friends is loads of fun.\n[*] You can design and build ships in creative mode, save them as blueprints and then auto build them online if you gather the necessary resources. You can also use other peoples blueprints if they upload them to the Steam workshop.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]BAD POINTS[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] The game's tutorial is a joke...a confusing one with no punchline. \n[*] The graphics are crappy, but considering it's a voxel game (you can drill into the earth like Minecraft), it isn't blocky, but it's no where near as good as 7 Days to Die which is also voxel.\n[*] Alien loot doesn't respawn once you've taken it and once you've broken the alien spawner block, the aliens themselves don't respawn.  This means once you've hit a base, it's useless for everyone else on the server.\n[*] the interface of the panels in the game are not very logical.\n[*] Combat doesn't feel solid.\n[*] Initial grind is painfully slow.\n[*] At the time of writing (mid 2018), I can say that development wise, very little has happened since I first picked up this early access game in 2016.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]MY THOUGHTS[/h1]\nIf you feel like exploring space, Elite Dangerous is better. If you feel like exploring alien planets, No Man's Sky is better.  If you feel like shooting aliens, Defiance is better.  The thing this game has that none of those do is the ship building.  Without the ship building aspect, I would not recommend this game...at least not yet.  The game needs a lot of lot of work...\n\nIf you found my review helpful come say hi on my stream:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/mr_w4rpath", "timestamp_created": 1535027326, "timestamp_updated": 1606383139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818609118461608887", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33637926": {"recommendationid": "33637926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078292532", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 29461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9074, "last_played": 1673849915}, "language": "english", "review": "[spoiler]this game will spoil you with how much gameplay you will get for its price tag, regular updates too[/spoiler]\n[h1]Empyrion - Galactic Survival - solid 8/10 space [b]survival[/b] sandbox[/h1]\n\n  I think this is better than space engineers, and just as unique from it too. each one of these gameplay mechanics are fleshed out (not completely) but work well together even as is in early access.\n\nEDIT: Several updates have passed, and most of the review still feels accurate to me but the game has improved 10 fold. Optimization is still one of the last things to be seen, but the community and the devs are real bug hunters which has kept the game fresh and playable these past couple years of solid updates and numerous fixes. The only thing I really want by now is more unique scenario starts. I remember how fun Dawn of Galaxy was and after fighting through that space station you werent left empty handed either, it was a difficult but rewarding start. the workshop is sadly a bit thin on this still. a lot of unique solar systems and custom planets but few that have a cool custom start that is as unique as the map i mentioned which is now out of date i believe.\n\n[list]\n[*] [h1]True Survival[/h1] - various planets with even more varying levels of hostility. how will you get food? does this planet have oxygen? can you survive for 10 seconds outside your ship/base because this lava planet is just too fire for even your rare[spoiler]ish[/spoiler] heavy armor? oh look everything on this planet just wants to kill you. you try to escape but space wants to kill you too, you must be prepared for the worst anywhere you go. whether you run out of ammo, run out of food, run out of fuel, or run out of oxygen, it can lead to the same demise.\n[*] [h1]Building and creativity[/h1] - you can make the ship you want, you can make the space fortress of your dreams, hover crafts? small space fighters, big space fighters? capital ships? you can do all that, [b]OR[/b] you can use blueprints. its not gonna force you to spend 3 hours making something just for it to get destroyed by some alien capital ship that happened to wander by, you can shove all those blocks, componants or raw ingots into your personal factory to make a prefab ship or base, or anything you find on the steam workshop that other people have made, anything to fit current needs and utility functions for all situations.\n[*] [h1]Exploration[/h1] - I'm not talking No Man's Sky exploration, but real legitimate exploring that makes everywhere you go feel alive and desolate at the same time. you can happen across anything. a booming little trade space station with aliens bumbling about, a massive fortress plopped on a planet with an angry swarm of drones and enough turrets to delete your measly space vessel, or some terrifying alien creatures that are as deadly as they are horrifying. traveling from planet to planet isnt just that, its something that feels like traveling to a different country, the customs there are different, you might not like it there, it may try to kill you over and over with deadly radiation or giant golems, but it has a vein of gold big enough to make you rich on space duckets. or it might be the most pleasant and beautiful looking planet you want to create an expansive vacation home on, but you might have to go elsewhere if you want some real epic loot.\n[*] [h1]Combat[/h1] - Right now you wont see AAA reload animations or even the most satisfying shooting sounds, but guns function just about as they should, and there are all sorts of guns for different situations. (EDIT: guns have gotten reworked and balanced but still lack nice animations.) Im not exxagerating when i say some alien bases/fortresses feel like dungeons or raids from an MMO. Theres a couple way to cheese them, but taking on your first \"much bigger than you first expected\" underground fortress is harder than initially though. sometimes they can take over an hour to clear out and take over, and that assumes you are prepared with enough ammo for your loadout of 2-3 different guns, cause when you are down to your pistol balls deep in an alien base, you might wish you packed more. maybe you are running out of oxygen right as you get to the core because you had to breach the place with explosives on an oxygen-less planet and you didnt bring any small o2 tanks. theres gonna be more than a few different enemies in there too, and many of them can give you mortal wounds or deadly diseases as well as parasites, which theres an array of different meds you better hope you have on you. the weapons you choose must counter them cause its not gonna hold your hand and say you can clear that room of robots, turrets, alien troops with anything from plasma guns, shotguns to rocket launchers with just a t1 assault rifle and a few magazines of ammo and the starter pistol nomatter how much ammo is in it.\n[*] [h1]Difficulty and complexity[/h1] With the many completely controllable difficulty options, this game can get difficult, but for every difficulty there are things you can always do to counter the difficulty. preparedness, tactical decisions, armor boosts to counter against the extreme cold or radiation. items like personal o2 tanks or emergency rations. you cant just fly to a moon with enough fuel to fill your tank and not expect the possibility of getting stranded there and hope theres a deposit of promethium to craft more. you see an alien base, it might be filled with epic loot and deadly traps and things, or it might just be a bust. even so, you can salvage the very blocks it was made of and do something else with it.\n[/list]\n\n  From the very start this game feels like early access. it doesnt feel complete. but at the same time it has a true adventure waiting, one i craved for a while. an adventure you create, if its in singleplayer, on a server of strangers, or with a friend, you can find that adventure.", "timestamp_created": 1500410873, "timestamp_updated": 1580776431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818395078182220459", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24405065": {"recommendationid": "24405065", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999934493", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 22267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6875, "last_played": 1613706335}, "language": "english", "review": "Quick and honest review:\n\nOpinion: For me this is the best FPS space survival game.

By doing so you unlock new technology to become stronger and more effective. There is many planets to travel to. All with their unique atmosphere, biolife and ore.\n\nSurviving is your main goal but its all up to you.\nMining is an important step in Empyrion. You can mine anywhere, building an underground base is always better for defence.\n\nYou are not alone. Alien drone will attack you and send assault ships to send troops to take your bases and or Capital ships.\n\nGraphics:\n7/10\nIts good. shaders and shadows are looking nice.\nDay/night cycle depending of the planet size. It is still beta and getting better every update.\nThe overall performance is very stable even for a low end computer.\n\nMultiplayer:\n8/10\nMultiplayer is just as good as the single player but with some advantage like the offline protection (depending of the server settings; there is a timer for  exemple 2 days will mean you have 2 days to log in again to reset the timer.)\n\nStory:\n2/10\nYou land on an unknow planet by life pod.

With realistic mining for rare elements, terraforming, exploration, & hunting; it provides a PVE experience that is a delight to play, even in early access. \n\n[b]State of the Art:[/b]\n   Empyrion has a full suite of heavy duty tools, equipped with lights for night/cave mining & terraforming, like a futuristic drill, & a Flatten/Fill tool for terraforming. It can drill in a pinch, but it can also repair holes in your mine roof to keep spiders out. In creative mode, your jetpack flies. In survival it has limited gravity jumps that can result in injury. You start with a handgun, but the assault rifle upgrade has a powerful feel. You can add other weapons, turrets & machinery as you upgrade. The interaction of component parts just feels great!\n\n[b]Flora & Fauna: [/b]\n   With the wide variety of indigenous plants & animals; you feel like you\u2019ve just stepped into Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s Lost World, or the set from Lost in Space or Guardians of the Galaxy. But, there is no cool 70\u2019s walkman or choosing music tracks, which would probably be a welcome plus. The game soundtrack is good, but the two scores will get repetitive if you play this much. (If you saw The Martian movie you know we need more music.)\n   There are edible & Medicinal plants, like Ahax fruit, Alien Spike Lemons, Space Oranges, Cobra leaves, Aloe Vera, & varieties of Alien plasma. Fearsome creatures become dinner, like the multi-headed Hydra-like Olyugh, the Desert Worm, Wood walkers who looks like Sasquatch, a warrior type AI, a baby Allosaurus & triceratops. Some are hostile, others will be if provoked.\n\n[b]Skill Trees & Game Modes: [/b]\n   You find yourself falling from the sky in an escape pod if you are lucky, or already on the ground in the pod if it glitches on loading. If you are still in freefall, you are able to steer the pod\u2019s fall with the mouse. Once you get out of the pod you grab all your gear. The last update to 1.4.0 fixed the ability to open pods that land in water, as well as improving functionality of turrets.\n   The game uses an efficient Tech tree system to allow you to unlock equipment as you earn levels which reset for each game you play & augments the rewards of the strategy & resource management needed to survive on this level. \n   Game Modes give lots of variety with Creative or Survival Modes of PVE & PVP in MP. But, within Survival worlds, at the moment you are only able to choose between the normal forest planet of Akua or the Hardcore Desert planet of Omicron. Akua is Hawaiian for \u201cgod\u201d & definitely looks like a lost world paradise. Omicron is where the intensity picks up, with more scarcity of resources that are spread further apart, & volatile terrain. You have a seed generator for terrain variety. If you land near the drones it\u2019s all over before it begins. The drones are real techno-beasts & you probably can\u2019t evade them early game.\n\n[b]Crafting: [/b]\n    The crafting interface can be confusing at first. Production flows right to left with the queue on bottom. Click the template you want, to move it to the queue to be constructed. Then the new item you wanted is output into the constructor's inventory space. You can move what you want from there to your own inventory or hot-bar. \n\n[b]Space Travel & Vehicles: [/b]\n   The game allows you to set up not only a home base on a planet or in space, but you can construct a \u201chover vehicle\u201d which is a fully stocked mobile base, equipped with fridge & food facilities for mining & hunting. You can also build small aircraft & capital vessels which can equip warp-drive to visit other planets & mine asteroid fields. In MP asteroids land for mining elements. In early access only 2 planets are available, though you can see the full list on the warp map. \n   Each base/vehicle has a \u201cstarter block\u201d with a core which emits a beacon when the power is turned on. When you build it, equip it, & power it up then prepare for an incoming drone siege that will last until you are able to dispatch drones quickly.  You must be well stocked with food before powering up that generator. This creates a game of tower defense. The drones will try to destroy the core starter block. Once you lose that block the game is for all practical purposes over, giving it a perma-death element. You have the option to restart at the location you die near your backpack. But, if drones were there, they will still be there when you respawn at half stats & they will likely kill you again before you can recover your weapon. The game also gives you the option to respawn near your base or take a fresh start, but the fresh start is a bad choice. It will put you in a falling pod with fewer resources. Best option is to exit the game & start a whole new world. You can build a clone chamber once you have a base that will set your spawn point. This is a great feature. \n\n[b]Mapping & Graphics: [/b]\n   The game runs on much less hardware than stated. The graphics seem to be similar on my screenshots to what people who have better machines are experiencing. There\u2019s no lag. The first day I flew the small vessels I experienced holes in my terrain, but that was cleared up by the next day\u2019s update. The scenery is lovely, but the graphics are subpar resolution in the current access state.\n   The mechanic of space travel is less well developed than the planetary aspects of the game mechanics. You experience a slideshow of backgrounds as you leave the planet\u2019s atmosphere, enter orbit, go deep space, & finally approach a new planet. You move around in each slide, but it has a bottom of the picture. I accidentally fell off the space station in deep space. I visibly fell for a few seconds, & then my avatar just stood there among the stars at the bottom of the background scenery in a \u201cstop the world & I\u2019ll jump off\u201d effect. \n   The in-game HUD utilizes a nice planetary mapping system with marker/beacons for different points of interest, like bases, rare elements, & drones. The space map needs work but does not affect the fun to be found in this great game. Visible location coordinates would be nice.\t\n\n[b]Tutorial: [/b]\n   The tutorial is really just simply the PDA info displayed one subchapter at a time on the right side of the HUD as missions. The instructions will not move forward until you do that mission. Also, it won\u2019t remember actions that you\u2019ve done early, so you have to repeat actions to get that mission objective to progress to the next step. You can deactivate chapters in the PDA, but you will lose subchapter steps. Also, there is no pause feature in the game, & reading or opening the PDA wastes your limited O2 & food while you stand around reading a TL:DR wall of text. I hope this is a priority because it leads to frustration trying to figure out what to do as a new player. Like Elon Musk says, \u201cIf it needs a manual it is broken.\u201d I would like to see a computer generated voice-over speaking to you from your PDA, kind of like HAL in 2001, giving you an emergency briefing to get you started on the HUD mission log. \n\n[b]Pros: [/b]\n\u2022\tHardcore Tower/Base Defense \n\u2022\tWorkshop to share ready-made build Templates\n\u2022\tFlight controls are intuitive\n\u2022\tPlug & play construction \n\u2022\tPlanetary exploration includes excellent game mechanics\n\u2022\tUnderpriced at $17.99/ many games in this tier $30.00\n\n[b]Cons: [/b] \n\u2022\tNo weather & Space Travel is subpar\n\u2022\tAI (except drones) are unintelligent\n\u2022\tPDA not noticeable in HUD. Lack of real Tutorial \n\u2022\tThe \u2018hit-boxes\u2019 seem a bit small slowing collection\n\n[h1]If you are dreaming of exploring planets, then Empyrion is the space sim for you. [/h1]I rate it an 8 out of 10 for survival games, with elements of tower defense & resource management. I highly recommend this game for everyone.

As it stands, I cannot recommend someone to buy this game in good conscience. It is NOT a complete game, despite having left Early Access with great fanfare and being advertised as such. That's the short of it, a longer reason why follows:\n\nAs someone that bought this game a long time ago while it was in Early Access, I waited patiently for it to be completed. So naturally, I was excited to hear that it was leaving EA and a 1.0 release would be imminent this summer.\n\nOh, to be so naive. Imagine my shock, along with many others, when we discovered that there was actually no \"Big Update\" from the latest alpha version to \"1.0\" (They used to have \"Big Update\" plastered on the game's title pic above, but now it looks like it's been silently removed.) Nope, despite having left early access, the game is still far from complete. There are MANY features still missing, and it plays very much like an incomplete game. The AI is rudimentary, (and that's being nice), combat feels like a game developed decades ago, many core gameplay features are not fully thought out or implemented well (mass and volume, I'm looking at you.) And if you want to play with friends, be warned that you can't walk around in a friend's ship while they fly like you can in other respectable space exploration/survival games-you have to sit in a passenger seat, unable to do anything else but twiddle your thumbs. This only scratches the surface of issues.\n\nAnd here's the rub. The developers' themselves admit that the game is incomplete (\"We are aware that there are dozens of features that are not yet added.\") and that the only reasons for going out of EA is that it was the game's 5th anniversary, and that \"we did not want to proceed with simply counting further up or adding fancy letters\" \n(Source: https://empyriononline.com/threads/leaving-alpha-early-access-some-clarifications.94900/)\n\nTheir excuse to leave EA and label the game as version 1.0 is that the meaning of EA has somehow changed, that a game not being complete \"is simply not reflected anymore by how the meaning of an Early Access tag is understood or talked about even nowadays.\" These are THEIR own words.\n\nYet, they insist that \"Leaving Early Access DOES NOT mean this is the \u201cfinal release\u201d or finished by any means\" and that \"this is not \u201cclassic software development\u201d\". By their own admission, it won't actually be done for another TWO-THREE YEARS! (This estimate was also in their explanation, but looks now to be also sneakily removed) So, from all this I can only surmise that Eleon thinks they are a special developer that does not have to be held to the same standards of other developers, that they can change the meaning of \"Early Access\" and \"released\" to suit their own needs, regardless of the actual state of the game.\n\nSo naturally, many players voiced their concerns over this. While still supportive of the game, but disagreeing that it should leave EA as it will frustrate a lot of players and harm the game's reputation. Even though this decision deserves all the criticism it gets. But voicing their grievances in the forums just leads to fervent apologists dog-piling on the person with concerns. Anyone with valid criticisms are attacks mercilessly, regardless of how reasonable they and their arguments are, and moderators continually lock down comment threads as soon as people start discussing their criticisms.\n\nI've supported many games in Early Access, even though I prefer to wait for them to be done to play them in full. Most of the developers I've supported were trustworthy and didn't have the gall to change the meaning of commonly understood terms to suit themselves. The state this game in is simply NOT acceptable for a so-called 1.0 release. And like all those other companies I've supported in early access programs, I will hold them to the same standards. \n\nIt is possible that this review might change in the future, if the game actually is completely years from now, I will change it to suit it's new status, but that is the future, and this is now. And presently, since the game is misleadingly advertised as completed while being unfinished, I must judge it as any other completed game, and so I sadly cannot recommend buying it, unless you're satisfied with the experience of playing an unfinished game.", "timestamp_created": 1597307981, "timestamp_updated": 1597374620, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 101, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810624003410339355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140314061": {"recommendationid": "140314061", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977486337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 26321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20691, "last_played": 1710907444}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wish I could give this game a positive review, but I just can't.\nOn paper, it sounds like my dream game: a mix of FPS, ship building, survival, space combat, exploration, and dungeon crawling in a huge universe. However, the gameplay itself is incredibly janky and frustrating.\n\nThe on foot / FPS gameplay is very stiff and non-responsive, like an FPS from like 2002. None of the guns feel good to shoot, and combat is more about micromanaging your ammo count and healing items than it is about skill.\n\nNPC AI is one of the worst parts of this game. When you attack hostile buildings, it's an exercise in frustration. Cheesing the game is standard operating procedure, as that is the only way to clear areas. Alien soldiers will spawn into their bases on literal warp pad blocks when you enter the room, then immediately shoot you. They deal huge amounts of damage, often one-shotting you, which I believe is a poor design choice to compensate for their awful AI. They will sometimes slowly walk through hallways, but for the most part they stand idly around, and the preferred way of killing enemies is to find an angle where they can't see you, but you can shoot them. If shot, they'll just stand there until you kill them.\nYou can stand directly above or beneath enemies, and they won't shoot up or down. They are just bullet sponges which require you to fire from weird angles in order to clear them out, slowly clearing a base room by room.\n\nShip building is alright, but the controls feel awful. Hover vehicles are borderline unusable on any planets with foliage, as your vehicle will constantly get stuck on trees and flip over. Flying larger ships in space just feels super floaty and weird, with a low travel speed and generally  unresponsive controls, making space combat frustrating too. Once you finally defeat a sizable alien ship (after wasting thousands of rounds of ammo), enjoy the physics glitches as the defeated wreckage becomes non-interactable and then de-spawns before you can loot it. Also, it is completely impossible to commandeer enemy ships. You can't fly them at all. There are also no small NPC / enemy ships in the game, so fighter-to-fighter combat isn't a thing in single player.\n\nThe graphics are generally not good, with very weird lighting that frequently makes it hard to see what is going on, and plenty of ugly assets and weirdly gaseous-looking planet LODs. Performance is bad in many situations. Where comparable games (Space Engineers, Star Citizen, No Man's Sky) run just fine for me, performance is consistently choppy in Empyrion. It feels like a really poorly optimized game.\n\nThere are also many little annoyances. The sound design is plain bad, with many annoying sounds constantly playing. \n\nLike I said, I want to like this game. I wish I hadn't spent 300+ hours trying to. \nIf the developers could improve the issues described in this review, this would honestly be a really good game - but there are too many frankly infuriating gameplay issues currently.", "timestamp_created": 1687145602, "timestamp_updated": 1687145602, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810516834259033203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17667146": {"recommendationid": "17667146", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966141007", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1311, "last_played": 1439925784}, "language": "english", "review": "Got a buddy who enjoys a good cooperative survival scenario as much as you? Give Empyrion a shot.\n\nThe Positive:\nMe and my buddy Meowmix have been gaming for years and we both love a good survival scenario. This game really impressed us, it was the first game in a long time that had hooked us with the gameplay. Many early access titles hook you with the premise, then fail to deliver with the initial gameplay, but Empyrion is in a very playable state and there is actually a lot to do and figure out.\n\nThe game captures the survival scenario very well, I was impressed. It is not easy to create a challenging survival game, but the developers did well here. You need to assess, prioritize, and address your immediate needs or you will die. If you fuck up and play fast-and-loose with your resources too much, you can paint yourself into a corner where you need to restart. That consequence looms over you as you play and I feel like the potential for a permanent end to my scenario was a driving factor to buckle the fuck down and figure out how to sustainably address my needs for power, oxygen, food, and defense.\n\nThe oxygen system is worth commending. It felt balanced. I didn't have to constantly top off my oxygen or spend too much time managing it, but it was always a factor. In a typical sandbox survival game, your resource bars usually just become an annoyance; they are just another factor to survival condensed into a linear measurement. In Empyrion there is an initial concern of running out of oxygen and the clock is ticking, but once you figure out how to produce oxygen bottles in a sustainable fashion; your oxygen now limits how far you can travel from your refilling stations. It was brilliant, and it gave me a reason to invest my resources in a land vehicle that could serve as a mobile refilling station. This is necessary to explore the planet you are marooned on and reach metal deposits that are outside of walking distance.\n\nThere were a lot of moments of desperation and perseverance. When you die, you drop all your items on the ground in a backpack then spawn with nothing. There was one time I lost a backpack, and with it went my mining tool and firearm as well as all the ammunition I had. To make things worse, we didn't have enough material to create another mining tool to replace it. We were also low on the material needed to craft more ammunition, which was a major concern. Fortunately, I had a partner. My buddy Meowmix still had his mining tool and enough charge to go scrape up enough minerals to replace my tool and keep us in business. The act of losing my items forced us to shift our focus and adapt; I feel like that is the essence of survival. Well done.\n\n\nThe Negative:\nThe game looks like half-life. Boxy and generally unpolished, the developers clearly narrowed their focus on the gameplay instead of making it look super-polished. This actually doesn't bother me, but I could see it being a point of contention for some.\n\nWait.. Space Engineers just added planets recently. Did I just type up a review for the wrong game? No, I have hours played here I was right.. The look and feel of the bases and ships is so close to Space Engineers, it hurts. If you've played Space Engineers before you will know what I'm talking about. I wouldn't go so far as to call this game a clone, however. Space Engineers seems to focus on the physics of being in space and feels like a sandbox game at heart. Empyrion was developed with survival as it's focus. Though the game may look and feel like Space Engineers at times, the gameplay as a whole is different. I would describe this game as 'Space Engineers with a purpose' but, some of the physics lack polish and make me wish I was just playing Space Engineers.\n\nYou can't transition from space to planet unless everyone is in the same vehicle. Typing that sentence made me sad, and as I read it through cupped hands: I know I have found a game-breaking flaw. They have to address this one, and I am confident they will in time. While playing, the main goal for Meowmix and I was to get our escape pod functional and get off-planet. It took us a while, but eventually we succeeded and decided to take our modified escape pod exploring. We made planetfall at a nearby planet and found that we were incredibly underprepared. I don't want to spoil too much, but we ended up getting shot down and found ourselves marooned on this new ice-planet with no food. The cockpit of our ship had been destroyed and we had no way to create a replacement because I fucked up and dismantled the constructor when I built the car. We did some scouting, got into some trouble, and won some battles. Without a constructor, we really couldn't do anything on that planet. We were essentially, fucked. So, we packed our inventories into storage and let the hunger finish us off. It was a huge setback, but we were able to spawn at the base we built on the first planet. Our new mission was to build a new, beefier ship and go back to ice planet to repair and recover our crashed space pod. Hours later we had mined and scavenged enough parts together to make a new ship. We shot back over to ice planet, found our crash site, recovered our items, and bolted a new cockpit onto the old ship. I hopped in, did a quick flight test, and we headed for space only to hit an invisible wall and a notification that we both had to be in the same vehicle to transition off planet. Seriously ...the fuck?\n\nThe game lacks content. I know, it's Alpha or early access or whatever.. Here is a fact though: it still costs money to buy it. If it costs money, I expect something playable and with content. I was happy to find the game in a very playable state, and to be fair it does have a decent amount of content. Once you get into space, there isn't much more to do. You can explore the handful of other planets, or try to mine them for the special minerals needed to create a capital ship, but there is no point at this stage. There is potential to grow the content further, but I would say there are about 12-16 hours of gameplay right now and after that you are just playing a mediocre version of Space Engineers.\n\nThe crafting takes too long. Space Engineers had a more polished system for this, and this was one of the times I wish I was playing Space Engineers instead. You can queue up a bunch of stuff to be made, then go off and do other stuff but sometimes you need to sit there and micromanage it. The worst part was that you needed to build all the small components needed to make a part, then build the part. You could run two large constructors, but they can only craft using the resources stored inside the machine, so it doesn't really work well. Again, Space Engineers figured all this out and gives you a way more robust crafting system, which I think Empyrion should adopt. Two players cannot access the same machine / container either. This was a generally annoying experience, because I want to make some bullets or mining tool ammo to go do my thing, but Meowmix is in the middle of fabricating complicated parts to create a spaceship. I have to wait for his parts to finish, then make him wait while I craft my shit so I can go mining because I used up the last of the magnesium on him making bullets. Think you like your room-mate? Try getting stranded on a hostile alien plannet with him.\n\n\nAdvice:\nRebind your 'Z' key to 'Number pad Minus'. One of the first things Meowmix and I did was go mining and he accidentally pressed 'Z', dropping his tool through the ground. If you don't have a mining tool, or the resources needed to create one it is game over. Literally. You need to be able to mine, unless you like twiddling your thumbs waiting for the lights to go off because you ran out of power and can't produce more without promethium.\n\nThree is one and one is none.

If you love building, exploring, collecting/crafting, have a good internet connection (to join a close server) and a degree of stubbornness, you\u2019ll probably love this game. However, sooner or later the lack of polish, game-breaking bugs and lack of Dev support will undoubtedly diminish your enjoyment.\n\nEmpyrion is a survival, building game, in the likes of Minecraft and 7 Days to Die but with a focus on building hover vehicles, aircraft and spacecraft. Undoubtedly the game truly shines with its ability to let players place thrusters, generators, cockpits and fuel tanks onto a craft, then letting the player fail or fly with great satisfaction. If you\u2019ve wanted to build a tank that trundles into bases ignoring all the return fire and melting opposition, that\u2019s possible. If you want to fly around in a giant pizza-shaped spaceship with turrets that pop out of the pepperonis, you can do that, if you want a supervillain lair built into the side of a mountain with numerous defended escape tunnels, that\u2019s possible too! Even if you\u2019re not creative or too lazy to design your own creation, it\u2019s possible to hop onto the steam workshop and download thousands of amazing designs from other players and spawn them into your game! That\u2019s right, this game allows you to save your creations to file, fill it up with enough resources to pay for it, then spawn in another copy. This means those builds you love can be transferred between creative/single-player/multiplayer/etc as long as you have the resources to pay for them and undoubtedly this is where the game absolutely shines.\n\nSo once you\u2019ve gotten enough food, tools and weapons to build your first craft you\u2019ll be free to start exploring the worlds, this is where the ambition and execution fall apart, the game is capable of creating infinite, weird, wonderful, vast solar systems but after you\u2019ve explored a few you\u2019ll see the same stock assets, same points of interest, same craft, same unintelligent \u201caliens\u201d in repeat until you\u2019ve realised that being able to generate infinite worlds means very little if they\u2019re just filled with the same assets. This is why I recommend playing in a server because good servers have fields filled with players, builds, additional content, shops and other interesting things to do. Otherwise single player just doesn\u2019t have enough to do.\n\nSo this where I start going into the negatives of the game and why I can\u2019t recommend Empyrion in this state/stage. Empyrion has been one of those game that has been in \u201cAlpha\u201d or a developmental stage for many, many years (around 5 years at the writing of this review) and the majority of assets/mechanics are janky, poorly implemented and feel unfinished. Game breaking bugs have been in the game for years, reported and ignored. Sometimes your base/ship will partially load in, forcing you to exit the game and load in again, as many times as it takes to make your whole base/ship appear. Perhaps you\u2019re shooting something and run out of ammo and would rather switch weapons instead of waiting for the for 4 seconds reload time to finish, but instead, the game tries to reload the weapon you switched to and restarts the reload timer/animation again. Maybe you\u2019ll attach a new part to your base and it\u2019ll suddenly explode off even though structural integrity means it should be solid. Perhaps you\u2019ll dig away part of a hill near your base, place down a turret and discover the turret doesn\u2019t work because the game still registers the turret being underground (thinking the hill is still there). Many times I have had a patch suddenly come out, break the game to the point of being unplayable and waited days if not weeks for a patch fix to come out, in Alpha 12 the devs released a patch that utterly destroyed servers (creating floods of error windows in games) and went on holidays. Perhaps you have vision problems and can\u2019t see the tiny red crosshair and have to live with the knowledge the devs don\u2019t care if you\u2019re colour-blind (despite the community constantly telling them it\u2019s a problem). You\u2019ll scream at the computer when dead bodies block bullets while enemies will happily shoot through the very same bodies. Support for single player is subpar and if you play in multiplayer or even worse PVP\u2026 support is abysmal.\n\nAs a whole Empyrion is a great game, it\u2019s tonnes of fun but flawed in almost every way. It\u2019s hard to play the game without realising most of the features are half-finished or have been better implemented by games far OLDER than Empyrion. Until the company behind Empyrion actually start fixing the god damn bugs or any of the issues that are plaguing players, I can\u2019t recommend it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1604000406, "timestamp_updated": 1604000406, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 187, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.807701051235198975", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38274962": {"recommendationid": "38274962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000377377", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 14885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5616, "last_played": 1596941799}, "language": "english", "review": "This review is about 70 hours in and I've since built bases, SV's, a single CV, and a hovercraft. I've also visited several planets.  Currently running a private server with a small group of friends. Here's a quick summary of some of the more major points I have.\n\nPositives: \n\nBuilding system is extensive and relatively user friendly. It takes a couple tries, but once you start to recognize how the blocks fit together it becomes a lot of fun. Futher, there's a lot of modification you can do as you grow as a player to improve your various structures. \n\nReaching new planets and seeing their overall terrain is fun, as well as space travel. Though there are similarities, I feel that each planet presents it's own strengths and (albeit minor) drawbacks. Though this doesn't go without saying that much of the exterior features, resources, and POI's are a little too similar. \n\nThe games logic system is sound. I like that there's so much to consider when building a full size base.\n\nNegatives:\n\nThe game is designed with PVP in mind. I am much more a Co-op PVE player which means that combat is relatively repetitive. Most of the primary interest points become redundant to take over, and the thrill of raiding a base like a bunch of space pirates starts to wear off after the third or fourth go. I really hope that this feature is addressed in a future update. A greater challenge via AI, wildlife, and varied races/planets would add a lot. Further, one turret will protect your base and is rendered relatively useless as soon as you take down the planets drone base. \n\nAfter warp capability, there is little in the way of challenge. It's relatively easy to prepare for a new base placement, and it can take as little as 10 minutes to set up a temp base that will provide everything you need to survive. This takes away from the excitement and thrill of landing on an entirely new planet, because we already know exactly what to expect. Varying requirements would help keep players surprised and add a challenge. \n\nOverall: I have really enjoyed this game so far, and am very eager to see what the devs release. Currently, as soon as warp is achieved, the game becomes somewhat redundant and really takes a turn toward a casual playstyle, as opposed to one of constant survival, risk, challenge, and danger.

The base game is pretty much in the same state as it was back then. The community content is tailored either for single player content or pvp. There is very little content in these community scenario's that work as intended. Yes, I'm talking about Eden before the white knights start frothing at the mouth to say something like \"Tell me you haven't played eden without telling me.\" \n\nThese scenario's are no better than the emptiness of the base game. Yes they have quests but htey are so badly documented and when you search for them on reddit everyone's being secretive. Not every quest is in your pda. The ones that are ? They are bland as hell and have things like \"warp to 3 systems, then another 3, then another 3, then another 3, then another 3, etc.\" Nothing but warping no content just a sentence or two. \nthen there's a quest that is \"Mine 5,000 alien blocks, player placed don't count.\" \n\nI understand the people working on this both dev and modders put a lot of hours into it but all of this is just a testament to the don'ts of gaming over the years. No one likes a bland \"Go to X, y ,z\" kill/gather 10, 50, 500, 5000\" quests. That is bad design and just filler. \n\nGround combat is just either teleporting mobs, jittering/wiggling sliding mobs or don't move at all and stand in place. Armor doesn't seem to matter at all. As everything just covers you in status effects. Yes you can use 10min medical buffs but you need to basically devout your hot bar to food, stims, and heals. Theres no resistance besides using a a stim that turns it off for 10mins. \n\nSpace combat is AI just knows and targets your core. Countering that later on is just a battle of shields and run away. Which at that point there is no difficulty as you are just immune as long as you have shields. \n\nThis game is still Alpha and should be labeled Early Access. I don't care what bizarre definition the devs want to use. The amount of content, mob behavior, etc is not that of a finished version 1.0 game. \n\nI can't recommended this to anyone as it doesn't seem like the game will ever be fleshed out and will depend on the community to finish it much like Bethesda does.\n\nEdit date Jan 11 2024:\nholy shit so the game barely had content added to it and now they are adding DLC.

Truth be told, I hated this game when I first started playing (a long time ago). It was tedious and required building every single intermediate component. Make steel plates, build the mechanical components, build the motors, make more plates...eventually assemble into a useful item. On and on...\n\nI came back a few months ago and found all this tedium was gone. I loved it! Mining, building stuff, killing bad guys, raiding outposts...I could actually spend time Mining, Building, and Killing instead of looking at recipies and trying to make the right stuff without inadvertantly using up scare resources on the wrong intermediate components.\n\nI feel like A9 has brought back the tedium. I don't disagree that carrying enough materials for an entire space ship in your backpack was a bit extreme. But it was simple and didn't require Backpack Management Simulator 2.0. Now, somehow magic-ing items across a wireless network and drilling through drop downs is more relatable. I am sure there are nuances I'm missing, but it's no longer intuitive. I would post rebalance thoughts on the forum but, quite frankly, don't feel like getting attacked by the community.\n\nKudos to the devs. You're working on a great concept and you can never please everyone, so I applaud your labor of love and making it this far. It's much easier for me to sit back and critique than for you to crunch down and create. I am certain there are folks who will enjoy this update very much.

It seems every time I return to this game it's both out of nostalgia, and because other friends are also returning to it and need a server (which I host).  At any rate, I'm glad to say that the realm of Empyrion keeps improving every time I visit!\n\nI've been very used to Empryion having a fairly static universe, and I use the term universe very loosely since there really wasn't a massive galaxy to explore...  Fast forward to 2020 and guess what?  Not only is there a massive galaxy that's randomly generated, you can also see the galaxy from everywhere.  Standing on a planet?  See another planet in the night sky?  Guess what?  You can go there!  See some stars in the distance?  Guess what?  You can go there!  My jaw dropped when I switched to the galaxy view and actually saw there were, quite literally, thousands (if not more) of solar systems I could visit.  Seriously, it's an ACTUAL GALAXY!  In addition, you can even see faction borders of the NPC's.   Think Star Trek with the Romulan Empire, Klingons, etc. and how everyone had their own borders.  Yes, it's a true galactic civilization going on.\n\nThere have also been quite a few building improvements.  Build yourself a \"concrete block\", hold it in your hand, and right click.   Boom!  3 pages of various shapes and sizes for you to morph that concrete block into before placing it.  This increases your ability to customize your ships and buildings by quite an extensive amount.  Get the exact look you're looking for.  In addition, most other objects also have their own visual versions.  Cargo boxes?  Something like a dozen visual options.  Windows?  Yep, lots of options.  Fridges?  There are a half dozen different looks.  The list goes on.\n\nIf I had to pick one gripe that exists in the current incarnation of Empyrion, it would be the lack-luster power you get from Solar.  In direct sunlight, running 2 panels, I was hard pressed to keep one constructor and a single fridge running.  They would constantly pulse on and off, and I didn't quite think that was realistic for the size of solar panel I was using (large x2).\n\nAnother small gripe I found was, while on a server, when you brought a capital vessel into a planet's orbit and you had a ship docked inside (hover or small fighter) it would regularly fall through the capital vessel.  I think it's because the capital vessel and the small ship load in at different speeds.  Not a big deal, you can fly down and pick up the small vessel that fell out of your capital ship.  You do need to be aware that this can happen though.\n\nVerdict?  This is still one of the best survival games that includes both planet and space flight.  Other games, like Space Engineers, do a pretty bad job trying to compete with Empyrion, the top dog in this genre.  If you're on the fence, get it.  If you're even a little interested, get it.  If you have friends and co-op all the time... This is a must have.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOriginal Review;\n\nWhen I first picked up Empyrion : Galactic Survival I have to admit that I wasn\u2019t impressed.  I had been playing another very similar title for quite some time and found Empyrion to be fairly inferior when it came to the game experience as a whole.  Recently returning to Empyrion I found many changes.  Let\u2019s just say, my first day returning to this game I put 12 hours into it.\n\nEmpyrion : Galactic Survival is one of those games that you\u2019ll either love or hate.  It\u2019s a game based heavily on survival where you absolutely can\u2019t sit idle.  You can\u2019t just put up a few walls, toss on a roof, and consider yourself safe.  If you don\u2019t keep up with your tasks (like gathering food/oxygen) you\u2019ll quickly find yourself dying.  In addition, resources are fairly limited so you have to continuously push yourself to explore further and further away from your comfort zone (aka. Your base).\n\nCrafting in Empyrion is a fairly simple task, with most machines requiring you to first craft components for those machines.  Even some components require components.  While some may find this a tedious task to perform, I rather enjoied it as it gave me something to constantly be doing.   You can\u2019t just \u201cclick\u201d and have yourself a cockpit (for example), you actually have to build the parts for it before it can be assembled.  I enjoyed this in the other title I mentioned earlier, and I like that Empyrion has adopted this crafting style.  There is a bit of a balance problem in crafting, however, and I hope that the developers solve it in the future.  While crafting items doesn't really have this problem, crafting food seems to be a little problematic.  Take a \"sandwitch\", for example.  In order to make a sandwitch you need to use a salami, a bread, and a tomato.  Seperately, in total these three items contain values of 195 food, 30 health, and 30 stamina.  Together, as a sandwitch, the values are 160 food, 10 health, and 25 stamina.  Thus you would be an idiot to craft a sandwitch as you are loosing a lot of food value in a game where food is always a struggle.  In crafting you would expect that a crafted item would have an equal, if not a higher, value than what you are putting into it.  This is one small way in which crafting recipes are currently \"broken\" in empyrion, but hopefully will be fixed.\n\nIn returning to the game I also found myself dealing with a new leveling system as well.  Each time you gain a level you unlock some basic building block recipes and get points to unlock more complex crafting recipes.  You have to spend your points wisely or you may find yourself without the recipes you need, when you want them.  In addition, all recipes have a level requirement so you can\u2019t simply unlock missile launchers (for example) at level 2 and blow everything up.  The mix of level locks, plus point unlocks, makes leveling a fairly exciting experience.  That being, every time you level you basically go \u201cSweet!  Now I can unlock that ____ I\u2019ve been wanting to make!\u201d\n\nMobs in Empyrion come in a couple different varieties.  You first have your basic non-aggressive indigenous creatures that will simply go about their business without a care in the world (until you shoot at them).  Next you have indigenous creatures that are hostile towards you and will attack you if you get too close.  It\u2019s fairly difficult to tell the hostile mobs apart from the non-hostile mobs without actually risking being attacked, as they all look pretty mean, but once you gain the knowledge it makes the world a lot easier to navigate.  The third variety comes in the form of NPC structures that have turrets and enemy units, as well as drones that will hunt you down.  These drones can be fairly useful when lured away from their bases as, if you\u2019re powerful enough to take them on, they always drop components you can use to craft equipment and machinery.\n\nFinally we come down to the core of the game.  Does the game look good and sound good?  Well\u2026  Yes, it does.  It\u2019s not going to be winning any awards for realism and immersion, but when it\u2019s stacked up beside other games in this genre it actually surpasses most of them.  Each creature has unique sounds, which I actually find very fitting to them and enjoy.  Music is well placed and fits the theme.  Distant planets and moons rise and set in the sky.  It\u2019s actually very well polished for still being in Pre-Alpha.\n\nSo what\u2019s my verdict?  Well, as I said, people will either love this game or hate it.  Personally I love it and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone who likes games from the survival crafting genre.  That said, you'll just have to make up your own mind.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor more no-nonsense reviews check out my curator page at; \nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/31550059-Viper%27s-No-Nonsense-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1450727528, "timestamp_updated": 1685669743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.79974895715713501", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38977430": {"recommendationid": "38977430", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980082424", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 159121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29567, "last_played": 1696705498}, "language": "english", "review": "As of this review, I have 458 hours on record and have completed most if not all of the PvE content this game has to offer as well as tried a little PvP.  \n\nWhats good:\n\nCrafting:  \nCrafting is quite involved and requires you to explore if you want to craft high tier stuff, weapons, ships with plasma and/or laser turrets and artillery.  The customization options in this game is amazing.  You can build your own ships in creative and then save the blueprints, or you can go subscribe to ships and bases others have built and shared on the workshop.  Once you Subscribe you will have access to the blueprint in game to build.  There are star destroyers and Star trek ships galore in the workshop from other players who like to build.\n\nExploration:  \nThere is so much to explore and see in this game.  There are asteroid fields, frozen planets, lava planets, earth like planets, desert planets, purple planets, and with planets comes moons to explore as well...  Different planets have different alien creatures.  \n\nWhats good but needs work:\n\nPvE:  \nWhen you are new to the game, PvE will be challenging and fun, but once you learn the querks and short-comings of the game, PvE becomes really easy.  If you have a small vessel, laser and plasma turret shots fired at you can be dodged pretty easy, and they can be taken out easily with rockets attached to your small vehicle.  The alien NPC's are clunky, easily evaded, and killed.  Then it becomes a hunt for the core, and once destroyed, you can use your multi-tool to breakdown the base into scrap metal and plastic to build more stuff for yourself.  I find drones both in space and on planets to be the worst when it comes to clunkyness and are very easily defeated with a low tier minigun attachment to your Small Vehicle.  PvE's saving grace is that there is a lot of user generated NPC (POI) bases, with traps and mazes.  Some are built really well, and I have even died to the occasional trap or tricky nature of some of the creative stuff people have come up with for POI.  \n\nWhats bad and needs a lot of work:\n\nPvP:\nThe clunky nature of the game makes PvP somewhat stale.  The ships for PvP consist of encasing your core in layers and layers of combat steel as well as all of your vital components.  Some servers have placed size/block limits which helps somewhat.  There should be much steeper maneuverability penalties to those who build massive brick capital vessels of all combat steel with so many layers protecting the ships vital components.  There also needs to be more turret limitations as well.  As of now, its just slap on as many turrets and manually fired guns onto your ship as the game allows.  I would like to see a more interesting way of limiting how many turrets can go onto a ship.  \n\n\nOverall, the game offers amazing value for your money.  You can't even go to the movies to watch a 1.5 hour flick with a date for $20 anymore, but $20 will most certainly get you multiple hours of entertainment as you explore in this game.  Even after 458 hours, some of my friends and a few of my relatives all enjoy playing this game on a private server together.

The need of crafting 12k iron ingots cannot discourage me from it (although I would love mining drones to be of any help) :D\nNPC and animal animations are really clunky, it's like 90's again, nevertheless Empyrion can be really pretty in some aspects (biomes are quite pretty).\n\nI haven't really tried multiplayer in any aspects, so I cannot comment on that.\n\npros:\n- a lot of content\n- a lot of fun from in-game activities\n- perspective of finding and visiting other systems and planets, as soon you have your ship\n- you can design your vehicles, you can also use community blueprints\n- game really sucks you in and it has its own \"flavour\", even at this stage\n- tech tree progression, which unlocks a lot of good stuff (ship modules, weapons, base modules, etc.)\n\ncons:\n- animations\n- the lore aspect could be a bit more present\n- mining drones are useless, really\n- no personal stats and skill progression\n\nAnd it blows my mind that this is still alpha.
