I love the fact that they were able to incorporate a measure of skill into the game with perfect blocks as well as the variety of combat builds. Just don't get your hopes up that any \"broken\" build will stay broken for long. As I had my hopes and dreams dashed to pieces when they made it so that the mutation lil' fist's damage stacks reset once you took damage instead of when you leave combat. Currently I am content with using one of the later game builds in the game. The only caveat I have is that currently in my opinion the wasp queen fight is a tiny bit broken in whoa-mode as she can summon her wasps an infinite amount of times. This coming from a man who has about 200 hours in the game. Honestly I feel that the wasp queen fight is more difficult then the infected broodmother (although this could just be a skill issue on my part).

Among them, \"Grounded\" emerges as a shining beacon of innovation, seamlessly blending elements of survival, exploration, and adventure into a captivating masterpiece. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released in 2020, Grounded not only redefines the boundaries of gaming but also establishes itself as one of the best games ever created.\n\nAt its core, Grounded transports players into a world where they are reduced to the size of insects, navigating a backyard filled with towering grass blades and towering obstacles. This unique premise immediately sets the stage for an immersive experience that challenges players to adapt, survive, and thrive in a world where every blade of grass becomes a towering obstacle and every insect a formidable adversary.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Grounded is its attention to detail and the sheer scale of its world. Despite the diminutive size of the player character, the game world feels vast and teeming with life, from the bustling activity of ants to the majestic flight of dragonflies. Every corner of the backyard is filled with secrets to uncover and challenges to overcome, ensuring that players are constantly engaged and enthralled by the world around them.\n\nFurthermore, Grounded excels in its implementation of survival mechanics, striking a delicate balance between challenge and accessibility. Players must scavenge for resources, craft tools and weapons, and build shelter to survive the harsh realities of the backyard. However, unlike other survival games that can feel punishingly difficult, Grounded provides ample opportunities for exploration and discovery, ensuring that players are always motivated to push forward and uncover the mysteries that lie ahead.\n\nThe game's visuals also deserve special mention, as they are nothing short of breathtaking. Despite the technical constraints of rendering a world from the perspective of a tiny insect, Grounded manages to deliver stunningly beautiful environments that are rich in detail and brimming with life. From the shimmering dewdrops on blades of grass to the intricate patterns of a spider's web, every aspect of the game world feels meticulously crafted and lovingly rendered.\n\nHowever, what truly sets Grounded apart from other games is its emphasis on cooperative multiplayer gameplay. While the single-player experience is certainly enjoyable, it is in multiplayer where Grounded truly shines. Working together with friends to build a base, fend off enemies, and explore the backyard is an experience like no other, fostering a sense of camaraderie and teamwork that few games can match.\n\nIn addition to its core gameplay mechanics, Grounded also boasts a compelling narrative that unfolds gradually as players progress through the game. While the story may not be the primary focus of the experience, it serves as a compelling backdrop that adds depth and context to the world around them. From uncovering the mysteries of the backyard to confronting the sinister forces that lurk within, the story of Grounded is both engaging and thought-provoking, ensuring that players are invested in the journey from beginning to end.\n\nIn conclusion, Grounded stands as a testament to the power of innovation and creativity in gaming. With its unique premise, engaging gameplay, stunning visuals, and cooperative multiplayer experience, it sets a new standard for excellence in the industry. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the medium, Grounded offers an experience that is truly unforgettable, cementing its status as one of the best games ever created.", "timestamp_created": 1710465204, "timestamp_updated": 1710465262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525533914566040039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163358297": {"recommendationid": "163358297", "author": {"steamid": "76561199069597865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2230, "playtime_at_review": 3970, "last_played": 1713754139}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1713754304, "timestamp_updated": 1713754304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163330019": {"recommendationid": "163330019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198926032812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "playtime_at_review": 726, "last_played": 1713799378}, "language": "english", "review": "if u dont like survival, dont buy it.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1713720719, "timestamp_updated": 1713720719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163326321": {"recommendationid": "163326321", "author": {"steamid": "76561199235918980", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1592, "playtime_at_review": 1064, "last_played": 1713749010}, "language": "english", "review": "smol ppl \r\n", "timestamp_created": 1713717337, "timestamp_updated": 1713717337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163284373": {"recommendationid": "163284373", "author": {"steamid": "76561199404838348", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1390, "playtime_at_review": 853, "last_played": 1713798657}, "language": "english", "review": "If I had a nickel for every time me and my brother lead a really difficult enemy to an anthill and had the ants rip it apart, I'd have two nickels.

So with its final planned content update just recently being released, it's time I share my thoughts.\n\nThere are only two games I can say I have been playing since its initial release. Sea of Thieves is one of them, and Grounded is the other. While Sea of Thieves came out in 2018, and was a fun little game I would play with my friends. But I have not touched the game in a very long time, due to being unsatisfied and unhappy with the game direction and the things they've chosen to do and not do. \n\nThat being said, when Grounded's Early Access came out in July of 2020, I was quick to jump into it on Xbox as I am a huge Survival Game fan, and played games like Ark: Survival Evolved and Minecraft a lot with my friends. Although the game only allowed you to play for 30 minute intervals, I could tell that what Obsidian was creating was truly a special game. After that, I stopped playing for a bit due to a lack of things to do. But when they released their first update in August, adding new features such as new building pieces, the first iterations of Mutations, and even the Bird, I was hooked even more. This game really seemed like it could deliver amazing content. Same thing went for their September update, adding the Hedge, more building pieces, and some cool Halloween additions. And then came the first major update. The Koi Pond Update. This added so much that was all focused on the pond and its related items and building pieces. But it featured so much content that I was getting more and more excited for the future of the game. After all, most of the map might've been empty, but the size was still there, which gave everyone ideas of what they could be adding.\n\nAfter a couple of monthly updates adding new features, items, pieces, and big fixes, they released their second major update. The Shroom and Doom Update. I remember vividly that I actually hadn't really played throughout the previous monthly updates as around that time me and some friends started a Minecraft Realm. But with the Shroom and Doom Update, and the redesign of the Broodmother, I instantly hopped back in and played until I couldn't. But not long after the Hot and Hazy Update came out, giving us even MORE. I continued to play after that and even played throughout the smaller monthly updates. All leading up to the 1.0 Full Release.\n\nThat was a huge moment for me. This game that I had loved for so long, a game that featured everything I wanted in not just a survival game, but a game itself. It was finally gonna receive its biggest update yet. Completing the story. I remember playing the exact date of the full release. And I have been playing the game ever since.\n\nSo with this final content update, adding New Game + and so many other cool features (FINALLY ANT QUEENS!!!), I just  want to thank Obsidian (although I know they won't be reading this) for this incredible game that has become my all time favorite game. Ever. I look forward to maybe some future surprise updates, and maybe even a Grounded 2. \n\nI cannot suggest a better game for anyone looking for a near perfect survival game, because yes, although there are some bugs (pun intended), its still such an amazing experience.", "timestamp_created": 1713479307, "timestamp_updated": 1713479307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163117642": {"recommendationid": "163117642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044652041", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "playtime_at_review": 73, "last_played": 1713459769}, "language": "english", "review": "this is mostly just a heads up for anyone with simulation sickness issues \u2014 this game is gorgeous and looks like it would have been fun, but five minutes in and I was F*CKED. no amount of fiddling with settings helped, unfortunately.

Even when it only had that, this game was amazing, and I love everything they added to the game since then. \n\nAll the different items they added to make the base look better is amazing, and you can pretty much make your base unique each time. I also love fighting the bosses, each one is difficult and unique. And the boss fights in the story line is amazing, my favorite boss fights are unfortunately the ones you only get to fight once in the game, being the Assistant Manager and the Mant boss fight. I do also like fighting the Orchid Mantis too though. Each insect is unique and amazing. I like all the armors. I like how messy the backyard is XD. I love all the \"biomes\" of the backyard as well.\n\nThe only problem I see some people complain about is that a lot of the insects in the upper yard are just reskined lower yard insects, but more aggressive. But honestly, I am glad they did this because its nice to see the same insect again, but different variations of them, because in real life there are many variations of certain insects too, like the ant. \n\nOverall, I'd rate this game a 10/10, and I wish games like this became more popularized because I love this genre, and I feel like it doesn't get as much love as it deserves.

The progression and crafting is fantastic, and anyone complaining that something needs to be nerfed is wrong, because nothing in the game is doesn't require at least a little skill to the point where having the sour battle axe makes it too easy (definitely not trying to keep the axe from getting nerfed). Being able to embody the movie honey I shrunk the kids or ant man is very unique and done in the best way possible, as parrying is an extremely satisfying game mechanic because it rewards game knowledge and reaction time. It is nice that the waft emitter exists as it provides for an extremely easy way to farm raw science in the endgame in order to unlock all upgrades and dupe boss items, black widow farming especially. 11/10 game", "timestamp_created": 1707204242, "timestamp_updated": 1707204242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157510870": {"recommendationid": "157510870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313537024", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 6055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5243, "last_played": 1712241947}, "language": "english", "review": "Unique and really great survival game.

Spurred on by the increased accessibility of 3D engines, one indie studio after the other was popping up to release their take on the genre. At one point it felt like a new game was coming out every month with only slight variations on the basic premise of the genre. Whether set in jungles or the open seas, and whether featuring zombies or dinosaurs, they all shared a great deal of similarities. Underdeveloped combat lacking the juiciness a combat system so desperately needs, frustratingly grindy resource gathering and item progression, uninspired exploration and environments. Though the genre has been popular since it's inception, it isn't exactly known for it's high quality. These games are content creator-bait, disposable popcorn entertainment. A flavour of the month that loses said flavour like cheap gum-- almost instantly. Time after time your friends will convince you to buy into these titles only for them to lose interest in a week, leaving you with a library full of unfinished early-access titles you'll never touch again.\n\nIt's easy to understand why someone might be left with a sour taste for the genre. I was the same when I came across Grounded. Obsidian entertainment of RPG-fame is jumping on the survival-crafting bandwagon at the end of the genre's lifespan? Odd, and probably not worth paying attention to. Of course, it wouldn't be long until a friend would once again come knocking on my door. I resisted valiantly, but when someone buys you a $40 game it's difficult to say no. We hopped into a new world and what I found was absolutely astonishing.\n\n[h3] Artstyle [/h3] \nThe first thing that I noticed was the vibrant art style. Gone were those drab 'realistic' graphics that are all too common. Instead the game completely focused on a colourful, cute, and animated style, which it combines with plenty of graphical effects like subsurface scattering, particles, and some really impressive shaders to make the entire experience come to life. The animations are absolutely top-notch with plenty of squash and stretch to really sell the cartoony style. The game just feels right to play. That juiciness that was so desperately missing from other titles in the genre is found here in abundance. The simple act of cutting down a blade of grass, one of the most basic building materials in the game, feels great. When your axe hits it comes to a satisfying stop, transferring it's momentum into the grass-shaped pool noodle that jiggles with a glorious elastic twang. This is what juicy resource gathering is meant to be like, and it extends to the combat too.\n\n[h3] Combat [/h3] \nCombat is in many ways fairly simplistic, as is to be expected from the genre. It is most similar to Valheim's combat, albeit a lot more forgiving. Importantly, the juice is here too. Attacks are well-telegraphed while still throwing in a few mix-ups here and there so you have to pay attention. Parrying is satisfying, as is attacking. The hit effects feel like you're smacking your enemy around, there's a great weight to it. The enemies are plenty varied, though reskins do show up. What's most impressive about the combat system is the way the experience changes as you level your gear and get familiar with your opposition. You're a small fish in a big pond and you're gonna have to work your way up to survive. At first this means scraping by, picking flight over fight in most situations. Bigger bugs are off-limits if you want to survive, and you have to stay vigilant if you don't want to get eaten by a roaming spider. You pick-off weaker bugs, stealthily gather resources, and build up a rudimentary shelter and gear. \n\n[h3] Progression [/h3] \nIt is at this point that the game does something that's very clever. To gather the higher level resources you need for better gear, you need better tools. Where do you get the resources you need to get these tools? From dangerous bugs. The game forces you to fight bugs that just might be a bit too difficult for you, so it gives you two option; gitgud, or be clever. They feel almost like mini-bossfights. You can prepare yourself with adequate healing items, weaponry and armor, and face the bug in a challenging fight, or you can use the yard to fight for you. If a bug is too strong for you to fight, try getting another bug to accidentally attack it so you can stab it in the back while it's attention is on the third party. Maybe lure it near a nest of friendly ants so the soldier ants will come and defend their property from the invader. Maybe put on a gasmask and lure in a stinkbug that spreads poisonous gas to efficiently kill dozens of weaker bugs at the same time. Of course, you can always just find a nice secluded perch the bug in question can't reach and down it with a volley of arrows. Creativity and situational awareness are rarely left unrewarded.\n\n[h3] The Yard [/h3] \nAs you slowly master the yard you will come across many different environments. Not only are these different environments more numerous than your standard survival-crafting game, but they offer vastly different experiences too. These aren't your lazily generated worlds or loosely sprinkled points of interest on an uninteresting map. This is a handcrafted world designed by the studio that's well-known for authored open-world experiences like New Vegas. Technically you can get almost anywhere on the map from the very start, but clever enemy placement and environments help guide the player down the intended path. As previously stated these environments are wide and varied. From the jungle-like forests of the lower Grasslands, sweltering heat and sand traps of the Sandbox, the dark unexplored depths of the Pond, to the toxic miasma of the Haze. Each requires a different approach and brings with it new enemies and mechanics that keep the game fresh throughout it's runtime.\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3] \nIn conclusion, Grounded is by far the most competent execution of the survival-crafting genre I have ever seen. It is a highly-engaging game that manages to fit a ton of different experiences into a well-crafted package. This game has proven to me that the survival-crafting genre isn't as cursed as one might believe, but instead is simply most frequently found in the hands of people who are out of their element. As we see the return of a healthier AA-studio ecosystem, I hope we get to see more studios like Obsidian give their take on the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1706630976, "timestamp_updated": 1706630976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160045650": {"recommendationid": "160045650", "author": {"steamid": "76561199247932956", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 170, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 507, "last_played": 1712504435}, "language": "english", "review": ":D", "timestamp_created": 1709828418, "timestamp_updated": 1709828418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522547543048858643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157323275": {"recommendationid": "157323275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009353248", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 220, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1713527318}, "language": "english", "review": "bugs are cute idea are great and makes me feel guilty to kill some bugs", "timestamp_created": 1706785641, "timestamp_updated": 1706785641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522455990314483643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161030518": {"recommendationid": "161030518", "author": {"steamid": "76561199034882370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2729, "last_played": 1711065841}, "language": "english", "review": "i dont like bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1710977691, "timestamp_updated": 1710977691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159339847": {"recommendationid": "159339847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198382921624", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1708979418}, "language": "english", "review": "p\u00f8lsehorn", "timestamp_created": 1708971090, "timestamp_updated": 1708971090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163287259": {"recommendationid": "163287259", "author": {"steamid": "76561199103080402", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 8878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 50, "playtime_at_review": 8878, "last_played": 1713398647}, "language": "english", "review": "10 out of 10 this game is immaculate the time they spent to make the backyard so immersive and the game so interesting its all just so flabbergasting", "timestamp_created": 1713674605, "timestamp_updated": 1713674605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163092098": {"recommendationid": "163092098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014763429", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 625, "playtime_at_review": 2968, "last_played": 1713781109}, "language": "english", "review": "Good solid game, like they used to be.

Single-player, it's perfection. :chef-kiss: But I don't play this for the single-player experience. I play it with my family and friends. We're all on Steam, PC, Windows, all fully updated, and no matter who hosts among all four of us, the game constantly drops connection for anyone but the host of the shared save game. When trying to combat bosses or defend against an event, it's so frustrating when everyone drops but the host during a particularly critical moment that I hesitate to recommend this as a coop survival game. \n\nEven when it drops us during mundane tasks, the behavior is so broken and unpredictable that often we have to shut the game down entirely and try reconnecting again. It can lead to cycles of several minutes of wasted time trying to get connected again. The whole thing is so disruptive that I can't give this a good review as a coop experience. I really wish I could, but it's not a good experience. \n\nObsidian needs to fix the networking issues. \n\nI've started support tickets with Obsidian, which repeatedly blames our network, or our systems. Obsidian support even encouraged us to REINSTALL WINDOWS. I knew at that point they didn't really have a solution to offer. They also didn't recommend any way for us to help them figure out what's going on. We repeatedly offered to enable logs and provide detailed feedback of our issues. All attempts ended with the same response. Basically, \"it's us or our network.\" Having spent time on Reddit and talking with friends that play cross-play, I don't believe we're an isolated case.\n\nWe've tried every possible scenario to fix the problem of dropped connections during coop multi-play, including buying new networking gear and using hot spots to remove the question of our local network and traverse the internet. Hot spots were the only thing that allowed continual connection for a session longer than about 20 minutes, but at the expense of latency. The ping was at times so bad that we could barely fight or navigate the world because of the stutter.\n\nI want to give this game a thumbs-up, but I can't do that until Obsidian figures out how to fix the networking connectivity issues.", "timestamp_created": 1713629230, "timestamp_updated": 1713629230, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500915884971618652", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163297865": {"recommendationid": "163297865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067748844", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 979, "playtime_at_review": 610, "last_played": 1713739081}, "language": "english", "review": "GEART\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1713689598, "timestamp_updated": 1713689598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500575363636016846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163297115": {"recommendationid": "163297115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013802016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 8253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 8253, "last_played": 1713203091}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game with nice visual, you can enjoy building, crafting, fighting, surviving...and story!

Vintage Micro$oft, the pinnacle of subpar software for half a century. \n\nI played about 15 hours before finally fixing things with Options, thus immensely improving the gameplay.\nThe one I absolutely needed was the time speed.\nEvery game and their cousin have a day/night cycle today, but few know how to make it good. Here, visibility is annihilated by night, yet there's sillily no command to wait it out. Build a bedroll to sleep it out? Can't sleep when not tired enough; I kid you not.\nHours wasted looking for invisible things, not enjoying the scenery, not watching bugs, not finding basic stuff...\nFrom then on, it's max time speed by night. Or 0x by day (things are still alive, only Earth stops rotating,) speeding back for some crafting (ropes, bricks) that wants an actual time flow.\n\nNext thing to go is Hunger.\nIn this universe, if you skip dinner, you die 90 seconds of real time later.\nHunger/thirst gauges always suck, but better games handle them decently. For example, you'd get weaker but still could play, finish what you were doing; you wouldn't lose your last 20 minutes of difficult climbing like you do in Grounded.\nI kept Thirst though, as it works smarter: when desperate, you can drink dirty water, which is nearly everywhere, for sensible penalties.\n\nFood wouldn't be a problem with either a better level design, or a decent inventory.\nThe latter is heartbreaking.\nYou can carry very few resources.\nHalf your slots are filled with necessary tools: shovel, ax, gas mask, diving gear, knife, bombs, lamps, etc. Things you cannot explore without; things you wouldn't craft on the spot, as their resources, often rare and distant, would use even more inventory slots.\n180 hours in, my backpack isn't larger than 5 seconds in. Stack sizes have increased, not the number of stacks, practically lower since I carry more tools. A variety of weapons? No room, they stay at the base. A bow and arrows? Not even considered.\nEither carry the strictest necessities, or play a backtracking simulator. Easy choice for me, when no Option can fix that (though turning off Hunger liberated food slots.)\n\nThe landscape looks great, but its traversal is a bit of a pain.\n\nFirst, it's non-stop fighting.\nI'm fine with running away constantly when just passing through, even with annoyingly low stamina. When searching however (progression, resources, secrets...,) things get tedious quickly.\nEvery step of the way, you're swarmed by hyper-aggressive bullet sponges. Worst are the tiny shooters: I can't even spot them.\nCombat isn't bad (although its various damage types are made moot by the inventory's size deficiency,) only there's way too much of it.\nAnd, of course, mobs respawn; not smartly.\nCantankerous fauna should be highly local, not waste calories charging all that moves; maybe have their own hunger gauge in control of their aggressiveness.\n(Bosses are handled better: you must summon them yourself if you want to see them.)\nMany Options available here, from tweaking HPs to respawn rates to turning off the violence entirely.\nI use the latter while building: an indignant mite on the ground will cancel your ability to fix your roof just by looking at you sideways, no matter that you are out of reach of the unnoticeable 1 HP terror (it got me puzzled a couple of times.)\n\nThen there are the layout and the traversal mechanics proper.\nGrounded is oddly weak on that front.\nOne depletable resource works as a parachute, with a tiny horizontal reach.\nLater on, you extend cables down between distant places, a slow process but useful shortcuts at last: The map is vast, with rare resources limited to corners remote and hard to access.\nUnlike most exploration games, Grounded opens no natural shortcuts to visited sites, no fast travel to distant areas; backtracking it is.\nFinally you should find a gadget to go up the cables, rendering half your network obsolete and the other half twice as convenient.\nThat's it. Nothing for climbing, no gliding, no grappling, no jumping boosts... There's a small trampoline, yet the game rarely lets me set it where I want to.\nBefore the cables, setting up a convenient respawn point then dying is the only way to fast travel. Useful cheese. Not a great design.\nSetting cables can be tedious, fraught with issues: access to building planks, unreliable obstacle detection, elevation, orientation, landing... Save before inaugurating a line: you'll probably hit something, fall, and earn yet one more long backtrack to the anchor point for adjustments.\nCable trips are a joy, once your network matures. There's certainly satisfaction post-grind. Still takes minutes to cross the map, so remember to bring your crochet and enjoy the view.\n\nThe bad part of level design is the natural underground.\nYour light has no reach, is conical, sickening, consumable (except for a helmet of poor armor value,) disappears/clips near walls, in short it's utterly lame.\nBuilding is forbidden there, in the dark and labyrinthine places where it's the most needed: No trail markers on the floor (only way to annotate the nearly useless map,) no signs on the walls, no lamps...\nThen there's the 3D platforming, only way to get out of some deep, dim, cramped, slippery pits. A mandatory ordeal in the case of the awful Undershed.\n\nGood thing the Save system is user-friendly (manual, auto, timed auto, on quit; multi-slots.) It's always a good thing, but lesser devs would expect you to succeed 30 luck-based jumps in a row as if that was the entertaining part of entertainment.\n\nNevertheless, general exploration is wonderful, especially once you can fully focus on it, when you have all the tools and a decent traversal network.\nI followed the main quest for the recipes it rewards us with, and reached the end credits earlier than expected, with obvious locations still unvisited.\nBack to the latest auto-save then, and on with pure tourism, I more than doubled my play time since; and still haven't discovered everything.\n100 hours later, I keep digging up collectibles from deceptively inaccessible places.\nHaven't found all crafting recipes either, which might be due to the loot being RNGed (thus inaccessible to the unlucky, however genocidal they are (this game really really wants you to wipe out all life, for science.))\nThe vast majority of the content is fully optional, unmarked, unhinted except for the sporadic side quest title. This is old school done well.\n\nGrounded seems balanced for cooperation, unchanged for single player runs.\nWhatever the reason, progression certainly is laborious.\nEither you keep it that way, play in peaceful sandbox mode, or fine tune the settings to your ideals, you should play this if you are the explorer type.

Those spiders ripped us to shreds.\n\n10/10, would lead the worst expedition again.\n\n\nThis is a game that caught me by complete surprise. I don\u2019t normally like survival games. So often they have crafting systems that stretch my ability to suspend disbelief, suddenly able to produce ridiculous items with just a few bare ingredients. I don\u2019t know what it is that's so different about this game, but I had a great time here.\n\nI bought four copies of this game, for myself, my wife, and 8 and 11-year-olds. We\u2019ve been playing it quite a bit for the past couple of weeks, and by now we\u2019ve played just about all it has to offer. We\u2019re holding off a bit on doing the final mission, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be beating it in the next few days, and singing our champion song. \n\nWhere this game truly shines is multiplayer and exploration. If you like those concepts, you would likely enjoy this game. It never really pushes you to go in a certain direction. If you wanted to, from the very start of the game, you could go anywhere. Some of the areas are blocked off in the early game, but the game doesn\u2019t stop you from building staircases to wherever you want to go. It would be foolish, since you\u2019d die quickly in areas you\u2019re not ready for, but the game is all about exploring. There are many interesting things to find along the way.\n\nThe exploration in many ways reminds me of Breath of the Wild, or also The Outer Wilds, which were two games where exploration was fantastic. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good as those two games, but still I always wanted to see more of the map and explore. I don\u2019t care as much for games where they just tell you where to go and you follow the map to the next waypoint. Instead, here you have a very vague idea where things are, and what to do, but it\u2019s up to you to explore and put it together. You have to pay more attention to your surroundings, not some quest-marker holding your hand.\n\nThere were so many bonding experiences we had as a family in this game. My 8-year-old son was fearless, joining me on many an adventure and I found myself following him as he leapt into battle. My 11-year-old daughter was more timid and reserved, scared of the spiders but embracing the base-building part of the game. She designed our base and built first-class rooms for everybody, while still joining in on some of our adventures. My wife isn\u2019t much of a gamer, but sometimes she\u2019d join us and, well, quite honestly, die a lot, but in the funniest of ways. I particularly loved when she randomly threw her expensive weapon into a lake because she couldn\u2019t figure out the controls. It was strange how much my defensive instincts would kick in at trying to keep my family alive \u2013 in a videogame of all things. It was a weird feeling but then again it\u2019s what I loved so much about this game.\n\nTonight I decided to make a scavenger hunt in the game, so I started a new world in creative mode, built stairways and ziplines throughout the world for ease of travel, and placed items in chests throughout the world with cryptic hints for the rest of the family to find. It was a blast to watch them scouring the world to find them. My boy was the one who ended up finishing first. Was again a great bonding experience, and I look forward to doing that again. Endless replayability with that.\n\nWith all of that being said, I don\u2019t think this game is necessarily for everybody. At first I didn\u2019t care much for the combat, it felt very much like button mashing. As the game went along though, I paid much more attention to blocking, and types of weapons, and watching the attack movements of the bugs, and that made it significantly funner. It\u2019s also a game that really is best with at least one other person with you. As a single player experience I think it loses a lot of what makes it great. There also isn\u2019t a ton of story here, and the story itself is meh. But I don\u2019t really think this is a game about story, it\u2019s about exploring and having adventures together.\n\nIs this a perfect game? No. We had some glitches, some disconnections, etc. And on the Xbox One it looks horrible, compared to pc. But for me, videogames are less about graphics and more about experiences. Graphics were pretty, yes, but overall, how do I feel by the end of the game? There\u2019s something about being in a shared world, all working together, to tackle challenges, that just resonated with me in this game. We went from being scared of pretty much everything in the game to eventually being THE THING TO FEAR in the backyard. My boy was fearsome in battle. My daughter made us a wonderful home. My wife was deadly with a crossbow when she could figure out how to use it. And I, well, I just wished it wouldn\u2019t end. It\u2019s been a genuine pleasure that I did not expect but I\u2019m thrilled we experienced.\n", "timestamp_created": 1672724727, "timestamp_updated": 1672724727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 560, "votes_funny": 184, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946491837501525879", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74343159": {"recommendationid": "74343159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012778769", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 10480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1216, "last_played": 1671477135}, "language": "english", "review": "Great co-op survival game.

On the surface, Grounded contains all the normal elements of your everyday survival game. Manage hunger and hydration whilst you venture around the backyard, gathering resources to build your own camp whilst fighting off all manner of creatures that want to eat you. But it is so so much more than just this. Let's get into all the awesome things you can expect.\n\n1. Biomes\nOn the surface of things, one may think \"How could you turn a backyard into a set of distinct and unique biomes?\" Well, Grounded does ALL of that, and so much more. Explore the undergrowth in the Grasslands, dive into the depths of a massive Koi Pond, navigate your way through the surprisingly labyrinthine branches of the Hedge, or try to survive the blistering heat of the Sandbox on your hunt for buried treasure. There are 16 unique biomes in the backyard, as well as many tunnels and dungeons to delve through, from anthills, spider nests, and long forgotten ruins of tiny human activities.\n\n2. Creatures\nGrounded will pitch you against many different type of creature, each with their own character, style, and attack preferences. Fight your way through hordes of ants and termites to plunder their food stores, sneak past the spiders and try to avoid getting yourself trapped in their confounded webbing, or test your mettle against the mighty black ox beetles that roam the jungles of the Upper Yard. But don't think the bugs aren't taking notice of your actions. If you bother them too much, you might find they pay you a visit when you return home...\n\n3. Character Progression\nAs well as having survival and combat elements, Grounded also gives your character many ways to progress in the game, from crafting better tools and weapons from the remains of slain foes, to infusing your character with the power of Yoked Girth Milk Molars. You will uncover character perks as your explore, known as Mutations, which you can activate or deactivate at any time to give yourself advantages in many different situations. Weapons and armor can also be upgraded and imbued with special properties, take advantage of creature weaknesses with elemental weapon upgrades, or give your armor hidden properties with sleek upgrades.\n\n4. Story\nGrounded has a fully playable story that will have you exploring the backyard in its entirety. It all starts when trying to reactivate the Mysterious Machine to grow back to your normal size - which unfortunately for you, ends in cataclysmic failure, causing explosive damage to a nearby oak tree and its unassuming robotic resident, BURG.L - Acting Science Manager for Dr Wendell Tully. But it will soon be revealed that the explosion corrupted BURG.Ls memory banks, and he can't remember how to fix the Mysterious Machine. But he does know he has backup files on Super Chips scattered throughout the backyard. It is your mission, brave adventurer, to retrieve them, return them to BURG.L, and try to piece together how you got so small, where Wendell has gone, and most importantly, how to get you home.\n\n5. Exploration\nAs well as exploring the backyard to help BURG.L recover his memories, there are tons of optional areas to explore as well, all having their own secrets and rewards. Discover the story of past long lost adventurers from Ominent, brought here and tasked with the documentation and classification of Wendell's research and his whereabouts, or discover what happens when you activate all of the MIX.Rs located throughout the backyard. Or follow the stories of the four BIG BUG BOSSES and make it your quest to rid the backyard of these tyrannical creatures... After finding just the right thing to lure them out of hiding. What in the world could enjoy the taste of a Mouldy Haogie!?\n\n6. Base Building\nThe base building in Grounded is extensive and comprises of several tiers of building structures, starting at grass plank and weed stem buildings, all the way through to mushroom brick and cement structures as the game progresses. As well as having many building options, you can decorate your base with all manner of furniture, crafting stations, lighting and trophies of all the creatures you've killed on your adventures. You can build in most parts of the backyard, and even connect bases with ziplines for fast travel across the backyard.  You will also have access to traps and turrets to defend your base when the bugs come knocking, because believe me, they will, and you'll need to be prepared for the onslaught!\n\nAs of the 1.2 Super Duper update, building bases now becomes even more important. As you get a better base, you get higher levels of Coziness, and that gives you new buffs whilst you're in your base, even unlocking more build pieces for you to use. Some of these build pieces also have extra uses when interacted with, like bug wall trophies giving you attack buffs against that particular type of creature, the stuffed bug statues giving you extra chances for rare loot, and the new Petal Bed giving the Comfy Stamina and Comfy Defense buffs to anyone who sleeps in it for the entire next day.\n\n7. Bosses\nGrounded has a mixture of required and optional bosses to complete the story. Without giving too much away, there are 2 main story bosses and 5 extra, completely optional bosses that you can fight. All story and optional bosses give you a special mutation upon their defeat, so even if the other five are not required to complete the story, the experience is worth it and the things you can craft from their parts are definitely worth it too.\n\n8. Replayability\nDo you love the story and want more of it? Do you also feel a bit daring? Well, with the final 1.4 Fully Yoked update, you can now re-experience the game in NewGame+ using the REMIX.R station, taking you to an alternate dimension where things are randomized! Where you find it and how you activate it is a not so secret mystery, but in NG+ some of the bugs (including all bosses) are infused with Raw Science, giving them special abilities like the player can have. The world features are different and locations of collectables are random. You also get to get Tier IV weapons in NG+ as well as new trinkets and equipment. Best of all you can stack NG+ again and again to give you even more challenges!\n\n9. Playgrounds\nDo you want to make your own maps and challenges in the world of Grounded? With the 1.3 update, you can now create your very own Playgrounds and custom interactions between objects! Place most terrain pieces and points of interest, down to each individual blade of grass, spawn bugs anywhere including bosses, make parkour maps and arenas, the only limit is your creativity!\n\nNow we have some other things to talk about that will make themselves more apparent after a playthrough or two.\n\n1. Late game creatures\nSome of the late game creatures are reskins of the early game ones, with maybe one different type of attack. Whilst not a dealbreaker, things may feel repetitive. But there is enough variety to keep you on your toes, so the overall significance is minor.\n\n2. No mod support\nIt is unlikely Grounded will ever see mod support due to release on consoles including Switch and PS5. But, there's enough in the game that you could enjoy it for hours, and most things we've wanted to mod in have been added by the developers anyway.\n\nOverall, I can highly recommend Grounded. Even though the 1.4 update is the last planned one, and we won't likely see anything more beyond this point, it's one you definitely should add to your library and play through.

Grounded is entirely set in a garden backyard, that from your newfound perspective is an expansive grass-bladed jungle filled with once-cute insects, now acting as mortal predators. The level of detail is remarkable with each environment, be it a labyrinthine anthill, the dark depths of a fish pond or a secret, half-wrecked laboratory all crafted with minute attention to detail.\n\nThe story clearly isn\u2019t the main focus, and is narrated in a generally-goofy way that however has its more serious or dramatic moments. Between fully-voiced dialogues and dozens of lore entries in the form of files, recordings and data, you\u2019ll put the pieces together and discover many interesting insights not only on the events but also the locations and bizarre places present in the Backyard.\n\n[h3]Exploration & Survival[/h3]\nThe world is nothing short of massive and is mainly divided in upper and lower backyard, plus a whole series of standalone dungeons be them main-quest related or secondary. You\u2019ll be able to go as you please, although multiple areas will need specialized equipment to make passage feasible, or will simply have too powerful foes for a long time. Between free building, parkour options and several traversal tools like dandelion tufts or ladders, you\u2019ll have many options on how to reach the next unexplored area. All points of interest will be permanently marked on your map, and custom markers are there too for keeping track of places. \n\nHunger and thirst will be your main concerns, both entirely manageable and, while a constant concern, never frustrating or annoying, but instead well-balanced, especially when you learn all the sources and tricks to get the most out of your surroundings, like kicking water drops out of grass blades. In case of death, you\u2019ll respawn at your bed, lose all the inventory except armor and a few other things, but you\u2019ll recover everything if you go back where you died. Items like Molars act as upgrade points when found: you can spend them in the Lab, once unlocked, to improve your character\u2019s stats and learn powerful passive advantages.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2882104599\n\n[h3]Crafting & Base Building[/h3]\nThe system in place to handle progression and research is quite unique. As you find new materials from natural sources, killed enemies and so on, you\u2019ll be able to use one of the several Research Stations around the map to analyze them, gaining insight on what you can build with them and also Raw Science points - used to buy even more recipes and perks from the trader once unlocked. Raw Science may also be found in the world, gained from quests and from some special defense event zones. For the rest, crafting is handed as any other survival game, using specialized workbenches to craft certain resources.\n\nWeapons and armors may also be enhanced up to +8, using rarer materials to increase attack, defense and passive perks in the process. Performing specific actions many times like mining, killing specific enemy categories and so on will unlock Mutations that can be freely enabled on the go to give passive advantages, for instance Ant-Nihilator gives bonus damage against ants, to name one.\n\nBases can be built almost anywhere, with a powerful yet easy-to-use system that allows complex architectures if one wants to. Better get fortified though, as enemies act as factions that will get progressively angry as you inevitably face them in battle while exploring, and attack your base with the intent of destroying it from time to time. A whole array of defenses can be built to help you, like mines, spikes, turrets and more. \n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nThe combat plays out mainly in melee, though ranged options and even magic exist, later on. All enemies have repeated attack patterns you should learn to attack and block at the right times, with perfect parrying being the highlight that, when mastered, can stagger any foe. Manage your stamina wisely and make sure to analyze each enemy\u2019s data card, unlocked by spotting them, to learn their weaknesses and resistances to the many types of damage, and bring the appropriate tool for the job. \n\nBoss fights are challenging and really feel like endeavors that require the best gear available at that point, and the right strategy to beat. Some optional bosses, very obscure to locate, will truly challenge even combat veterans, and award unique materials and items as a reward.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2880244400\n\n[h3]Quests & Secondary Activities[/h3]\nQuests are given by the various terminals in the world, tasking you with scouting places, killing specific enemies or crafting certain items in exchange for Raw Science. The main and side missions may also unlock new recipes, so they are definitely worth doing. Other activities include MIXR defenses, high-stakes sieges against huge hordes of enemies, in return for unique perks and tons of raw science, and also optional or secret dungeons that usually host hidden recipes or unique items.", "timestamp_created": 1667790451, "timestamp_updated": 1667790451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 590, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929015696048736572", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122989470": {"recommendationid": "122989470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391382772", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1707039361}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I've played in a while.

I figured, \"7 Days to Die meets Honey I Shrunk the Kids, sure, why not?\" and I eagerly punched my ticket on the train to capture a little childhood nostalgia. What I got was SO much better, and flat-out impressive for a game that still purports to be on Version 0.3 in an environment where that actually MEANS something (sorry 7DTD, I love you, but 3 years of alpha is silly). \n\nNegatives first, just to get it out of the way: \n1) Steam client doesn't seem to shut the game down properly when it's over. As I write this, it claims that I have 23 hours play time, but I really only have 45 minutes or so in. It only acknowledges the shut down when I completely exit and restart the steam client. So if you're evaluating it against the 2 hour return clock, be VERY aware of this. \n\n2) As other reviewers have pointed out, you do need XBox Live for multiplayer. I don't know if that means you need a paid subscription or not - I happen to be on the 3 month free pass for Discord Nitro. If it does that would be a SERIOUS problem, as multiplayer is where this game's value mostly resides for me. \n\n3) A few more character options would be nice. Mind you, the characters are fully voice acted with unique and endearing personalities, so I understand that's a HUGE ask, but it's my hope that they'll get it up to like 6-8 minimum (12 ideally) before coming to full release. It would be particularly cool if each kid had unique advantages/disadvantages in approaching puzzles and crafting (think old-school Maniac Mansion, for those of you familiar with that game).\n\nThat's about all I have to say in terms of critique. The positives are myriad and amazing by comparison. \n\n1) There's an Engaging Storyline - this was a super welcome surprise and intrigued me almost out of the gate. Without spoiling too much, the characters have no idea how/why they've been miniaturized, and finding out seems to be the main plot. VERY cool. \n\n2) A Robust Quest System - Objectives are auto-accepted and very well tracked. Easy peasy. \n\n3) Engaging Map - Of course I'm only 45 minutes in, so there may come a time when this particular map gets boring/predictable, and hopefully they'll add procedurally generated ones in the future. But what a delight! It feels very wide open and three dimensional, lots of underground tunnels and omnidirectional exploration potential. \n\n4) It's HARD - Medium difficulty is challenging and unforgiving, and the ants will mess you up if you venture into the wrong area before you're ready. I love the challenge. \n\n5) Immersive, delightful art style - Maybe it's being a 7DTD veteran that makes this stand out, but the cartoonish, vibrant and sunny backyard is such a welcome change from the drab motif of the apocalypse. ;) \n\n6) Familiar but Strange - Overall, they really captured the idea of how scale changes the look and feel of otherwise familiar objects and surroundings. They took it way beyond its conceptual roots into new and awesome places. \n\nI'm very happy with the game, and I'm glad I supported it while in early access.

But it manages to make a lot of what it does better than every other competitor. Grounded\u2019s biggest achievement is managing to streamline the actual crafting to the point where its never tedious and doesn\u2019t get in your way almost at all. You don\u2019t have to go sifting through inventories, trying to remember all the components of the thing you need to make. Grounded makes everything in the storage around the workbench accessible, it automatically pulls out what you need when you craft something. Building is streamlined in the same way. Building materials are pulled from nearby storage. Even better, after a long day of wandering around gathering materials and hunting bugs, you can \u201chot deposit\u201d all your materials with one button. And not just into the closest storage, Grounded automatically puts items with others of its type. So if you have some plant fibers in one crate and ant parts in another, it will put the ant parts and plant fibers together. Overall Grounded does a lot to get out of the way of the player having fun, something a lot of survival games could learn from.\n\nI could talk about the rest of the game being fun, exploration being heavily rewarded. The charm of the visual direction, the sense of achievement from taking down the hardest bugs... But other reviews have all talked about that.

I haven't clipped through the world, gotten stuck, glitched out, or otherwise experienced a single issue that isn't an intended game mechanic.\n\nThe Map is humongous and will take you between 8-10 minutes to sprint across, longer if you walk and sprinting across the map isn't really possible because of the nourishment requirements.  \n\nThe enemies are a challenge.

It's very thought out with how all bugs are scaled, along with the different lengths of grass, plants and weeds, it's all so realistic to what you would see in a garden.\n\nIt's a beautiful but scary world, the simplicity of some of the bugs can look the most horrifying up close. But the garden is so detailed and it's only growing with each passing update, even the pond has a magical world underneath. \n\nGrounded can be played solo but exploring this garden by yourself is very challenging and certain things will take a lot of time and effort to achieve on your own, playing with other players is the best way to survive and definitely the most enjoyable. \n\nIf you suffer from Arachnophobia, there is a option to make the spiders less.... spidery, so even you guys can enjoy this game. It's well worth the asking price, just make sure you have someone to travel this garden with you.\nTotal Score = 89/100.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nGrounded is a survival game that can be played either in first-person or a third-person. In the game, the protagonist is shrunk to the size of an ant and must strive to survive in a garden. In the game, the player character (Max, Willow, Pete or Hoops) needs to consume an adequate amount of food and water, or they will lose health due to starvation or dehydration. The garden is filled with various bugs and insects, such as spiders, bees, dust mites, and ladybugs.\n\nAs players progress in the game, they will visit new areas in the backyard. The game's difficulty would slowly increase and enemies that are more dangerous would be introduced. Throughout the game, players need to scavenge resources in the world in order to construct a base so as to defend themselves from hostile enemies, in particular during nighttime as some of the insects become more aggressive. The resources can also be used to craft different tools, traps and weapons, such as axes, spears and bows and arrows, to defeat enemies. Players also need to manage their stamina as the playable character may become exhausted in sustained combat The game can be played solo, though it also has a four-player cooperative multiplayer mode.\n\nSIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:\nArk, Rust, The Forest\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1\u25a1 8 / 10\nHoney, I've shrunk the kids.\n\nRECOMMEDED SPECS\nOS: Windows 10\nProcessor: Intel Core i3-3225\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\nGraphics: Nvidia GTX 650 Ti\nStorage: 8 GB available space", "timestamp_created": 1670762328, "timestamp_updated": 1671973042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 721, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.902637481689453125", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100646739": {"recommendationid": "100646739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416432003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 11938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 565, "playtime_at_review": 5445, "last_played": 1713749225}, "language": "english", "review": "game good i love to play with my dad", "timestamp_created": 1633564897, "timestamp_updated": 1633564897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 182, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.901721477508544922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137660470": {"recommendationid": "137660470", "author": {"steamid": "76561199029389851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 5485, "last_played": 1713409654}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10\n \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1683005309, "timestamp_updated": 1683005309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 287, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900586724281311035", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138839555": {"recommendationid": "138839555", "author": {"steamid": "76561199053490257", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1710100745}, "language": "english", "review": "Took wife and daughter to climb a giant tree.\nArea was dark, so I brought two torches.\nWife and daughter didn\u2019t bring torches\u2026..amateurs.\nHad to inch along the branches so they could see by my light.\nWife complained and asked for my spare torch.\nTold wife if she wanted to see in the dark then she should have brought her own torch.\n\nWife raised eyebrow.\n\nDropped spare torch onto branch for her.\nTorch rolled off branch down to vast emptiness below.

Those spiders ripped us to shreds.\n\n10/10, would lead the worst expedition again.\n\n\nThis is a game that caught me by complete surprise. I don\u2019t normally like survival games. So often they have crafting systems that stretch my ability to suspend disbelief, suddenly able to produce ridiculous items with just a few bare ingredients. I don\u2019t know what it is that's so different about this game, but I had a great time here.\n\nI bought four copies of this game, for myself, my wife, and 8 and 11-year-olds. We\u2019ve been playing it quite a bit for the past couple of weeks, and by now we\u2019ve played just about all it has to offer. We\u2019re holding off a bit on doing the final mission, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be beating it in the next few days, and singing our champion song.\n\nWhere this game truly shines is multiplayer and exploration. If you like those concepts, you would likely enjoy this game. It never really pushes you to go in a certain direction. If you wanted to, from the very start of the game, you could go anywhere. Some of the areas are blocked off in the early game, but the game doesn\u2019t stop you from building staircases to wherever you want to go. It would be foolish, since you\u2019d die quickly in areas you\u2019re not ready for, but the game is all about exploring. There are many interesting things to find along the way.\n\nThe exploration in many ways reminds me of Breath of the Wild, or also The Outer Wilds, which were two games where exploration was fantastic. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good as those two games, but still I always wanted to see more of the map and explore. I don\u2019t care as much for games where they just tell you where to go and you follow the map to the next waypoint. Instead, here you have a very vague idea where things are, and what to do, but it\u2019s up to you to explore and put it together. You have to pay more attention to your surroundings, not some quest-marker holding your hand.\n\nThere were so many bonding experiences we had as a family in this game. My 8-year-old son was fearless, joining me on many an adventure and I found myself following him as he leapt into battle. My 11-year-old daughter was more timid and reserved, scared of the spiders but embracing the base-building part of the game. She designed our base and built first-class rooms for everybody, while still joining in on some of our adventures. My wife isn\u2019t much of a gamer, but sometimes she\u2019d join us and, well, quite honestly, die a lot, but in the funniest of ways. I particularly loved when she randomly threw her expensive weapon into a lake because she couldn\u2019t figure out the controls. It was strange how much my defensive instincts would kick in at trying to keep my family alive \u2013 in a videogame of all things. It was a weird feeling but then again it\u2019s what I loved so much about this game.\n\nTonight I decided to make a scavenger hunt in the game, so I started a new world in creative mode, built stairways and ziplines throughout the world for ease of travel, and placed items in chests throughout the world with cryptic hints for the rest of the family to find. It was a blast to watch them scouring the world to find them. My boy was the one who ended up finishing first. Was again a great bonding experience, and I look forward to doing that again. Endless replayability with that.\n\nWith all of that being said, I don\u2019t think this game is necessarily for everybody. At first I didn\u2019t care much for the combat, it felt very much like button mashing. As the game went along though, I paid much more attention to blocking, and types of weapons, and watching the attack movements of the bugs, and that made it significantly funner. It\u2019s also a game that really is best with at least one other person with you. As a single player experience I think it loses a lot of what makes it great. There also isn\u2019t a ton of story here, and the story itself is meh. But I don\u2019t really think this is a game about story, it\u2019s about exploring and having adventures together.\n\nIs this a perfect game? No. We had some glitches, some disconnections, etc. And on the Xbox One it looks horrible, compared to pc. But for me, videogames are less about graphics and more about experiences. Graphics were pretty, yes, but overall, how do I feel by the end of the game? There\u2019s something about being in a shared world, all working together, to tackle challenges, that just resonated with me in this game. We went from being scared of pretty much everything in the game to eventually being THE THING TO FEAR in the backyard. My boy was fearsome in battle. My daughter made us a wonderful home. My wife was deadly with a crossbow when she could figure out how to use it. And I, well, I just wished it wouldn\u2019t end. It\u2019s been a genuine pleasure that I did not expect but I\u2019m thrilled we experienced.", "timestamp_created": 1684850344, "timestamp_updated": 1684850344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 139, "votes_funny": 54, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900276422500610352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144982408": {"recommendationid": "144982408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366865379", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1129, "playtime_at_review": 405, "last_played": 1713687580}, "language": "english", "review": "realistic depiction of people 5'4", "timestamp_created": 1692965278, "timestamp_updated": 1692965278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 273, "votes_funny": 303, "weighted_vote_score": "0.898449897766113281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121732376": {"recommendationid": "121732376", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064238166", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1662305954}, "language": "english", "review": "this game contain alot of bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1662295972, "timestamp_updated": 1662295972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1495, "votes_funny": 2678, "weighted_vote_score": "0.89253997802734375", "comment_count": 39, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73445600": {"recommendationid": "73445600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005655932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 7383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1635566850}, "language": "english", "review": "So Grounded is amazing and terrifying at the same time. Game needs some difficulty adjustment, but its cool to see a new environment i've never seen in video games.\nKinda jarring.\nALSO FUCK SPIDERS\nWas legit screaming at times.\n\nHere are my thoughts after 7 hours of gameplay.\n\n- Base building is frustrating and bugged. making a roof was mind fumblingly difficult. you definitely need foundations.\n\n- Spiders are cool, but there are way to many of them (especially given that they can one shot you) and they are super buggy. I also find that even if you dont engage them, they passively walk slowly towards your position for quite some time and for some distance. Spiders need an overhaul ASAP\n\n- I would love more items to improve the single player experience. Like maybe a shield or maybe the ability to tame an ant to use as a distraction\n\n- I was TERRIFIED to get to the robot section because it was near the spider filled tree. It adds integral gameplay and should be easier to get to (especially as a tutorial quest)\n\n- Water and food deplete to quickly for me to reasonably explore. Same with food spoiling way to quickly.\n\n- The base building section needs way more stuff to build. I found that once was base was large and done... it was super barren without building the same things over and over.\n\n- The night portion of the game seems... not scary or different. Besides running into spiders I expected something to happen, but nothing did.\n\n- Once I had everything analyzed the analyzing stations seemed pointless. they cant protect from spiders and most of them dont have any special goods. I loved finding the underground one with granola bars. Made it feel special and unique.\n\n- Exploring certain sections definitely showed how much left is in the game. It feels a lot like Raft right now with the chapters coming out over time.\n\n- Multiplayer is bad right now, but I will wait. Just get rid of the XBOX live garbage and let us connect via steam.\n\n- Let us place or throw torches on the ground so we can fight in dark areas with 2 handed weapons. please.\n\n- I really wish some of the quest stuff was slightly highlighted.

This game is a survival game, so you know, managing stats and inventories, building and upgrading to do the next tier of thing until you 'complete' the game. \n\nBUT the thing that's great about this game is it doesn't make things inconvenient for the sake of trying to add more 'gameplay'. It has some amazing systems that put the player first. You can move something you've built without having to grind out the materials again, crafting pulls from nearby containers, you can deposit similar items with a single button. You can switch up your 'build' at a whim, you aren't locked into playing any one way and even online is super straight forward. No having to set up servers, you can just share a world with friends and they can load it up and host it at any point and vice a versa. It respects your time and instead of bloating your play hours with grind, it actually focuses on the player experience.\n\nThe map is really well crafted, no areas of copy paste or nothingness and there's a load to explore, each area has a really distinct feel and some great gimmicks/mechanics. Resources have their own flavour and are all fun to gather, the crafting is pretty well balanced and therefore going to gather materials is actually fun. You do have to consider what you are collecting and gear appropriately but it's not going to take hours to craft one weapon or add something to your base. The enemies are all their own thing too and the difficulty is just right, you never feel OP but you don't feel frustrated by having to run from certain things.\n\nBut the best thing about this game and what I consider makes it a real gem is that anyone could play this. Be a first time survival player, someone new to gaming, a younger sibling or child, a seasoned survival player, there is really something for everyone here. It doesn't rely on lots of lore, lots of gore or lots of grind, it's a very straight forward concept that is frankly, just fun. \n", "timestamp_created": 1672167210, "timestamp_updated": 1672167210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.886814594268798828", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115008018": {"recommendationid": "115008018", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036563094", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 19950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "playtime_at_review": 14753, "last_played": 1713381913}, "language": "english", "review": "Clearly from the amount of hours I have played this game already it is one of my absolute favorite games.

The being shrunk and having to fight in a backyard is appealing. Basebuilding in this game is pretty phenonemal as well as the crafting system. Both were easy to navigate through and learn. Thus far, the crafting aspects in this game are plentiful and NOT repetitive feeling as there is a lot to do with the resources in the game. I had a lot of fun crafting things. For the base, I could also put up blueprint plans as well as for the [Cooking]/[Beds]/etc. and my boyfriend could help me build them. So it allowed for teamwork in the aspect of [I set up the peremiters and plans] and we both harvested resources and delivered them into the spots I planned. It was a lot of fun, and let me know that we both were taking part to build and set up everything unlike a lot of other crafters where I usually am doing solo-basebuilding and my boyfriend is doing a more redudant job of harvesting and storing the resources so I can. This aspect made us both feel more equally involved.\n\nThe difficulty of fighting enemies seems for bigger creatures like [spiders/ladybugs] that seem integral for certain resources that pertain to mainly your [Thirst/Drinking Needs] seems to be the harder curve than [Eating/Sleeping/Shelter.] Even on Mild - despite only playing only Mild/Medium difficulty modes thus far.\n\nSpiders once developing some mutations and having help in multiplayer still however feels appropriately scaled.\n\nAs I have stated in a later part of this review, the ability to climb [unless somehow I didn't ever unlock it] seems neccessary to a point in this world, in my personal opinion. This is where my reduction of points comes from. \n\n[b]GRAPHICS: [9.5/10][/b] - the creation of the 'world' is wonderful. The graphics ran very well with my 1080 GTX and i5 Intel Processor and despite still having Windows 7 OS. I rarely experienced lag whatsoever to my surprise and essentially had no issues of dropping frames. The world itself and its creatures and the science machines are all pretty well detailed and done. Very good also for an xBox game seemingly ported into PC.  The art style and the character design is also a great aspect of this game that should be noted.\n\n[b]MUSIC: [9/10][/b] I can't really ever complain about music unless it's horrendous. There could be more tracks, however. Otherwise if not, still wonderful. At times it feels like I'm in a Cyber weird science movie or Lab.\n\n[b]STORY: [8.5/10][/b] The story and quests definitely are one of the aspects that reel you into this game as the characters try to unveil what has happened, how/why they were shrunk, and who caused this and how you connect to it. For most of the gameplay me and my boyfriend were definitely trying to figure out why these things and unlock tapes scattered through out the world. I do think there could be more guided gameplay of the story > however for early access thus far the story progress despite only getting what I feel like was 1/10+ chunks of the story was still satisfying and leads me to want to play more. \n\n[b]OTHER NOTEABLE ASPECTS:[/b] HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS!!!!! \n\n[do i say more?]\n\n[b][u]++++ CONS +++++[/u][/b]\n\n[b]BUGS:[/b]\nI bought this game and have been playing it with my boyfriend. While I have had to weirdly deal with less bugs [despite out of the 2 of us, my computer despite being custom built is much older and still operates on Windows 7 OS], my boyfriend experienced a few more bugs that made his game play quite a hindrance.\n\nThe bugs he experienced caused his menus to mess up entirely and freeze him and he had to exit out of our session to relog back into it, at times causing him to lose many things in his inventory.\n\nThe bugs I experienced were friction between having to navigate the menus with both my controller and my keyboard despite wanting to test out more game play fully with my controller. If I played with keyboard and mouse, I had no issues fully navigating through the game. \n\nThere was a bug we both experienced in the oak tree with a Wolf Spider that caused the spider to not attack and just sit there. We didn't complain much as it was early in the game and helped us get spider web resources more easily. lol. At times some of the mites would also bug out like this and kind of sit in place whilst doing nothing. On a solo session, I also expierenced the Wolf Spider in the Oak tree not attacking which leads me to believe the spider spawn in that area is busted.\n\nAs it's still an early access game, the bugs are understandable and didn't, for the most part, cause any real damage to playing the game as the game is still forgiving in respawning pretty much what seems to be endless resources but with a difficulty curve even on Medium level not seem so awful.... \n\nThe only other complaint I have about the gameplay itself as far as cons is the ability to NOT BE ABLE TO CLIMB. You can jump, and you can certainly in a way \"Parkour\" but I dropped into a part of the map that did not allow me whatsoever the ability to climb out and didn't seem like it was meant for someone to drop into. Leaving me to have to manually \"Give Up\" which allows you to essentially \"seppuku\" so you can respawn and start over.\n\n[b]XBOX LIVE ISSUES:[/b]\n\nThe next thing I have to complain about which more of has to do with the actual Platform of this game.\n\nYou DO have to have an Xbox Live Account to play this game. Whether you make a new one or not- is up to you.\nHowever, as far as the Steam version goes [as I can't speak of the XBox Market Platform itself as I don't own the game there], you do NOT have to be an active paying Xbox Live [GOLD/ULTIMATE] subscriber to play with your friends. I wanted to make this clear as NO REVIEWS NOR ONLINE GOOGLE SEARCHES had originally answered this question that people have been asking. Whether this changes in the future or not, I don't know - but currently at the time of me writing this review you do NOT.\n\nI did have to download the app on my phone [ I can't download their market platform on my computer as it requires Windows 10] in order to [MAKE MYSELF APPEAR ONLINE] in order to play multiplayer as it wouldn't register me online through the chrome/firefox webpage on their website.\n\n[b]RAW SCIENCE:[/b] [might be spoiler]\n[spoiler]\nRaw science is a currency in game that you unlock in a way similar to I guess [SKILL POINTS] or Unlock points essentially to either BUFF yourself, get more recipes, other unlocks, etc. \n\nThere is a perk supposedly that helps you unlock the ability to find floating chunks of pure raw science through out the world *more easily*, that works similarly to the way you find more of the outdoor science HUD tents. Finding both of these things is cumbersome as their lacks to be a minimap, and your 'scanner/alerter/thingy' is realllllllly REALLY wonky in helping direct you to either of these things- especially pure raw science clusters that are harder to see and more hidden. I feel like the scanner needs to be made radial/directional- because thus far in an open world the only indicator is a flash and a beep from the HUD.

Secondly some of the enemies are too powerful to take on in single player, leading to frustrtion, you would have already been killed 20 times by random spiders and mosquitoes before you are even able to fight them off because of our lack luster gear.

Realistically brutal, as it would be in a bug's life (in this case yours, in their size). The lack of handholding pushes the player to think on their feet, which fits well into the mystery of this situation you are thrown into (unnecessary handholding would've taken away from immersion otherwise).\n\nThe bad:\nThe release of this game at this price point is a little unjustified. Survival games that had an early access (for e.g. The Long Dark) usually come with a decently fleshed out sandbox with the promise of an eventual story, or a decently fleshed out story with a promise of an eventual sandbox. In grounded, we have little of either. The story comes to a very quick end as it is still being created (perfectly understandable). However, there is not much content in the sandbox department as the ceiling of craftables are quite quickly reached (which the exception of tier 2 tools). With a very familiar and simple trope of only having to manage hunger and thirst, there is little to do in the sandbox other than basic base building. Most survival games so far (even on early access release) have had decent enough distractions for your character to manage (Cold, Thirst, Hunger, Fatigue in The Long Dark) or endless base building possibilities (Minecraft). \n\nMany would argue that this is still early access, and there's much more to come. I agree, and I would expect no less from a dedicated dev like Obsidian. However, this release should've been either:\n\n(1) A larger story on release at this current price\n(2) A better sandbox on release at this current price\n(3) Based on the current content, at half its price\n\nOn some closing thoughts, my \"not recommended\" review is specifically on a cost benefit analysis of getting this game in its current state at this price.

The odorous house ant does not have a dedicated soldier class, nor do they really fight all that often. Red ants are generally associated with fire ants, if the red ants are supposed to fire ants, would it not make more sense to switch the two ants tiers?

I knew the game was \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\" as an OWSC game. And that premise didn't seem like one that would draw me in. Likewise, a back yard seemed like an awfully confined setting for an open world. \n\nBut Obsidian knocked it out of the park. The back yard may be small, but it is [b]dense[/b]. There is not a single foot of wasted space. The crafting tree is enjoyable. The base building, while more limited in piece and furniture variety than I would prefer, is solid. I was able to create a player home for myself that I am quite proud of.\n\nI love the whimsy of this game. They had a lot of fun at Obsidian designing this. The backyard has a surprising number of biomes (including a desert setting thanks to the sandbox). There are several \"dungeons\", but the best is the one with the bees. I won't spoil it for you. And I get a real kick out of the attacks based on the elements of candy.\n\nThe combat is fierce and feels great. There are a healthy variety of enemies, many of which have fun combat styles. I also appreciate that there is a respectable number of non-hostile critters spanning all tiers.\n\nThere are multiple difficulties and a lot of very good custom game settings. I started playing on medium difficulty, which felt very challenging without being punishing. I don't care about achievements, so it took me about 60 hours to realize that I wasn't getting achievements because I wasn't logged into X-Box. At about the same time, I was hit by the first bug raid on the home I was meticulously crafting. Random home raids are an element of the game that I can appreciate the challenge of, but that I want to remove. So I switched my game to be a custom game where I could turn that off. I made other custom adjustments such as setting the game to pause while in a menu so I could read data entries at my leisure.\n\nI was happy to learn that there is an optional series of castle-defense style raids in the game that I can participate in to experience that element of gameplay even after having disabled the random home raids. \n\nAs of this review, I have done all but the final quest chain.

Nights are dark and dangerous.\n\nCombat is absolutely savage. You WILL die, alot.\nYou'll be tempted to explore alot, but are quickly punished for wandering about unprepared. \nPlaying with friends is highly recommended.\nComb the backyard's every nook and cranny for new resources to research, and science stuff to unlock better gear.\n\nIt's easy to give the game a quick look and a miss, but it rewards if you stick with it.\nThe insects can sometimes be quite... buggy. ;P It's still in development. Recent content is generous, adding whole new biomes, of which there's plenty.\nNot recommended if you're arachnophobic!! The spiders ARE scary, even if you're not (although there is a feature to reduce their spider-like resemblance).\n\nIt's pretty difficult to map out a playthrough, because things you need are everywhere, and can be found in any order. The yard is your oyster.\nEven though it isn't finished, the game has enough content to keep you quite busy for a while, even without sinking time into building luscious garden palaces.\n\nIt's the adventure you always wanted to have as a kid after seeing Honey I Shrunk The Kids.", "timestamp_created": 1646316767, "timestamp_updated": 1646919449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857998669147491455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119911534": {"recommendationid": "119911534", "author": {"steamid": "76561199069985555", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 15855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 229, "playtime_at_review": 1544, "last_played": 1713656407}, "language": "english", "review": "fun bug game but scary but also fun and scary but mostly fun and a little scary but a lot of the time fun except when its scary", "timestamp_created": 1659401109, "timestamp_updated": 1659401109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 290, "votes_funny": 211, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857840478420257568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99650047": {"recommendationid": "99650047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079234235", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 202, "playtime_at_review": 4545, "last_played": 1713738090}, "language": "english", "review": "***FULL OF BUGS***\n\nBugs include but not limited to:\n   - Mosquito\n   - Ladybug\n   - Variety of ants\n   - Stinkbug\n   - Firefly\n   - Gnat\n   - SPIDERS (multiple types but not technically a bug)\n\nThere are many more bugs than this list!

When you first start playing the game, it can be quite horrifying. Virtually every bug is incredibly strong, especially at the start of the game, and it definitely adds to the overall vibe of the game. Some of the bugs are honestly terrifying, and towards the start of the game I jumped several times (looking at you wolf spiders).\n\nThe level design is fantastic. You can tell they put a lot of thought into where to place objects to let you traverse the map better. This is especially highlighted when you start building zip lines and other objects to help you traverse the map better. \n\nThis is one the best survival games for player progression. There are mutations that are unlocked by using specific types of weapons, or doing specific events. There are also \"milk molars\" that can be used to upgrade stats like HP, Stamina, food consumption, etc. In addition to the armor / weapon systems, you can end up creating a reasonably unique character, this is especially true for a survival game. \n\nThe base building is also amazing. I spent hours building, rebuilding, and adjusting my base. You unlock new building materials as the game progresses, and the base building mechanics are fun enough that it had be wanting to tear down my base just to make a new one out of the material I just unlocked. There is also a fairly basic base defense mechanic that can have some fun. Though, this is one of the areas that I hope they flush out further. \n\nThe Bad\n\nThe game biggest issues is that there is basically no scaling for solo vs. group play. The game is very obviously balanced around group play. Different people will have different opinions on this, but the game is also extremely long. I just can't imagine finding the time to play this game with friends from start to finish. The game can be soloed on the hardest difficulty, but you won't want to. The game needs to scale differently based on the number of players, AND also have a difficulty setting. \n\nYou WILL be cheesing some of the more difficult enemies. Yes yes, I know you're all very awesome at this game and you don't need to cheese but the game can be so incredibly tedious that you will really want to. Gear decays WAY too fast. You will be farming the same parts over and over just to repair the gear you're currently wearing before you end up getting to the end game. Shields can never be repaired with glue, so for most of the game, you will be constantly farming shields parts. This will make the player constantly want to use ranged weapons, because at least your gear isn't breaking every 5 fights. \n\nOn that point, some weapons are just obviously better than others. The greatsword always felt the weakest, shields and bows always felt strong, and maces were somewhere in between. There are different elements that you can imbue your weapons with, and different enemies have different resistances. This seems awesome at first, but then you swiftly realize it becomes a rather tedious and cumbersome mechanic  because you are limited on inventory space. This probably works better with a group of players, but it just ends up being a PITA for solo players. \n\nUpgrades almost seem worthless as equal tier enemies will basically always two shot you. Once you've upgraded your equipment all the way, which takes a very very long time, you might be able to withstand a couple more hits.\n\nBosses especially have just absolutely horrible balancing. Some bosses don't have any cool downs on summoning adds. If you get bad RNG, they will literally sit there and spam adds over and over. At one point I had 8 spiders in the room with a boss. Its clear the bosses were also designed for group play. \n\nFinally, the number one thing that frustrated me the most in this game was the collision and the bugs that came along with it. I was constantly stuck on EVERYTHING in this game. I would have to crouch and bunny hop constantly in this game. When jumping my character would the smallest of obstacles above me and it would send me 10 feet to the left or right. I get that they wanted you to feel like you're in a jungle.  They do a fantastic job at that at making you feel like you're shrunk in someones backyard.  However after 60 hours or so, getting stuck on a tiny pebble while running from a bug, or failing a jump for the 20th time because the game decided to launch me 10 feet, is just insanely frustrating. \n\nMost enemies also don't follow the same collision rules. Most bugs have a specific attacks that will nearly almost land no matter how far you've run, or what obstacle you've put between you since they started the animation. They clip right through objects and land the attack. Lady bugs and Larvae will literally charge right through solid boulders and hit you. They probably did this in an attempt to mitigate cheesing, but its a very lazy solution. Balancing the game appropriately would have been the better decision. \n\nOverall If you're a fan of survival games, this one is a no brainer. IMO,  Its definitely in the top 5 games within the survival genre, and  I could see it easily be considered the best once they iron the rest of the kinks.  \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1665530564, "timestamp_updated": 1665530564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851580202579498291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120188805": {"recommendationid": "120188805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215529000", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1637272907}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is full of bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1659828425, "timestamp_updated": 1659828425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 161, "votes_funny": 342, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85083538293838501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74698633": {"recommendationid": "74698633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054756090", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1363, "last_played": 1704423847}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2611 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{Audience}---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens\n\u2610 Adults\n\u2611 All\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2611 Fast\n\u2611 Rich boi\n \u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{Story}---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely (There isn't alot of the story yet but what they do have combined with the lore is excellent!)\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n---{Game Time}---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 It\u2019s free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2611 Can get annoying ( It's early access so the bugs are understandable and they don't ruin the game at all.

The concept of Early Access has become a fierce cash grab and enables developers to produce minimal content on their own terms, usually very slowly while they harvest money from the hopeful expectations of players. for may gamers, the cost of this game costs two hours of work- and from investment, they get an hour of content. \n\n When the game is beyond a demo phase, I wil likely change this review, but I can't in good faith justify 30 dollars for an unfinished game- even leverage the all-to-common \"Early Access\" excuse often used.

If you get annoyed by missing content, bugs, and crashes, then you might want to wait for a more complete experience.\n\nIt's the well-known genre of basebuilding/survival, where you can build a base, explore, and gradually get better resources and equipment. It works well. Both alone and with friends.\n\nWhat I think makes it stand out is the visuals. It is a unique setting \u2013 and it also looks great!\n\nPros:\n* Looks great\n* Plays well\n* Original setting\n* Fun both alone and with friends\n* A ton of potential here. There is so much fun things they can easily implement and build on this.\n* Scary spiders, but they have an arachnophobia-setting you can use to dial back their appearance to something less scary!\n\nCons:\n* Very Early Access. It just released. This means there is a chance you will run into frequent crashes or gamebreaking bugs requiring you to start over or reload an older save \u2013 although it has not been a major issue for me.\n* A LOT of content still missing. It is clear more is planned. There are locked doors to several bases/labs that you can't enter, and several areas are literally marked in-game as \"under construction\". Missing enemy types. Missing story.\n* Bad pathfinding for the Ai enemies. It is often trivial to make them get stuck somewhere silly so you can just slowly take them down with a ton of weak arrows from a safe distance. I hope they improve this, as it makes some things a bit easier than it should be.\n\nMy recommendation is based on the assumption that they will actively keep building and improving on the game; especially adding more content and story.\n\nUpdate November 2020:  \nThere has been a major update filling in one more area of the map (the pond).

The story is very short too, but until they update it, survival holds its own. I think it has a lot of potential in the future though. I love being able to jump on top of the grass blades and petals, it makes the game feel... small like its supposed to. I like finding all the random objects scattered about the yard, it's fun to see what you'll find next, although I do wish they had more of a purpose besides landmarks.\n\nSome things I think that could use some work/fixing:\n- When me or my friends net drops even the slightest, it kicks the person who joins the game. I've been kicked from the game maybe 20 times today.\n- When the host jumps into a spider web and then breaks it, they are stuck suspended in the air and not able to get out unless they reload the game.\n- The joiner can't see the proper durability on their items when rejoining. They are all stuck on full even if the item is broken.\n- The meat spoilage is way too fast. Food is the one thing you need when waking up, and all the meat is spoiled overnight so I rarely have any food besides things that give me the smallest amount of hunger refilled.\n- I think spiders could use a rework, they hit super hard and there are way too many of them around for how powerful they are and the armor you make before spider armor does not protect you nearly enough to even fight spiders unless you want to shoot 50 arrows into them from afar.\n- Building feels very -iffy too. It was really frustrating to try to build until we found clay foundations, so I think it is a bit better. But I'd still like to see the building be much easier since some of the things are really hard to place and spaz out all over the place.\n\nUpdate after playing a little longer:\n-Spiders aren't too bad if you've got a friend to help kill them, especially the Golden Orbweavers. Blocking is pretty hugely important to fighting stronger things. But I still think there's a lot of them.\n- The lever on the science lab in the tree does nothing to our knowledge.

This differs to its competitors by having no PVP I'm aware of at this stage, but it's the only game I can recall that made me scream out loud. If your arachniphobic (and an adult) just roll with the game as it's designed, even with its seemingly childish art style it is genuinely terrifying, and full of flavour, and after 10 mins the design manages to walk the fine line and come across as rather endearing. I hope the story gets expanded on quickly as 30-60 mins of content actually got me invested which is impressive in a game like this. But as with all survival games, the main content is in just that, survival.\n\nI can honestly say this seems more polished than any of its main competitors after years of development on day one of its EA.

You have to collect better resources and kill stronger bugs to be able to unlock more areas where you will find more quests and learn more about the story. This all requires better tier tools that requires time to get.\n\nSecondly those who are saying multiplayer does not work is also lying. Currently there is no way to join other servers but you can join your friends who host a multiplayer game. You must do this through Xbox friend list which is free to make an account and join them that way.

If you can get a couple of friends to play the game with you then it will be even better and much more enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1596115414, "timestamp_updated": 1596115414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 152, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820817470550537109", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149532384": {"recommendationid": "149532384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087890194", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 112, "playtime_at_review": 3240, "last_played": 1713410307}, "language": "english", "review": "didnt notice any bugs", "timestamp_created": 1699121427, "timestamp_updated": 1699121427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 129, "votes_funny": 361, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820382356643676758", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74374934": {"recommendationid": "74374934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275281641", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 263, "playtime_forever": 1284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1170, "last_played": 1692030906}, "language": "english", "review": "A quick review and feedback\n\n+ An interesting open world. Many places have an interesting multiple-layer design including underground and over the ground (on the tree) layer. With abundant diversity on the map and great reward, it keeps players interested in exploration.\n\n+ Unique, beautiful micro-photograph like graphics\n\n- Not enough contents in the story for now\n\n- Key binding is a hot mess. Even the same action of confirmation, in different menus, you have to use different keys like LMB, Space, W, R, etc. Just make a universal binding for all menus.\n\n- No hitbox. Hitting in the body or head deals the same damage.\n\n- Lack of flexibility in building. For example, players cannot customize the length of stairs or floors, resulting some awkward situations like leaving a hole on the ground.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198778795\n\n- Flaws in building.It is extremely difficult to build stairs between two platforms or build walls between two existing layers. Even if I manage to do it, I cannot do it perfectly. Like here, somehow I have to jump on it instead of walking.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198778287\n\n- The game is not physic, which is fine by me. However, sometimes I cannot build things on a very reasonable spot. And very often it just keeps blinking between red and blue, like even the game can\u2019t tell if you can build things at this spot.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198779074\n\n- Objects going through other objects. It is so often that almost annoys me.  See these examples.\n\nSpider legs went through the wood. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198784035\n\nClovers grew inside my house.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198779724\n\nWalls on the lower floor went through the ground\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198779965\n\nFloors waiting for construction sunk into underground (twice, all with triangle floors)\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198783485\n\nGrass I chopped down sunk into underground, later I found them laying inside the underground tunnel. But more often, they just reappeared after a while.\n\n\nOverall, building mechanics work fine with small, regular shape buildings. But once you build some giant, irregular shape buildings with complex architectural structures, it really sucks. \n\nIt does have potential and I had fun playing it.
