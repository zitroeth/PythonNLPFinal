I don't have any weapon, let's hit the Zombie with my ATV and be done with it\".\nThe ATV could have hit a concrete wall or a zombie, made no difference, just immediately stopped in place.\nNot only the vamp-zombie is an immovable object, just like my ATV it took no damage.\nIt notices me, it slashes and causes a bleeding wound.\n\nNo problem, I have some bandages in my inventory, starting items.\nI run away with my ATV from the zombie and I try to medicate the bleeding wound.\nI click the bandage, I right click the bandage, I try to drag and drop the bandage.\nI have absolutely no clue on how to use the bandage and it's not me, this game has one of the most un-intuitive a stupid UI that I have ever seen and I've played literally thousands of PC games.\nI die from the bleeding wound before I realise how to actually use them, but whatever.\n\nThen I learn how to craft a spear (again, awful system, but whatever), I still want to kill that thing.\nThe keybind to throw a spear is Ctrl + R and then mouse left.\nThis keybind alone should make you ask for a refund, let alone the terrible animations, UI, interactions and all.\nI find the vamp, he's strolling around, I aim the spear at the head of the vamp... HEADSHOT!\nThe thing keeps on strolling around like NOTHING HAPPENED.\nDespite having a 1.5 meters long spear dangling on his head and my ATV roaring with its engine this creature still has not detected my presence.\nWhat an awesome videogame this is!\n\nSo I pick my stone axe and I try to get the creature attention, it chases me on some rocks, I notice he's gotten stuck and I go just below it and I start to pummer the tip of his toe with my Stone Axe.\nThe creature dies.\n\nWhat drunken creature developed this game is uncertain, it must be bought and installed just for the sake of experiencing how convoluted and abstruse the UI is.

I have a few recommendations based on the few hours that I have played, and based around several other survival games that I have extensive hours in:\n\n1) Multiplayer is needed.\n2) Random map generation\n3) Zoomable Map\n4) The ability to place map markers\n5) Brick forge load/unload is clunky\n6) Too many \"click\" executions to get stuff done.\n7)  Beasts of burden - sick of walking everywhere (too slow)\n8)  Improve tool wear\n9)  Food spoilage is excessive\n10)  More box slots\n11)  Active mini map and compass visible during travel (main screen)\n12)  Enable clothing repair.  Wear rate is way to high.\n13)  Benches/Stations needs an accessible recipe list (right click)\n14)  Food that has been dried should not spoil at the same rate as other food when taken from the rack.  The meat is essentially \"cured.\"\n15)  Provide a means to reduce foliage clutter.  For older players like me I find it to be a bit overwhelming and distracting.\n16)  Gamma control would be nice.\n17)  Icon size/Stored Item:  Cloth and Kevlar are building materials.  Why is the Kevlar icon 5 times the size of cloth?  Wasted space in the box.  Same with several other materials.\n18)  Resources.  Too much lead and not enough iron.\n19)  Rocks in the caves that are stuck in walls and in the water (on occasion) do not produce resources when mined.\n20)  Make tools dragable from your backpack into your inventory.\n21)  Mineral Extractor pull rate is too slow.  For some reason stone comes in faster than ore.\n22)  Resource collection is not in line with the sleep cycle when you select it.  While sleeping the equipment being used to pull resources should continue to collect them and expend the fuel used to power them.\n23)  You should not freeze to death in a cave.  In almost every instance a cave is temperate, maintaining a constant temperature (unless you happen to be at one of the arctic poles).\n24)  Tools are repairable.  Why not the weapons?\n25)  The backpack needs more than 4 slots.\n26)  Some items need to be able to be snapped into position like other building structures (i.e., shelters, storage boxes and planter boxes.)\n27)  Canned goods should be non-perishable and a cabinet/shelf would be nice to store them.\n28)  Fish baskets or a better fishing mechanic other than using a spear.  Bow fishing?  Maybe an old fashioned fishing pole?\n29)  It would be nice to have the materials stackable in the mixer versus standing there doing one load at a time.\n30)  A tool that would allow for path clearing without the vegetation growing back would be great", "timestamp_created": 1619514559, "timestamp_updated": 1620142593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 170, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.899553000926971436", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74159055": {"recommendationid": "74159055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074209496", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 387, "last_played": 1702322127}, "language": "english", "review": "The infected is a kind of mix between Green Hell and The forest to my point of view. I played around 6 hours.\n\nThis game has a really good potential, but is in early stage development. However, it is yet clearly playable, and has already a reasonable number of items to be crafted.\n\nI must say it is not really an easy game : \n\n  - As in Green Hell, you have different types of food to deal with: thirst, proteins, carbohydrates, fats and vitamins. If you are missing any type of nutrient or are dehydrated, your life gradually decreases, and you eventually die. So you have to manage your food.\n \n  - When you die, you respawn next to your bed with all of your ressources, but your maximum HP decrease. You begin the game with 100/100 HP, if you die 5 times, you respawn with 75/75 HP (5 HP per death). Maybe in later game some items permit you to recover your maximum amount of HP, but I didn't go so far in the game.\n\n  - Around day 5 infected start to harass you, so like in The Forest you need to build a good base.\n\nBuilding structures is like in The Forest or Green Hell : you place the blueprint and then bring ressources into it.\n\nBackpack and crafting items is like in Green Hell, maybe less optimize for now, but is okay.\n\nYou have to visit infected camps to discover new technologies (like fridge or solar panels), but I didn't go so far in the game.\n\nGraphicaly it is okay, I would say good, but it is sometimes difficult to see where are animals / interesting plants as the vegetation is a bit redondant and dense.\n\n\nTo conclude I think it worth to invest 12$ if you like games like Green Hell or The Forest, and to support this game.

The rainstorms with a headset somehow sounds like I'm actually there.\nMusic - Only the intro and that's a pro for me in this style game.\nGame Play - Semi challenging, gradual but slow difficulty increase, overall; relaxing.\nGame Play setting - a HUGE bonus. It's simple but customizable to fit the player.\nCrafting - Nice variety and clean\nBugs - Haven't come across any\nGame Stability - Solid\n\nSemi Cons - I say semi because I realize this is still pre-release\n\nGame Depth - It's lacking\nCrafting Options - Nice selection but still feels a bit limited\nConstruction Materials - Iron has no simple way to build up to attaining easily and feels like a constant wall. This is an issue as it's the central lynch pin for construction. Anything  before iron takes effort which is good. Anything AFTER iron takes effort up to being semi easy. Iron? It's just a flat out continual pain and grind. The number of materials that require iron plus the number of straight up ingots for both low and high level crafting make it feel like a slog. Even when you craft a miner that requires 18 iron ingots (serious effort) it is VERY slow in harvesting only metal fragments. It takes 5 fragments to make an iron bar so you are looking at around 25 minutes real time to get just ONE bar. The return on investment is abysmal.\n\nTake into account copper. Go to a mining area. Smash rocks and almost every rock gives copper. Set up a miner and every five minutes is more copper. You get the gist.\n\nLet me sum it up. \nIt's a nice game and a steal for $13 dollars.\nThe game foundation building, setting and game play is solid. Keep up the good work, you've got something really good.\n\nOk last and final note and this has been said, rehashed and tossed around so I want to clear up something really really fast. Anyone that has programmed a game uses a game engine - duh! But what many don't realize is that when you are an indie dev that doesn't have a massive budget, you can't afford a pile of artists, game designers and the list goes on. The solution? Each engine offers what are called \"Assets\". These are created by people and put on a store to be sold over and over again for anyone's use. This saves dev's MASSES of money so that you can play a game. Now the hitch. On occasion various games will buy the same asset packs (totally legal) and as result you have a game with very similar features such as this game and Green Hell. It is NOT plagiarizing, it's NOT theft, it's NOT illegal. The number of people griping about this is crazy. That's the same thing as two people going to walmart, buying the same bike in the same color and then claiming the other person stole their bike because it looks the same. \n\nSo I say buy and enjoy. To the devs I say, don't let us down!\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1631462714, "timestamp_updated": 1631462714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857626497745513916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121055970": {"recommendationid": "121055970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859050260", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 730, "last_played": 1706319324}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game but really needs multiplayer", "timestamp_created": 1661182353, "timestamp_updated": 1661182353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 117, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.856275260448455811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89277289": {"recommendationid": "89277289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305159327", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1615740265}, "language": "english", "review": "I want multiplayer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1616966164, "timestamp_updated": 1616966164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 244, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855896353721618652", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102910962": {"recommendationid": "102910962", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013376432", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 654, "last_played": 1706999966}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good game but you need to make it multiplayer. i feel like more people would play it if it was multiplayer survival. other than that great game and everybody should get a chance to play it.", "timestamp_created": 1637111368, "timestamp_updated": 1637111368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 134, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.854138970375061035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114826342": {"recommendationid": "114826342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279131105", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10080, "last_played": 1699126469}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]The Infected[/b] is an extremely charming and captivating survival and crafting game with an out-of-the-ordinary, gloomy atmosphere.

Relatively complex and the visual and audio components are excellent.\n\nThe game currently contains a great amount variety in it's resources, a steady development and progression with new workstations and crafting availability, and upgrade-able building pieces. You can plan out a base using the ghost-object feature, and most - if not all - objects such as chests and campfires can be moved once crafted and placed, so no need to wait to craft stuff for the perfect place. The developer recently added building on uneven and rocky terrain, such as cliff sides and hills, with the addition of adjustable building heights. All building pieces snap really cleanly and are made well.\n\nThere's also a demand for exploration, as you need to obtain specific tech to build the respective workstations and other craftables. These can be found in the Vambie camps scattered throughout the map, alongside other loot. With the recent additions of caves and infections, there's not only the option to explore - there's a need to do so.\n\nThere is an in-depth vitals and nutrients aspect, containing things like carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. Temperature is also a big factor, which changes according to the realistic seasonal changes, both visual and practical. For example, lakes freeze over in the winter and crops wither outside. Additionally, the weather interacts with some placeables; so if your fires aren't under cover when it rains, they will be distinguished. Similarly, your crops will be watered upon raining, too.\n\nThe developer is an absolute MACHINE, putting out bug fixes and updating versions of the game constantly. There are pretty much daily updates and bug fixes, alongside the developer working on adding new features, such as scorpions and new building pieces being introduced within the next couple of weeks. They are not only listening to the player base for bug fixes and features we'd like to see, but is also adding things from their own vision and keeping the games new and interesting. \n\nVisually, the game is stunning. Very detailed shrubbery and surroundings. The audio is exceptional, too, with realistic weather and player interactions.\n\nThe AI Vambies aren't that challenging at the minute, however the developer is working hard and has upcoming updates for them to become a more formidable opponent. You can also turn on the option for swarms which are introduced after a certain amount of in-games days for a more combat-like game style, or you can turn the Vambies off completely for a survival-craft game style. It's really up to you.

This does make me happy.  I am, however, waiting to see if the Dev decides to remove the land claim pole (#2, below) since there is zero reason for something that is typically seen in multiplayer/co-op games to be utilized in a game that will never have multiplayer/co-op. I still play v13 and my base gets assaulted constantly without the need for any special forced 'triggering' mechanism.  I am cautiously hopeful because I really want to give a favorable review and return to this game.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI consume survival/crafting games like a drug.  I absolutely adore the genre.  Found The Infected from a Youtuber and started playing v13 immediately and fell in love.  Certainly, it needed more, but that's the nature of Early Access.  Still, I loved what I was experiencing and the community is positive and helpful when you need suggestions or answers to questions.\n\nThen v14 came along and EVERYTHING changed.  So much so, I'm not feeling the same love.  I have tried, really tried, to play the new map but I cannot get into the mechanics.\n\n1. Don't get me wrong, the map is gorgeous - but far to large for a dedicated single player game.  So large that it actual feels empty.  I find it to be both vast and claustrophobic at the same time with the size and scope combined with the roads winding between towering mountains and narrow canyons. If you are like me and try to find 'THE' perfect base location you're going to be traveling - a lot.  And probably dying - a lot.  \n\n2. The new enemy AI system being tied to a 'land claim pole' where you can only place items that run on power within a certain radius is the main reason I cannot/will not play v14.  The entire premise makes zero sense and is utterly immersion breaking.  The AI could have be tuned to be attracted to light/sound/activity without the need for a pole that limits how you build.  (it's been done in other games, it could have been done here as well.) Trying to imagine that I as soon as I set down a 'pole' to claim an area of land and immediately 3 camps of enemies just sit around the perimeter and wait to attack when the 'meter' is full - feels utterly artificial and forced.  The wandering enemies from v13 felt vastly more 'natural' when they encounter my base.\n\n3. The new enemy design choice was...strange.  The previous models were good.  Yes, they needed a graphical upgrade, but I'm not sure how the current designs are supposed to flow with the description of the game.  They look good, they just don't feel right since we went from what is described as a viral mutation and now morphed into supernatural fantasy  and that is just weird.\n\nPlease, do not let pure negativity be the only thing you take from this review.  I do not hate the game.  There is a lot to enjoy here.  At its heart as a survival/craft game it is excellent with many superb features like dynamic weather, seasons, a plethora of different building and crafting pieces.  I just feel the need to focus on expressing my opinion on 3 issues that I find to be a roadblock to my personal enjoyment of it. \n\nI appreciate an active indie Developer that is regularly updating content/patching bugs.  They've been working hard and it shows.  I just wish that it felt they were taking some of the more critical feedback and legitimate concerns more seriously.   There's a vision of your game - and then there is the game that is going to sell and bring in players.  The purpose of Early Access is to 'send out feelers' so to speak and see what is working and what is not.\n\nI still play v13 - I still love that version.  However, until there's some sort of major change to the land claim pole being tied to the new AI combat requirement in v14, I will only play the v14 map with the enemies turned off and do a craft/survival against nature and the elements type of gameplay.\n\nI seriously wish Steam would implement a Neutral review because I am very conflicted here.\n      - Based on my experiences with v13 - yes, I recommend.  \n      - Based my experiences with v14, v15 - no, I cannot recommend.\n      - Based on v16 notes - Cautiously hopefully things are changing for the better so I'm \n        Neutral on it now.", "timestamp_created": 1684344610, "timestamp_updated": 1696026109, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 123, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.829969406127929688", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74515717": {"recommendationid": "74515717", "author": {"steamid": "76561199063576708", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 596, "last_played": 1630177552}, "language": "english", "review": "2 words ..... I'm hooked!! \n\nSeriously, this is one of the best EA survival games out there... it's up there with Mist Survival, one of my favourites. Little things like temperature change when outside in the rain, next to a fire, going indoors. The attention to detail is awesome and i very much look forward to seeing where this goes. \n\nOne bit of advice, get a farm going asap! Carbs aren't easy to find, so when you find them, harvest them and get them planted. I've got a decent supply now with seeds to spare and I've only been playing for 11 hours.\n\nAs for future development, I'd love to see shift click into storage etc, also when you go into a container your inventory automatically goes into the food section, it would make more sense to open up the main compartment first - just a little niggle but one i can live with. \nWould be great to see berries and nuts in the game, herbal medicines - maybe more ways to affect your health other than being attacked - illness etc, more uses for the hide i'm stashing from animal kills - or perhaps make the hide relevant to the animal, like currently birds give you feathers - perhaps sheep could give you wool etc which you could craft clothing,  more cooking recipes, more ways to improve health points i.e. when you die the penalty is 5 points off your total health. There's only 1 thing can help with that currently that i can see.\n\nAnyway, just little ideas - understandably it's a single developer and it's a big job doing it alone.

You struggle to feed yourself initially and am in bit of a muddle till you sort out your plan. You build your small cabin and then you plan what is the next course of action.  Is it the forges, is it the towns to get the blueprints or is it to sit it out and  build the basics then start to explore.   Winter is ahead and you gotta prepare.  This survival game is a lot of fun.  It is gritty, does not hand hold too much (thank goodness), and looking for the tech papers is now very easy - too easy.  Once they were in bookcases and one had to have patience and search a little bit, but now they are on tables and easy to spot.  It  was sad to see this change as the challenge now is minimal.  However in saying that, it does not distract from the rest of the survival aspects.    \n\nNow looting in the villages becomes a bit addictive but also very fun.  The Infected creatures are mean, but if that is not to the players taste, they can be altered in settings to be less of a thread or even no threat.  The settings generally are very generous for custom play. The building side is great and is simple to do. There is a decent amount of furniture, building objects, decorations to keep one occupied.

I can tell you that is wrong! This has some great mechanics and amazing audio. \n\nI would consider myself a veteran in the survival game genre, having played most other survival titles available on steam and I'm thoroughly impressed considering this is still in EA. The scenery is rather beautiful and the detail among the rocks is outstanding. The animations for harvesting logs and stone are simple yet clean. The crafting is similar to that of Green Hell only executed much, much better. The audio is outstanding, lovely atmospheric sounds, animal noises and best of all... Thunder! The rain and thunder in this game is so realistic to where the people I live with, genuinely thought it was thundering outside when I was playing without headphones.\n\nThe base building really shines for me, everything snaps in its proper place with ease and is easily rotated so walls and roofs etc are facing the correct way. The blueprint system for base building is very good, quite similar to The Forest but the best part about base building in this? You can move built items to wherever you want! This is a massive feature because it allows you to build items you need and not have to worry about base planning right of the bat.\n\nThe changing of seasons is a nice touch allowing fruit and vegetables to grow abundantly during the warmer seasons and then none available to harvest during winter. Water freezes over during the winter also making the map easier to traverse over but making it a little more difficult to source water.\n\nThe only real thing that needs work is the vambies and nutrients system. The vambies animations are a little wonky and silly but still provide a good threat within the game. I also find there to be no audio for them either when you haven't been detected. It would be nice to hear some footsteps or even some light growling so you know they're nearby.

Uses the \"ghost frame\" system of The Forest. You can relocate base features without losing any materials\n* I really like the weather effects (thunderstorms, fog)\n* You get a minibike with portable storage right at the start of the game. I wish more survival games did this\n* Survival meters (food, water, temperature, etc) aren't too obnoxious. Once you know a bit about the game it isn't hard to obtain food and water. The game has separate protein and vitamin meters... was worried this was going to be a bit annoying, but you mostly just have to mix meat and vegs, so no big deal\n* Excellent range of game options; you can turn off enemies, hordes, hostile animals, adjust weather/season, disable hunger/thirst\n\nCons:\n* Melee combat is absolutely terrible. You can swing a katana at a frog 20 times and not hit. There is poor feedback so it is hard to tell when you actually hit enemies. Enemies on the other hand do running jump attacks, so you can't just carefully back away poking at heads of slow moving enemies like in 7 Days to Die\n* Most of the world is just copy and paste forest, just there to waste time and bike fuel traversing. Lacks memorable locations\n* Buildings you loot have a very \"store bought asset\" feel. Many great games are built from store bought assets, but still...\n* There is no plot or objective beyond \"make stuff for the sake of making stuff\"\n* Icons popup with no clear way of knowing what they mean. If you bring up the menu you can then mouse over the icon. A \"skull and crossbones\" means \"food poisoning\" apparently (eat a egg or potato to fix), but a \"dizzy\" icon means \"a vital stat is low\", but you sometimes can't tell what stat it means\n\nWeird:\n* Ramming a bike into a deer at full speed stops you dead with a \"clink\" sound effect\n* Killing a frog and a adult grizzly bear both give you one piece of meat\n* Red foxes attack humans on sight despite their size?\n* Rain water needs to be boiled to be safe to drink. Um, maybe there is a virus in the rain?\n* Left Shift + Right Click to move items between containers.... that's weird right?\n* You can have location specific injuries. Your left arm and right leg can both be bleeding, and need to be bandaged separately using a paperdoll UI. The precludes hot-keying certain medical items. Is this good/bad/weird? It just seems more complicated then necessary perhaps\n\nObviously inspired by The Forest and 7 Days to Die. I almost give this a \"yes\" vote, but it fumbles two critical areas; combat and a clear goal. But it also does a lots of things really well if you want to put it on peaceful mode and just build without dealing with the terrible combat.

Game has improved, yet the progress still kinda slows once you start building the more advanced work stations. Initially it was impossible to get iron, you'd basically have to loot the ghost towns full of vampires to be lucky enough to get 1 or 2 pieces. Now you can smelt the rocks for iron fragments, and then make a iron ingot with 5 fragments. Iron is readily available now! Given you have the patience to wait! (Or be me, and make 5 stove furnaces so you can make 2 ingots at a time). \n\nSo that's great, you've finally got enough iron so now you think you can make the next level of gear, and achieve passive ore gathering. Wrong. You can't work the extractor without oil, you can't get oil because you'd need at least 100 electricity to make the oil extractor function (and 15 aluminum ingots), you can't get electricity because you'd need a lot of aluminum ingots (the cheapest option takes 5 aluminum ingots and you'd need at least 3 because they only give 40 electricity). You cannot get aluminum at a reasonable rate without the mineral extractor in the cave, you can't use the extractor without oil. Do you see the issue?\n\nWe're back to square one with searching the ghost towns for ore, just now its aluminum and not iron. The map is new and different, you're given an ATV to help get around. Though it needs gasoline to work, so if you run out while driving you're stuck walking an empty map hoping you find a village that may have some gas.\n\nGame is fun starting off, but once you start trying to seriously make progress it just falls apart with tediousness.", "timestamp_created": 1619898054, "timestamp_updated": 1684459440, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723573565483093262", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114363236": {"recommendationid": "114363236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198874515706", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1651098125}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game wish it had multiplayer tho but hopefully they add it in the game", "timestamp_created": 1650753644, "timestamp_updated": 1650753644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720072090625762939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86367168": {"recommendationid": "86367168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059901400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7094, "last_played": 1702682807}, "language": "english", "review": "Firstly let me start by saying this is a lone developer.  What he achieves and produces puts things in perspective.  He, for one actually listens to feedback and is very consistent in updates and further development.\n\nThe game is in early access, however the only bug i have personally experienced since playing this since very early release is cut down logs sporadically getting thrown in the air by dumb ass animals running.  So please do not let that put you off what is nothing short of a fantastic game.\n\nThe grind is very real in this game, however you get rewarded massively for time and effort spent.  If you are unsure check out kage848 and gameedged on youtube who have very comprehensive and funny play through videos.\n\nI play this with my son and we take shots about weekly to gather resources, build and further progress the game together.  In my personal opinion it is far superior to other games such as rust and the massively over-hyped valheim, but that is just one persons opinion.  It is very clean, runs fantastically on my PC at 4k at over 60 fps.\n\nPros:\n\n- Base building is MASSIVE, you have so much customisation and time progression.\n- Weapons such as the bow and spear have realistic properties making you feeling like Legolas on roids.\n- Updates are frequent, and actually matter adding whole new levels to the game.\n- Graphics are good and can be customised to have things like less foilage.\n- The sound and music are atmospheric, not the best but suit the game very well.\n- You can pick up and play straight away, without obtrusive tutorials making you look like a dumbass.\n- Surviving is not straight forward, protein, carbs, fats and vitamins all matter.  You cant just munch on a sheep and be fine.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- No multiplayer, this is the single most bugaabear that there is.  With it this game could reach another level.\n- Interface can be a pain, using variants of \"RMB\" \"E\" \"ctrl\" \"alt\" combinations are poor.\n- Very little RPG elements.  Dying makes you lose max health and stamina, eating good food replaces and increases it.\n- Very little or no story behind it apart from your enemy is/are vambies.\n- AI is not great, the AI tend to be equally unpredictable and stupidly predictable attacking you.\n- Vambies, seriously, a cross of vampire and zombie?  The enemies should have some kind of meaning or background.  Psycho infected sheep that head butt you would have been more amusing and made more sense.\n\nOverall, you want a game that is massively value for money and engrosses you then stop reading this and buy it now.  As of the 11th of February writing this I cannot recommend it enough.  My scores reflect my experience of the game taking into consideration all aspects including the fact that this is a solo developer.\n\nIf you want an online game to play with friends, look elsewhere.\n\nSpecs:  Budget sub \u00a3600 system\n\nMobo: MSI gaming 5 z97 gaming 5\nCPU: i7 4790\nRam: 16 gb ddr3 corsair vengance\nGPU: Palit RTX 2070", "timestamp_created": 1613001988, "timestamp_updated": 1613001988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718483030796051025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108164533": {"recommendationid": "108164533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354504489", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 22985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14386, "last_played": 1697377463}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game and I have a ton of hours logged into it.

I'm going to break this game down into sections to help you understand more of what this game is about and what you can expect from it!1. Graphics - 9/10 the graphics within this game are incredibly smooth and realistic especially for a game in alpha (the current version released at the time i'm writing this) they are clean and crisp and really add to the experience of making you feel totally alone and isolated in a survival situation.2. Objective - 7/10 if completing missions and following a story line is what your looking for then you may want to reconsider, yes there is clear objectives within this game one of which is surviving and the other is locating blueprints which allow you to access new items, however once you have located all of these plans/blueprints there is no other real objective besides expending your base/settlement and building those items you have unlocked.3. game-play -  9/10 not much to say here other then the game flows very well, a couple minor bugs but nothing major mostly visual glitches, overall a great open world survival if that's what your looking for!4. challenge - 8/10 this game offers many challenges including, trying to survive, fighting off wildlife, and surviving the undead, there is always something to do and the only reason this game does not get a 10 in this department is once you hit the end game basically all the challenge aspect goes out the window as it becomes fairly easy, however that is the case with most games.5. mobs - 4/10 - this is really the only issue i have with this game, there definitely needs to be a rework of some mobs within the game, the undead or \"vambies\" are very week and easy to fight off compared to some other hostile mobs such as foxes which are incredibly fast and hard to hit6. weather -  10/10 the developer could not have done a better job when designing the weather within this game, the rain in the summer and spring and the snow in the winter really makes you feel as if its actually happening right outside your window, the sound the storms bring with there roaring thunder is truly amazing and is a awesome feature within this game7. Price - 10/10 the amount of content and fun you will get to experience out of this game for the price is amazing, this game offers one of the best price/content rates i have seen and over all is definitely worth the purchase.8. Conclusion - in conclusion i would rate this game a 8/10 and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great open world survival game, the amount of content you receive  for the price is truly amazing and you cant go wrong i think that anyone who gives this game a chance would truly enjoy them self and agree with me when i say it was worth the purchase!", "timestamp_created": 1600225122, "timestamp_updated": 1600225122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701848804950714111", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104605812": {"recommendationid": "104605812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079480068", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2665, "last_played": 1700323131}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the game, hate bears, praying co-op feature gets added", "timestamp_created": 1638131346, "timestamp_updated": 1638131346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701397240161895752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111187607": {"recommendationid": "111187607", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971932960", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 14782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 157, "playtime_at_review": 5848, "last_played": 1712706025}, "language": "english", "review": "The Infected is a game of grinding, resource gathering, crafting, building, farming and preparing for the next attack.

Usually in a survival game, the point is to survive because death has consequences, like some penalties, setting you back from progressing.  Not in this one.  Well, you lose 1 point of max health when you die, but only down to 50%.  You lose no items, you clear all your infections, recover your stats to 50% and you get a free ride to your base if you have a bed there.  It's almost like dying is a good thing in this game, a good way to recover.\n\nOn top of that, the combat is very lackluster.  With the smaller vambies, you just spam-click the spear and they dance before letting out an annoyingly loud scream that can't be turned down in the audio settings.  There's no feedback from getting hit except a subtle blood splatter and health going down, if you happen to notice them.\n\nThere's also some artificial difficulty such as having to find the technology to craft an advanced workbench just to attach a steel tip to a wooden stick to craft a spear even though you can already craft an almost identical stone or bone-tipped spear.  You also need a fancy metal butcher table to harvest meat from larger animals, even though you can easily harvest frogs and birds on the ground.  It would make more sense to keep such technology requirements for things that actually make sense, such as crafting electric components.\n\nIt's a game with good potential and looks, but it's still currently too rough and non-rewarding as a game for me to recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1662873190, "timestamp_updated": 1662873190, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694645285606384277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91240572": {"recommendationid": "91240572", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996273719", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 802, "playtime_forever": 1404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1620663813}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Information / Review English[/h1]\n\nThe Infected is a Singleplayer Open World Sandbox survival Game that transports us into an apocalyptic Future, which is still in the Early Accessphase.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2473531408\n\n[h1] Gameplay / Story [/h1]\n\nThe Infected is played from the Firstperson Perspective. In the Game, a Virus hit the World, or rather the supposed cure for the Virus. In the course of a violent Virus pandemic, a Treatment was quickly developed that was even very promising at first and healed People. But nobody expected the side effects. The Antidote mutated human DNA and turned people into Monsters called Vambies, a hybrid mixture of Zombie and Vampire. In the Game you slip into the role of an adult who sets off into the wilderness against this Vambie background to look for his Child and his Friends. The young People wanted to spend the weekend Camping in the Forest and have since disappeared without a Trace.\n\nIn the Forest, survival is on the Agenda. You start by collecting Wood and Stones in order to build a small base with the help of the Construction menu. A wooden Floor, a few Walls and Windows and a flat Roof, you have your little Shelter. The building can accommodate a Bed, Storage boxes, Workbench and Forge, as well as various other things. If you have built and lit a Campfire outside, you can boil Water there and prepare Food. Hunger, Thirst, Body temperature and general well-being should always be kept in mind. To get the necessary Food, you can hunt Animals in The Infected or cultivate various Plants such as cucumbers, Corn or Melons, provided you have found the Seeds you need. In short, The Infected has a lot of all the Features a survival Heart desires. A Day and Night cycle with really, dark, scary nights, several Weather scenarios and even different seasons round off the survival Scenario. A lot to craft, a lot to cook and a lot to discover in a really lively environment with numerous Plants and Animals. But because of the sheer survival and Inventory management, one must not forget the threat posed by the Vambies, who apparently have their own warehouse deep in the Forest and will be on the doorstep by the 5th day at the latest. So a fence and other defensive measures shouldn't be neglected.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2473549735\n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ Zombies and Vampires in one\n+ gripping struggle for survival\n+ detailed Forest environment\n+ nice Weather effects\n+ realistic, sometimes eerie sound effects\n+ different Types of Opponents\n+ good Mix of exploring, fighting and crafting\n+ scary Zombie/Vampire horror\n+ Price / Performance ratio is right\n\n[h1] Contra [/h1]\n\n- collect monotonous Resources\n- Start is too difficult for Beginners\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nThe Infected sets Survival and Exploration in a particularly atmospheric way through Horror elements and is already Fun and doesn't have to Hide from other Games of this Genre.

Im Spiel hat ein Virus die Welt vor die Wand gefahren, oder besser gesagt das vermeintliche Heilmittel f\u00fcr das Virus. Im Zuge einer heftigen Viruspandemie wurde schnell eine Behandlung entwickelt, die zuerst sogar sehr vielversprechend war und Menschen geheilt hat. Doch niemand hatte mit den Nebenwirkungen gerechnet. Das Gegenmittel lie\u00df die menschliche DNA mutieren und die Menschen verwandelten sich in Monster, sogenannte Vambies, eine Hybrid-Mischung aus Zombie und Vampir. Im Spiel schl\u00fcpft man nun in die Rolle eines Erwachsenen, der vor diesem Vambie-Hintergrund in die Wildnis aufbricht um nach seinem Kind und dessen Freunden zu suchen. Die Jugendlichen wollten das Wochenende mit Camping im Wald verbringen und sind seitdem spurlos verschwunden.\n\nIm Wald steht \u00dcberleben auf dem Programm. Man beginnt damit Holz und Steine zu sammeln, um mithilfe des Baumen\u00fcs eine kleine Basis aufzubauen. Ein Holzfu\u00dfboden, ein paar W\u00e4nde und Fenster und ein flaches Dach, schon hat man seinen kleinen Unterschlupf. Im Geb\u00e4ude kann man ein Bett, Lagerkisten, Werkbank und Schmiede sowie diverse andere Dinge unterbringen. Hat man sich drau\u00dfen ein Lagerfeuer gecraftet und entz\u00fcndet, kann man dort Wasser abkochen und Nahrung zubereiten. Hunger, Durst, die K\u00f6rpertemperatur und das allgemeine Wohlbefinden sollte man immer im Auge behalten. Um die n\u00f6tigen Lebensmittel zu bekommen, kann man in The Infected Tiere jagen oder diverse Pflanzen wie Gurken, Mais oder Melonen kultivieren, sofern man die daf\u00fcr ben\u00f6tigten Samen gefunden hat. Kurzum, The Infected bringt ziemlich viel von all den Features mit, die das Survival-Herz begehrt. Ein Tag- und Nacht-Zyklus mit wirklich, dunklen, gruseligen N\u00e4chten, mehrere Wetter-Szenarien und sogar verschiedene Jahreszeiten runden das Survival-Szenario ab.\nViel zu craften, viel zu kochen und viel zu entdecken in einer wirklich lebendig wirkenden Umwelt mit zahlreichen Pflanzen und Tieren. Aber vor lauter Survival und Inventar-Management, darf man auch nicht die Bedrohung durch die Vambies vergessen, die offenbar tief im Wald ein eigenes Lager haben und sp\u00e4testens am 5. Tag vor der Haust\u00fcr stehen werden. Ein Zaun und andere Verteidigungsma\u00dfnahmen sollten also nicht vernachl\u00e4ssigt werden. \n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ Zombies und Vampire in einem\n+ packender Kampf ums \u00dcberleben\n+ detaillierte Waldumgebung\n+ sch\u00f6ne Wettereffekte\n+ realistische, teils unheimliche Soundeffekte\n+ unterschiedliche Gegnertypen\n+ gute Mischung aus Erkunden, K\u00e4mpfen und Crafting\n+ schauriger Zombie-Horror \n+ Preis/Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis stimmt\n\n[h1] Kontra [/h1]\n\n- monotones Ressourcen sammeln\n- Start ist f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger zu schwer\n\n[h1] Fazit [/h1]\n\nThe Infected setzt das \u00dcberleben und Erkunden durch Horror-Elemente besonders atmosph\u00e4risch in Szene und macht jetzt schon Spa\u00df und muss sich vor anderen Spielen dieses Genres nicht verstecken.

The first couple of things is simply pick up and rock/ stick etc. The problem is however you only get a very vague description of said item, saying \"this resources spawns around the player\", but these items are not easily found or spotted . it took me a good couple of minutes to find a rock then another ten minutes to find a bloody stick. this makes the world look very dull as you notice that there is hardly anything else to interact with. also things you can interact with, like the stick needs to be way easier to spot.  i understand it is alpha and maybe these quality of life issues will be addressed in the near future but for me it just turned me off.\n\nSo after finaly finding that god damn stick i crafted myself a hatchet and proceeded to chop down my first tree, i instantly realised that this fundamental thing for a survival game( chopping a tree) still needs soo much more work in this title, the functionality is there but it just feels rough. \n\nMoving on, so after figuring out by myself how to build a 4x4 wooden camp, placing a camp fire, bed ,workbench, chests and a furnace and started to dabble with more of the building options i really started to get frustrated with the control scheme to exit containers or open panels.  there is plently of options and i think the developer has done a good job with the amount of things to craft. but it was very frustrating and is so un-intuitive that it left me with a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nleading onto the combat, its just plain awful, from the animations/hitboxes all of it,  half the time if it was a croc or vambie (zombie)  i couldn't even tell if the bloody things was hitting me from the animations to the sound effects. all i got was a bandage symbol pop up and without warning on multiple occasions and then i would just die.  And that leads me to the topic of press f for your stats display. i'm assuming the dev is going down the minimalist ui route for immersion sake. but for this to work you need to show the player in other ways that information, just felt like i was playing a tech build not a steam early access.\n\nok.. so after making my way to the military camps to find the tech guides and after killing many buggy ass vambies from a distance with my spear as close combat isn't a viable solution currently i was soo underwhelmed by the lack of content in the military areas, i killed maybe 3 to 4 vambies and went into loot and most of the buildings are husks of shells, and all there was, was 1 tech guide.\n\ni couldn't bring myself to carry on playing after that as obviously there was no incentive from lack of content.\n\n iv'e never gave a negative review before and this will be my first, but i give it soley on the fact that this title has a very positive review score that lead me to buy it in the first place, and in its current state i do not feel it deserves that.  i understand this is alpha and really early access and developed by one developer, but i think it needs alot more time before its enjoyable to play for me. \n\nWill this be a great game down the road ?? possibly ! but for me it is too rough around the edges and too many core issues in its current state, there has been many great games developed by only one developer (mist/subsistence) to name a few that iv'e supported throught the years from day 1. and i'm sure i will be back when this one is further down the road.  just it needs things ironed out and way more content,\n\nSo to sum up:\n\nif you want to support the developer buy it, but i can't recommend it in its current state.\n\nupdated review.  02/092021\n\nSo after waiting a full year i came back to give THE INFECTED another go, firstly i would like to point out that i did give a very negative review when this game first released and i think that fully represented the game at that time.\n\nBut to my surprise the solo developer has really drastically improved in all areas of the game and i'm truly impressed by the sheer amount of updates that he has pushed out. the game runs much better, the annoying cumbersome UI has been updated and feels more polished and so many other quality of life issues that I won't address here but lets just say earned him a seal of approval by me.\n\nI have put in an additional 23 hours since coming back and i think overall its a great base building game, it can keep you busy for at least 20 hours but i think apart from the really good building side of things the game hasn't much depth currently. not really anything to explore. no lore . 6 generic villages  the only purpose of which is to visit to seek a blueprint so you can build something new and a few almost empty caves.  That's it. the player only needs to go away from their base to collect different ores and once you have done that, there is nothing else to the game apart from build, farm, and occasionaly watch a stupid vambie on horde night run into you spikes to collect their rewards..\n\nbut alas.... i will change my NOT recommended to recommend this time as the developer clearly knows what he is doing, after taking a year off i have seen how many things have changed since i revisited,. The solo developer seems determined to push update after update and the game feels better for it. But i hope that the things that are still lacking e.g (lore/ poi's/new enemy types/combat rework/ endgame content and goal,) etc..\n\n   \n\n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1598039815, "timestamp_updated": 1630578818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682719051837921143", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75708989": {"recommendationid": "75708989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310637883", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 709, "last_played": 1599637769}, "language": "english", "review": "Keeping in mind this is Early Access, reluctantly not recommended. \nI like this type of game, but there are several detractors for me:\n- any dealings with the inventory quickly become tedious.  There is no right click to transfer, one must drag and drop; and the inventory/storage interaction windows are not conveniently adjacent to e/o, they open on oposite sides of the screen.  Not everything stacks, and for items which do stack, the stacks are too small.  I grow tired of games which demand such a need for overly frequent and tedious inventory management.\n- The Vambie screech is very abrupt and extremely loud!  The volume level is exactly the same no matter the distance.  \nAlso, one is not made aware with the sound of approaching footfall.  It's just SCREEECH!  I thought I was going to have a heart-attack the first time!  THANKFULLY, the Dev added features to disable static and roaming vambies, and/or to disable vambie horde attacks.\n- IMHO vitals and sustenance needs are too demanding, meaning maintenance is required too rapidly.  In my playthrough of just over a game week, even with vambies disabled, I was overwhelmed with an intense pace of building, placing, gathering, farming, hunting, cooking, watering, eating and drinking just to stay alive.  I died, idk, 10 times, 3-4 caused by animal attacks, the rest from various sustinance deficiencies.  \nThe last few deaths I had ceased attempts to stay alive and just continued to build/gather resources while waiting for the inevitable.  I haven't even had the chance to explore beyond the starting point yet.  I've been focussing efforts to stockpile enough sustinance to support exploring the map, but is it proving futile.  In that regard, crop yields are way to low to amass a stockpile.  Harvested foods will have to be eaten while growing more...it's a torturous cycle that gains little to nothing.\n\nThat's as far as my experience has been.  The immediate area surrounding the starting spawn point.\nOther people can do it, other people are super-gamers.  I'm a casual gamer and play for entertainment and relaxation.\nThis experience has been neither for me, rather a race paced tedious affair.

Map feels HUGE after the recent update introducing mountain like terrain that you must go around instead of over to take shortcuts.  There are still \"some\" areas you can cut across, but we are far more limited than we used to be, but the amount of travel we have to do still feels \"appropriate\".\n\nRecent updates have introduced an NPC that you can recruit into your camp to do various tasks for you.

(other than a recent bug that popped up, but I'm sure it'll be fixed soon enough).\n\nCons: No multiplayer.

But in it's current state, I can't recommend it.  \n\nI absolutely love survival games. I usually thoroughly enjoy grinding, gathering resources, and crafting the next best thing. But in this game it is just all too tedious.  The crafting is very annoying.  Looking up a recipe from the itempedia, dragging and dropping several ingredients over and over again to the crafting table to create one item, and having to repeat that over and over again for every item you want to craft, every time you want to craft it, for me, took all the fun out of it. \n\nThe nutrition system is quite convoluted with all of the different types of stats you have to micromanage to keep from starving.  I'm okay with having different types of nutrition but when you have to juggle thirst, proteins, carbs, fats, and vitamins with different foods, it becomes very annoying.  Not only do you have to worry about getting all these nutrients, but you have to worry about finding the food in the first place in order to plant them, which isn't always easy. Especially if you are already low on any of these nutrients, which will hinder your ability to effectively gather what you need.\n\nThe combat is just so basic, empty and unsatisfying.  AI reaction to hits seems nonexistent as well as when you get hit.  Enemies can also very easily hit you through walls. When this happens you have a chance of getting an infected wound.  If you don't have any medicated bandages, you will slowly be drained of health and die. I wandered around endlessly after I died to find an ingredient so I could craft medicated bandages. I turned all the foliage down so I could spot them easier.  I never found any. I don't know if none spawned or if I was missing something.\n\nI  found myself searching for blueprints in a nearby village because i was at a point in the game that i needed to find more blueprints to craft anything that would progress me in the game.  Since I couldn't craft armor because I didn't have the tech blueprints found that i needed, it became an endless cycle of my running through the buildings, frantically searching, finding nothing i needed, getting hit once by a zombie through a wall, getting an infected wound, slowly dying, and having to run all the way back from my base, only to repeat the same thing.  \n\nI understand that the beginning stages of a survival game are supposed to be brutal.  But I don't think that the execution is done well in this game.  Being stuck in an endless gameplay loop is not enjoyable. And that's what I found myself trapped in.

Alot of other reviews have already stated the desire for multiplayer while the developer says they have no plans for making it multiplayer. I still got it on sale after watching it on The Outer Middle Show, Fooster, and GameEdged. So the core of the game is fun. There are some annoying aspects like having to use different workbenches to make different things instead of say the regular Workbench allowing you to make everything you can on the Personal Crafting Table (the pink slate stone) and then the Advanced Workbench allowing you can to make everything you can on the regular Workbench AND your lesser Personal Crafting Table. However, after wanting some multiplayer and getting another established crafting game (the Forest), DigX has that game beat IMO on everything but ability to have multiplayer. Seriously  after playing this game the Forest is a headache.\n\nSo... basically it's a GOOD single player EXPERIENCE, not good single player game. Unless you just want to build forever in god mode and spend hours and hours alone or play with stagnant Vambies (the enemies), it just... it gets old. There is lore on the website, but not in-game, no difference in enemies beside one walks and one crawls, no ending. I built everything from scratch, got all the blueprints, have everything to survive with almost no chance of dying... for... forever. What do I do now? Yea, it's in Early Access and I admit I was waiting for over a year for the full release due to being burned on Early Access before, but after this version 12.0 released and had a good sale, I caved. So I've got over 63 hours in it and don't plan to continue unless some really groundbreaking update or multiplayer is released. It has SO much potential and people are all saying \"Multiplayer!\" \"Multiplayer!\" \"Multiplayer!\" and I agree, BUT have to admit, the developer said from the start that their intention was \"single player only\". I enjoyed it for the most part but kept thinking of my friends I'd love to share it with, and during the sale would've bought probably 4 to 6 copies if that was the case. Maybe future updates will change things, or not, or the developer may abandon like other Early Access titles. Only time will tell. \n\nTLDR: Here's the shorthand: If you want a game with some interesting mechanics like season changes, and building things from scratch, but not wanting to vomit and grind like in Green Hell but beats The Forest, check it out for some decent hours of fun, but if you wanna share with friends, get mad with some crafting quirks, or want to complete a \"campaign\" (get an ending), then pass on it.", "timestamp_created": 1653859425, "timestamp_updated": 1653859843, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.672835886478424072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92633865": {"recommendationid": "92633865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109247233", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 22869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1701076608}, "language": "english", "review": "A friend recommended this game to me.

Allow posts to be built from under roof to make more believable balconies.\n- Furniture: Wardrobe, Arrow Storage, chair, wall storage.\n- Tamable Animals? Even if it's just find a lost dog or make animal enclosures for farming. \n- Diseases curable by herbs that can be grown in your garden\n- Fishing rod for when in -C temperatures, being able to swim to fish in freezing weather feels a little unbelievable \n- More destinations on the map.

Well, overall, I think it has potential.  In my testing, I am not playing with the zombies, vombies, vampies, or any other part of that. I wanted to test the survival aspects of the game and specifically the environment and such. \n\nThere is a huge need for improvement. One of the things that tick me off with this type of game is the use of standard place holding types of assets. Another is the fact that there are a thousand plants, rocks, trees, and the like yet there are only one single type of each you require for a given task. They are only available in a certain area in a certain fashion and a certain flavor. \n\nI have reached the winter months and am going to test a restart to see if I can actually prepare myself for the winter survival months. As with many of these types of games, balance is key and that is lacking at this point in this game. I gave this a thumbs up as it is fairly priced and is a decent game to this point. I hope to see it some balance changes as well as additional effort to replace the stock Unity placeholders that are in use currently. I have seen this crafting series as well as its assets in a few games to this point. Waiting to see in that is addressed and improved. \n\nI'm not disappointed with my investment at this point and as I said it is fairly priced.
