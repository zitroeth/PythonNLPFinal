First of all, this isn't a fucking MOBA. This is a fucking survival game. Second of all. Slow progression? Developers you already did that with your RPG skill system. With your player level based loot system in which in your early player levels you will never see a modern weapon, all pipe guns and cheap weapons. Why are you making this a Fallout 4+?

The jar issue isn't the first weird \"progression rebalancing\" they did. The developers made it where meat can only be cooked if you have 5 raw meat pieces. Here's a easy solution, let us cook each piece independently, then reduce the food and health you receive from each. BAM, fucking easy. Also if it wasn't obvious, reuse and recycle of jars and cans is a really good apocalyptic survival game mechanic. And you just threw it away.

Nothing else.\nThere's no exploration, no goal, no objective, no story, no narrative. It's one of the emptiest games I've ever played. \nSome of the changes they've made in the past few years have changed certain aspects of the game in a major way, mostly negatively.

Until you get high enough level to put points into everything, certain trees are just obviously 100x better than others. Melee shouldn't even be in the skill trees at this point, the melee system is the most boring and intuitive combat of any survival game, hit walk back, hit walk back, hit walk back, repeat until thing dies.\n\nThere was no reason to change the item rating system to the new bland \"add more attachments\" system. \nThe new item rating system is boring and lacks any excitement when finding items, finding a high tier 500-600 rated item gave you the adrenaline the new system lacks.

Its post-apocalyptic setting, dynamic world, and robust crafting system have kept me hooked for countless hours.

Its blend of crafting, exploration, and survival mechanics creates an immersive experience unlike any other. The thrill of scavenging for resources by day and defending against hordes of the un-dead by night is unmatched. The freedom to build and fortify your own base adds a layer of creativity that keeps players coming back for more.\n\nHowever, there's a glaring issue that overshadows all of its virtues: its perpetual state of \"Early Access.\" It's been a decade since the game first entered this phase, and despite occasional updates, progress feels stagnant.

There are ways to break this system but you still need to loot thousands of mail boxes and random places because there are literally a thousand of these books you need to find..\n\nIf you want to be a strength character you are forced to use a shotgun, if you want to use a bow you are forced to use a knife. This insane design choice can be 'beaten' by eventually levelling up enough to put points into multiple tiers of different attributes but its a system akin to a Diablo game where you are pigeon holed down a path, thats fine for things like Mine 69er which allows you to use tools in game better, an obvious strength mechanic and makes sense, but to pigeon hole the weapons is crazy and to add the random skill book system in on top of it which means you get more books of the skills you put points into and it makes this weird rouge lite style game which would suit 60 min playthroughs, not the 60 hours you get here.\n\nThere are numerous graphical issues, probably as a result of a super old engine, black shifting is prevalent, no amount of AA or AF fixes the crazy amount of jaggies on thin straight line items like bars and edges of certain objects which makes the game look poor, which is fine if it doesn't also perform poorly.\n\nThe only thing I found was 'good' was the initial 10 hours or so of wonder as I'm creeping around trying to be stealthy to not get swarmed by zombies while I'm clutching my stone spear, but the trader mission system completely ruins this as the rewards are too good and the items you can randomly buy completely skip tier progression systems, except of course its more random in a game of random.\n\nBack to the stealth, its fake and doesn't exist as you soon find out later on, zombies spawn ontop of you out of nowhere in certain situations, like in buildings if you walk on 1 particular tile zombies that didn't exist within your vision now suddenly pop into existence rendering stealth pointless and this isn't a trap, something you can avoid, nope its just a thing that the developers did seemingly for some bizarre reason that didn't use to exist, theres even stealth items and stealth skills to invest in to make it even more insulting.\n\nEventually you progress to having a chain of ammo and block building manufacturing capability at which point you start to encounter the next design issues, screamer zombies spawn out of thin air, literally, and when they scream they make a hoard of zombies spawn out of thin air, literally and this happens multiple times a day no matter where you put your base, it doesn't matter what you do and so the only thing you can do is bury your base underground and use automated turrets ti kill the zombies when they magically know where you are because there is no sound muffling system in this game.\n\nYou could be 30 blocks below the earth, surrounded by 30 layers of solid steel blocks and survive the nuclear apocalypse yet some random zombie can still hear you flicking through your magazine, its awful.\nBuy the game if its on sale, if you have a average PC you'll find it tough to play unless used to console games, at first you'll proclaim that dude is talking nonsense I'm getting 100FPS, just wait\n\n\nThe devs need to have a long look at the direction they took this game\nInstead of performance improvements they chose to make high quality models that make performance worse\nInstead of being able to increase zombie count due to the above they had to reduce it and make zombies asleep instead of roaming around\nInstead of having that performance to then create wandering mechanics across the map they instead created systems that spawn them out of thin air and trivialise them\nInstead of having performance to play with to create more tense atmosphere and encourage gameplay in the large towns they just create more basic large set piece locations like a school that drain performance even more\nInstead of having performance so you could have a physics based water system that matches the physics based block system you instead get a worthless resource that does nothing, that plays no part in the game other than drinking it from a bottle, of which of course you can't even put water in a bottle anymore, because LOGIC\n\nIf I had the money I'd buy this game from these developers and give it to a studio that cared, they have no clue what they are doing, what they need to prioritise or how to implement it, they seemingly have no clue what the dedicated player base wants either because they all play mods like Darkness Falls which reverses some of the insane design choices.\n\nIf you're reading this, developer, how about you stick your neck out and do some proper canvassing with details polls and ask the people who actually bother to continue to play this what THEY feel would be a good direction to take, what would their priorities be and what do they want from the non existent story and set up.\n", "timestamp_created": 1707408424, "timestamp_updated": 1707578823, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score":

You can gather resources, build a home/base. Do random quests or just travel whenever whilst looting EVERY building you encounter. Thats right, from smallest shacks to ginormous skyscrapers - its all there for you to conquer.\nThe craft system is pretty good with some surprising rewards\nLike a bow literally from Crysis 3, an M60, a sentry gun that shoots with shotgun shells, a helper drone and finally - a Gyrocopter\n\nLastly, you can tweak the game however  you want: you want some fun time whilst shooting a horde of really slow zombies? - Sure (although a horde would be only on 7-th day but there's a workaround)\nYou want a challenge? - crank up their speed, the damage that they do to voxels, crank up the difficulty\nAnd many more.\n\nAs you can see - replay value is quite high - if only there were even more variations for zombies, or at least - different skins for each of them, But hey, I heard they gonna add human bandits (again!)\n\n[h1]But this is where the fun stops[/h1]\nGranted, the game was in development for a loooong time. \nAnd the visuals are REALLY dated. And while the effects and texture work looks decent....the models are NOT.\nAdd to this the performance issues (the game runs like utter sh_t) and there you have it - a reason to stay away.\n\nThere's no story line, and the only purpose that pushes you forward - are trader quests - after a while, a level of difficulty stops at 6 and repeats itself - kinda dull.

Unfortunately you need a lot of mods or an overhaul to get a game that is fun. The Main-Developers are slow, don\u00b4t ggive out any informations or roadmaps, they doesn\u00b4t listen to the Players - and the Mod Team on Steam is mostly just a bunch of unfriendly fanboys. If you make some points what could be better your'e screamed down by guys saying \"lol stop whining\" or mods liing why it isn\u00b4t allowed to give out informations.\n\nYou can\u00b4t use water from Ponds/Rivers because it\u00b4s unsafe. Yet you can swin and dive in it. But Water you find in an old toilet? Totally fine! You want to make a coffee? Na-ah! You need a reciepe first! You want to make food, even the most basic things? Reciepe! Plant corn? You need the reciepe how you get corn-seeds from a corncub. Since the last update it feels like an P2W-System but there are no Booster-Packs. The Mod-/Admin-Team on Steam just tells the community to play another game or get a mod if you don\u00b4t like the changes. Most of the last changes were optical changes but the melee still isn\u00b4t good, the melee-distance just isn\u00b4t right. In the current state i can only warn you, even if the game is cheap - get another one with active devs or where the game isn't bugged as hell. Don't even try to use the Forums, worst community i've seen on Steam so far.  \n\nThe game is really fun to play with friends or alone - but only heavily modded - so be aware. Normally that game could be a gem if it wasn\u00b4t for the non-acting Mod-Team and the slow Devs who make the game worse and worse. The Devs even take praise for the work modders do, because \"they made it easy moddable\" - but the modders are fast, friendly and listen to the playerbase and add a lot of stuff & QOL-Updates the devs aren\u00b4t capable of. Right now it's mostly go to a POI, walk over a invisible triggerline, kill the Zombiewave, hope you get the reciepes you need (mostly you don\u00b4t) and repeat. Most survival-aspects have been stripped and the Z spawn suddenly behind you, even if you already cleared the spot. So on the other hand you can axe your way trough walls and since you didn't walk over the triggerline the zombies stands in corners \"sleeping\" and you can kill them witout them even moving. Since the last update the game is really linear and you can't use your playstyle, you have to play it like the Devs want it to be played. Some things were just changed to exceed the timespan to level up - more playtime but not fun, just repetetive.\n\nIf you buy it try it, mod it, hate it, use an overhaul-mod like Subquakes Undead Legacy and then love it.

So not only is the game unfinished with promises already broken, but now comes with a roadmap that basically tells people \"Shh, we got you... in 1 year, maybe...\" while ignoring stuff that players asked for or were promised when the game first got announced... in 2013... and collected money for it.\n\nThe roadmap itself is quite a joke, along with the promised alpha features now being added way past the full release, there are cosmetic focused updates planned (in a zombie survival game, yeah.) and, the icing on the cake of disappointment and lies: DLC! Yes, DLC is planned for this game in the future. This is the ARK problem all over again, but this time the developers think they are being sneaky by rushing the game to 1.0!\n\nWell, this is all shady and crazy, but what is probably the most outrageous takeaway from the announcement videos is that the price of the game will double to $45 on PC and consoles. But consoles will be hit even harder, as the developer claims that the 1.0 update is \"too complex\" or whatever for the current console versions, so players will have to buy the game AGAIN for said 45$! So not only will the current console version of the game be stuck in the final alpha version due to \"limitations\", but console gamers will have to pay twice the original price of the game AGAIN just to be able to play the 1.0 and later versions!\n\nAnd if that's not a shady and disrespectful way to treat a loyal fanbase that kept the game alive during its 10 1/2 year alpha, I don't know what is.\n\nThe backlash is already huge, the subreddit is on fire, comments on gaming sites reporting the news of the release are being flooded with negative feedback, and the developers are not even allowing comments on the announcement video on YouTube, so they knew EXACTLY what they were doing and how the reaction would be. Just look at the discussions on Steam.

Been watching the development of this game since 2014, when I was introduced to this game by watching the Yogscast Youtube channel play it, when they still played games.\nThey dumbed down the leveling and crafting mechanics and the developers only want you to play by their rules. No play styles made by the community, the devs always find a way to patch it out. The loot system is now level based and the crafting system is now also level based. Everything is now level based, except for the day 7 waves, which you better not be unprepared for so you better grind those levels.\nDon't be fooled by the 1.0 release, it's just a way to raise the price and resell the new console release when that comes out at a discount to the Xbox One players because they will not update or sell that version anymore, this a very scummy move to Xbox One owners that thought they owned the game, even if they had the physical release. The hardware and storage requirements has also skyrocketed so don't run this game on a medium end PC and expect 60 fps, even though it looks like it will run fine. \nThe only things the devs done right was multiplayer from the very start and Linux and Mac OS support, which is something you don't see very often. It's just not worth the money if you want a game made for the community. There still isn't a game 100% like this one so it's a shame removed all the things that all the OG players found fun.

There is quests that keeps you occupied if there is very hard quests you will take greater rewards ;) .\r\n7.

I wouldn't have sunk 650 hours if i didnt. But. Development is slow and takes too long.

The jar removal update made it so you can only (reliably) get water from collectors that are slow and only store 3 at a time. The vehicles are slow and use up gas really quickly causing me to just change the values in the code for my playthroughs.

I get it, you don't want players to exploit but making everything grindy is not the solution to that.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fun though, you go to POIs and do a little \"dungeon\" and get your loot at the end. Every 7 (modifiable) days you get a massive horde you have to fight off. The combat is entertaining especially with a club build. You can get quests from the traders for even other stuff to do but after a while it all just gets a little repetitive. They have good ideas they need to capitalize on. Maybe some more variations with quests? Definitely more zombie variation maybe through biomes? Even more POIs? Sure mods can fix all of this but why do we always have to rely on mods for that.\n\nI know I know early access blah blah blah but fuck sake i played this game on PS4 like 6 years ago at this point and it was earlier access back then.

Developed by The Fun Pimps, this game offers a unique blend of crafting, exploration, and intense combat that keeps players on their toes from dawn to dusk.\n\nAt its core, 7 Days to Die revolves around the titular concept: every seven days, hordes of zombies besiege the player's base, ramping up the tension and forcing strategic planning to fortify defenses and gather resources. This dynamic cycle creates a sense of urgency and excitement, as players must balance their time between scavenging for supplies, building shelters, and fending off the undead.\n\nOne of the game's strongest aspects is its robust crafting system, which allows players to create a wide range of tools, weapons, and structures using resources found in the environment. From simple axes and bows to complex fortifications and traps, the possibilities are nearly endless, fostering creativity and experimentation.\n\nExploration is another key element of 7 Days to Die, with a vast open world filled with diverse biomes to discover. From desolate wastelands to eerie forests, each area offers its own set of challenges and rewards, encouraging players to venture out and uncover hidden treasures while avoiding the dangers that lurk around every corner.\n\nCombat in 7 Days to Die is visceral and intense, requiring players to carefully manage their stamina and resources while facing off against swarms of zombies with varying strengths and abilities. Whether engaging in melee combat with a horde of undead or picking off enemies from a distance with ranged weapons, the adrenaline-pumping action keeps players engaged and on their toes.\n\nHowever, despite its many strengths, 7 Days to Die is not without its flaws. The game's graphics and animations can feel dated at times, and occasional bugs and technical issues can detract from the overall experience.

I just want to make it crystal clear that this game is not something that was a passing interest for me, I've been following development since it started, all the way back when I was a teenager. I can remember being so excited when the game came out with new things, but now the feature creep is just too much. (Its been roughly 14 years now, still in alpha.)\r\n\r\n With the latest alpha update they changed a significant amount of the core systems, its nearly impossible to live off the land anymore, and something as simple as water is ridiculously convoluted to acquire. You can no longer bottle water from the environment and boil it to get a sustainable source of water, all water must now be looted except for water gained from water purifiers, which are something that can only be rarely looted or bought for an insane price at the traders. The crafting system has changed completely,(once again) You can't gain levels in crafting in any way that i could find except for looting books and painstakingly leveling a small portion of the crafting skill. Those are just a few of the changes that make the early game an absolute slog to get through, and remove any of the fun and magic that used to be present.\r\n\r\nI have never seen a development team fail so hard, and its really sad to see.

Good thing they give you 34 tips to cycle through while waiting forever. Secondly, its been in Early Access for how long and I don't have a setting to turn off infections or change a variety of other settings? I should be able to change damn near everything about the game at this rate but instead a bunch of time and resources went into the stupid world editor. Wow... Someone probably got fired for that, considering how long its taking to push this into completion, and if not they should've for developing a game out of order. You could've waited til later, ironed it out completely so it's worth a damn, and sold it as DLC... \r\n\r\nIt wants to be good but even on the cheesiest (non creative) settings the distance between worthwhile loot is ANNOYING. You'll be sitting there drinking and eating wondering why your meters aren't going up and there's NO WAY TO CHANGE IT.  God forbid 1 piece of meat makes 1 piece of charred meat! God forbid the JAR of murky water you gotta purify makes more than a FRIGGIN SIP OF CLEAN WATER! CUZ THAT CRAP WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE RIGHT?! And again...11+ years in \"early access\" and this is the standard. Oh and just a pissy sidenote that broke the camel's back on this negative review: I went to alter my controls and the game derped out and stopped registering my keyboard inputs, causing me to have to close out and inevitably sit BACK THROUGH THESE LONG ASS LOAD SCREENS. I can dig mines unlike any other zombie themed open world survival craft (besides minecraft and its many ripoffs) and I still hate it. WTF, HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?!?... \r\n\r\nLook...Go look at what Project Zomboid has done with their features, settings, and configurations. THAT'S HOW ITS DONE.\r\n\r\nOh and every single time I'm restarting a new game I have to go through this stupid tutorial quest. GO AWAY. If it's something I can change in the settings I didn't get to it yet because again, I had to close out of the game for derping out like a game that hasn't been being worked on for a decade, and that leads us to where we are now, reluctant to spend any more hours staring at load screens and damn near non-replenish-able hunger/thirst meters to see if it ever becomes worth it. \r\n\r\nOne more thing... Trader Outposts are occupied by 1 person. I got all excited the first time playing getting ready to go to a safezone only to find out it's a ghost town with a singular generic vendor NPC stuck behind a counter, overcharging for food that if eaten in the evening; would diminish by the time you get forced out to fight the zombies that inevitably and always spawn just in view enough for you to be like, \"wow...that was obvious and stupid, and I hate this game\"\r\n\r\n7 Days to Die...\r\n7 Hours of wanting to but not being able to like a game.", "timestamp_created": 1712481133, "timestamp_updated": 1712481133, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506788134574890137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159630925": {"recommendationid": "159630925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211949115", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 80092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80043, "last_played": 1710220624}, "language": "english", "review": "Everytime players find a strategy that works the devs comes out with a update to fix an \"exploit\", I say exploit with quotation marks because they treat it as such. thirst is a major problem, you can cook meat from animals you hunt to get by with food without skills but that'll compound the thirst problem further by making you even more thirsty. clean drinking water (for an example, water jars) is way more rare than they used to be. as of this review, you need a dew collector to get water over time and needs to be repaired, it needs a water filter to even make the stupid thing.

I'll start by saying I have been playing since the earliest release version. I have participated in game-play on various platforms. Ultimately the game always appeared to have great potential. The hours I've invested are not hours I would consider poorly spent. However, FunPimps has continued to create changes in there game that are never received well by the community. They have continued to create an environment of communication that is always hostile between themselves and the rest of there community, fostering a very {well its our game so get over attitude}. As well they continue to enter into what I feel are shady business practices, ex. Reselling the game after announcing major updates which only applied for PC but marketing it at the console players who have been clinging to desperation for an update, which seemed a bit of a cash grab and a scam all rolled into one. Listing the game here on steam as Cross-platform, which is only partially true in so much as console gamer's are cross-platform. PC is so far ahead in its current version it may never be cross-platform with consoles and this is still being used to push the console players time and time again into having hope that one day they will also be updated. So not only is it misleading to sell a copy to a PC suggesting its cross-platform, its also misleading to the console players suggesting they are even working on a new console version. Of course for a complete list of shady business practices that this company has entered into or for a full history of the game and its early demise on Console please turn your eye's to YouTube or any other internet media platform and do a simple search. It has been and likely will always be a poorly put together short coming of a game, that at times is extremely buggy, has been mismanaged, contains systems that do not work as intended or simply are fun mechanically speaking, graphically unappealing (very much this for console), has no dedicated servers to encourage a fun fair multiplayer experience (Of course there are servers that are privately owned and operated. All of which seem to be pay to win or cash grab. Most of which appear to be operated by Chinese owners and have servers abroad. Which appear at the top of the list when seeking servers to play on regardless of search parameters. This is like a whole shady thing to look it up its wild.) The whole game and the attitude of the Devs just seems to be reaching for some unrealistic, unachievable final goal. If I did not know any better I would say the devs are at this point delusional as to what they actually possess the ability to do. As we have seen in the past with many games that delusion of grandeur will oft times drive teams to make poor decisions and poor implementations. For a person who may never have played this before it may all seem fine at first and as stated it will likely feel like it has great potential, for any one who has been here since the beginning its easy to see its not the case. For a returning player who has been away for a good amount of time it will feel fresh and different, until you realize its not. This game is simply going no where and the only people left to blame are the devs. If any one thing would have changed all this it would have been a demand of the whole player base to take the game out of alpha (look up how long this has been going on BTW *crazy*) or no longer receive our support. Instead we lazily hung about and helped to create this dreary excuse for a zombie survival that once could have been the dream everyone wanted to realize. in conclusion you could have had a better zombie experience playing Minecraft at this point.

I've not seen such fanaticism outside of Reddit and was genuinely surprised when attempting to share suggestions, potential changes, etc in the Steam discussion section as well as the official website. Give it a go as an observer and browse the general discussions section for a few days and see for yourself.

Some new and some old/legacy ones (10+ years later). Though with its faults, the game can still be enjoyed to an extent (with mods). With the devs losing sight of their original vision and the slew of nonsensical updates, etc etc et al, i'd honestly give it a 5.5/10. But as I said, this game is still fun and can be enjoyed thoroughly (when overlooking some of the more annoying bugs).\n\nAmusing:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/19d5cg7/i_dont_think_this_should_be_allowed_to_be_in/", "timestamp_created": 1546219819, "timestamp_updated": 1708756667, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2059, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.967802166938781738", "comment_count": 52, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148869879": {"recommendationid": "148869879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154742170", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 6888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6887, "last_played": 1699032999}, "language": "english", "review": "It has been 10 years since I played this as a kid, and now I'm a married man, and this game is still on alpha early access.", "timestamp_created": 1698262888, "timestamp_updated": 1698262888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1015, "votes_funny": 695, "weighted_vote_score": "0.962303221225738525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9866302": {"recommendationid": "9866302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061581135", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 29900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8659, "last_played": 1687592930}, "language": "english", "review": "( Updates at bottom. )\n\nA friend got this game for me, I looked at the title, looked at the screenshots and groaned. \"Not another 'zombicide game' trying to say it's a 'survival game'.\" But he got it for me, and it woud be rude to not atleast give it another shot. I'm rather glad I did.\n\nI started play in a -private game- with my friend, set to the medium difficulty. Day one was a mess, I figured I was playing another left4dead 'survival' game which was all about killing as many zombies as one humanly can before wandering to the next area. Well, after breaking a few weapons on zombies and getting no reward outside of what lint was in the zombie's pockets, I knew I was wrong, and night had begun to set in. My friend luckily -had- played before and warned me that things got a lot different at night, so we managed to make it through with no deaths, but many close calls.\n\n50 days in, I'm more than hooked. Survival is the key- Food, water, scavving, repairs and building at day. Shelter, security and stealth at night. Crafting damn near anything in a Alpha game, from multiple layers of cobblestone walls outside of what used to be a log cabin. Each peice taken the long crafting process of finding rocks, chopping them down into stone and then turning into cobblestone. More? We built a second story for storing items. More? Two layers of spiked pits surrounding our 'cabin' with only a bitch for us living people to cross. More? Another story, turned into a rooftop farm of corn, blueberries and potatos. \n\nNights can get rough at the \"Spillway Estate\" as we have now dubbed our fortress, we try to keep quiet throughout the nights, limiting player activity to things that dont make sound, or carry foods on our person that generate smell. ( Yes, that's a thing!) A chest near the front door full of easy repaired and built weapons. Pistols, a shotgun and some ammo for it, fresh from the forge! when things get really bad- The newly crafted fallback point, a basement/bunker. Metal walls , floor, and roof, only one entry which is blocked in times of emergencies. Beds, emergency food and water (or tea!) supplies stored next to some of our most powerful weapons. ( Chainsaws, landmines, a rocket launcher, and a whole lot of shotgun ammo! )\n\nTo sum it all up, it has a few minor bugs, but it's in alpha, and they generally get fixed up rather swiftly! Worth the money, great with friends- Especially when you notch up the difficulty and find yourself hiding for your life in a closet with nothing but a stick to protect yourself!\n\nLots of potentiel, and fun as is.\n\n9/10\n\n\n(Aug 19, 2014 Update: 1)\nBeen awhile since I posted this, but it has been brought to my attention that a good amount of people have read this. So I thought I owe it an update due to the many, many changes to the game:\n\nCrafting: Crafting is mostly the same beast as it was when I started, though so, so much more crisp now than it was before. A lot of the bugs have been worked out (Some still linger). You now can upgrate tiles after you lay them into more fortified version of their previous selves. (A wooden frame - Wooden block. - Reinforced wooden block - Metal reinforced wooden block.) As well as many other types of similar things, it's rather neat I think.\n\nRandom world generation?! I admit the same ol' world was getting a bit old and such. So when I heard they had a random world with some neat UI upgrades I was excited.

At this moment, I'm 529 hours in, so I felt the time to review it was approaching fast, so here I am.\n\nWhere do I begin? Well, I had been scrolling around on YouTube, looking for games to watch people play, when I accidentaly stubled upon this gem. I only saw Alpha 1 gameplay at the time, which barely resembles what this game is now. Despite how it looked, I had been looking for a survival base building game for a long time, so I bought it one weekend, and it absorbed my soul and then some.\n\nWhenever you first start, you have little to nothing on you. You have a bottle of water, a bandage, and some food to start with. You can loot your surroundings to get some basic materials to start making a stone axe to start getting wood to make a simple shack. If you don't want to build a base in the beginning, you can claim one of the many buildings and fortify it so it works as a home until you decide what you want.\n\nThis task won't be easy, with zombies added into the mix. Depending on your difficulty, the zombies might be a niusance or an absolute nightmare to deal with. Every 7 days, a Zombie horde will come to attack you and destroy the precious progress you've made on your base, hence the name 7 Days to Die. In those 7 days, you will build your base, and get traps and weapons ready to survive the night and emerge victorious from your base when the morning comes.\n\nAs the game goes on, it senses how well you're doing. If you're sweeping through the zombie hordes and haven't died in a while, It will send stronger zombies in more numbers to try to give the hardcorre people a challenge.\n\nThere is a whole lot I could add into here, but for the sake of people who get bored of reading reviews all day, let me get to my pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Lots of replayability. You can play a whole lot of this game and get the best stuff, and start all over again on another world with different settings to give your veteran self a bigger challenge, to keep the game fresh. EDIT: Even though the updates come rarely, there is SO MUCH added each update it's sometimes like you're playing an entirely different game.\n\n-Smart building. You can't just build a castle in the sky here! There is structual intergity in this game, so if you build a structure incorrectly or a zombie takes out an important support beam, the building could fall apart around you, along with your supplies being cast into the void.\n\n-Friendly Community. This community isn't like DayZ or some of the other communities that have murderous players lurking everywhere, there is a huge variety of servers, some being PvE(Player verses Enemy), others being PvP(Player verses Player), other servers being modded to give the game even more life.\n\nCons:\n\n-Updates. The game does have updates, but they happen at least 3 or 4 times a year, so you will be playing the same thing for at least a couple of months before anything new is added, which is annoying at times.\n\n-Learning Curve. There are games like Space Engineer that have a very steep learning curve that makes casual players not want to pick these games up. 7 Days to Die can have this problem with new players at first, with so much to do and a horde on Day 7 being a problem that might overwhelm some players. I would reccomend watching some people play this first before jumping in, mainly so you have a vague idea on what you are doing. After that initial curve, the game definitely gets easier.\n\n-Graphics. If you are a big graphics gamer, then this game might be a bit dissapointing for you. The models, especially for the players, aren't too pretty to look at. The zombies are a bit better, but like I said, the graphics are a bit dissapointing to look at. The landscape is kind of blocky, but It is a minecraft-like game, so it is to be expected.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite games of all time. It does have it's flaws, like not super good graphics, a bit of a learning curve, few updates, and the occasional bug, but what it has far outclasses its cons, like solid gameplay, lots of repalyability, and having building physics that make you build smart and realistic.

At the time of this review, the game was in a much earlier state. it seems that 7DTD is still in \"early access\", which should tell you everything you need to know. To be honest, I have no idea how this game is now. don't trust this review. I guess just enjoy my 17 year old self's story telling and catch a snippet of one of my exaggerated core gaming memories.\n\nThree friends and I spawn in the wasteland biome.\nThought we could make a shelter out of this apartment complex.\nWas going well at first.\nGathered many supplies.\nFortified the door.\nWas supposed to be temporary, started turning into something permanent.\nEverything was going well.\n\nthey broke down the door...\n\nEverything went to hell.\nThey started pouring through the stairwell.\nDogs everywhere.\nThe only way out was down.\nStarted running down and dodging walkers.\nWe got separated in half.\nTwo of my friends made it out.\nMy other friend and I were still stuck inside.\nFigured we'd spend the last night, hiding.\nThe moaning of walkers never stopped.\n\nMorning came..\n\nIt was time.\nWe had to go.\nMy friend and I continued to drill down passed the horde.\nGot desperate.\nI jumped out the second floor.\nBroke my legs.\nThey were everywhere.\nManaged to limp through the horde.\nMet up with my other three friends\n\nDon't look back..\n\nWe crossed the river into a forest.\nStarted off with a small shack.\nTurned it into a four house village.\nWe had a wall, a trench around it.\nWe had something.\n\nWe never did forget about what happened that day in the wasteland.\n\n\nThat right there, is just a small story (that wasn't even in full detail) of what 7 Days to Die is like. Very few may say that \"Oh, it's just another zombie survival game\" or \"Oh, it's just a DayZ knockoff\". Well, I'm here to tell you that this is not the case at all. I own H1Z1, DayZ, and 7dtd. I have to say that this is the best one. Why?\n\n1. The developers are actually going in the right path.\n\n2. Loot system is pretty awesome.\n\n3. Crafting system is also pretty awesome, may take a bit to get used to. But, still awesome.\n\n4. Instead of just piling blocks and making a box-house, there are actually physics to the building system. Like, in some cases, you actually have to put support. Otherwise that sniper tower or that neat house will collapse on you. Which has happened to my friends. It's kind of satisfying to watch, but damn you're mad if it's your structure.\n\n5. The different variety in enemies is cool! Right now, you have: bees, dogs, and zombies; and other different kind of zombies to add to that.\n\n6. Speaking of zombies. This game's zombies have something that DayZ doesn't have. You know... They actually pose a threat and can move in numbers. There are moments when you see that police station surrounded by a horde of zombies and you think to yourself \"No, I'm good\", because they actually threaten you. The fact that they sprint at night by default (settings can be changed) also adds a thrill to the game. To a point in which you don't even want to leave your shelter at night because you can hear a spider zombie calling a nearby horde. Hordes also happen randomly at anytime and anywhere. This is also unheard of in DayZ. You never see a horde in that game. Also, as the days go on, the zombies start to get a little tougher. You start to feel that the apocalypse is worsening. Zombies are also smart.\n\n7. There's nothing more satisfying than fortifying your base to prepare for the undead. This game does a very good job at that. You can do almost whatever your mind imagines.. Wanna put a trench that surrounds your base and put spikes at the bottom of it? Do it. Want to salvage land mines from an overrun military base and use them as your own? Do it. Want to build a huge wall around your base? Do it. However, don't think that just putting a wall around your base will help. Zombies will rip through it and actually dig under the wall. We've seen this done in our server before, and it's frustrating, but it's so awesome having to constantly keep maintanence on your base and look for new ways to prevent them and to see your weak spots.\n\n\nThese are just some of my points, and you wanna know the awesome thing? This right here, is just an alpha.. A fucking.. Alpha, and the developers have already come this far. As I type this, the alpha11 update is imminent and should be released any day now. This is said to be the biggest update this game has seen. This game is going nowhere but up.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't tell you about the PvP, because my friends and I just normally play on a private PvE server and survive together.

I have picked the game up again on occasion, but didn't find myself as content to continue playing as I used to be. There have been many changes over the past couple of years; mostly in terms of your character having a skill and perk system, which is a nice addition and adds a lot of RPG-feel elements. However, the game suffers from something I feel a lot of survival games lack; 'end game' replayability.\n\nBeing a new player in this game is fantastic, as written in my original review below (long before I had so many hours played), but the fundamental problem is that once you are established, once you have access to creating your own munitions and have the hardware to farm resources effortlessly, the game becomes quite stale. I'm sure the addition of more NPC's etc. in the future will amend this, having a reason to leave your stronghold and go out into the world, but I feel as though the developers are perhaps setting their sights a little [i]too[/i] high.\n\nA recent cross-platform release (consoles, *sigh*) was met with a huge backlash of negativity, mostly because the game needs so much work - not in terms of content, the game has an endless amount of items and block types and there is still the potential for a massively popular RPG/Survival experience in this game. The problem is that some of the core engine mechanics really, really need work. Movement feels sketchy, aiming weapons and firing them feels far from smooth and the game doesn't exactly run smoothly at high settings even with beefy hardware. This was forgivable 2 years ago, but for it to still be playing this way is dissapointing.\n\nI still hold out hope for this game, and I'm sure I will return to it, but I would love to see the developers iron out the creases in the core game mechanics instead of having such an enormous amount of focus on adding new things. Finding poop in toilets and having the ability to throw that poop is hilarious, turning that poop into compost to grow crops more efficiently shows great ingenuity, but I only wish they would iron out the creases before adding to the already vast amount of items/blocks/locations etc.\n\nI have no doubts about keeping my review positive - this is a fantastic game. I would still recommend this game to new players without hesitation, it is a great experience, especially with friends, but for it to become a true blockbuster, I feel the developers need to take a step back and improve on what is [i]already there[/i].\n\n[b]Original Review From October 2014[/b]\n\nMy first time playing this game was one of the most enjoyable noobie experiences I've ever had, digging a hole in the side of a hill before nightfall and hiding inside, starving and hoping nothing would find me, seeing sunrise has never been such a relief. After some exploration and scavenging for food and water, I found a town, thinking this would be a good place to lay my bed and fortify a building to try and hold off anything that came for me at night.\n\nWhat a mistake that was, a horde came for me and trashed my defenses, the few crossbow bolts I had managed to craft were consumed in no time, and I found myself in a backroom hacking through the roof trying to find an escape route, my friend below me yelling at me to hurry up as he desperately tried to repair the door that was being pounded on by zombies. \"I see daylight, I've found a way out!\" Our glimmer of hope ruined when I looked down to see my friend, looking up at me, with the floor beneath him almost completely destroyed and a horde of zombies under him, barely a block left to stand on. I told him not to look down, but naturally he did, what ensued was a genuinely fearful collaboration of curse words, desperation wouldn't be a fitting enough word to describe it.\n\nGenuine adrenaline rushes and forever fearing for your life, this game has brung about a whole new meaning to the survival genre, being in a fortified position and crafting yourself a lot of ammunition simply won't cut it, you can play rambo for a short time but your resources will eventually diminish if you use them too recklessly and you will find yourself back to being starving and hiding away once again, you really need to think about how and when you're going to engage the zombies by choice, because when a feral horde comes for you, you won't have a choice, and you better be ready for when that happens.\n\nNot only is this game a great thrill-ride and at times a genuine tester for your grey-matter, it is also a brilliant game to play with your friends and rewards co-operative gameplay. Sustaining yourself, by yourself, is indeed possible, but with friends you can assign eachother certain tasks, for example me and a buddy built a fortified bunker with a deep mineshaft underneath, he spent most of his days underground mining, creating ammunition and such, providing me with raw materials, while I worked on our surface defences and food supplies. Do-able alone but so much more efficient if planned with a friend, or a few friends is even better, unless you are the hardcore lone-wolf type.\n\nI have yet to play on a \"no rules/ PVP\" server, I can imagine that adds whole new elements of fear-factor into the game, knowing that other survivors may just snipe you from a distance and steal your stuff, at their own discretion, or maybe they will help you, it's up to them, I may build the courage to try this someday, at the moment I'm happy enough just trying to survive waves of zombie hordes on a PVE server.\n\nOverall this game is already almost a finished product in terms of crafting and survival aspects, there is the occasional annoying glitch/bug here and there as to be expected in a game at Alpha stage but I have found nothing game-breaking as of yet. To think that there is so much more to be added in terms of character customisation, experience points, more weaponry etc. is a very exciting thought indeed. I can see this game making a huge impact on release, it is genuinely brilliant fun.\n\nHighly recommended, especially playing with friends!", "timestamp_created": 1414255159, "timestamp_updated": 1604780221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 268, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932724952697753906", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82278381": {"recommendationid": "82278381", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997753516", "num_games_owned": 657, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 7756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4882, "last_played": 1669782302}, "language": "english", "review": "7 Years. \nIt is officially 7 years to the day that this game has been out on Steam. \n\n7 years and it's still in Early Access.

During my visit I encountered several zombies and a zombified guard dog... all at the same time. I managed to survive but with severe lacerations, a broken arm and leg, and an infection.\n\n- I had the supplies on me to splint the broken limbs and bandage my laceration, but they still took some time to heal and the infection wasn't going anywhere. I retreated to the trader but she had no antibiotics for sale which meant I was on my own for the infeciton.\n\n- I attempted to move onwards instead, coming across an abandoned hospital. Reasoning that I could likely find medical supplies yet to be plundered or spoiled inside I girded myself and broke in, fighting my way through several floors worth of the undead.\n\n- Midway through, during a quick outdoor run through a small open air garden to get around a barricaded part of the hospital I discovered birds could be zombified as well and was promptly attacked by a flock of the rotten budgies. I was able to fight them off, but this upgraded my infection to serious and gave me a fresh laceration. Thankfully I had located bandages.\n\n- Several floors went by and no antibiotics. The infection was progressing rapidly at this point and the undead were showing no signs of thinning. After several hordes and an encounter with some strange zombie that ran on all fours but thankfully was shit at dodging makeshift arrows I was able to make it to the rooftops of the hospital.\n\n- Upon travelling upwards I found a huge cache of ammunition. However, I had no gun. I left it lay and continued onwards to the rooftop. Peering carefully over the edge I saw no less than a dozen zombies led by one that seemed much larger than the others. By now my food supplies were exhausted, my water supplies were running low, and I had no means to make a campfire to replenish either. Deciding to declare \"bollocks to this\" I carefully made my way back down out of the hospital.\n\n- Upon exiting the hospital I found out that bears could become zombified as one spotted me in the parking lot. And thus was the end of my survivor's tale as I also discovered humans cannot outrun bears.\n\nAt this point I almost gave up until I noticed that it was past 4:00 AM and that I'd been playing for four hours solid so clearly the game is doing something right.\n\nVerdict: Very promising start for an early access game. 10/10, would get mauled to death by a zombified Yogi Bear again.", "timestamp_created": 1618911446, "timestamp_updated": 1618911623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 231, "votes_funny": 118, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929683446884155273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82949445": {"recommendationid": "82949445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322260173", "num_games_owned": 1201, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 814, "last_played": 1708229731}, "language": "english", "review": "the title is misleading it only took me 9 minutes to die", "timestamp_created": 1608723992, "timestamp_updated": 1608723992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 395, "votes_funny": 772, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926833987236022949", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129774357": {"recommendationid": "129774357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273259116", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 50134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47713, "last_played": 1708679831}, "language": "english", "review": "more like more than 7 years of being in early access", "timestamp_created": 1672491554, "timestamp_updated": 1672493953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 354, "votes_funny": 159, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926649272441864014", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122589963": {"recommendationid": "122589963", "author": {"steamid": "76561199206649743", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 29200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29200, "last_played": 1634172649}, "language": "english", "review": "Don\u2019t fall for it, the game goes on for more then 7 days", "timestamp_created": 1663778827, "timestamp_updated": 1663778827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 296, "votes_funny": 222, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926342487335205078", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101585879": {"recommendationid": "101585879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397753756", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1707011973}, "language": "english", "review": "First spawn, killed by pig.\n\nSecond spawn, killed by same pig. \n\nThird spawn, found blunderbuss and murdered pig.\n\n10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1635129990, "timestamp_updated": 1635129990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 461, "votes_funny": 342, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925817608833312988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124785109": {"recommendationid": "124785109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284491620", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 5166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 865, "last_played": 1670258620}, "language": "english", "review": "Maybe it is time for you guys to think about a release date for this game, 10 years of alpha is enough.", "timestamp_created": 1667323191, "timestamp_updated": 1667323191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 501, "votes_funny": 112, "weighted_vote_score": "0.92548900842666626", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140640321": {"recommendationid": "140640321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306420797", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2672, "last_played": 1683492387}, "language": "english", "review": "Day 1 - Got attacked and almost killed on my first night. Then I went Rambo. Fought my way out and ran to a house. Hid in the attic until the sun came up.\n\nDay 2 - Found a few weapons and some rudimentary armor in the house next door. And the upper half of the owner. Gotta stay mobile until I find a place to settle in and make it defensible.\n\nDay 5 - Snuck around and scavenged houses for food and potable water. No sign of...people. Am I the last one alive?\n\nDay 10 - Found an abandoned military outpost. Made a door and barricaded myself inside of the largest tent for now. Will scavenge the surrounding area during daylight only.\n\nNight of the 10th day - They're everywhere. Oh God. They walk right by my tent. I'm cowering in a corner behind a desk with a pistol and a wooden club that I wrapped in some scrap iron. Only 15 rounds of 9mm for the pistol. I hope that they don't decide to tear the tent down around me.\n\nDay 11 - Began collecting resources. I think that I'll try sleeping tonight.\n\nDay 12 - They woke me up 2 times, but never took notice of me. I'm glad that I don't snore.\n\nDay 25 - Have been fortifying my position, dug a trench to trap the undead. Only the \"Spider Zombies\" can get out. I need to contain them somehow.\n\nDay 50 - Currently I have a fortress surrounded by metal tipped log spike traps 3 deep so they can't escape. Then I just stand on my roof and snipe the spider zombies. Collect loot and smile. I think that I'll be ok.\n\nDay 79 - Been farming. Food is plentiful now. Weapons and ammo are easy to make. I built my fortress on top of a deposit of iron, lead and potassium nitrate, with coal deposits poking out of the ground all around me! What luck!\n\nDay 1?? - There's no end to them. I heard a scream the other night. Not one of them. It sounded...human. Female. Close. By the time I made it outside at first light, all I found was a pool of blood and entrails a half mile from my fortress. Next to the carnage I found a purse with some pictures of a pretty young blonde lady with a cheerleading outfit on in one picture, in another she was in an expensive looking dress cuddled up to who was probably the star quarterback at her high school. The last picture was her with what must have been her family on vacation at an expensive looking beach house. They looked so happy. Her driver's license said that her name was Cindy Batross and she was 17 years old. There was a notepad with illegible scribbles and crude drawings of people eating each other. I cried as I realized that she saw my lights and was desperately trying to make it to the safety of my home. What may have been my only hope for companionship was now in the rotting stomach of the undead.\n\nStardate 4/20 Delta V - Venison stew is good. It's lonely here. I found pictures in houses and I talk to the nice people in them. You want to be my friend, Jimmy? Ok. I promise that I won't chew on your bones.\n\nDay whatever - What was that noise? They scratch inside my skull sometimes. I saw the cheerleader. She doesn't have a stomach anymore, but she walks around with a little smile on her face and coos sometimes. Then she screams when I try to talk to her from my roof. Maybe I should let her in. Maybe she just wants to be friends.\n\nNight time now. She didn't want to be friends. Only my iron helmet kept her from chewing my face off. I cut her head off with my hunting knife. She didn't have any manners at all.\n\nHump Day - I sewed her head back on and sat her in a chair. We talked for hours while I cooked some vension stew for us. She's nice, but a little cold. I hope that she's on the pill.\n\nYear of the Rat - I caught that \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Cindy looking at one of the other guys in the photos today. She denied it, but I know there's something going on while I'm out risking my life for us. Ungrateful \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\n\nJudgement Day - Cindy had to go. I had no choice. I had told her too much about Mrs. Doubtfire and she was plotting a coup to reap the benefits of our trade agreement with the rabbits. I loved her, but now her bones are scattered in the ashes.\n\nThe Day I Die - Spent the last 30 winters here. I lost my mind a long time ago, though I regained some of my faculties after much reflection. I can no longer keep up with my home. It's only a matter of time before they break through. I never did find anyone else. No one came. The supply drops stopped long ago. I can only assume that the rest of the world succumbed to this hellish plague. The undead continue to march in all directions.\nI have stockpiled a large amount of explosive devices, guns and ammo. Tonight I will open the bridge to my door for them and when they are clamoring to peel my flesh from my bones, I'll let them in.\nThe world will see the last survivor, not dying peacefully in my sleep, but raging against the darkness in one last epic battle. But I won't let them kill me. When it's finally hopeless, I'm going out on my own terms. Let them eat what is left of this shell after my spirit departs. Those damned fools won't make me one of them. My life is over.\nI can hear them now. There must be close to a hundred. It's time to face my fate.\nHere I come, Cindy. I'm sorry for everything.\n\nNOTE: This is a dramatization of in game events and doesn't represent actual game play. Don't get me wrong, the game is amazing and I can't wait to see where they take it for the end game. BUT, this little story was entirely made up in my head based on my experiences in the game and a fateful first encounter with a cheerleader zombie that seriously freaked me out.

How to review this game. As you can see, I have a lot of time into this game. I'm so very torn on how to review this game because my opinion of it is bittersweet, to put it bluntly. \n\nFirst, the good. \n-7 Days to Die is probably the best survival/scavenging game made, to date. \n-The world is pretty enough to make you want to explore more. \n-The POI's are unique enough to want to investigate. \n-The loot is great, everything in the game has a use, and the progression is decent. \nObviously with nearly 1,900 hours invested in this game, over it's lifetime, it's a good game with lots of replay value. This game has the most value of any game I've ever owned, and honestly, that in and of itself is huge. \n\nNow, for the bad, because as of late, I've been very very disenchanted with the development, and methods for developing the game. (Mind you, some of these gripes can be adjusted with settings,) but frankly, from where the game started, all the way to where it's gone over the past couple of years, they are very much valid, and quite honestly worth addressing here. \n\n-The development of the game is what I could only describe as \"Vindictive\" and \"petty.\" What I mean by this, is that no matter what you do, no matter how much you progress, you cannot ever be considered \"Safe.\" Any time the community finds a way to make a base type, \"Safe\" the developers change the entire AI so that these methods no longer work. The issue with this is, at the end of the day, there is no point at all in progressing, as the zombies rip through just about anything that you'd build, in a matter of minutes, and the defenses are easily dispatched and insanely underwhelming. Back in the day, I used to work my butt off to get to concrete and steel, so I could make a defensible base. It gave me a reason to play and something to work towards. And because of this gripe, I can no longer play this game without getting bored after a week or so, and quitting for months. This is what killed the game for me, overall. \n\n-The leveling system. Before the game's leveling system was changed, you used to be able to skill up by preforming the tasks that you wanted to level. This was amazing, and was very much like \"real life.\" This was one of the things that drew me to the game in the first place. How do you get better at something? Practice! Now basically, you kill zombies, gain XP and spend points from level-ups. Frankly, it makes no sense, and this change was explained away in the most stupid way possible, and it made me lose a LOT of respect for the development of this game. In fact, this is when/why I stopped playing the game as much as I used to, and was the start of my distaste for it. Apparently \"leveling by doing\" isn't \"realistic,\" and in order to conform to the desires of what I call the \"Immersion Turd\" community, they've effectively done away with one of the main things that made the game unique and overall enjoyable/rewarding to play. \n\n-Map Size. I understand the need to cap the size of the map for performance reasons. Unfortunately, with the introduction of vehicles, it cuts the size of the map down, immensely. Finding borders and endless oceans as a border is a complete Buzz-kill, as the game itself isn't rewarding to a nomadic player, which this game eventually forces you to be, the longer you play. Simply put, the maps, even random-gen, is capped, and small, even at the maximum map size. \n\n-Leveling Speed. I'm not going into this very heavy, but when you need to increase the XP gain to 300% in order to pace the game at a normal speed.... There's a problem. \n\n-This is a mild gripe, and barely worth putting here, but it is something to note. TFP have seriously lofty goals with their updates. This is fine, but at the same time, it's not. Because of this, updates can take 6 months at minimum, to release. Most take nearly a year. Which is fine... I guess, as most of their major updates change the game greatly. The fact of the matter is, the development has been ongoing for far too long, it's far too slow, and frankly, this is one of the many many things that are destroying the game's long-term success.\n\n-Finally, this one speaks for itself by this point.... There is NOTHING in the way of endgame. There's no reason to even get there, and by the time you're at a point where you can hold your own, you're so beaten down and burned out from the issues listed above, that it only leaves a bad taste in your mouth. This has been the issue with this game since day one.\n\nSo. For the majority of people, I would completely recommend the game. Obviously I got my money's worth. The game is fine. I will still say that this is probably the best survival game to date. It's worth buying. But if the devs don't stop intentionally screwing over their community, and ignoring the need for endgame content, they're going to destroy one of the best games of the decade. I'm on the fence on whether I would recommend this game to a friend, I really am. But to the average player, the game is fine. For those who started playing this in the beginning? It's a shadow of what it once was, and it's painfully obvious that the potential that it had was, (putting it mildly,) squandered. It's for this reason why I cannot effectively say whether or not I'd recommend it. Try it out for yourself, it's worth that much alone. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1615915102, "timestamp_updated": 1615915102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 208, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.91979372501373291", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122364828": {"recommendationid": "122364828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022772216", "num_games_owned": 1378, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 22701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22701, "last_played": 1660684302}, "language": "english", "review": "we're long dead and probably stardust before this game reaches the beta phase", "timestamp_created": 1663405885, "timestamp_updated": 1663405885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 183, "votes_funny": 83, "weighted_vote_score": "0.918505191802978516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151496899": {"recommendationid": "151496899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146240425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 6351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6230, "last_played": 1700858730}, "language": "english", "review": "In winter, I died because of overheating.", "timestamp_created": 1700812909, "timestamp_updated": 1700812909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 286, "votes_funny": 262, "weighted_vote_score": "0.917685985565185547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123986439": {"recommendationid": "123986439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021615741", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 617609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 560082, "last_played": 1705356014}, "language": "english", "review": "With 9334 hours played, it's got to be my favorite game.  It's been updated to A20, and with each update, there have been challenges.  What have the zombies learned, and how do you get around it?  You've got to figure out a way to survive, and hopefully thrive with each new version to the game.  I've got to say, the Fun Pimps have done a great job at updating 7Days.

Pretty much any variable you want to change is changeable, provided you don't mind delving into some of the game files.  I do it.  How hard can it be? You want to change it to 1 Day blood moons, or no blood moons at all?  You can do it.  Change the magazine on that SMG to 100 rounds?  You can do that too.  That shotgun range is too short for you?  Change it from a \"drop off\" range of 10 yards to a more realistic 50 yards.  Want to find more than one can of beans in a cabinet you're looting?  Change it to 10, if you really like beans.  If you want to totally modify the game?  There are plenty of mods out there that do just that.  The only drawback is (at least for now, ) there's no Steam Workshop for these mods.  You'll have to get them elsewhere, but they're readily available.  Try the game.  If there's something you really don't like, you can fix that to suit your play style.  Get the game.  Don't be afraid to experiment.  Have fun!\n\nAlso, I've got to say that I'm a big fan of their business practices.  If you own the game, the game is yours.

And it pains me.\n\nLike many others, I think that the latest update, alpha 17, was a huge step in the wrong direction. Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don\u2019t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent. This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps. /facepalm\n\nThe skill system was utterly destroyed as well. In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great\u2026\n\nThe performance of the game\u2026 hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don\u2019t bother mentioning it to the devs, they\u2019ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you\u2019re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend \u2013 if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.", "timestamp_created": 1553418196, "timestamp_updated": 1553418236, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 898, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912516891956329346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55544668": {"recommendationid": "55544668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986421535", "num_games_owned": 666, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 39967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 448, "last_played": 1686848959}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2063[h1]Exciting mix of DayZ and Minecraft[/h1]\n\u2800\u2800\u25b8\u2800But also full of bugs and never gonne leave alpha.\n\u2800\u2800\u25b8\u2800Addictive when playing it with a couple of friends.\n\u2800\u2800\u25b8\u2800Early Access Game forever, but regularly updates.\n \nPlaying it on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/H31S3NB3RG] another account [/url]since I got banned on my favorite Server \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude4a\udb40\udc21\udb40\udc21", "timestamp_created": 1570750032, "timestamp_updated": 1638302472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 124, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.91112828254699707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "152508394": {"recommendationid": "152508394", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971724802", "num_games_owned": 1253, "num_reviews": 248, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 486, "last_played": 1703807781}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]7 Days to Die[/b] is a zombie survival game where, every 7 days, a huge horde of zombies will descend on your location and try to eat you. You are given a week to prepare to defend yourself against this horde by crafting weapons, ammo and defences for your location. But you\u2019ll also be needing to monitor illness, hunger and thirst the whole time too. That\u2019s the basic jist of it, but there\u2019s a little more to it than that.\n\nThe game has a levelling up system with so many perks to choose from and ways in which to specialise your character. It\u2019s an almost perfect levelling system that makes sure every perk you take makes a noticeable difference in your abilities, while also reminding you that you\u2019re often choosing one skill at the expense of another. You could, for example, be really good at fighting but not know how to cook anything and constantly be on the verge of starvation. You could be really good at harvesting raw materials but struggle to find high tier loot from containers in cities and towns. You could be really tough but really slow. You could be able to jump fifteen feet in the air but be really flimsy. It\u2019s the ultimate challenging but fair levelling where perk selection comes with rewards and consequences.\n\nWell, at least if you play on regular levelling. If you want to, you can set XP gain at 300% and get upwards of 2000xp for a single zombie kill, if you like playing on easy mode. I find that is too easy, but I also find the default levelling too slow, so I play on 200% XP gain, personally. Even so, there are other ways to get experience other than killing things. You can harvest materials, upgrade things you build and complete quests for local traders. Most traders are assholes. They\u2019ll tell you to leave them the hell alone, but still give you 5000 XP and sixty bullets for killing three zombies down the road. They also help level things out a little if you haven\u2019t specialised in many combat perks; being a reliable source of early game ammo, guns and explosives. However, they also sell stuff for crafting and skill magazines if you\u2019ve done things the other way around.\n\nThis game is also a little like [i]Minecraft[/i]. You can smack trees, make wooden blocks and build elaborate cube-based structures with them. Normally I find a relatively defensible structure in the wilderness \u2013 a house, mansion or junkyard \u2013 and build defences around it. You can make barbed wire, wooden spikes, dig trenches, build walls, craft shotgun turrets, machine gun turrets, spot lights and all sorts.\n\nUltimately the world is a sandbox, the levelling presents interesting choices and drives compromise, and the difficulty of the zombies and their attacks scales well with the player. You never feel like the zombies are unfairly tough or pathetically weak. Well, unless you exploit their pathfinding over rough terrain or find yourself having not made and reliable defences by the time the horde comes for you.\n\nSo, what are the downsides? Well\u2026 It\u2019s early access. Forever. This game has been early access for 7-8 years and is still in alpha, a long way from beta. There\u2019s lots of bugs. Lots of placeholder text. Weird world and terrain generation that can break the zombies entirely.\n\nThe thing that doesn\u2019t help is sometimes the developers have odd priorities. Should they put some actual text in place of those placeholders, or make a new zombie model? That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t fix bugs \u2013 they certainly do! But it does mean sometimes they would rather make zombies with jiggly boobies first.\n\nThe only other reasons not to play this are inherent to the survival/crafting genre. If you hate micromanaging arbitrary hunger and thirst bars, it\u2019s not going to be for you. Nor will it be if the tedious task of building defences isn\u2019t surmounted by the pay-off they provide when done.\n\n[b]THE GOOD[/b]\n- Lots to do\n- Fun with friends or alone\n- Sees regular updates\n- Thriving modding community\n\n[b]THE BAD[/b]\n- 10 years in Alpha is a long time\n- Major patches tend to force server wipes because they change so much stuff\n\n[h1]7/10[/h1]\nDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | [u]|GOOD[/u]| GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE\n[quote]\nIf you like this review, then please consider giving it a thumbs up.

So you may ask\u2026 why am I posting a negative review?\n\nBecause the game I love has been updated out of existence. To the dev\u2019s credit, you can still download previous builds and play those, but I have little hope for the game to ever get more polished now since it\u2019s completely changed directions.\n\nThe root issue to me seems to be the developers have suddenly shifted from improving the overall experience to trying to force players to play the way THEY want them to play. Which to me is a terrible idea for an open world survival crafting game.\n\nPrevious systems allowed you to bypass endless RNG grinding by using your skill points to unlock crafting options rather than trying to find recipes as loot. This system was excellent because it made two different play styles viable, the base builder and the explorer. \n\nYou could find a place to huddle up and grind for xp by mining and base building, then use that xp to unlock crafting recipes by spending perks. Or you could go out exploring and use your XP to increase your killing potential as you raided progressively more dangerous structures for better loot which might contain crafting recipes.\n\nAnd the two play styles complement each other beautifully. If your friend wanted to just hunt zombies but you wanted to just play mad scientist, two of you could enter a symbiotic relationship where both prospered. The adventurer going off and bringing back new wonders while the mad scientist invented new weapons and tools for the adventurer.\n\nIt would seem however that in spite of the previous system being allowing for multiple different play styles, that encouraged team play, the devs didn\u2019t like the idea of players bypassing the RNG grind.\n\nThe new system merges the two play styles resulting in a system that to me is the worst of both worlds. Now you have to grind for xp to use your skill points to buy an improved chance at finding the books that might or might not be the recipes that you want. You now have no choice. You HAVE to grind endlessly for XP to buy perks like you did when going base builder, and then you HAVE to grind random loot to find the books you actually want to unlock the recipes you need. This doubles the grind needed to accomplish anything, forces players to rely on RNG, and takes away their choice of playstyle.\n\nNow everyone needs to play the exact same game loop. Grind XP. Grind RNG Book drops. No exceptions.\n\nTo me this is objectively less fun regardless of what play style you enjoyed.

We were holding out in a barn. Difficulty was cranked up, zombie spawns on blood moons up, and this was bloodmoon three. The barn had several floors and we were expecting air attacks. We smashed trapped the ground floor, made one entrance, and waiting on the second floor. At first, it was shooting fish in a barrel. One guy had to go to the third floor and repair the roof to keep the birds out while myself and the sniper wracked up the kills. \n\nAt first, the only downside was that two of us ran out of ammo and there were several more hours to go. The birds started putting holes in the roof and we were running out of materials to patch them. Then everything started to fall apart. The roof literally collapsed as the spine was shredded by the birds and the rest of the roof couldn't support itself. We shredded a dozen birds when zombies started pouring into the second floor from a point where they had stacked up and managed to jump up. As we handled these two threats, we had less than an hour to hold out and we thought we'd dealt with the worst of it. Then the zombies collapsed another support on the building and the floor started to crack. Abruptly, one side of the barn just collapsed taking one of my friends with it. The rest of the floor started to crumble as the collapse moved across the house. I had time to run to the last edge with my other buddy and watch the one on the ground surrounded and eaten. My surviving friend said to run for the motorcycles and I reminded him that mine was out of fuel, I'd have to run to the nearest building. He wished me luck and we hit the ground running sustaining only minimal damage from the fall with nothing above us to collapse on us.\n\nHis motorcycle was close and he zoomed away as I jumped a fence and climbed on a truck. As they destroyed the fence and charged my position, I realized I was dead if I stayed and\\ I dashed into a nearby building and slammed the door behind me, shooting two zombies who were already in the building. I had time to turn to the door and watch as the bloodmoon mob ripped it open. My friend, feeling guilty, circled back on his motorcycle and drew his spear, ready to rush the mob from behind and go down with me but I had a few seconds before his arrival. I unloaded my pump action shotgun into the doorway as the door gave out and, in desperation, pulled out my baseball bat to smash the few from that wave still on their feet. I then ran through another door taking me back outside and reloaded my shotgun as the room filled behind me. At that moment, I heard the game sound signaling daytime and the end of the bloodmoon. The zombies are slow in the day and I could cleanup without any more coming. It was over. We wiped the sweat off our faces and the blood off our hands. I drew out my shovel and started excavating the collapsed barn looking for whatever we could salvage from the gear we had in there.\n\nThe whole thing was incredible and entirely organic.

Catch it on sale and you're getting a deal so good it can only be called unholy.  \n\n7 Days to Die is one of my very favorite games.  Look at the play time (1337 as of this writing, lol) and do your own math.  I have probably spent a bit over $100 all told, though, because I keep gifting the game to friends, and I still feel I got my money's worth easily.  While there's some roughness around the edges, even now (it IS still *technically* an alpha, though that is easy to forget) the amount of content this game offers is absolutely staggering.

You just never know when you might get trapped in a barn loft one night with a ravening wandering horde around that notices the campfire you made to char up that little bit of meat you got from the lone pig downstairs because you're starving, and to boil a little water because you were in danger of dehydrating.  Suddenly there's a cacophony everywhere and you clutch your pathetic sharp-rock-on-a-stick and hunker down, knowing you can't fight them, not at this point.  But you put the fire out and hold very very still, and they'll eventually go away, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThe building collapses under you.  At least the fall killed you before the zombies could.\n\nHard 10/10, recommend this even to people who don't like zombies/crafting/survival.  But most of all I recommend it to people who do like those things but have been left cold by other entries in that bloated genre.  7 Days is the one you've been looking for.", "timestamp_created": 1605695476, "timestamp_updated": 1605696108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 209, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.904682040214538574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9773137": {"recommendationid": "9773137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099824439", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1411, "last_played": 1581842098}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been playing this game since Alpha2, it is my and my son's favorite game to play together (he's 14).

The Devs are very active, and are adding things at a very reasonable rate, with consistent patches and updates.\n\nThis game just has everything you want. Zombies, and tons of them, especially at night when they turn into 28 days later crack zombies.\n\nBuilding, you can build underground, above ground, build castles, huts, shelters, expansions on already existing buildings. The things I've seen in this game amaze me. The creativity of some people is astounding. I've literally seen kilometer long tunnels leading from a base, to a nearby town. I've also seen castles surrounded with spikes, and hidden doors / passages.\n\nThe looting system is also great. Items generally spawn every 7 in-game days which is a very reasonable amount of time. The randomly generated maps are amazing, and literally endless so you have to potential to find hundreds of towns, etc. So much freedom you can even deconstruct buildings in towns, use dynamite to blow things up, chainsaws, augers.\n\nThe leveling system is very well done too, and very unique as it hasn't been done in other popular survival games. As you level up, you become more efficient at crafting - being able to create higher tier items. At first, you'll be able to create Faulty items, which are the lowest quality, as you level you'll be able to create from Faulty - Poor - Good - Fine - Great - Flawless. It takes forever to gain a high enough level to make flawless items so you can spend lots of time leveling up which adds highly to the game playability. \n\nThere's also PVE servers for people who don't want to deal with PVP. Every server I've joined, the admins are great and active. If anything happens, they're generally happy to help regardless of the situation.\n\nHighly recommend this game over every other survival game available. Don't read anymore reviews.

In the default setting during the day the dead are George A. Romero zombies, slow but relentless.   At night they become Dawn of the Dead (remake) zombies, fast hunters.  To live you must break down bits of the world for raw materials, craft, loot and club your way to fabricating a base from which you can last through the night and gain experience enough to build a facility that will last through the 7th night.  Some are dwarves digging into the ground, but I a prefer to be the kid building cement treehouses (I call them rooks) and seeing if I can keep them being collapsed.  With the new 7-day horde limit setting, which I set as the max of 64, I don't think that will be possible since I am always alone but I will soon see as the 7th night is moving in.\n\nAlpha 16; Experimental - I really like the improvements given in this release, one of the struggles I have with open world environments is the limited array of critters in the ecosystem.  An additinal flying critter, a bit more variety from the land based fauna and the different types of attack hordes are a very nice addition.  I particularly liked the platoon of Army guys that attacked on the 6th day escorted by three guys in hazmat suits.\n\nThe creators are working their way up to including bandits and real quests and this recent addition was a good sized move forward to that aim by increasing the variety of city/town footprints and the changes to the trading posts.  I always close the doors when leaving a trading post because I assume in some release in the future if I do the poor lonely guy (always a guy so far) will get overrun cause I left his unbreachable wall open.  I have  to say it does look like it will be a while before other living npc humans (besides the trader) will be added.\n\nThe new skill/point system makes it easier to get to the level of a workbench but the reduced amount of materials and the addition of bad mechanic makes the harvesting a lot slower.  I'm o.k. with that as I don't need to grind as much to get skill points, and before it was too easy to get 5000 stacks of wood and stone in A15.  The ability to actually get mechanical parts from a dead car is much much better.  Not getting enough parts for a workbench until day 20 was often a drag.\n\nBut the best part for me will always be the refinements to the procedural world generation.  The towns are starting to look more like towns found in a typical modern country and the terrain has fewer errors like ultra steep walls and hanging houses.\n\nSo yes, I like this game  much for the endless supply of zombies to beat on, the improved variety of critters and the varied terrain to exploer.

To give a bit of background, I first discovered this game back when alpha 9 was the current build. My adventure began when I logged into a singleplayer game in Navezgane with all the settings on easy. This was the first game of its kind that I had ever played, and I had no idea what to expect or how to play. This was evident, as I spent my first day sprinting through the Wasteland in which I had spawned, completely panicked because I had no idea what the game controls were and I had no idea how to get the endless trail of zombies off my back. I never did, either; I ended up dying multiple times and that was where my solo beginning of 7 Days to Die ended. \n\nThen, a few months later when alpha 9 got updated to alpha 10, I convinced my friend to buy the game when it was on sale so that he could help me learn how to play it and actually enjoy it. He caved, and so our adventure began in Navezgane once more. Of course, we spawned in the wasteland again, and it was like the horror of my solo journey all over again as we desperately tried to escape the zombies while scavenging for what little supplies we could manage to stop and gather without getting bitten by a dog or smacked by a cheerleader. By the time the 7th day had rolled around, we had finally gotten a grasp on how to play the game... or at least we thought we did at the time. I say this lightly, as we also considered killing ourselves a better alternative than the progressive zombie infection, broken legs, and the endless dysentery that we always seemed to have - probably because food was so hard to come by that we were filling ourselves with old sham sandwiches, rotten flesh, and raw eggs. We hadn't the slightest clue that we were completely destroying our chances of survival as our wellness plummeted down from 100 to 60. Then, our blissful ignorance turned to incredible terror as nighttime rolled around, and the hordes came for us. We had shacked up in the desert by the river and made twin towers out of the incredibly ineffective log cabin wood, which the sprinting, bloodthirsty masses of zombies tore through in a matter of minutes. We had little choice but to hide ourselves on our top floors, watching and waiting in horror as the dead simply demolished everything we had spent the last 7 days working for. But then, in a final moment of hope and desperation, we whipped out the chainsaws we had found and quite literally blasted our way through the masses, only to escape in the night and return in the morning to pick up the pieces and kill off the stragglers. We considered calling it quits and starting over, but ultimately decided against it and decided to dig ourselves a series of bunkers connected by tunnels across the desert. As time passed, we became wiser, and we grew stronger. It was day 35 that we had finally built ourselves and our base up enough to fight off the hordes of the 7th night. We were victorious.\n\nFrom that game on, we've stayed ever-faithful to this game. With every new alpha that's been released, we've been waiting on baited breath to launch a new game, each time slowly but surely helping us progress from the dark, early days of alpha 10 to the hardened, survivalist veterans that we are now in alpha 15. With countless play-throughs on both Navezgane and Random Gen, on servers belonging to friends, random people, and eventually even ourselves, we have learned the game, though we are far from masters. Each new alpha released is like an entirely new game, and we revel in the chance to start anew and work at the chance to better ourselves and our tactics even more.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Well, that would depend on what you're looking for, and what you're expecting to take from the game. You will pour an endless amount hours into this game, you will sometimes regret it, but most of the time you won't. You will be frustrated, you will be terrified, you will be inspired, you will be determined, you will be devastated, you will be excited. The accomplishment you will feel is immense, and it will keep bringing you back to this game even when you think it won't. So, yes, I do recommend this game, because this game is golden, and it just keeps getting better and better.\n\n10/10 will continue to be terrified by dogs but explore the wastelands and cities unarmed anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1479094333, "timestamp_updated": 1479094333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 341, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900812506675720215", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105565150": {"recommendationid": "105565150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061204379", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 55331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37615, "last_played": 1704103690}, "language": "english", "review": "before I play this game, this game was in early access, i had no girlfriend, small penIs....after 600 hours playing it, nothing changed but the game is good!", "timestamp_created": 1639131504, "timestamp_updated": 1640508775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 839, "votes_funny": 1203, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900095105171203613", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35398286": {"recommendationid": "35398286", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994268765", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 403219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399001, "last_played": 1547415196}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]A16 Review[/b]\n\nAs a die hard veteran of this game it has been 'suggested' by various friends on Steam that i write a review.\n(Write a reivew after only 6,000 hours?

Excellent Survival, Exploration, and Building!\n\n\nThis game has been in development for a long time and has lots of content. Many POIs to explore and loot.  Lots of missions and quests. And lots and lots of Zombies!  You really never stop defending your base, they are always coming for you.  And every 7 days there's Horde Night, when they come outta the walls till 4 in the morning.  \n\nHorde Night is a very cool feature that keeps you busy through the week as you repair and upgrade your home base.  Most players use a \"Horde Base\"- a sacrificial structure with long hallways to form a kill zone.  You can build from scratch, or take over an existing structure and modify it for Horde Night.  The Zombies will attack wherever you are on Horde Night and leave your main base alone.  Mostly.\n\nSteam Forums and Discord are very active, pretty much 24/7.  There is a great community to help out if you get stuck.\n\n\nThe Menu and setup options are stellar.  For non-combat types like me, the game can be dialed in with ease.  Enemies' strength and speed can be set so that there are attacks and challenges at your desired intensity.   This is cool because Creative Mode can seem cold and boring in survival games.  Even Horde Night can be turned off entirely.  These options can be changed anytime without starting over.\n\n\nThe building system is unique and awesome.  I am a builder and this is my favorite feature in 7dtd.  Most survival games have some type of base building, but in so many it seems an afterthought.  There's nothing worse than building up a large base, only to discover there is no outside corner or some specialty shape to complete the design.  Sure, there are still a few more items that could be added- I can always make a list of needed block shapes, but 7dtd has a definite commitment to builders and it shows!\n\nThere is a structural integrity requirement.  You can only cantilever out so far with your structure before it will collapse.  The system is quite forgiving and works well.\n\nSurvival mode building seems very realistic.  Pretty much everything in the world can be broken down and recycled for use or for sale to traders.  There are no autominers or any automated resource gathering.  This game is grind-a-liscious!  You do it all, or have some friends join you in Co-Op mode.  There is no jetpack or flying-  for tall structures you will need to build scaffolding and nerd-pole up using blocks.  The basic building blocks can be easily picked up when you are finished with the scaffolding and no loss of materials.  Once you upgrade the blocks to their finished state, they must be hacked away with tools and you will lose some materials.  Don't fall off your your structures- fall damage is serious, but can be mitigated with perks, armor, and character upgrades.\n\n\nPerformance wise, 7dtd is very good.  This was my only beef until recently.  The last update had optimizations that have the game running very well now.  In this game, nearly everything can be destroyed, modified, or picked up.  Everything moves and that makes for a heavy load on the computer. \n\nWith that in mind, I normally build a huge base and have lots of inventory.

Naturally, I entered it to have a look around. In here I met a man by the name of Joel. He was a bit intimidating at first with his bullet belt and heavily bearded face, but it didn't take very long before Joel and I hit it off. He let me take some of his stuff and gave me a mission that was not too far away from the safety of his outpost. Although, I wish he would have told me about the gates closing if I didn't make it back by sundown. Luckily though, I had already cleansed one of the nearby houses from the undead and that's where I had to stay the night. \n\nIt was only until the morning after that I noticed the sign he had put up outside of his outpost (TRAITOR JOEL'S FULL \"NO MONEY BACK\" GUARANTEE). I had found quite a few houses with loot that would help me progress much faster in the long run, but I couldn't help but notice their lack of food. So with the money that I got from completing my run, I bought food and beverages from a vending machine that Joel apparently restocked each and every day. They might have been a bit pricey, but at least I had a way of securing my next meal. This became the reason as to why the house that I would be building for the next couple of days would be located close to Joel. \n\nOn the morning of my 7th day when I was going to \"work\" as usual, I noticed a lack of undead. While it made the commute easier, it also made me feel a slight bit uncomfortable thinking something was up. The 7th night was creeping up and I had no idea what that would mean for me. I pushed it to the back of my mind as I entered Joel's to receive my mission. The mission this time pointed me towards the northern side of the outpost, a place I had yet to explore...\n      So I headed out, sweeping each and every trash bag on the way to where the mission took me. With an Iron sledgehammer I had found on my 3rd day, I plowed my way through smaller groups of undead to get to where I needed to be. The mission was nothing special, just your standard extermination. Or, that would have been the case if it wasn't for the fact that I accidentally stumbled upon a pack of undead dogs. My first instinct was to start running as fast as I possibly could without looking back. Stupid as I was, I had only brought the sledgehammer with me as a weapon and that wasn't going to cut it since my opponents were much faster than I was. Eventually during the chase, I reached what appeared to be a bar that I quickly broke my way into. This gave me some time to slowly take out the dogs one by one as they followed me into the building. I wasn't left completely unscathed after that hectic chase, so I basically had to use what little healing items I had brought with me to recover my health. The sledgehammer also broke during the fight with the dogs so I had to use my last repair kit.\n\nAt this point, I had completely forgotten about the time and decided to explore the building since from the outside it had looked like it was close to 3 stories high. I took what I could find, noticed that the stairs was broken and then I saw an elevator further into the bar. The elevator didn't work, but I could crawl out of the hatch on its roof to enter the elevator shaft and take the ladder up to the next floor. Unfortunately, I had to waste away on some of the durability of my hammer to force open the elevator door from inside the shaft. Something I would quickly regret as soon as I entered the 2nd floor. I had no way of knowing what awaited me since the sound of my hammer hitting the door was too loud for me to hear what was on the other side...\n\nThe door broke and I was greeted by two not so friendly grizzly bears. They both started swinging their paws at me, but I only managed to dodge one of them. I took a heavy blow to the body and fell down the shaft which resulted in me breaking my leg as soon as I landed. The two bears quickly followed me down the shaft, but couldn't reach me through the hatch that I \"smoothly\" skipped on my way down and onto the elevator floor.\n\nEven though I was very distressed by the \"experience\", I couldn't help but notice the time and that it was getting late. So not only did I get to experience what it's like to have two heart attacks and a broken leg in a single day, I would soon also get to experience my first bad weekend. \n\nUsing a splint that I had just found and then sprinting out the back door and towards where I came from, I ran and ran as fast as my broken leg would allow me to. Somehow dodging the undead in my path, I couldn't help but curse myself for choosing to enter the building that literally had a gigantic sign that mentioned it was a \"bear bar\".  Had my eyes been working properly, then I wouldn't be running for my life at a snails pace, trying to make it back to base.\n\nI had a brief idea as to where Joel's was located from where I ended up and that's where I thought that I would be the most safe on a day such as this. (Spoiler alert): I didn't make it. I had arrived at a bridge next to a lake and that's when the clock hit 10pm. I had forgotten to take a turn somewhere along the way and now the undead was surrounding me, but I didn't have enough time to build barricades or to somehow sprint past one of the hordes on either side of the bridge. A broken leg up against a rabid horde. That's when I came up with a genius idea... \"They can't swim, right? So I'll just jump into the water.\" And that's exactly what I did.\n\nI ran to the edge of the bridge and barely had enough time to climb over the ledge and jump into the water. Now, I had never tried swimming before, so I didn't know that your character is an Olympic gold medalist for \"the slowest swimmer\". It might've been because of my broken leg, but I guess I kind of figured that my character would be shitting himself as much as I was and swimming for dear life when I turned around and saw the ever so growing school of undead pouring over the ledge and swimming after me.\n\nHoping that I wouldn't die from hypothermia, I swam for the whole night and when the morning came, I had apparently gotten away from the horde that had been chasing me. So I decided to finally head on back to Joel's outpost. When I arrived and headed on in to buy some food, Joel greeted me and said \"You're a sight for sore eyes\".", "timestamp_created": 1640610389, "timestamp_updated": 1640610389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 241, "votes_funny": 113, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895550370216369629", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132821159": {"recommendationid": "132821159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186365993", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 12369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8397, "last_played": 1712208635}, "language": "english", "review": "This game taught me that the best way to cure an infection or a broken limb is to just eat glass.\n\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1676364905, "timestamp_updated": 1676364905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 165, "votes_funny": 112, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894641518592834473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83703093": {"recommendationid": "83703093", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978322065", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 72852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59830, "last_played": 1683590889}, "language": "english", "review": "7 Days to Die for me is more of a base building game than anything else (i love to build bases)\nSo my review might not be for everyone as i might look at the game abit different.\nSorry for the long wall of text.\n\n\nExploration - Scavenging\n\nIt got a good amount of different POIs (Point of Interest) to explore and scavange so your first hours of gameplay will not be boring or repetitive.\nThere are different biomes wich has its perks and hazards. I do believe (correct me if im wrong) that all the places to explore is not region locked so you can find any type of building in any type of biome. \nThere are a good amount of items to scavenge in 7Days, from nails to weapons to medicine to keep you alive. There is a progression when looting so in the beginning you wont find all the good items in a high quality. That way you dont get too overpowered too fast.\nVehicles? Yes! Different types of vehicles to either buy or craft. Im not gonna spoil what you can get tho! Getting your first vehicle is always a nice feeling and makes everything go faster.\n\n\nCrafting\n\nThere is a wide variety of items to craft. The crafting menu is decent to use but you mostly just write what you need as scrolling through all the items might take some time. There is different sections for different types of items so its easier to find what you need but most of the time you just search for what you need.\nFor heavy crafting players it might not seem that its alot of different weapons and armors you can make but it is enough and the progression to the next tier is pretty balanced out.\n\n\nBuilding\n\nSo to the part i love :)\nI love the building in this game, there is a wide variety of blocks you can use to come up with crazy base designs to fend of the hordes of zombies. You have railings to walk on so you can shoot down. You can make chutes to throw grenades down or maybe you just want a pit around your base with spikes, dart traps, electric fences or blades of death. There is alwaus something new to build.\n\n\nSolo - COOP - PVP\n\nIf you are playing solo you will have a good time in 7Days but playing it with friends is so much more fun. Go out on trips hunting down zombies and scavenging is always more fun when you can die together. I have never tried to play PVP in this game and im not sure how good that are but some people might enjoy it. There are public server for both PVE and PVP so choose on of your liking or make your own.\n\n\nSkills\n\nYou have different type of skills like strength, agility, intelligence etc where you can put points in. Those are the \"main\" skills. Under all of those main skills there are several different skills to get. You can get more damage to blocks and yielding more ressources when breaking them, more damage with spesific weapons, cooking skills, crafting skills and many more to choose your path.\n\n\nWorld types\n\nWhen making a game you can use one of their premade maps or you can make a random generated map. I do not like to play on any of the premade maps because i dont like to know where everything are when i create a new world. For people playing it the first time the premade maps are good to use. There are less wierd road paths and not wierd buildings 50 meters down the ground. For someone like me who has spent a segnificant amount of time in this game i love to explore a fresh world where i dont know anything of.\n\n\nCombat\n\nNow this one.. The combat system is not the best. (this is my opinion so please dont hate) The range of when zombies are attacking and from the visuals you see dosent always add up. Sometimes the zombies have abit longer range than what you see and they can hit you but that is only one of the few things that i dislike about this game. Fighting with both fists or grenades is all fun, there is a wide arsenal of weapons to use against the zombies wich makes the game much better than your average \"open world survival craft building game\".\nYou have alot of modifications you can put on your weapon to make it much better durable.\n\n\nSurvival \n\nThere are alot of things that can hurt you and give you \"debuffs\". All from a broken leg to puking. In the beggining and for new players the survival aspect of the game is pretty good. You have to work to get enough food, water and medicine to survive until you've been able to stock upp on ressources.\nNow the survival aspect in the end game and for players with several hundreds of hours its not that challenging. You know where to go to get what you need and its not alot of trouble but it might be abit hard in the beginning depending on the difficulty.\n\n\nTerraforming\n\nI love to be able to terraform when building bases. In some cases it help so much that my bases goes from crap to good. The terraforming might not be the best there is but its more than good enough to do what you want. There is also physics in place so stuff dosent keep being stuck in the air. (be aware when mining, you might die from the ceiling collapsing. yes ive died multiple times to this)\n\n\nQuests\n\nWell, to put it simple... Its not balanced. That is my opinion, some might like it but it just are too good to be there. You get too much money and usefull ressources too fast from the quests. Wich then makes you able to buy stuff to make the game way easier. The quests are nice and adds variety to the game but after you cracked the code it becomes abit too good.\n\n\nOptimization\n\nIt run decent on not that good systems but there are some issues. One for an instance is all the foilage. It does reduce some of your frames by the share amount of it. The water can sometimes make your game lag if its \"tampered\" with alot.\nFor me there is only one big issue about this game and its optimization. That is the lag you will get when you have on max zombies on horde nights. It will lag ALOT. I have been able to dip belove 1 fps when playing with friends on max zombies. It is a big issue for some players but to fix it you just simple turn down the amount.\nI do really hope they get some optimization patch out in the future that will help against the lag with alot of zombies but i played the game for so long that i simply dont care about the low frames.\n\n\nYet again im sorry for the long text. But overall its a great game i would recommend to anyone who wants some fun. There is some issues here and there but they are outweight by all the fun you can have in the game. 10/10 would die against vultures after 1 minute again.", "timestamp_created": 1609477166, "timestamp_updated": 1609477166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 133, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894013822078704834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142675889": {"recommendationid": "142675889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024577427", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 30074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29944, "last_played": 1691119070}, "language": "english", "review": "I love running across an 8km map to find my friends.", "timestamp_created": 1690159740, "timestamp_updated": 1690171239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 149, "votes_funny": 76, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893924593925476074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151149830": {"recommendationid": "151149830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012714562", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1700694737}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10", "timestamp_created": 1700684458, "timestamp_updated": 1700684458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 219, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893591403961181641", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156102873": {"recommendationid": "156102873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003527177", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 604891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2817, "playtime_at_review": 599991, "last_played": 1713798733}, "language": "english", "review": "It's ok, I guess.

I missed the Kickstarter, and have only started playing with the 7.9 Alpha patch. I have been watching the game on Steam since it made Early Access in December. I bought it when I caught it on sale for $20.\n\nFirst let me say what it is that I do NOT like about the game, so that any notion of fanboy-ism can be dismissed:\n\n1) Getting others into you game can be tricky. Hosting a game isn't an issue, rather, the problems arise when friends try to even FIND my game on the server. Regardless of physical distance or ping, even friends that have my game favorited cannot always find my game and connect. While in game, some friends do not receive invites to Steam Chat, but can when they exit. I don't know if the issues are related, but they happen at the same time.\n\n2) Sometimes, when the server load is high (and at random), my computer will freeze while hosting, usually just after friends join. I have to do a hard reboot, and when I load my game, any alterations to the environment and containers are saved, but my inventory is reverted to the state it was in at the end of my previous session. Moving precious tungsten from chest to my inventory and having it lost to a freeze is very annoying.\n\n3) Zombies are a little too aware at times. If I can't see what is atop my tower, how can they? As for being sensed, I don't carry food with a smell radius, and the sound radius created by various actions isn't large enough to carry through my walls AND over the trench, but zombies hear/smell me. AI pathing needs work. Nightly hordes will run through my base and stand on the corner of my wall and do nothing. A freshly spawned zombie can sense me, causing it to arbitrarily attack the hardest section (and most costly to replace), instead of running into the opening a few blocks away and into my sledgehammer.  Spawning is poor. When just loading into the game, zombies tend to spawn way too close, which means they are in my base. This isn't an issue when first starting the game (as you are in the open, unprotected), but hunting the crawler zombie that keeps clipping into my walls for the first 15 minutes of a session gets old. Zombies sometimes spawn stuck in blocks. I then have to dig them out to kill them so that they don't alert and attract other zombies.\n\n4) Lighting doesn't always have the intended effect. I can see better when I am near, but torches do not always stay lit when far from players. I can still see them, as they are rendered (my base isn't THAT large), but without the light being \"on\", zombies have no problems spawning at night right in my base. I have had issues where zombies IN the light when it IS on will still behave like they are in the dark. This means that the one or two zombies that managed to get in my base (or more likely spawned there) will still be a large threat inside, even when the sun has come up.\n\n5) Gathering materials can be a pain. Killing zombies and having them fall into grass often means you have to destroy the grass, or walk around it, to loot the zombie - same goes for picking up items near grass. Corpses de-spawn too quick. I appreciate the game cleaning itself up, but I don't like missing the opportunity to loot every corpse (part of the game IS scavenging). A horde of ten zombies often results in half the bodies de-spawning before I can kill them all. Sometimes, the body will even disappear while I have the loot screen up. When mining or digging, if you are not quick to grab all the voxels, they can be gone before you realize it. To add to that frustration, anything on the ground (not placed) have collision. This means that when you hold the key to pick up all the dirt or wood you just worked for, it has to travel to the player with each unit bumping into itself and the environment. When breaking down anything, you have to work from the top down, or risk everything crumbling under gravity from removing the support (think sand in Minecraft). Though this may mean getting materials quicker (chopping a tree down at the base), the falling blocks can destroy themselves and de-spawn, often hurting the player in the process. I don't mind getting hurt, but I shouldn't lose all my materials because of one misstep. Some blocks, crafted or found, drop nothing upon being broken. This is really frustrating for items made out of metal. A tungsten door or iron bars broken by zombies (or needing to be moved by a player) will leave not even a piece of scrap, much less the some of its whole. It is too easy to accidentally throw something out of the inventory. Placing something on the grid instead of in a slot means the item is now on the ground, and might de-spawn before you realize it.\n\n6) Crafting can be ambiguous and cause a lot of wasted effort. Example, a crossbow: you need sticks and plant fiber. With these materials in the required amount, the recipe shows up in the list in white. When clicked, the 5x5 grid will highlight the squares that you are supposed to place these materials in. But the game does not say how MANY of each item is needed, nor WHERE they go in the grid. Once you make the crossbow, the recipe then turns green in the list, and when you click on it, it automatically places the items in the grid. You can even queue up multiple to made (you don't have to leave the crafting menu open for it to finish). This does make it easier than the initial attempt, but what if you completely forget what a crossbow is made of, or are one stick short? Then the recipe will not be in the list at all. You cannot preview item stats before creation: how am I supposed to know that a rusty iron door is better than a scrap metal door?\n\nNow, let me say what it is that I LIKE so much about this game that I have convinced several friends to buy it:\n\n1) The construction is amazing. There are several materials, each with varying degrees of durability, structural integrity, and acquisition difficulty. Anything that can be placed can be rotated. Turn a ramp piece upside down for the lip of a wall (to stop those pesky spider zombies). Turn wooden planks vertical into a fence. Lay a ladder horizontally to make a walkway. The construction lends to creativity. How a block looks and where it will line up can be seen in a transparent overlay before you place it.\n\n2) The game looks good for its current development. I don't need 4K textures, but for a voxel game in Alpha, I am impressed. Some textures repeat more than others, but in most cases you would have to make a 2x2 section of blocks before the texture completely repeats.\n\n3) Zombies are a THREAT. Even in the day when they are slow, letting one get close can result in not only health loss, but infection and bleed-out. At night they have increased spawns, run, and do more damage. Zombies vary visually and have different behaviors, loot, stats, and sounds.\n\n4) There are a LOT of settings to choose from each time a game is created or continued. There is a cheat option for the lazy or new player, but it can be used to test weapons and materials, or to gain back anything lost in error or glitch. Multiplayer supports up to 16 players. The standard game is survival, but players can choose horde or deathmatch for shorter sessions.\n\n5) Heatlh, fullness, hydration, and stamina all make sense. Decreased stamina means decreased effectiveness in work and combat. Lower fullness/hydration means less stamina.\n\n6) Weapons/tools degrade and do less damage to entities and blocks. They can be repaired, or more can be crafted (ammo too) or found. Blocks can be repaired and reinforced with siding.\n\n7) Farming, hunting, and scavenging are all viable, and sustainable, gameplay options. Players can settle or be nomadic.\n\n8) The updates are regular.\n\nTL;DR This is the zombie game I have always wanted: buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1397493592, "timestamp_updated": 1397493592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 434, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892912745475769043", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50286012": {"recommendationid": "50286012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048902473", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 182371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 127, "playtime_at_review": 46889, "last_played": 1712703214}, "language": "english", "review": "Right click on game\nClick \"Properties\"\nClick the \"Betas\" tab\nOpt in to Alpha 16.4\nHave the time of your life.\n\nWhile Alpha 17 brought in some neat features, like an improved gardening system, there are just too many draw backs.

The reason you buy this game is because the foundations are still solid, so whatever they build on top or change can't really do too much.  The game is not marketed toward a broad audience, however - if it were, it wouldn't be in alpha 8? years after release.\n\nOverall good gameplay.  Where you spend your skill points matters and has a big impact on your successful play styles.  Survival concepts like staying well fed, well hydrated, and devoid of any injury or illness keep the player on their toes as they try to balance their health-in-the-moment with their longer-term gameplay goals, e.g. do I have the stamina, time, and health to clear this house and gather the resources inside to build a new base, or not?\n\nThere is great variety to the Points of Interest, the equivalent of dungeons within the game.  The difficulty in these POIs varies with the template they take on, ranging from easy Tier 1 POIs to larger and much more difficult Tier 5 POIs (a burnt-down house with one zombie compared to a sprawling factory with a hundred sprinting and armored enemies).\n\nGame difficulty can be modified in the game settings prior to loading in, so you can always change the game to be more to your liking.  Maybe that's a blood moon every night, maybe it's every week.\n\nThat's the big draw and what separates this game from Minecraft, the Forest, other survival/build games: On a given night, you will be swarmed by powerful hordes of zombies for 6 hours straight.  You will need ammo, arrows, traps, and a good base to fend them off.  That is the purpose to your expeditions into the POIs, doing quests for the Trader to earn money and buy supplies, for your continued survival really.  To fight the Blood Moon.\n\nIf you're interested in a mix between survival and what you might be able to compare to an \"orcs mus die\" style fight every few nights, this is a good pick up.  I have over 1k hours, but many of those are from the game being paused and minimized while i was at work, or falling asleep with the game on.  I like the game, but not that much.  The biggest downside is the lackadaisical development team, but again, that's not the worst thing in the world because the core concepts are good and there.  Frankly, I'm not sure why they don't just shut the door on Alpha, not like they're doing anything anyways.

It is fun. It has evolved so much and it is addicting as hell often. Every year i come back to it and test myself again not only to see how far i still can get but how much the devs did. (Yes.. a year is.. a long time to see something new in a game but.. well it has been a few years since release of the first \"Beta\"/\"Alpha\"/WTFEVER they call it now.)\n\nBut also no. No because they always (and that is the biggest gripe i have with the dev) ALWAYS! have to take away your fun.\nYou had fun thinking for hours and days to come up with a really good base and strategy to fend off even the biggest endgame waves of zombies? Well fuck you! Now we change the system so they randomly attack your base anyway!\nYou had fun making actually really smart builds with your base to evade the horde? FUCK YOU! This is not how WE want YOU to play the game. \nWhat you had a loadout that was effective for you? Can't have that! You actually found a way to be somewhat ressourceful with everything? Can't have that!\n\nNearly every \"major\" (lol) build they release they try to highlight the \"good\" things they change by barely mention all the nerfs and what not they also implement all the time.\n\nYou had a good way to fight the infection with honey? Not anymore! Take away the honey! You had a good way to get food by actually skilling into farming? Not anymore! Changed farming so you often get barely anything out of what you planted!\nAnd now? Now they take away the water.\nI am now just as fucking braindead as the zombies are by not knowing that i could use cans and other things to collect water and make it drinkable by puryfying it. \nNo no! Can't have that. Now you need to cheer if you find toiletwater and drink the piss to survive. Eventhough there is a massive river right next to your base. \n\nI should absolutely say no to the question \"if i recommend the game?\" from Steam, since slowly the \"Fun\" Pimps need to realize that they more and more piss off everyone by these changes, but i will be fair and say i still do recommend it since it is still as fun as back then once you somewhat get to manage all the nerfs they brought in with the recent \"update\".\n\nThe biggest problem i have with the recent update is the level/skill system.\nBack then you decided for yourself what build you wanted to play. Now the GAME dictates for you what you can play.\nWhat do i mean by that? Back then you got a level and were able to choose which weaponskill you want to take. You wanted to go for spears? Shotguns? Pistols? All choices you could make. You wanted to be the builder? The hunter?\nAll were important steps you had to go through.\nNow the game has this new system with books that level these skills. So you randomly find something. And from then on out the game \"decides\" for you what you will level up. \nYes you can somewhat influence it, but i barely seen it working for me. I put so many points in shotgun skills and still have mostly found pistols and spears instead of shotgun books.\n\nAnd that is.. awful. I can no longer decide what i want to play but have to hope the game drops me the right skillbooks.\n\nBut i will absolutely change it to a no if they aren't going to stop to nerf even the last few remaining good things the game has going for it.\nAnd sorry. You can defend it all you want. Even without a can or anything that could hold water, i could at least sit down next to a river and try to drink from it directly if i am desperately trying to survive. Even as bad as it is.

It can't be as bad as drinking pisswater form a toiletbowl)", "timestamp_created": 1695332036, "timestamp_updated": 1695332440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 212, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889883100986480713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118239744": {"recommendationid": "118239744", "author": {"steamid": "76561199322774248", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 623, "last_played": 1710656444}, "language": "english", "review": "there's zombie titty jiggle physics \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1656998143, "timestamp_updated": 1656998143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 322, "votes_funny": 194, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889669716358184814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15478700": {"recommendationid": "15478700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136280069", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9246, "last_played": 1474224535}, "language": "english", "review": "EDITED for A14.7\n\nEasily the best zombie survival game on steam, and probably the most promising alpha I've ever seen. I often watch youtube videos before purchasing a game, and this review has been written with past experience of all the games I've mentioned, with DayZ, Rust and H1Z1 being played on friends' accounts. It's a blast with friends, but the main reason I recommend this game is because it has some things which are almost unheard of in the zombie survival genre:\n\n1) Zombies. No, not the glitchy, ethereal zombies in DayZ, or the ones they just simply couldn't be bothered with in Rust, because Zombies in 7 days obey the laws of physics, and are everywhere, and the regular hordes (completely unheard of in almost every other survival game), as well as variation in zombies keeps combat fresh. We already have vomiting police officer zombies, \"feral\" boss zombies take horrendous punishment, undead dogs (which are extremely dangerous if not properly handled), bears (and undead versions) and mutant hornets.  The zombies in 7 days are threats, and, for a long while at least, not a manageable one. By default, they run at night, gaining speed and finesse, turning an already- formidable foe into a nightmare. I won't say much more, but it is called \"7 Days to Die\" for a reason...\n\n2) It's actually a challenge to survive. This isn't like in H1Z1 where you can live forever off of blueberries until a bear mauls you to death, or in Rust, where starvation feels practically nonexistant. The scavenging itself is rewarding, but food is low in quantity and far- spread. However, once you survive long enough to have a fortress going, you have time and opportuinty to hunt or farm, where the goals in the game radically shift from getting by on cans to actively improving your wellness, which takes me to the next point:\n\n3) Unique mechanics- Be it the wellness system (eating good food and staying healthy increases physical fitness), weapon quality, the fact that you can get infected and become desperate for a cure, building a base or even simply that zombies run at night, 7 Days has many things that similar games in the genre have merely scraped the surface of, if they've even bothered at all. It's a true game hidden amongst several cash grabs. Something I will note though- the devs are currently experimenting with temperature based survival and hordes, and both are fairly broken atm. Still, they're making progress, have no intention of giving up and listen to the community. Besides, that's what early access is for, right?\n\n4) Singleplayer- This one is probably coming off as a surprise to you right as I read it, but I think it's worth a mention. Singleplayer is a feature that most similar games lack, and that's a really crucial feature for those who want a decent survival game without the constant PvP like in DayZ or H1Z1. It's obviously not initially intended for single player, considering that there's still chat, but it still works, and works wonders.\n\n5) Base building- This isn't like in Unturned or H1Z1 where it is seemingly bolted on as an afterthought. Base building in 7 Days is important (not essential- you can still get by by moving from place to place) for survival in the new world. There are many items easily lootable that serve no practical purpose, but are instead simply decorations to further the impression that base building is a core feature of this game.\n\n6) The devs and community- The Fun Pimps listen to the community, and the community itself is very helpful and supportive. The (incredibly) steep learning curve is quickly offset by the community, who tirelessly answer all questions the noobs may have. Plus, there are NPC bandits and traders in the works, and that's awesome.\n\n7) ANYONE can mod it- The Fun Pimps have deliberately designed the XML files for the game to be easily moddable. I'd check out Valmod once you consider yourself truly hardcore- it makes the game way harder. Alternatively, you could do what I did, and mod more recipes and guns into a private game with friends to get a more walking- dead style vibe. If you get confused, again, the forum section on modding is amazing at helping you with whatever problems you might have.\n\nThe game itself has regularly been referred to as a mashup of Minecraft and DayZ, but I disagree. From the perspective of a buyer, this may look the case, but it isn't. It's a completely different animal, far greater than the sum of its parts. \n\nI will not lie to you, there are more than a few balance issues, bugs galore after every major patch and big patches take a while, but I believe that it's all worth it in the end, because there's no other survival game to my knowledge that doesn't act like that Goat Sim parody DLC, while also having hardworking devs who are willing to put more than ten minutes into the game.\n\nIf you're still skeptical, get it on sale. I mean it- 2 hours is nowhere near enough time to judge this game properly. There is just so much here that you won't find within two hours.\n\nRecommended as a 7.5/10- the learning curve is steep, and there are balance issues- and the devs are hardly experts at meeting their deadlines, but that's what Alpha was meant to be about. If you're the type of gamer who wants survival, building, a true zombies game or an amalgamation of the three, then this is the game for you, and you won't regret buying it.\n\nPS: If Dogs end up killing you a lot, ask politely on the forums for help. Us forum folk are tired of seeing \"F***ING NERF THE DOGS OP AS **** YOU GUYS ARE MORONS\" threads when they try to punch them or something else stupid. There are tactics to beat them, and a lot of them. The forum guys who are better at surviving than me could probably point you in the right direction.", "timestamp_created": 1429635701, "timestamp_updated": 1466867245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 126, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889267265796661377", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36576844": {"recommendationid": "36576844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086254356", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 296890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40441, "last_played": 1679458901}, "language": "english", "review": "To me, this game [i]feels like[/i] a mix between : \n[list]\n    [*]Sandbox construction : a (nearly) infinite world where you can destroy/build anything from bottom to top, with a great crafting system\n    [*]Post apocalyptic : zombies, scavenging, looting, explorating, finding shelter, etc\n    [*]Survival : not only zombies will kill you, animals, dysentry, lack of food, hypothermy, heat strokes, etc\n    [*]RPG : a good leveling and skills system that proposes different playstyles and gives long term goals\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Zombies?...

My only hesitation has been that i don't want to contribute to the loss of subscribers for the EXCELLENT modders in this community. I have no loyalty or confidence remaining for the game itself anymore however. Their pushing this mess out to stable just to get it out of their hair before the holidays was the final straw for me. Their lack of professionalism is something i haven't seen in any game before.\n\n I have close to a thousand hours in the game over the past couple of years and that is primarily due to those excellent modders i mentioned. The game had tremendous possibility but was not fleshed out. That's understandable. It's an early release (or at least that was the excuse i gave myself for it) but it's been in early release for years and it has seemed more and more as though the developers are depending heavily on the modders to make it into a decent game.\n\nThen i decided to sign up on the official forums so i could see what was going on with the experimental A17 and maybe get more involved. What an eye opener. I had already suspected there was a lack of judgment and professionalism within the company and the forums just proved it. \n\nThe community manager comes across as a school yard bully who mocks and shoots down anyone who questions the confusing decisions being made by the developers. He doesn't moderate. He dictates. I witnessed him shredding one of the most highly respected modders in the community in a post he wrote specifically for that purpose-prompting more people to jump on his band wagon and join in. Then he continued justifying his doing that in posts spanning several pages-personally attacking the modder (who in NO way-responded in kind) and also mocking anyone who called him out on doing it-going so far as to brag that he has never once been reprimanded for his behavior and he can do/say whatever he wants.  \n\nSo in essence-a moderator who, rather than moderating-CAUSED bashing and drama by his supporters. There were several  \"getting out the popcorn\" comments. So you get the impression the entire community is muzzled by an ego maniacal community manager who mocks into silence anyone that questions the decisions being made even when those people are their most loyal supporters/the modders who quite literally MAKE this game( Apparently for the purpose of providing self aggrandizing entertainment at the expense of those who genuinely care about the games success.)\n\nThen you have the devs making radical changes that don't go in the patch notes and making odd knee jerk seeming decisions that look for all the world like they were done out of spite. They completely crucified the random gen for maps-making them nearly unplayable. Not a word was said about it. So you had people spending hours trying to fix it-just to have one of the devs post an impatient sounding, snarky post on the forums to all of those \"going on\" about the maps-that he had basically just patched a \"make do\" thing together so it would sorta work before the holidays and would get around to fixing it after they were over. No apologies for not putting that in the patch notes. No awareness that they are wasting peoples time. Just more lack of professional ettiquette and bad judgment calls. That is the condition the maps were left in when they pushed it to stable.\n\nI can't even imagine what is going on in the company that they are letting this kind of stuff slide. To allow the person who represents them to the public-behave in the way I witnessed does not inspire confidence in their ability to make good decisions. \n\nWhat started out as a very promising vision for a unique game that covered many different playstyles has become something that has lost most of what made it compelling. Add to that-the mess that things are in and the behavior of their staff and i just can't recommend that anyone put time into it at this point. It will result in mostly frustration.\n\nMaybe if they do some internal reorganizing and put in place people who legitimately care about the well being of the game and it's community and aren't just on their own personal ego trip-it could turn into the amazing game it promised to be.

Be prepared to be harassed and belittled on forums if you plan to discuss this Alpha product with the developers, and feel free to peruse around for quotes and interviews with devs and community representatives who openly state they don't like finding out their players play the game in certain ways.\n\n[b] Update: With the changes revealed in Alpha 21, this trend continues. [/b] \n1. The perk and leveling system has gotten a complete overhaul; total game upheavals are unfortunately a common occurrence in this game. While this came with a much-needed balance shift away from perks in the Strength tree, the devs also decided to force players to have to loot and scavenge to improve the accessibility and quality of tools, armor and weapons. XP gained from your favorite building and harvesting activities can no longer be funneled into combat; you [b] HAVE [/b] to go out and loot buildings, or you won't be able to improve your gear, unless you are playing multiplayer and have teammates bring back these magazines for you.\n2. Water. You will no longer be able to collect water from water sources, such as lakes and rivers, for the purposes of drinking it. You know, a common survival practice for the entirety of human existence? In the past, you would take a bunch of jars to the watering hole, fill up on murky water, bring it back to base, and use it for a variety of purposes... You know, like what water is used for. No more of that; efficient collection of usable water is now subject to acquiring a water filter item, and using it to build a \"dew collector,\" which is supposed to give you 3 \"pure water\" items a day. Or, you guessed it, you can instead loot murky water from specific container types in the world.\n3. Traders. Traders were where you could grab quests, which led you to all manner of interesting buildings and POIs on the map you may not have found, fill up on treasure, recipes and materials, and get some good hard cash to spend in their shops to get items you normally couldn't get. Not anymore! Traders' inventory is tied directly to your level, which means that if you can't make or find it yourself, they won't have it. On top of this, they will also have less general goods, and instead have more items towards each one's \"theme\": Some have more medical items, some guns, some armor, etc.\n\n[b] Original review: [/b] \nAbout a year ago, this game was amazing. It had everything you could possibly want from a zombie basebuilder, with tons of options to survive the night, and the monstrous hordes every seven days. It was one of my favorite games for a long time, and the only reason I'm not in the thousands of hours is because I didn't always have friends to play with... And the glaring dev-forced game direction I will detail below.\nNow, as the devs have had more and more time to [strike] listen to [/strike] ignore player feedback, they have gone completely out of their way to patch out every single conceivable way to outsmart the horde. It baffled me that a dev team that listens so intently to what their players are up to uses it exclusively to stop them from playing the game a certain way.\nEverything from moats, underground bases, death mazes, and even building a freaking helicopter and just flying away have all been \"fixed\", so that [b] you have to play the game the way the devs want you to play it. [/b]\n\nGetting creative and learning the game is a thing of the past. Below are a few examples of what I mean when I say \"the devs are getting in the way of their own game.\"\n\n[b] Farming and being self-reliant? [/b] Nerfed. Even completely maxing out the relevant perk tree leaves you with a barely serviceable farm. It would seem the point of farming was to plant seeds you find while looting, and get a little extra back; once the devs sniffed out that players were actually living off of their produce, it was nerfed. Sustainability is practically nonexistent after this change. Farming wasn't even that powerful! A lot of high-tier food in the game still requires materials you have to forage and scavenge for; being able to grow your own food was just one less thing to worry about while you prepared for horde night.\n[b] Death mazes? [/b] Patched. Zombie AI is equivalent to having a hive mind of architectural engineers working like a well-oiled machine to take down the exact structural support needed to expose you to them. I'm not even exaggerating: No matter how elaborate your base is, the zombies are coded to find the fastest route to you no matter what, and if they can't reach you, will destroy the blocks required to get you into range.\n[b] Hiding under 100 meters of solid stone and just laying low? [/b] Nope. On horde night, zombies have [b] infinite detection radius [/b], and will dig with their superhuman claws all the way down there to meet you... That is, if you somehow manage to close up the hole behind you, because they can sniff out even the most convoluted tunnel and hatch system you can possibly come up with without even slowing down.\n[b] Building a helicopter, truck or other vehicle and staying out of range? [/b] No longer possible; there are now flying vulture zombies that move faster than any vehicle available in the game; not even aviation can save you from these things.\n\nIt's really frustrating to see, once again, a very particular playstyle being reinforced by the developers of this game. They are hellbent on making sure we play the game THEIR way, and this game would be so much more popular if they just let the players play the game the way they want! I've complained about how hordes are handled, and several people told me that I can just turn off the hordes if I hate them so much. And now, I do, but that wasn't always the case. Years ago, it was fun when it was my friends and I  tried different methods of outsmarting the endless hordes to see who did the best; now, it's just us trying to figure out how to hold back this hive mind of architectural engineers with the one particular style of base defense while the devs release change after change making sure we only go about it one specific way: The way the devs want you to play.\n\n[b] TL;DR [/b] \nThis game feels like playing \"zombie survivor\" in your living room with your 10 year old cousin. No matter what creative and interesting strategy you come up with, the little kid will just say \"nuh-uh\" and make something up to beat you, until you are playing exactly how he wants to play. On top of all of this, the devs themselves have been openly dismissive of both their players and any criticism that heads their way.\nUntil the devs can ditch their childish reinforcement of their preferred game style, endless stream of frustrating \"overhauls\" that turn the game on its head and general dismissal of any of their players offering constructive feedback on updates, changes and overhauils, this game is doomed to be less and less fun. Or, you can just use their base code as a framework and mod it; there are plenty of mod authors who actually listen to player feedback.", "timestamp_created": 1670897426, "timestamp_updated": 1673685118, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 744, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.882159173488616943", "comment_count": 40, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54847674": {"recommendationid": "54847674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035184826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 206090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122268, "last_played": 1711167457}, "language": "english", "review": "7 Days to Die has pivoted from 2 of its four defining gameplay characteristics with the introduction of Alpha 17.

In a nutshell, Minecraft for adults.  However, unlike the Minecraft --- these Zombies are not a joke.   In fact, early on the game your best bet is just run.   Zombies are just mean --- and it is fantastic.   Raiding old building, building your own guns, riding mini / motor bikes --- it is a very rich world.    The multiplayer is fantastic as well.    My kids year love this game --- and my 65 year old retired Dad loves this game.   That REALLY says a lot to me.   My wife, kids, friends, and Dad all play together on a private server.  Rockets, exploding crossbow bolts, flaming arrows ---- you just have so much to pick from.\n\nAnd on top of all of that -- the building engine is one of the best I've seen.   Blocks have and strength --- you can't just build whatever you want (like Minecraft) --- you have to plan support beams, or your building will fall down around you.    Think can just ignore the Zombies while you hide on the roof?    Good luck with that --- I've had them beat the walls down --- and then the ceiling will fall in (you scream while it happens, then you run away and scream --- then you laugh).\n\nIn single player mode, it is a slow creepy game (you are playing an episode of The Walking Dead).   In co-op mode you are basically a gang of zombie killing mad men.    It is my favorite game on Steam.    By far, head and shoulders one of the best co-op (play together) games I've ever played.

The other ones just lose to it so bad...\nThere are pvp servers but the community, and devs, seem more focused on pve. Yes dealing with other players can be stressful but in 7 days the zombies and environment are the real threat. At night the zombies all do cocain and bathsalts, going from shambling little sneaks to full on oh god why mode. You are not zombie apocalypse rambo. You are a meat sack that got the idea in its head that a little stone on the end of a stick might be effective against something that doesn't feel pain. Situational awareness is key as you will often be snuck up on during the day. Tired from cutting wood? Perfect time for a zombie to silently shamble out of the tall grass behind you and use the loud crash of the tree falling to essentially grapple you and begin mauling your face off.\nTowns offer their own unique challanges. Tougher and more frequent enemy spawns make looting difficult early on. You will spend hours slinking around trying to make as little noise as possible while going building to building praying for that one thing to make the trip worth it. And then you realize the sun is setting... The house you are in is a one story home in the middle of town... Time for a good ol garage night cry. You sit in the dark, unmoving, hoping the zombie outside will just go away. It's scratching at the walls aimlessly. You hear more footsteps. Stay away from the windows, do not open any noisy containers. That juicy locker in the corner probably has something nice for you but its going to groan and clang when you open and rumage through it. A long moan has your attention on the window again as a shadow moves across the broken frame.\nAnd then it happens. You haven't been keeping track of your own needs and hunger pangs cause you to grumble and moan. The god awful scream just outside the garage send you into a panic and them into a frenzy. Your hiding spot is beset by the undead, riping at the siding and pounding down the door. The flimsy walls begin to split, arms flail wildly through the openings grasping at anything in reach. You haven't moved from the corner. It's time to make a judgement call. Do you bolt into the house, knowing that they will see you and begin sprinting around the house trying to find a way in? Staying in there might work. The house could hold up until day when they slow down and you can escape. Making a break for it may work to. Or do you just not move and pray they lose interest before they fully breach the wall?\nPanic wins and the cold night air kisses your skin as you burst out the front door. They're on you though, but very slowly falling behind. Your stamina only lasts so long... They finally lose interest in chasing you as you dodge and weave through side streets. But you're tired now, and still very hungry. The run wasnt enough to warm you up and snow begins to fall. You finally stagger to a stop, practially stumbling around the corner of a house as the area is slowly blanketed in white. A low dark shape pops against the white before you. It begins to snarl. The zombie dog is faster than you, and you're so very tired...\nThis is the only zombie survival game where the environment and undead, actually surviving, feels fantastic. Early to mid game is stressful and you will be startled from time to time by unexpected events. As you progress into zombie rambo, you still need to worry about basic survival. You may be able to wade through a horde of shamblers with your shotty and heavy armor, but at night you will only ever feel safe behind your fortress walls. And then the red moon rises... Good luck.\n\nFantastic devs. Frequent updates and progress videos. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFrUPm0uNQgiPRos3TYOpEA/videos\n\nI have only experienced a few frustraiting bugs. Mini bikes falling out of the map when you dismount,  which is frustraiting after storing loot on them... And the very rare physics bug that has you catapult into the air and break your legs for no reason. Very rare as I have only had it once in 138 hours of play. I have lost 2 or 3 minibikes though.\n\nDecent sound, ok graphics, great mechanics. This game was made to be played with friends. Single player is fun to, but in a more stressful way if you like that kind of fun.\n\nRemembering that it is still an alpha, though imo a very complete feeling alpha, 8/10\nThe game does get a little boring after so many hours. It's one of those play it for 30 hours then come back in 2 weeks and enjoy some new features for another 30 hours type of games. Starting fresh every time keeps it fun unless you just love building, and the building system is very nice...\n\nAlthough I'm hoping console release doesn't slow down development as it feels like it is starting to...

If you like tension, exploration, tech trees, loot, workstations, gun mods, and/or hitting zombies with baseball bats, buy it.\n\nLong version:\nBelieve the hype. 7 Days is the title everyone in the survival crafting genre is trying to emulate, and none have come close. More than likely this is because 7 Days is one of the only S/C titles that utilizes an actual voxel world. Most titles have objects that are immune to destruction, but in 7 Days you can build, explode, or dig underneath anything in the world. And since everything is destructible, everything is a potential resource \u2013 although some objects give more resources than others (you\u2019ll get more iron from hitting an iron mining vein than from hitting a wrought iron fence).\n\nCharacter options abound. Are you an expert marksman, a melee specialist, or good with a bow? Do you excel at wrenching down cars or hunting down wild game? A plethora of build options await, and all of them are viable. \n\nThe loot is looty. You\u2019ll find all kinds of stuff, from clothes and weapons to tools and mods to car parts and plastic explosives. Plan on having a base full of boxes that are easily marked for storage, otherwise you\u2019ll never be able to find what you need. A base is not optional, by the way. The core mechanic of the game is that every 7 days a blood moon rises, causing all the zombies in the area to flip out and hunt you down. You\u2019ll need weapons, walls, and traps to survive through the night. At dawn, rinse and repeat \u2013 you have another 7 days to loot, craft, and build before the next horde arrives. Each week, and as you level, the zombies get tougher.\n\nMultiplayer is recommended. Building everything, looting everything, and shooting everything is a lot for one person to handle. That said, for every person in the game, the blood moon spawns more zombies. More people, bigger hordes. \n\nOver time, the game has gotten steadily better \u2013 it\u2019s in Alpha 20 now, and the progress since the beginning has been significant. With each new revision there\u2019s more loot, more enemies, more locations to search, and more character options. \n\nThe only issue is that the game isn\u2019t officially out yet. Oh it\u2019s playable \u2013 and stable for the most part. But it\u2019s not complete. There\u2019s no win condition, no roguelike advancement over multiple games, no escape. Which means you basically start a new randomly generated map and play until you get bored. Then start another. I know, sounds stupid, but once you try it you\u2019ll see what I mean.\n\nIf there was a way to finish a game and start a new one with some sort of continuity, this might be the greatest game of all time.

Then I went Rambo. Fought my way out and ran to a house. Hid in the attic until the sun came up.\n\nDay 2 - Found a few weapons and some rudimentary armor in the house next door. And the upper half of the owner. Gotta stay mobile until I find a place to settle in and make it defensible.\n\nDay 5 - Snuck around and scavenged houses for food and potable water. No sign of...people. Am I the last one alive?\n\nDay 10 - Found an abandoned military outpost. Made a door and barricaded myself inside of the largest tent for now. Will scavenge the surrounding area during daylight only.\n\nNight of the 10th day - They're everywhere. Oh God. They walk right by my tent. I'm cowering in a corner behind a desk with a pistol and a wooden club that I wrapped in some scrap iron. Only 15 rounds of 9mm for the pistol. I hope that they don't decide to tear the tent down around me.\n\nDay 11 - Began collecting resources. I think that I'll try sleeping tonight.\n\nDay 12 - They woke me up 2 times, but never took notice of me. I'm glad that I don't snore.\n\nDay 25 - Have been fortifying my position, dug a trench to trap the undead. Only the \"Spider Zombies\" can get out. I need to contain them somehow. \n\nDay 50 - Currently I have a fortress surrounded by metal tipped log spike traps 3 deep so they can't escape. Then I just stand on my roof and snipe the spider zombies. Collect loot and smile. I think that I'll be ok.\n\nDay 79 - Been farming. Food is plentiful now. Weapons and ammo are easy to make. I built my fortress on top of a deposit of iron, lead and potassium nitrate, with coal deposits poking out of the ground all around me! What luck!\n\nDay 1?? - There's no end to them. I heard a scream the other night. Not one of them. It sounded...human. Female. Close. By the time I made it outside at first light, all I found was a pool of blood and entrails a half mile from my fortress. Next to the carnage I found a purse with some pictures of a pretty young blonde lady with a cheerleading outfit on in one picture, in another she was in an expensive looking dress cuddled up to who was probably the star quarterback at her high school. The last picture was her with what must have been her family on vacation at an expensive looking beach house. They looked so happy. Her driver's license said that her name was Cindy Batross and she was 17 years old. There was a notepad with illegible scribbles and crude drawings of people eating each other. I cried as I realized that she saw my lights and was desperately trying to make it to the safety of my home. What may have been my only hope for companionship was now in the rotting stomach of the undead.\n\nStardate 4/20 Delta V - Venison stew is good. It's lonely here. I found pictures in houses and I talk to the nice people in them. You want to be my friend, Jimmy? Ok. I promise that I won't chew on your bones. \n\nDay whatever - What was that noise? They scratch inside my skull sometimes. I saw the cheerleader. She doesn't have a stomach anymore, but she walks around with a little smile on her face and coos sometimes. Then she screams when I try to talk to her from my roof. Maybe I should let her in. Maybe she just wants to be friends.\n\nNight time now. She didn't want to be friends. Only my iron helmet kept her from chewing my face off. I cut her head off with my hunting knife. She didn't have any manners at all.\n\nHump Day - I sewed her head back on and sat her in a chair. We talked for hours while I cooked some vension stew for us. She's nice, but a little cold. I hope that she's on the pill.\n\nYear of the Rat - I caught that bitch Cindy looking at one of the other guys in the photos today. She denied it, but I know there's something going on while I'm out risking my life for us. Ungrateful bitch.\n\nJudgement Day - Cindy had to go. I had no choice. I had told her too much about Mrs. Doubtfire and she was plotting a coup to reap the benefits of our trade agreement with the rabbits. I loved her, but now her bones are scattered in the ashes.\n\nThe Day I Die - Spent the last 30 winters here. I lost my mind a long time ago, though I regained some of my faculties after much reflection. I can no longer keep up with my home. It's only a matter of time before they break through. I never did find anyone else. No one came. The supply drops stopped long ago. I can only assume that the rest of the world succumbed to this hellish plague. The undead continue to march in all directions. \nI have stockpiled a large amount of explosive devices, guns and ammo. Tonight I will open the bridge to my door for them and when they are clamoring to peel my flesh from my bones, I'll let them in. \nThe world will see the last survivor, not dying peacefully in my sleep, but raging against the darkness in one last epic battle. But I won't let them kill me. When it's finally hopeless, I'm going out on my own terms. Let them eat what is left of this shell after my spirit departs. Those damned fools won't make me one of them. My life is over.\nI can hear them now. There must be close to a hundred. It's time to face my fate.\nHere I come, Cindy. I'm sorry for everything.\n\nNOTE: This is a dramatization of in game events and doesn't represent actual game play. Don't get me wrong, the game is amazing and I can't wait to see where they take it for the end game. BUT, this little story was entirely made up in my head based on my experiences in the game and a fateful first encounter with a cheerleader zombie that seriously freaked me out. And based on the positive comments so far, I may turn this into a short story.\n\nUpdate 7/21/15: I've managed a plot that I can mold as more content is released and have been working on a solid beginning to explain just \"appearing\" as if from nowhere in Navezgane amidst the carnage. It should please quite a few fans of the survival horror genre. I'm not looking to invest a lot of time into a project that won't yield any revenue, so a very short story will set the bar and sway my decision to pursue a published work (with TFP's blessing, of course) in the future. I'll see how well it is received here and on some FanFic sites first. But rest assured, it's in the works as you read this text.\nStay safe, survivors. And happy hunting!\n\nUpdate 9/19/23: I've been made aware that the review at https://steamcommunity.com/id/DirtyDeedsDone4DirtCheap/recommended/251570/ is plagiarizing my review and thus my intellectual property in the form of this dramatized, short story in order to farm awards.

But I rather tell you a story.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a hell hole, far, far away there was a nameless man who could punch insanely quickly and break bushes with his fists.\n\nHe plopped into existence on a remote server. With nothing more than his starting items and a zombie mauling his face due to server latency.\n\nHis journey started light heartedly. He came across a body of a dismembered fellow citizen, he politely inquired if the citizen would be requiring that wrench on his persons any longer. The man took the gentleman\u2019s silence as a \u201cyes, please good sir! I cannot bear to have it in my locale any longer!\u201d\nThe man then starting using the head of the wrench to mate with the faces of walking dead - It was the start of a beautiful relationship and symbiosis between two sentient objects. Man and wrench.\n\nAfter some through mating with skulls; the wrench began to tire, the man acknowledged his silent partner\u2019s weary state and left her (My lawyers say the wrench must be a she due to gender neutrality) in his inventory to rest.\nThe man travelled onwards, admiring the fly tippers that had plagued the lander with their rubbish tipping on public highways. \u201cAre there no gentlemen left anymore?\u201d the man asked himself. His companion would retort, is she were not so tired.\n\nThe man after many minutes of walking the man was ambushed by 4 gentlemen, all armed with firearms pointed at him.\n\nThe gentlemen asked in the most gentlemanly fashion:- [i]\u201cWant 2 help us come build a town :D ?\u201d[/i]\n\nThat man pondered for a while, this could be a trap. What he was more worried about is that following 4 burley white men into the bushes late at night could ruin his reputation as a stand up and decent gentlemen.\nWeighing the risks he agreed politely.\nThe 5 gentlemen travelled down the road, for what seemed like many hours (20 minutes) until they came across a small town, partially build in the middle of a plains area.\n\nFor the next few days the man and his fellow gentlemen laughed, sang, and drank the polluted water from the river merrily. And as a result were plagued by the ungentlemanly affliction of diarrhoea.\nMany days passed of incontinence and building.\nThen, a large pack of ruffians assaulted the town\u2019s walls.\nThe more nimble ruffians simply vaulted over the walls [b]IN A MOST UNGENTLEMANLY FASHION[/b] while the slower Ruffians pounded on the walls and demanded an audience with us.\n\n[u]I stood upon our half built watch tower. Gazing at the ruffians\u2026[/u]\nThe ungentlemanly behaviour\u2026\nThe pounding on the walls\u2026\nThe way they attacked us like feral beasts\u2026\nThe way they were dressed and many of them unclothed\u2026\n\nBeing a gentleman I knew this could only mean one thing. [b]The French had found us.[/b]\nThe walls fell, many died from being driven indoors and (presumably) forced to sample their heathen food.\n\nI did what I could, but there were too many Frenchmen to repel. I came down from my tower, firing my rifle as fast as I could at the hordes of unwashed Frenchmen. I could have sworn one was wielding a baguette.\nI was forced inside, I fired my rifle with the most British and gentlemanly fury I could muster.\nThe Frenchmen piled up by the door. But there was too many.\n\nI then barricaded myself inside \u2013 buying myself only time.\nIn my last efforts, I took out my tired companion. I bashed and bashed and bashed the wall in front of me, breaking through enough to escape.\n\nOn the final swing my friend broke into pieces.\n\nI heard her speak to me, broken on the floor\u2026\n[i]\u201cBe free\u201d[/i]\n\nI ran outside, jumped over the fence and off to freedom.\n[b]Then I disconnected.[/b]\n\n[h1]===THE SERIOUS REVIEW===[/h1]\nIn a nutshell 7D2D is what early access games should be. It has a good range of features to keep you entertained while updates come out. The devs were friendly and helped me with a FoV problem I had with the game (I suffer from acute simulation sickness).\n\nWhat put me off is seeing people and curators endorse the game as \u201clike minecraft\u201d\n\n[b]Can we please get out of this trench of comparing everything to Minecraft?\nThe genre is Voxel world not \u201cMinecraft\u201d, it\u2019s like calling all FPS games \u201cLike CoD\u201d.[/b]\n\nThere is much I still have to explore and it honestly is one of the best survival games I have ever played. Compared to a game such as DayZ everyone seems rather friendly. Which is much better than other zombie world based games like Dayz (not making many comparisons, for obvious reasons) because not many people seem to shoot me on sight. Which was refreshing.\n\nOnce you get access to guns everyone loves you (totally unrelated I\u2019m sure). \nDefinitely worth a pickup. I can\u2019t find much wrong with it. The only problems are purely cosmetic and don't break the game. Which is nice because every build seems to be very stable, aside from the few bugs that do get fixed rapidly.\n\nThe only major complaint I have is that the range of melee weapons and a zombie\u2019s reach feels misleading, if a reticule turned green when in range and red when out of melee range I would be happy with this. But it's hard to judge range and distance, espically when you are like me and you modded the FoV files because you suffer from motion sickness.\n\nAside from that, completely worth the money - nice to see someone finally did the genre justice.\nThe only warning I will give however is that this game is pretty damn taxing, not on your hardware, but on you;-\n\n1) The ambiance will quickly start messing with your mind (really good, props to the sound artists) and it's easy to give up because of it being \"too hard\"\n2) Thankfully 7D2D isn't hard just because it has to be or it feels it must be.

We had to break boards off the front door to get in. Did this mean the building was sealed from before the outbreak...and therefore safe?\n\n (shrug)\n\n We settled in an apartment on a lower floor as it got dark, You don't wanna be outside at night, At night...they can RUN, FAST. A horde is scary enough during the day, 20 zombies or so shambling along...maybe trying to catch up to you. But...at night a horde is terrifying. A screeching, sprinting mob racing through the dark. The dead don't get tired...but you do. \n Finding lots of supplies in the cupboards and what not. We didn't realize that all the noise we were making...as night fell...was disturbing the tenants of the building. Of course the entire building was inhabited by zombies...all locked in their apts ever since it all started. They must have been dormant until we disturbed them. The screams and bangs and crashes from all around us got louder as the darkness became absolute. You could hear walls, and doors and even the ceiling starting to give way. We had a long wait for dawn. We couldn't stand the pitch darkness anymore, it made the cacophony that much worse. In the server I set up...The darkness of night lasts a full half hour or so and that's how long we sat there in the near pitch blackness listening to the zombies tear the building apart around us. We couldn't make a run for it because all the noise that our neighbors were making was attracting other nearby hordes on the outside of the building.\n\n As dawn broke...so was the rear wall of our unit....they were getting in...\n\n\n fun game! \n\n(I didn't even mention the zombie dobermans.)", "timestamp_created": 1419218949, "timestamp_updated": 1419218949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 145, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.872113406658172607", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58171453": {"recommendationid": "58171453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088916717", "num_games_owned": 1757, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 117534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 50798, "last_played": 1699681728}, "language": "english", "review": "I received 7 days to die as part of a Humble Monthly subscription about a year ago. Initially I thought, big deal, another zombie game. I own many games due to buying bundles online over the last 10+ years and was about to let it fall into the huge pile of games not even played when a friend of mine convinced me to play a multiplayer co-op game with him and his wife.\n\nI'm sure glad that I joined them for multiplayer... Now, I even play it solo when they are not online and 7 days to die has quickly grown to one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nTo me, playing 7 days to die is like playing a videogame version of \"The Walking Dead.\" Not a simple adventure game (like the licensed version of the tv show) but a immersive first person shooter that is enjoyable for both solo and multiplayer games. (You can play multiplayer cooperatively or PVP)\n\nIn 7 days to die, you start naked on the side of the road. You must craft tools and weapons in order to survive. You need to scavenge items like food and ammo until you learn how to make them yourself. And every 7 days, you need to fight off the zombie horde bent on your destruction. \n\nInitially, you will take over a nearby house and start barricading it for your own defense. You will look through all the cabinets and closets in order to find any material to help you out, from food and water, tools and raw materials, to guns and ammo. As time progresses, you will need to expand your scavenging efforts to other houses and nearby businesses in order to get the items you need to survive another day. As you progress, there will be more zombies and they will get more difficult.\n\nYou will need to build a base. While a wood or stone building may suffice for a few days, eventually it will have to be upgraded to concrete and steel. The zombie horde will grow so much that you will also need to add traps in order to supplant your personal firepower.\n\nAs your scavenging efforts loot the nearby area, you will have to build vehicles (bikes, motorcycles, 4x4's, and even a gyrocopter,) in order to gather the limited supply of resources from even further out.\n\nThere are also a few traders in the area. They can send you on quests to earn some money, and if you are lucky enough to survive, they can sell you items that you will need. However, if you have no money, they will have no mercy. (and they never help when the horde comes around... kicking you out of their compounds every night.)\n\nEverything in the world can be destroyed. From a block of terrain to an entire building. Even if you do not destroy something, the zombies will in their quest to kill you... they will even knock down the largest skyscrapers (literally) just so that you die.\n\nHow long can you last?\n\n7 days to die works well on linux and can be played cross platform(Linux, Mac, Windows.) However, the console version is older and can not be played with PC users. It is in early access now and is still being developed.

Buildings, rooftops, cellars, just think of you old favorite starting shelter, now it comes complete with zombies.\nMANY new buildings and trader now offers missions for some added variety.\n\nSo what\u2019s new?\n- Guns... ALLOT of guns. everywhere you look you will find guns. And you will need them to deal with all the Z's\n- Food... you will never run out of food as long as you don\u2019t mind eating it out of a can.\n- Airdrops... Lots of food and guns.\n- 4x4 jeep (eventually) lots of fun\n- Gyrocopter (eventually) lots of fun \n- Gun mods... AK47 with large mag, scope, ultra fast fire rate and a suppressor. what more can I say :)\n- Army bases... 20-30 Z's (and dogs) per base. Loot = LOW fun = extreme (see AK47 description above)\n\nWhat I'm not keen on.\n- Crafting is now level based... this makes it much slower to get established, get a forge, get a base producing stuff\n- Friggen dogs.. dogs everywhere. There is even a new structure (boarding kennel) YUP.. full of dogs. \n\nOverall. still great fun, May changes but none are deal breakers, they just make game play different.\nA17 is a very deferent game to A16 and have a massive new feature list.

I have a mighty Z proof base with tones of food and ammo. \nI Love exploring the country side, looting, shooting and finding hidden treasure. Great random maps with cities surrounded by smaller towns and villages. The new city sky scrapers POI's are awesome to explore, Lots of loot. I also rebuild them when I get a bit bored.  \n\nThe good points:\nGreat fun in multi play with a few mates.\nFun crafting and base making\nFun exploring\nSleeper Z's sometimes scare the crap out of you\n\nThe bad points\nPretty buggy (but playable)\nLots of clipping\nNeed more craftable and vanity items, usually after day 14 you can make everything, there is nothing left to aim for \nNeed fishing\nNeed animal farming\nNeed a better reason to make food that is not a meat stew\nAfter a few days, everything is a turkey shoot\n\nThis could be the best survival / Z shooter / crafting game ever, if the devs ever finish it and add greater depth to the crafting", "timestamp_created": 1528810670, "timestamp_updated": 1546683546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867518246173858643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156116572": {"recommendationid": "156116572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046034844", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 35205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35205, "last_played": 1705377521}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a perfect example of that type of game that you play once with your friends every 6-12 months for a week or two (RELIGIOUSLY), for 10 years straight.
