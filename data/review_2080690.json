The graphics are decent though I generally care more about gameplay than graphics.  Its not large or procedure generated but decent sized and there are a bunch of above and submerged points of interest with nothing more than mostly barren seafloor between them. As it stands right now you can build structures/bases in open ocean, certain shallow areas and at some limited points of interests but not many.  You can battle to take down enemy strongholds, loot materials and gear,  mine/craft, grow foods and crops, hunt typical of most survival games. There is a recently added basic main quest and one trader NPC. Ive only played solo so cant speak to multiplayer but the gameplay is likely the same no matter how many people.\n\nPro's:  The base building system is decent and you can create a neat rusty waterworld-type fortress with all sorts of decor, interesting crafting stations, lights, furniture, gardens, defensive structures and you can defend it from raids. Foraging and diving for materials is fun and the points of interests are really varied and very cool.  The armor/weapons/crafting station progression is pretty good and not a huge grind ( and I like grinding). Exploring the world on boats and swimming is gratifying.\n\nCons: Well this game still need a lot of work and feels half baked. There are lots of bugs, the sounds are poorly implemented and at sometimes annoying and the sound levels of things are all off. For example guns are quiet but the table saw at your base will split your ears. The boats are bugged so they pull left and the best boat you can make is bugged so it flies all over the place when you exit it. Lots of other clipping issues etc...\n\nThe worst part, as many have stated, is the enemy AI. They just dont seem realistic and are very predictable in how they behave. At night they are basically invisible, which is fine, but they have no problem seeing you and targeting you. This forces you to light up your surrounding area with many torches and lights just to be able to target them or you just sit in your base and wait till sunrise when you can see them. Fighting them in the open you will just see blackness while they pelt you with bullets.  During the day they are pretty easy to kill and dont seem like much of a challenge. The enemies have unlimited ammo.. but you dont, which isnt very realistic. \n\nSecond worst is the gun crafting system.. with the main flaw being once you make a weapon or a gun ( which in some cases requires a lot of work and materials) you cant upgrade it or modify it when you get better parts and so you just have to make an entirely new gun which is frustrating to say the least. \n\nThird worst is the ammo crafting as there are very limited places to get one ammo ingredient and it has the slowest re-spawn in the game which is really annoying. \n\nLastly, the quest line, though clearly in development, really sucks and you really have no idea why you are doing the quest and at the end there is no closure or reward, sadly. It's anti-climatic to say the least and feels like it was written by a 10-year old kid.\n\nThe underwater world seems a little devoid of life, save for a few sharks ( like maybe 1 o 2 at each POI) which can swim through walls and bite you, but none of which are particularly dangerous once you get spear.\n\nNo spear gun, no underwater monsters, no rare gear, no NPC's or special enemies or bosses, no weather, no diseases or maladies except radiation at one place but thats easy to cure with an item. \n\nSummary, it's a fun romp and with some polish, more quests, more content, it would make for a better game.\n\nI mean for $20 I got Valheim.. which is absolutely incredible and one of the yardsticks by which I would measure survival games.  This one ... fun but ... not so great.\n", "timestamp_created": 1709853483, "timestamp_updated": 1709853483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 209, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.939182400703430176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159591910": {"recommendationid": "159591910", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962157306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 8816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 333, "playtime_at_review": 7383, "last_played": 1713183779}, "language": "english", "review": "got the bones of  good game \n", "timestamp_created": 1709277998, "timestamp_updated": 1712040601, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 165, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.834981560707092285", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160800536": {"recommendationid": "160800536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146065393", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1953, "last_played": 1711911597}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey, serious question here...

This game has potential, it really does.  But before I could give this a good review with a clear conscience there are a LOT of issues to be resolved.  I could do a TLDR post about all of the problems, but instead I'll sum it up with just the two most glaring.  #1 - The combat AI is trash and completely unbalanced.  The player cannot see the enemies in the dark, but the AI can for DAMN sure see you out to a distance of 2 miles and will put a bullet between your eyes effortlessly.  This also applies to all situational awareness combat engagements.  Sitting behind cover and still think that enemy guy doesn't know you're there?  Pop your head up to look at him and just get blasted dead before you can even aim.  #2 - the game becomes boring and without real purpose within 7 hours of dedicated play.  There are lots of building pieces and you can design your fortresses any way you like, but there is no purpose in doing so.   The enemies will attack your base and will have the same Godlike navy seal skills as the enemies in other bases.  You will die 4-8 times and maybe more just trying to kill them off so you can start to figure out what they destroyed and start rebuilding everything you lost.  Then, go off to bases you've already beaten and cleared, loot them again and come back to your own base until it gets attacked...again.  That's all this game is up to this point.  Possibly, in the future, it will become something more.  For now, buy it if you want to.

These islands are occupied by clans that differ in difficulty. Your goal is to scavenge and re-purpose items found in underwater cities, mansions, factories, and other POI's. With those items you need to build defences  to protect all of your belongings from attacks mounted by the clans - matching your current progress with the difficulty of these attackers. Your main way of gathering materials is under water ruins and raiding clan islands. Along the way you always want to update your technology to be prepared for higher tier production.\n\n[h3] The Good [/h3]\n- Studio has regular updates and community interaction. The game gets better every update (some updates create bugs but they are always being fixed).\n- GREAT pacing in the way in which you progress preserves the fun and adventure as you build your armoury.\n- Freedom of placing objects around the world or your base. This allows you to set up custom peeks and find different uses for items that fit your needs.\n- Hours of fun. Once you are in and get going, you will not want to take a break for at LEAST 3-ish hours.\n- Amazing concept. This game is literally Rust meets The Forest meets 7 Days to Die. Although I find this game less repetitive than 7 Days to Die.\n- Fun vehicles and fun to follow guided POI's\n- THE SOUND OF GATHERING SCRAP IS SO SATISFYING\n- Raids are a nice break from gathering materials and taking over other islands.\n- Multiplayer is the most fun way to play the game but it doesn't come at the cost of singleplayer.\n- Since I have bought the game there has been two updates already.\n- great community.\n- CONSTANT island updates making the islands cooler and better suited for attacks.\n\n[h3] The Bad [/h3]\n- Sound design is AWFUL in many cases especially when recycling old gun parts.\n- Enemy hit-boxes and movement is so wacky and fast that it is sometimes hard to hit anything with the crossbow or guns.\n- Guns are almost well balanced. Some issues happen late game that turn the game into some sort of an ammo factory unless you use exclusively sniper rifles which is boring.\n- The way the environment looks on islands is just poor. It's like someone just painted blobs all around and called it \"a mountain\". \n- Needs more customisation options for game settings - although what it has is pretty good for now.\n- Needs variation in how you can play the game. Progression is linear but the trader almost always has the same stuff. This stuff is useless in the beginning, and not worth it in the end as you have to make multiple boxes to store just valuables. Trading is awful.\n- Needs better animations (I understand it is early access and I know they will fix it. Just saying the current state of the game).\n- Kind of pricey for this EARLY of early access. I mean $20 is in no way bad, but other established and finished games show this price-point when sales are on 4-6 times a year.\n- Inventory UI is very annoying. You cannot drag items out of a chest, you have to first drag it to your inventory and then in your inventory drag it to a specific drop icon. Also no shift or ctrl clicking into boxes or out.\n\n[h3] Overall 8.8/10 as it stands. Will be coming back again and again.

It's a bit grindy, and the world is empty outside of Points of Interest, so you are forced to repeatedly do the same locations as they respawn.\n\nInitially, I wanted to give this game thumbs up, but when I hit mid-game, I encountered two regular bugs that totally destroy any fun from playing the game:\n[list]\n[*] Water blocks all ranged attacks - if your base is being raided and enemies are swimming around and shooting at you, in order to deal them any damage you have to hit the head.\n[*] Often enemies stop taking damage from any ranged attacks, and the only way to kill them is in melee.\n[/list]\n\nAiming feels very weird. The size of a crosshair doesn't actually indicate a spread - the bullet always goes in the centre. The projectiles also seem to be always going in the straight line - gravity doesn't exist. The reflex sight is extremely small and still hides a lot of surroundings of your target, just as a regular iron sight. 2x scope seems more similar to the reflex sight, especially that it doesn't black out the rest of the screen.\n\nRaids are also very strange, especially once you start getting attacked by a dozen guys with firearms. They are swimming around and shooting at your base... There are only 2 traps in the game but they are both short ranged (spikes and rolling log). There is no shooting underwater, but while on the surface, both the player and the enemies can shoot just fine, which is totally unrealistic. Given the bulletproof water issue, the best strategy to defend against rides is to dive and melee the enemies from underneath... Or to just turn off the rides completely in the world settings...\n\nThere are a lot of other minor bugs such as:\n[list]\n[*] Enemies and containers respawn very quickly, while the player is still on the POI. The world respawn time setting is totally ignored.\n[*] Discrepancies between held item and selected item on the toolbar.\n[*] If there are two containers one behind the other, the game first selects the farthest one from the player (within some range) and not the closest, so you frequently end up interacting with something that you cannot actually see.\n[*] I had one crash in 25h of playing co-op, but there are frequent autosaves so it was not an issue.\n[*] I have seen desyncs of items\u2019 locations (e.g. logs after chopping the tree), but the players can still pick up those items, even though they see them in different places.\n[/list]\n\nAs for the grinding, it would be nice to have some automation or queueing options. Or maybe more advanced work stations that do things in bulk. It would be also nice if scrap metal could be converted into iron ingots (even if it's at a ratio 10:1 and requires electricity and wood), because there is a lot of iron ore needed to craft all that steel. Also, I really lack some bigger containers and boats with bigger storage - even though there are 3 different motor boats (plus jet-ski), they all have only 30 slots for cargo, just like a fully upgraded backpack.\n\nThe base of the game is solid, and I am really looking forward to the updates and changing this review to a positive one.", "timestamp_created": 1710977304, "timestamp_updated": 1710977416, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615328967571258545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157967485": {"recommendationid": "157967485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800679900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6166, "last_played": 1707534327}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game at the start - did all the missions took over all the islands - build an amazing base and when content ran out I stockpiled - for what you ask?

It already has a lot to offer (though I'm looking forward to the promised story features) and is super addictive.\n\n[b]Base building[/b]\nThe base building mechanics are great and very dynamic - with plenty of options (particularly with all the unique aesthetic furnishings you can find around the world) - and its relatively quick and resource-cheap to build a nice base (as compared to similar games that require you to carry the logs two at a time just to put up a little wall segment). This is not even to mention all the many very useful workbenches and machines that you'll end up needing - so it's not all just to look pretty.\n\n[b]Exploring[/b]\nIt's quite fun just exploring the open ocean, finding new enemy islands and rafts (often with new things on them that you may not yet have encountered), as well as all the sunken ruins to explore underwater.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nI think the combat is very well done, particularly with regard to the weaponry and armour. The customisation, especially among the guns, is a real treat, and the progression through the weapon and armour types comes as a very nice surprise. Meanwhile, the enemies all belong to distinct factions, which correlate with difficulty, and so you can always roughly gauge whether you're ready to start conquering certain islands you encounter. The enemies' AI also seems pretty decent, with them hiding behind cover and what not. Although, knowing that at any moment that intense music might start playing and my base may come under siege forever fills me with anxiety while I try to peacefully work on my happy little island - but at least this makes building up defences worthwhile.\n\n[b]Progression[/b]\nI think the game progression is also very well balanced - with the enemy factions and islands being of different 'levels' is a nice feature, so that certain islands are essentially out-of-bounds until you're better equipped to fight there. And similarly, deep ocean ruins, while technically available right away, really open up to you only after you develop the technology to explore underwater for greater lengths of time (not to mention speedier boats to stray further from your base and still make it home for tea). Meanwhile, advancing through the technology and progressing from stone weapons to fancier metal ones to gunpowder guns to customisable WWII and \"modern\" guns keeps the game very fresh.\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\nI think this game succeeds on all fronts, with very strong base-building, great exploration and combat mechanics, with very well balanced progression.

I have spent 90 hours on a friends account watching and playing with them and bought it on mine to play with them. The game has a very good premise and a ton of potential with some unique things not many other survival games have, what the game has done right is very good, but in its current state I cannot recommend paying \u00a317 for it. The game seems to borrow things from Valheim, Stranded Deep, The Forest and a few other survival games and it actually works pretty well. It's fun although in early access, but still being an EA game does not absolve it from being able to be criticised\n\nThis review is taking into account the v0.150 and v0.200 updates in which we played mainly saying whats good and needs work and what has been improved on.\n\nPros: \n\nGreat underwater exploration. You get a good variety of equipment like flippers, sacks, oxygen tanks and structures to explore and scavenge.\n\nPvE combat against different enemies, both animal and human, in and out of the water.\n\nYou can choose where you want to go at anytime and explore or craft or build with a lot of potential even with the low amount of things currently in the game.\n\nTrophies and special items like Neon signs to make hunting have a goal even at end game and set your base apart from other peoples.\n\nThe v0.200 added 45 degree structures and half walls which is really good for expanding better base designs.\n \nA good base amount of things to do with Anvils, Researching, Crafting Tables etc. A good progression route you can follow from early to mid to endgame.\n\nGun customisation added not just 1 red dot sight.\n\nCharacter creator has a good base to it.\n\nNew huge islands to fight on and explore for blueprints as of v0.200.\n\nBig map with a lot of locations to explore and can freely build anywhere given you control the territory.\n\nBetter enemy drops not just 1 cloth or a mushroom you can get gun parts and useful things.\n\nCool basic use of electricity, would be even better if in future updates you could industrialize and make auto farmers and link chests up to farms or smelters so you can make things while away from base.\n\nCan swap between beta versions so even when old worlds become obsolete due to updates you can revert back and continue to play on them.\n\nCons:\n\nHotbar isn't integrated into the inventory and as of v0.200 random items seem to get forced into it.\n\nCan't edit a character when made and pretty limited choice of who you can create.\n\nDespite the building requirements saying you need columns to build upper floors you can just destroy them and have floating builds, not exactly a bad thing but its a big oversight.\n\nTrying to go faster in the start boat makes your character energy decrease which seems odd.\n\nDecoration items can't be picked up once put down so if you misplace it then you lose it.\n\nSome items removed like the Halloween pumpkin are still in the game but have no icon.\n\nAudio issues especially with item pick ups, taking 1 wood makes an invidiual item pick up noise, while taking 50 makes the pick up noise 50 times in one being extremely loud. Another one is the starter boat makes an awful clunky noise that persists even when the game is paused.\n\nSleeping seems to not sync with actual night time meaning you either have to wait for the water to heat up in the morning or keep busy at base to kill time.\n\nBit of a minor issue but glass walls are randomly locked behind a discoverable blueprint which I couldn't find so I had to resort to using 45 degree walls, you should get guaranteed access to that from the beginning or on tier 1 of the research table.\n\nThe newly implemented missions don't seem to serve any purpose other than a slight guide on the order to target islands, but I'd rather just explore where I want since its an open world. Maybe make the trader give out randomised missions that you can cash in for rewards instead. And give the trader a lot more items to buy and sell that randomise and change every 5 days or so, its always almost the same thing.\n\nChanges to chest and item sizes. A ton of things have been nerfed making looting more tedious, wood and scrap have been slightly increased which is good but the majority of things have been cut back a lot which for some things like glass as 40 was a bit too much but things like basic items needing so many resources, advanced components stack sizes, the basic boat having almost no slots etc is just a hindrance, it doesn't rebalance the game or make it challenging, just irritating when you have to make multiple long trips to cover an island instead of 1 or 2.\n\nThe combat has always been very buggy but particularly with the crossbow it just does not hit the target especially when aiming high, it seemed to work as of v0.200 so maybe v0.201 broke it? Bullets stray off especially when you strafe to dodge enemies. The enemy are either blind or insanely punishing to the point where hard is infuriating to play when enemies can shoot through walls or group together to gang up on you.\n\nSince you have no passive health regen for having full hunger and thirst and now algae is seemingly a lot rarer and you need to research to even craft it you have no reliable way early game to heal and because of the glitchy combat and hitboxes and strange enemy AI you need to resort to use other glitches to win fights.\n\nFlags don't seem to claim land and enemies respawned right on the island at midnight and nearly instantly killed me since I was low on health from only just taking over it.\n\nThe hitboxes are very dodgy and sometimes extend way past walls, fences so you cant shoot through them but the enemy seemingly can. I just resort to jump stabbing enemies through the floor/walls with a spear quite often since peaking gets you almost instakilled.\n\nInvisible walls particularly on Radio Island. I'm not sure if it was an attempt to make you use the regular route but to get a tactical advantage I went round the rocks on the side and hit a huge invisible wall that seemingly just gets cut off so you can still get round it anyway.\n\nWith boats your character hitbox disappears and any raft bases slightly above water you can clip through and kill enemies as long as your boat fits underneath.\n\nRaiding on the higher end is so often your base gets demolished extremely fast and forget about building a big base because enemies just decide to spawn inside your defences and break your stuff.\n\nUnderwater combat is essentially just repair your armour and bring herbs/antibiotics because you WILL be hit. A dodge mechanic would be nice, or some way of making shark or hammerhead fights winnable without being hit.\n\nI appreciate this might come off as very negative and I do think the game has a lot of potential, most survival games while fun come off as very generic and this has a unique twist I don't think anything else has capitalised on, at least properly. But the v0.200 update is pretty disappointing and still very buggy. I'd recommend just reverting to v0.150 which felt more balanced and fun even without the newest additions. Since this account has under 2 hours playtime I'm gonna ask for a refund and hopefully the game will be much better in future full release and I might buy it again.

But I find I can only play in 20 \\ 30 minute sections before needing to come away.   \n\n- There's no hook or it's all in text so never grabs you away from wondering around.\n\n- Physics can be abit dodgy \n\n- Limited character creation \n\n- Graphics are alright (stranded deep) but you can find areas that lag alot\n\nI can't really say what turns me off and what makes me play a little more. It just needs work at this point. I Don't find each sunken area or faction interesting. Crafting & forging can be slow & grinds. \n\nSorry if that's not helpful. Keep up the good work and work on getting the player interested in the hook & world :)\n\nSpit balling\n\n- Take a note from subnautica and have something you can always see. could be an Island or old warship This gives player a reference point and area of interest to work towards.  \n\n- subnautica again make the middle piece hard to get into Radiation, cutting gear, key cards. \n\n- Not every island needs to be raiders, they're alittle boring. Leave two groups the mutants and slavers\\pirates. \n\n- Add two neutral factions free towns & old world government. Think Fallout new world verses old world - who does the player agree with ?  \n\n- Base building needs set & leave defences and choke point kill zones, enemies where just spawning in the middle of my base out of nowhere ?  \n\n- Humans psychology should be a huge factor in this world. maybe the free towns aren't finding food and become more hostile to the player. Has their base been attacked so many time that they become unstable. \nIs the radiation from the power plant causing a mutation but no one knows why, Has the old world faction stepped too far and being unfair (taking best land or asking for aid by show of force \\ threats)  Paint everything in shades gray. people get meaner \\ unfair the more desperate they get.\n\n- Trade is also key in this sort of world, no one person can do everything. Let the player branch into how they pay for things. \n\n- Skills. Let the player pick a skill - salvage diver, mercenary, pirate, blacksmith, craftsman, healer  \n\nAt the moment I've built a base, maxed the skill tree out, cleared every island, never dive anymore passed starting area (dive equipment seems lacking), don't scavenge often (Once you hit afew islands you are set and don't need to dive). I was hoping some islands where traders or friendly or to find some old government buildings (Army)  every island is the same with no story just raiders.

The island and underwater exploration is very satisfying with a good sense of progression. It reminds me of Raft but fighting enemies and you don't have to spend countless amounts of time in the water itself you can make a conscious choice to go where you want. It's hard to make a survival game that has something different about it but this definitely has a lot of unique ideas.\n\nThe trophies you can find to put up in your base are very fun to find even after having set up a base and the building itself is very simple but effective. A wide variety of different tables for different uses.\n\nThe building almost has the structural integrity mechanic like in Valheim where you need pillars/supports to build but you can bypass it by building on your pillars and then removing them. Unsure whether this is intended or a bug, but it allows for a lot of creativity when building even though it can be a little finicky\n\nThe sunken buildings are fun to explore but it would be even better if all or more of the floors were accessible even above land as for some players who prefer combat to looting could get bored of the repetition without having varieties of structures to explore.\n\nThe combat is fun but a lot of the hitboxes on terrain is off from the actual texture meaning enemies can shoot you through walls sometimes and you can't shoot back, or you shoot through a gap in a fence but the gap is part of a wall so the bullet doesn't pass through. The AI can be a either a bit blind and predictable or a tactical trained sniper that almost instantly kills you with no inbetween.\n\nThe difficulty does need a little bit of balancing as well on the high and very high settings raiding becomes 2,3 times a day its hard to leave your base in single player to continue getting supplies while also making sure your base isn't destroyed. The way I got round this was by using steep sloped buildings where the player can jump up but not the AI but even then things built low down were broken very quickly.\n\nOverall a really good game especially for early access with tons of nice ideas, it just needs bug fixing a little and a few tweaks but definitely recommend buying it!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1706566135, "timestamp_updated": 1706566135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527389943599700928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159060415": {"recommendationid": "159060415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060191168", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3424, "last_played": 1711742396}, "language": "english", "review": "Way too bugged still.Wait a while.

Would suggest not having raid unless you wanna be raided everyday.\r\n\r\n- Difficulty: Fairly Easy. No super realism, able to control the difficulty to your liking, but do know that combat kinda sucks. \r\n\r\n- It's a good small game but rough around the edges, definitely needs more TLC.

The concept is fun.  If you enjoyed subnautica or valheim this game is fun.  It lacks the construction fluidity of valheim -and you're really hamstrung by the armor types to build with--if you don't build a metal base--you'll get creamed. It lacks the story of subnautica and the progression... so here's my constructive criticism: \n\n1.  Needs more linear progression.  The enemy islands should scale up more as you progress (or perhaps ALL enemies in the game scale with your level)-and there should be a relative order to get your gear. The all over the place weapon and blueprint acquisition isn't fun --and shouldn't be based on luck. \n\n2. Diving goes away midgame. Once I've dived and gotten all the blueprints--there's really no reason to be underwater.  That sucks. It's a water game.  Should have bigger and badder sharks and monsters.  Should have an underwater projectile weapon.  The spear is crappy.  The power plant radiation mechanic is more annoying than anything else and there's no great loot there anyway. Seems like a waste. \n\n3.  The gun progression is also stupid.  So once I've defeated dreadville --I have to keep going back and back to use the dumb machine on top?  Terrible idea.  If you wanted to make that machine part of the build progression, fine.  But making us go back to underleveled content for no reason is dumb and annoying. \nGun progression should be linear with the higher level bad guys dropping better guns and parts. Period.  Don't overthink it. \n\n4. Building should be more fun. The snap system isn't good. It's very hard to use and often tries to snap in places that you don't want it to go.  Also, the stairs not connecting to a base drives me CRAZY.  please fix it. \n\n5. The normal level of base attacks is too much. It shouldn't be so frequent. It should feel like a big deal, sure. However, it shouldn't be so frequent that if your base gets wrecked you don't have time to rebuild and prepare again. \n\n6.  Would be fun to build an underwater base in late game as a reward --perhaps to avoid being attacked or making it easier to defend. \n\n7.  The story is completely missing.  Who are we?  What are we trying to accomplish?  Without some RP elements the game suffers. It's very repetitive --get guns, clear island. Repeat. No real objectives. No quests. Once you've cleared zion atoll --what's the point of playing?  optimize your guns? Game should have a clear ending:  boss fight, quest, whatever\n\n8.  The factions are all the same. No real cosmetic differences or AI differences.  The combat is fast paced and fun.  But it would be cool if the different factions actually meant something --either the way they fight or look or BOTH.  i.e. Some could be long ranged specialists.  some could be melee focused. some could be camouflaged. etc\n\n9.  Need a better farming system. eating lemons over and over is boring. The stove is fairly useless. Seafood plate with 50 health is nice. The salad is a waste. The swimming one is nice. Molotovs are useless later in game --but you can only get potatoes in late game....soooo ...that's poor planning on the dev side. \n\n10. The helicopter controls are so bad its unusable. \n\nOverall, I really think this game has potential. I love survival games and it's better than many --and with some serious tweaks  (and a major story upgrade) it could be a hit.

Unfortunately, right now (2/23/24) it has only around 15 amazing hours of great playtime with well made progression, and about 10 more hours worth of grinding for guns which this game makes only somewhat fun. Though it is clear this game does need more updates, I still really enjoyed it, and it reminds me of Subnautica early access days. Of course this game does have a core gameplay loop more similar to Rust. I do think that the gun crafting system and obtaining iron is extremely grindy, but as long as the devs cut down on this a bit once more content is added, I don't think it's a big deal.\n\n   I would love to see advanced blueprints/advanced guns used in later mission islands, and make the gun scrapping system less random. Furthermore, it'd also be great to be able to actually find guns occasionally, even if they are just crappy ones. \n\n   My biggest complaint for this game however, is that it absolutely SUCKS to complete an island and either 1. make multiple trips back to my base to save the loot or 2. sort through and leave behind alot of loot. I had the best backpack, which definitely isn't enough, and it's not like Subnautica where you can make bases which are closer to the later game content. Instead, the islands are all spread out on the East side of the map, and unlike Subnautica's formula where late game content follows a certain path/direction, your base is guaranteed to be far away from many islands which you will need to visit.", "timestamp_created": 1708713087, "timestamp_updated": 1708713087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504436194896697998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161781718": {"recommendationid": "161781718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171290035", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2280, "last_played": 1711430362}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't feel so fat anymore my character eats more then me. <3", "timestamp_created": 1711777537, "timestamp_updated": 1711777537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503618478775024414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161473931": {"recommendationid": "161473931", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013077002", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1711413979}, "language": "english", "review": "game crashes a lot", "timestamp_created": 1711413968, "timestamp_updated": 1711413968, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503618478775024414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162577917": {"recommendationid": "162577917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198447117974", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1070, "playtime_at_review": 1573, "last_played": 1713161153}, "language": "english", "review": ":)\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1712712288, "timestamp_updated": 1712712288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503576517105102539", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158855899": {"recommendationid": "158855899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011490450", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2016, "last_played": 1712183777}, "language": "english", "review": "Somehow gets worse every update", "timestamp_created": 1708482043, "timestamp_updated": 1708482043, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502649843692779541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158016343": {"recommendationid": "158016343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047588172", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 109, "last_played": 1707587918}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is nothing special, i have no idea how it has so many positive reviews other than maybe bots?\n\nThe gameplay is \"ok\", a lot of the gameplay is strange, i WANT to say asset flip but not entirely sure.

But whether or not this can come together into a fully fleshed out game remains to be seen. \n\nCurrently playable. However, some issues:\n1) Loot does not respawn, leading to resource shortfalls later in the game. They should add more loot, make it respawn on a 30d timer, or lower the resource costs of late game building\n2) No way to deconstruct your base and move materials to a different base location\n3) No way to move objects once they are placed in your base\n4) AI combat is janky at best. Movements don't feel fluid or natural. \n5) No stealth mechanic\n6) No way to build bases on islands already held by NPC, even if NPC defeated\n7) UI needs a lot of love here. on my 49\" screen, UI elements wind up overlaying on top of one another. Sometimes parts of the item list are cut off at the top of the screen\n8) Hunger and Thirst drain while sleeping should be greatly reduced -- maybe 25% of normal value\n9) Wherever you have a base, there should be some kind of marker on your map or in the game world. Maybe like a smoke signal or something similar\n10) It doesn't really benefit the player to start building early when food and water are plentiful. Its just a waste of critical resources since better versions unlock at Level2 Bench. Nothing wrong with this, but maybe the resource for Level 1 crafting tables should be reduced further, not use critical resources other than scrap. \n11) Far too much emphasis on decorations. I understand what they're going for here, but they clutter up inventory quickly. Might be better to increase their loot rarity, and have trader provide the bulk of decorative items at reduced costs since they aren't integral to gameplay at all. Decorations are more of a mid to late game enterprise.\n12) They should add in floating debris to be collected, this could boost the early game. Things like wood would be useful. They should add floating seaweed and allow players to create early game rope and clothing out of it. Could be more useful for creation of early base recipes at Level 1 without wasting better resources\n13) Adding more friendly NPC and possible friendly camps to the game. More trade and barter possibilities, and opens up the game to questlines and missions\n14) Increasing the number of small islands\n15) Allow the collection of natural resources like pearls and shells to be sold to traders or used in crafting recipes\n16) Adding stormy weather to the game would be a great touch\n\nFinally, this game really could use a leveling/perk system to give players additional progression incentives. It doesn't necessarily need to be deep or complicated, but every little shot of dopamine is a nice touch. \n\nSome possibilities:\na) Percentage increases to lung capacity are an obvious choice. \nb) A perk that quickly drains your energy when you run out of oxygen before it starts depleting your health\nc) Swim/land movement speed % increases\nd) Increase Stamina capacity, decrease energy drain\ne) slow oxygen depletion while looting\nf) Increase damage against (insert creature here)\ng) Double resource gain from looting/creatures/NPC\nh) Increase loot drop rarity\ni) Allow to set focus to specific loot, increasing drop rates for them\nj) Allow to see from a distance a marker for ore/loot/specific loot/sharks\nk) tag enemies (could be used with binoculars)\n", "timestamp_created": 1693249213, "timestamp_updated": 1693277586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 668, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.951393365859985352", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145688734": {"recommendationid": "145688734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349828665", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1501, "last_played": 1697163344}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is alright, I like the concept and if it keeps going I think it will turn into an awesome game. \nHowever,\nI have noticed while playing that my webcam light turns on which is a little bit worrying.", "timestamp_created": 1693882416, "timestamp_updated": 1693882416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 410, "votes_funny": 150, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946210622787475586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146770468": {"recommendationid": "146770468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038425782", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 5605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1703941574}, "language": "english", "review": "Would be fun if I had friends.", "timestamp_created": 1695378548, "timestamp_updated": 1695378548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 474, "votes_funny": 258, "weighted_vote_score": "0.928841590881347656", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153973720": {"recommendationid": "153973720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198822216984", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1341, "last_played": 1703383879}, "language": "english", "review": "I purchased this game for my son and I for Christmas.

I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! but it needs some work...\n\n[DEVS IF YOU ARE SEEING THIS PLEASE READ]\n\nThese are all based off the love I have for the game but first and I will talk about the \"CONS\" of the game and then talk about the \"PROS\"!\n\nThe parts of the game that i think need the most work ASAP to keep people actively playing the game and stay relevant are. \n\n1. A way to make it so the loot can be 100% replenish-able every 10 days instead of the 15%. I'm saying this because I run a LFG community for those who don't know what that stands for Looking for Group and its where you can fined new friends in a safe and fun environment! and with the max player group even with the AI turn up to the MAX amount and on INSANE difficulty we go through the maps loot and recourse way to fast this makes it so there's nothing to do and everyone wants to get off and you are forced to wait and afk the 10 in game day, till the only 15% loot has respond. Also We get the the objective to beat the game is to flag up the islands and taking over 100% of the map. I come from a long line of playing and testing open-wold/ survival games! Let me tell you that players are going to get washed out even faster when there isn't anything to fight. If its robots or zombies, people, there's nothing better than coming together with your friends or allies to fight the common enemy! so please hear me and take a look at what you guys can do on making it so, also the factions re-spawn cause not everyone wants to buy a game and only be able to fight stuff for one or two nights! some want the real survival feel and have a never ending war! \n\n[Not as important] Quality of life.\n\n2. [Furnaces] They have a glitch where you cant pick up the ore or it will not burn even tho, for EX. you have 7/10 wood in it you have to put one more in for it to start burning again. \n\n3. [Throwing items out] It is very tedious to have to drag and drop items a \"HOT KEY'\" would be nice! \n\n4. [Collectables] all of the trophy's EX. Paintings, toy cars, peddle bike, all should be able to be picked up some people make more than one base but its hard to hold more than one base down when you get raided by the AI and other like to pick up everything and be free to move around the map. \n\nEnough of that, that was for the DEV'S!!!! \n\nTime for the Community you guys ready?! you're going to get the of the PRO'S on why you should get this game and I'm going to be rating everything on a scale of 1/10 and talking about some parts of the game in depth. \n\n1. Movement 10/10 being able to surf stafe is awesome! well done. \n2. The food and water are good and easy to get 9/10\n3. AI are so fun to fight, could use some work on long rang because they are easy to take out at rang 8/10 you can cheese them from high locations. \n4. Map 9/10 it is super to be able to explore above and under water but there should be more enemy's under water! \n5. Base building is awesome and excited to see what comes next! \n6. Boating and flying and great 10/10\n7. Raiding, having your base attacked is litty! and makes you panic and rush back to your base XD\n8. graphics are good for what the game is 8/10\n9. Armour is 10/10 the lower your durability gets the more damage you take and it lasts a while and repair is free so its awesome to just run in guns blazing \n10. Guns, they look good and have a good feel the sights are a bit off and need to be reworked and sadly there's only red dots as of right now. Needs rework 6/10\n\nThere's prob more I can say but that's for a later review once they have made some more progress for the price it is i totally recommend for you and your friends. Its got fun enemy's to fight, base building is great, the boats and heli feel awesome! solo hosting only you can have up to 15 people on your map and dont be scared when you log off and when you come back to play it says its not there just click new game and your same character and then click it again and it'll be your world :P the survivalist feel of the game is there, everything really interactive so, so you're always looking or picking stuff up! The AI is hard and fun they WILL PUNISH YOU if you just run in like a idiot but do able cause you can just re-spawn nearby. Its just a good game people and is you would like to have some friends to play with feel free to add me on discord RushKida is my name! and DEV'S I would like to keep playing your game and see what you guys have in store so please read! GAME is 8/10 coming from a complete gamer.

This isn't directed specifically at this game but, in general, on the other side of the coin, developers collaborating with their players can eventually lead to better content, in fairness.\n\nOnto the game and its current state. I give it 3 1/2 out of five stars. A friend and I have played through the current content, and it took us about a week of casual playing to unlock all the current buildables and work through all the content currently released. In comparison to some of the other games I have recently played, that's pretty fast. A few things that I would like to see fixed, as many others have said, would be nice to have the enemies respawn, even if the developers choose to set that as an option because once you've killed something and it doesn't respawn, the game quickly comes to a conclusion.\n\nI'm a PC player with a mouse and keyboard. The helicopter is pretty difficult to fly. I would like to see that adjusted slightly. I would also like to see a larger speed differential between the different boats. As we progress towards endgame, the speed boats all move pretty much at the same rate right now, so the only real difference is visual preference.\n\nThe other pink elephant in the room for me right now is the large generator and electrical system. The sound on the generator needs to be adjusted. My current base is 10 x 7, three stories tall, four if you count the helicopter landing pad. The large generator is the loudest item in the game and can be heard on every square inch of the base, not muffled by doors or distance. \n\nI also would like a better system for connecting wires. I know to some, the appearance might not matter, but for me personally, I would be willing to put a little bit more work into running wires to have hidden wires. Another small thing for me is the collection cabinet. I would willingly sacrifice some storage space inside to have the items displayed on the outside. What's the point of a trophy case if you can't see your trophies? It's a minor detail, but it's something I would like to see adjusted.\n\nI would also like to see a balance in the lighting system. Right now, there's no point in switching to all the fancy electrical lights that they put into the vanity system because the hanging fire lamps require no fuel, so what's the point of switching? In the future, it would be nice to see an extra trader or two with some different items available. It would also be nice to see some balance in the cost and value of endgame items. Right now, the value of the items is all over the place.\n\nThe current durability system, I am not a fan of. I would like to see the repair station adjusted, so maybe you can make a craftable repair kit that you could take with you, which would also give a little bit more cost and purpose to the armor durability. Building durability is okay, but it's really finicky to hit the right spots while making repairs, especially for fencing and defensive structures. I would love to see that improved.\n\nOverall, my game experience was enjoyable.

(it's scrap!)\n-- rotation, better placement, etc.\n-- More pieces, especially roof.\n-- set depth when placing things like paintings so they don't end up half in a wall.\n-- destructable decorations; that way you are protecting the fancy vase you found.\n- The machines must take more than one piece. It's such a grind to cook one piece of meat at a time on a 3D rendered grill that could clearly take more. Maybe early game you just get a little yakitori grill that takes 1 piece and the nicer grill could take more...\n- A reason to take specific islands/factions.\n- More neutral / friendly NPCs.\n- Reworked menus where item descriptions are whole and you get important storage info for containers.\n- instead of requiring rubber for wiring, construct wire from rubber/copper.\n- Barge / Move the larger floatillas / Towing?\n- If you can't own an build on a conquered base - fine.

As the game is early access things may change, hopefully for the better.\n\nUpon first impression Sunkenland is a visually stunning game, with an absolutely beautiful underwater biome.  There are few games that do underwater well, and this game is definitely one of them.\n\nSoon as I installed, I was met with a UI which can only be described as rudimentary.  It lacks finesse and features such as being able to split stacks easily, and while the UI does work, it leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter creating a character, you'll spawn naked next to the only uninhabited island on the map (thankfully there are now two.)  This means if you want to play with a few teams, or a community, your options are limited.\n\nBuilding the base - you'll soon realise that there are some limitations. For example, there are no stairs to build your base with, so you'll have to use ladders, despite there being stairs used in enemies bases. There are also a number of clipping errors, i.e.  I can stack things almost on top of each other, ladders clip to the outside of structures, and you can drop a foundation almost anywhere to see pillars extend to the bottom of the sea. \n\nBase Storage - After testing every storage container, they all have the same stack sizes. There are speciality storage options i.e. a wood storage and a scrap storage, but you'll soon realise that the cheapest and only thing you need to craft are barrels, as they hold as much as everything else, and over 3x more than specialist wood / stone storage.   Apart from this, almost everything can clip through walls, and you can drop foundations almost anywhere.\n\nAs the base expands, you'll realise that you need to sack other bases in order to get blueprints.  This is pretty fun, but as there's no \"threat level\" there's no real indication of just how hard a base will be to attack until you get there and are head-shotted by an angry mutant.  The AI can see you through walls, and will often be waiting to fully head-shot you in a split second.  There are also instances in which you'll fire a number of shots into a AI only for it to seemingly not take damage.  If the AI is clipping a bit through a wall, he'll quite happily head-shot you through the wall.\n\nIf  you're fortunate enough, you'll die many times and eventually murder every mutant on the base, which will become immediately apparent as the combat music will change.  However there's been a few occasions where we've had to hunt down the last mutant as we knew by the music he was there but just couldn't find him!  We ended up having to build two boats, due to the limited storage of them (one box), and still find that ferrying loot takes a large effort.  There are a ton of base decorations, which is cool and I now have a base which as kitschy as you could imagine.  I have a horse with a globe as a hat, and a tower of infinitely scaling paintings, and a floor of countless carpets.  You can also craft some decorations which serve absolutely no purpose, but are actually considerably expensive in terms of crafting!!!\n\nYou will also end up with valuable items you can sell at the trader!  Bad news, she has a static inventory, and some crafted goods are worth considerably more to her than some of these valuable items i.e. fishing rod vs diamond ring.\n\nBase defence - in my version of the game, I had to turn this off, as we were raiding away from base, and when we came back, our entire base had been destroyed without any notification. Worse still, at the time when we arrived back to base, the AI had frozen in place!  For this raid once we'd came home, there were over 30 mutants on our little newbie island, and they had demolished everything.  Because of this bug, we had to disable base raids as  to be raided without any warning wasn't really fair. \n\nBase upgrade - there's a mallet to demolish, but once you place something there's no way to move it, or in the case of walls / foundations, there's no way (I think) to upgrade them without tearing down the old one.  If you build a wood base, and have raids on - you'll quickly find you need a better base.\n\nSo this brings us back to the game play - after your first 10 to 15 hours, you'll begin to feel that it's a great game on the surface, however digging deeper it has problems.  My final impressions on Sunkenland is that it feels a bit like an asset flip, as QC is minimal, and attention to detail is lacking i.e. there are many ladders you can't climb, there are buildings that are quite generic and with a low level of detail.\n\nYou'll then begin to notice that apart from the truly lovely water, much of the game is very generic and generally OK, but in it's present form, there is no endgame, other than collecting every blueprint, amassing wealth and clearing all the camps.\n\nSadly, enemies and loot does not re spawn.\n\nTalking about loot, my character who starts as a svelte 20-something female, instantly turns pregnant as soon as I equip a combat vest!  My friend has a police vest which is about 25 sizes too big! \n\nFundamentally this is a coop game you can play with 1, 2 or 3 players, that will be enjoyable for the first 20 hours, after which you'll soon begin to see examples of good visual aesthetic, with very little planning in terms of game design.  Sadly, if you removed the water and replaced it with a desert for example - you would quickly realise that there is very little that sets this game apart from any other, and a great deal that forces you to play around it's limitations, accept it's lack of any sort of polish or finesse, and while there are areas in which you think \"Wow, that's really cool!\" There are also countless more in which you'll think \"Well, that was meh.\"\n\nI truly hope that this isn't an asset flip, and that the team are truly as passionate and invested in the game as they show themselves to be.  However, after seeing countless items i.e. wallpaper with Chinese text that says (\u53ef\u4ee5\u5438\u9644\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5899\u9762) - fixed in updated of 31/08/23 I am fearful that once the initial interest period is over - the game may quickly disappear.", "timestamp_created": 1693478140, "timestamp_updated": 1693478140, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 465, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.807344973087310791", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146537483": {"recommendationid": "146537483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198814788775", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3163, "last_played": 1698525150}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the underwater exploration.

And the next \"big\" titles only release by the end of January so we had some time to kill.\n\nI fully understand what EA games are but my review is about the state of the game as it is currently.  There are some bad choices and decisions that are making the game not enjoyable to me. Weirdly enough, the game has a good rating, which is why I gave it a shot but damn...\n\nAt first, the game was janky but that didn't stop us to push beyond the 2h mark refund. What game in this genre wasn't full of bugs and unfinished mechanics during EA? That being said, our enjoyment died pretty quick but we kept pushing, hoping that we would find a bit more fun into it. But we were wrong.\nThe game is nice for about 3-5h, then it get frustrating for 6-10h.... reaching 16h is just copium.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The world building doesn't make sense. It is just a copy/paste of the same, uninspired and empty islands (yes they look different but they are all empty buildings with loot crates). They put everything on isolated islands with some buildings right and left underwater. There is no continuity or logic to how things are presented and after a few hours, the game is not fun to explore. You know that if you dive into these buildings, you are going to find a few furniture to break down and a few crates with more or less interesting loot.\nWhen you land on an island, the disappointment and emptiness just continue. My friend and I landed on an island call \"Gas Station\" with two or three big buildings surrounding a.... gas station! (I know right?) We were excited to explore and loot but oh boy did the excitement died fast. The buildings were only empty shells that you couldn't even explore and all enemies were stacked at the gas station. Again, other islands or explorable content is more or less like this.\n\n2. The progression isn't really good. Farming is easy in the game up to steel (which is the last tier, I think). You get plenty of resources to do pretty much everything you want. But I found the progression logic / research not very good or interesting.\n\n3. Base building is bad. You can only build squares and the roof system is horrible. Base defenses are useless (we built barbed wires and they don't affect enemies. Enemies just go around them so it only serves as a blockade.\nTo avoid being attacked on all sides, my friend and I captured an island called \"mines\". We decided to move our base inside the main building, only having to block the three entrances and covering the inside with foundations so we could build everything we needed. Oh boy were we wrong again... Any can apparently phase through the building walls and get inside to destroy everything. Our fault, we are stupid. We should have planned our setup against phasing.\n\n4. NPCS.... oh boy...... ooohhhhhh bboooyyyyyy. They are horrible. Sometimes, they will stand in front of you, not reacting to your presence, sometimes, they will be lighting fast and insta kill you. Even on normal, they can do a lot of damage (and I usually play games on hard or very hard difficulty). They can even shoot you through graphics or angles that you can't. The number of times, both the npc and I didn't have line of sight on each other but they were able to hit me. Having enemies with either, Stormtrooper aim or perfect aim is not fun. It doesn't give you any challenge. They either feel bad and clunky or over tuned.\n\n5. Coop was fine. I was hosting (I have a good pc) and my friend only got a handful of desync for a few seconds. Game was mostly smooth.\n\nI hope it helps people to make a clear decision in encouraging this project.", "timestamp_created": 1704415395, "timestamp_updated": 1704415395, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.783563971519470215", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150668233": {"recommendationid": "150668233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006435997", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1857, "last_played": 1696542257}, "language": "english", "review": "It like Raft had a baby with Rust.", "timestamp_created": 1700599182, "timestamp_updated": 1700599182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780781388282775879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145357494": {"recommendationid": "145357494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198863056665", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 3048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 534, "last_played": 1710818166}, "language": "english", "review": "dont let negative reviews deter you from this game when it has SO MUCH potential to be better than any other survival game on market.

Please let me opt top turn those icons off and just keep the one more homebase.\n\n-raiding is finicky at best, spawns are really weird and the defensive structures you can build can range from OP for some enemy spawns and others will end up being completely useless until maybe the next raid\n\n-i love that theres gunplay but holy hell the hit reg is really bad. Headshots feel really inconsistent.\n\n-similarly, enemies seem to range from totally clueless to elite sniper gang faze clan pump shotgun gods.\nI appreciate that they are formidable but sometimes it feels like there's no way to react to being shot at. The animations are wonky and it can be hard to tell when an enemy is taking aim or taking cover.\nrandom voice lines would be cool to help locate enemies as well(dm me I make an excellent generic mercenary)\n\n-another hotbar would be nice, sometimes at home I like to have the hammer, bucket, etc. but I don't want to take the time to remove all my weapons and other tools. \n\n-I don't really like when games have a sleep timer, I think it would be much nicer if we could sleep when and only when its night time and wake up in the morning, Sometimes it can be frustrating when its night but i have to wait halfway till morning to sleep.\n\n-there should be a crab trap. its one of the few sea creatures you can't consistently farm, at least in my experience.\n\nThis is 100% meant to be constructive criticism.

Buy it. Now read below.\n\nSo first and foremost I think Sunkenland is worth it's 20$ price tag. I played with two others and got 33 hours at the time of writing this but there is little left to do other than resource hoard for future updates.\n33hrs to me justifies 20$ especially because those 30 hours were not plagued with bugs or crashes like many early access titles are. \n\n\nThe Good, The Bad, and the Ugly:\n\nSunkenland is almost like raft but more combat heavy and less cutesy on the graphics. Oh yeah and you have a stationary base/s. I enjoyed this concept more than raft. The looks of things having a heavily decay-from-water feel to it set a good tone for whatever the story may be  in the future though some of the textures were still ugly, Intentional or not.\n\nThe combat is decent. The gunplay can be fun under the right circumstances but there are a good bunch of guns with little difference between them. Shooting feels a little lifeless and unintuitive as the only attachment you are given is a \"red dot\" (which is pale green) has a huge circle which covers up any would-be target not to mention the ever present single dot reticle is also there but offset which obfuscates the shooting mechanic. My biggest gripe with combat besides whats mentioned above is that enemies frequently drop items of a much lower tier than they fought you with. Why are 9 dudes able to shoot with 7.62 but only drop slingshots? Enemy type and quantity is very limited and AI is bad. Running is also useless as you move slightly faster than a hobble. Maybe running shoes as an accessory/food should be added.\n\nThe map is large enough that you have a good amount to do and a bit to explore. The means of traveling is primarily handled with boats and their handling isn't too bad. The biggest problems with them are that when you upgrade from one tier of boat to the next it is a large amount of expensive materials for very little gain. +20kph and no storage upgrade. Yuck. If you do eventually find the gyrocopter, DO NOT USE IT. The controls are some of the worst i've ever seen for helicopters. This needs improved. It is worthless in its current state.\n\nThe UI is a little clunky and some things need a touch of love. Renaming a box can't be completed with [enter] and instead has to be clicked with mouse, drag and drop feature doesn't work with the merchant, frequent double clicking which messes up inventory management etc. Small things. Not game breaking. \n\nBuildables are not very good and like many other items have large invisible walls that extend past the item. Great for providing extra cover from fire, not so nice when you think you shot the enemy but somehow you missed even though your shot was a foot or two over their barrier. The snapping works well as does the item retrieval system.\n\nStability is good with no major framerate drops and only 2 disconnects during our 30hr sessions which is a strong plus. This added a lot of playability and is worth noting as optimization is usually something devs do last so kudos to Sunkenland here.\n\nMusic is boring and uninspired. There are only 2 or 3 tracks that get repetitive fast but you can turn them off.\n\nI think there should be other things to do than just hoard resources and sandbox around. I'm thinking minigames, animals, etc. You know, those little things that distract you from the stuff you were supposed to get done. Yeah, those things.\n\nLastly, The merchant's barter system is okay. I don't love it but I don't hate it. It makes sense however their goods become woefully irrelevant after a few hours in. This seems to be an oversight. I'd like to see more valuable things locked behind her store's paywall. I also think the .50 should have been able to be boat mounted. That would really add some excitement. The electricity system is also very primitive. I am hoping it will be updated. Every wire run to power an appliance must be fed directly to the generator instead of using connectors or relays that can't be reconnected to. \n\nI hope the devs will continue to work on Sunkenland.

You just gather enough resources for that grill and all of a sudden a bunch of bast*rds come and tear it up, as well as the very foundations beneath your feet. \n\nBase-building is super customisable with many different decorations and furniture already, which is super impressive. Hard to get going but once you grind a little bit and depending on your respawn settings for the loot, also super rewarding. \n\nA few comments; charcoal needs another purpose. Once you move past the homemade weapons, and no longer need black-powder, it is useless. Please, let us use this instead of wood in the machines that require burning fuel. It would make sense, as at first it is hard to come by and once you get going, wood is incredibly scarce but charcoal plentiful. \n\nI hope there are some plans to add additional wildlife to the islands and specifically the ocean. The odd small fish, group of 2-3 Marlin, sea turtles and 2 different types of sharks that all swim in a circle becomes no challenge. Make the sharks spawn randomly and let them move all around the locations at different depths please.

But i think i made ingame far enough to have some opinion:\n\nAfter spending a lot of hours at Escape from Tarkov half a year ago, combat in this game feels very primitive, but i don't say it is bad thing, because game is focusing on dynamic fights, looting, exploring, crafting, using vehicles, co-op fights. Though i felt ingame that developers made some stoppage on weapons for a reload, which feels close to real life, also i think some recoil exists too. Melee fight experience was pretty bad and felt like in any other cheap surival game, enemy were dropping through the ground, their movement and hits felt little clumsy, but some of AI is there as enemy try to get to you if you are on a higher ground etc. But as game progress is pretty fast, then once you get to ranged weapons you don't really need melee weapons as even in combat you can run away from enemy strafing and start again fighting with ranged weapons.\n\nOVERALL ABOUT GAME: So it in some way is similar to Valheim. Server for up to 10 players. You can play with friends too as co-op against AI or just against each other. You start at one of the islands where you can make your first homebase. There is not so much grind as in other games, so you progress pretty fast. From the start you already can dive around your island or swim further to other islands or underwater locations. Map in the server is pretty big, so it would be probably fun to play co-op 2v2, 5v5 and similar or FFA. Before creating a map (server) you can use options to set enemy bot difficulty, garrisons, raiding frequency on your base, you can even set that enemy don't raid your base. I don't remember what kind of frequency i did set but enemy raids were every ~3rd day so i had to defend my base. Also enemy quantity was more and more with each raid and also they became stronger and better geared, i think it has something to do with your research table tier upgrades. Worst thing about enemy raid is that they can come at night and if your base don't have good lighting then you have to fight in the dark. I might add that  first time zombie-like enemies came to my base at night, at that point i didn't know that enemies can raid your base. I was doing regular stuff in my \"house\" and i heard strange zombie angry men noises from outside, so i went to check it, it was very dark and i couldn't see a thing because my base at that point had no lighting built. So when i walked out and at some point i noticed silhoutte in front of me it didn't look friendly because it was swinging at me. I almost shit my pants at that point because before this i was chill for 3 days farming around base, thinking i am safe because i am on ISLAND! And now someone is here trying to kill me, the music turned from chill to scary, so as i notice my hp gets lower i run away from him to understand against how many i am dealing, i run to a cliff and watch from above i spotted they are 3 bad guys hitting my house, trying to destroy everything i have built. So i decided to go and kill them. I was crafting a lot for base so i didn't really have any gear, just weapon and high-heel woman boots (that's all i found till then). With all my fear and rage i took in a hand torch to see where is my closest enemy then i switch to melee weapon and kill him, then i took another zombie out, and on last one i remembered that i have campfire next to my base i run to fill it with planks so there's some light,then i finished him off and music turned back to chill. Loot from them was full garbage. Also it is not cool that you don't see health of your base structure items like: walls, doors, building base etc, unless you hold in your hand building hammer. So after the raid you go with it and look on every wall with hamer to see if something needs repair. I think it would be much cooler if you could see HP of wall etc just pointing with your crosshair at it. As soon as you understand how underwater looting works you can pretty fast grind for your first boat or catamaran both of which don't need any gas or fuel. So you can swim around faster to new locations and loot there underwater. Building feels easy but sometimes you have no idea where to farm some of the items, but if you keep exploring and looting eventually you can find it. \nUnderwater experience and looting feels amazing, combined with the ingame music. It feels pretty real and ofcourse you need to follow how much oxygen you have left before you swim up to breathe. Expect that you can stuck in the buildings windows underwater and never get free and die when your oxygen is out. \n\nCompared to other surival games it feels more dynamic as there is not so much hard grind, easier to farm for specific items, easier to build, therefor you can faster start searching for your enemy and start a fights. Not so much thinking about eating and drinking. +there are a lot of items (bottle to drink) to buff yourself like swim longer underwater for a period of time, and also slots for items that buff your character like foot flippers to add permanent speed under water and other similar items.\n\nIt still feels a little empty not finished game, but i am sure if you have some friends who can play together for 3-5 hours you can get much fun playing it together co-op vs AI or just against each other.\n\nToo bad price somehow went from 15$ to 20$ in just a few weeks. I mean if your game is at the top in allkeyshop and probably in many other places it's not cool to use it to raise the price. Maybe i got it with steam discount no idea, but in history it shows a purchase for 15$", "timestamp_created": 1694892116, "timestamp_updated": 1695488862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738702118396759033", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147950163": {"recommendationid": "147950163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027907549", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1231, "last_played": 1708975008}, "language": "english", "review": "Similar to the movie Waterworld, you are a kind of Kevin Costner doing various Costner stuff, swimming underwater in cities ruins, looting, building and everything Kevin Costner did in the movie.\n\nPro: Be a Kevin Costner\n\nCon: No Kevin Costner", "timestamp_created": 1696894328, "timestamp_updated": 1696894328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735237419605255127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145027294": {"recommendationid": "145027294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067679758", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1698619911}, "language": "english", "review": "5 Minutes into my first time playing a random man called Shaneeqa joined the game and was the chillest guy ever.

Its your boy TacticoolFriedRice. I have spent an incredible amount of hours in: 7 days to die, Project Zomboid, Rust, Raft, DayZ, any other survival type games\n\nGame Comparison:\n- Raft without the \"raft\"\n- Rust\n\nGames percent finish at this point\n- 50% with a fun to explore type of map. 4 Different research tiers. Hidden Blueprints. More content to come on their roadmap such as a lore and story, new tiers, new boats, new equipments.\n\nReplayability\n- Only has some replayability if you play multiplayer with either coop or PvP. But PvP can have some janks here and there that may not make it not so fun to play.\n\nMoneys Worth\n- The fact that this game costs 20 dollars kinda put most other games that are over 30 dollars in the gutter. 20 dollars is the perfect amount for the game in the current stage.\n\nThe Good\n- There are 4 tiers of research that you will have to go through to progress through the game\n- There are also hidden blueprints that cannot be research and only found in safes of POIs (Point of interest). Some of these blueprints can be fun to use, craft, or build\n- Some decent amount of survival aspect staying true to hunger, thirst, and temperature \n- Multiple workbenches and stations to work with in order to increase progression\n- Sea vehicles and accessories that allows you to traverse the waters faster\n- Enemy raids on your base that needs to be repelled\n- Enemy outpost that you need to raid in order to obtain necessary resources and blueprints\n- Some underwater threats that aren't so terrifying unfortunately\n- Decent gunplay, but large amount of limitations that can make the experience not so fun (More later on this)\n- Decent amount of mechanics that followed from raft\n- An actual headshot system that actually KO your enemies unless they're wearing helmet\n- Has potential to provide PvP content similar to Rust, yet also provides PvE content for players who prefer Co-op\n\nThe Bugs and Bad\n- Aside from unlocking Tier 4 in the research bench, it wasn't really worth unlocking any of the tech from tier 4. This could be different if it was for PvP however\n- Temperature is a bit too simple.  You only really get cold at night.  And I would love to see a sickness system from being too cold or too hot, or just contracting some unknown entity within the deep waters\n- Although enemy raids are cool, I hope that enemy AI is improved and that they can attack from sea vehicles instead of just swimming towards the base and screaming the same scream that annoys the crap out of me.\n- Gunplay has downsides with attachments. When you add a red dot, you still see the aim dot on top of the red dot.  Some guns with ironsight actually covers the aim dot which confuses me where to shoot\n- Although the game borrows some mechanics from raft, I am still not really a fan of adding materials one at a time (grill and forge) Although this can easily be manageable at night.\n- Sleeping at night can screw over your sleep schedule to the point that sometimes you can sleep through most of the day. \n- You can turn your early sailboat into a railgun by looking down and push.  This can be done with other people to increase the speed exponentially\n- Some workbenches/workstations can overlap each other which can overlap the GUI. One example is that I am trying to grill food but drank from my water filter instead.\n- From a singleplayer experience, the game was fun but short lived. I was able to just progress through the game fairly easily and I hope more content would actually slap in more playtime instead of focusing too much on gatekeeping content to slowdown gameplay\n- Its hilarious how a melee raider/mutant slowly waddles towards you, and then you have gunners who will instantly laser your head.  There are points where enemy AIs will glitch through obstacle and blast you through those obstacle\n\nFuture Potential\n- The game is still in early access so the potential is still there. The game provides surprisingly smooth gameplay in most cases. The devs has provided a large roadmap.  The Future looks good but it will still take time to let the game to continue baking in the oven.  Devs are currently listening to feedback within steam forums and their own discord.

Don't listen to the haters. There is such a plethora of entitlement in today's youth and it resonates wildly in some of the disgusting, thoughtless, and, frankly, disrespectful feedback. Remember that the world's finest critics are often the least capable of producing anything noteworthy. \n\nI find this game to be outstanding. I suppose I am an \"old timer\" who enjoys games similar to Stranded Deep. What I wished that that game had, has been imaginatively crafted into Sunkenland. The soundtrack is meditative and relaxing; a perfect complement to the time spent scavenging, building, and surviving. The developer's thoughtfulness is present throughout, from the excellent mechanics of collecting materials on land and underwater, to the satisfying sounds of chopping down trees and adding planks to the fire. The underwater world is mesmerizing; it resonates with a nostalgia for the world that once was. The neon signs and rubber ducks are a fun touch. I felt an immense sense of joy and satisfaction in the little time I played this game so far. I don't often feel that way about games. Sunkenland is right up there with some of the great games I have played. I am looking forward to exploring the landscape.\n\nSure, just like in any early access development, there are likely improvements that could be done, but I have yet to find something that stands out as \"unplayable\". Given the things to come (shown just before the splash screen), I can only imagine this game will continue to impress. Many kudos to the developer for this top-notch work. \n\nTo the folks out there who feel they have a right to be crass - if you think you can do better, do better. First, show some respect. Game development is an incredibly tedious and difficult process. Remember that you are paying a mere few dollars for something another human being has put countless hours into. \n\nUPDATE: I have over 7 hours into this game and it continues to get better. The level of detail is incredible for an early release. I have yet to explore the enemy islands. The gameplay truly requires some serious scaffolding to get to \"level-up\" (e.g. learning recipes and upgrading the research table). The mechanics and building are very well balanced. Given its current state, I would be more than happy with this game as the final product. This is easily among my favorite games I have played. Bravo!\n\nTo the developer, you are amazing.

I'll tell you what I told them, it's basically Raft on Crack without the annoying voyage and shark constantly destroying your ship. \n\nAs far as Early Access games go this has a lot of potential to expand on, people have already made mods to help smooth over some of the edges that currently exist. I really think the Devs should add some of them to the game. Like 3rd person views, better utility, increased stack sizes, no building restrictions after clearing, key modifier to quick drop items, and a few minor things to really get this game at a place where I could say I could spend 100+ hours on it.\n\nHaven't gotten super far into the game yet but I can see where it's going.

Rip base number 3 :o(\n\nI'm hesitant to not recommend this game because I really am enjoying it; but one major bug that is ruining it is when I save and exit and reload my save, my base along with some things in it are completely missing/gone. I thought maybe I'd selected a different region and that was why it happened, so I rebuilt and unfortunately it happened again after saving, quitting and relaunching. This game has great potential, I am really enjoying so far (keeping in mind it is early access and brand new); It's just unplayable when you lose all progress each time you open the game. big sad", "timestamp_created": 1693123386, "timestamp_updated": 1693524451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691019356250762939", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156468134": {"recommendationid": "156468134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015266968", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2765, "last_played": 1708523326}, "language": "english", "review": "The latest updates has not changed the outlook of this grind fest.\n\nThis game is an example of why getting hyped for early access is dangerous.", "timestamp_created": 1705845638, "timestamp_updated": 1708522174, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.68933403491973877", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146233429": {"recommendationid": "146233429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083453513", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1712603924}, "language": "english", "review": "The game seems like it could be fun.................However, until they fix All Your Loot Disappearing when you save game, you are stuck with NEVER turning the game off or LOSING ALL PROGRESS.

So At this point I must say, that they have a game that could be something reminiscent to Fallout 3 on the ocean. If they add lore and communicating NPC'S that talk, (Have Dialogue) you start finding it being more. Also, If they create factions that are not automatically hostile, that could create tons more content and play time.

Content is a little lacking and most outposts despite differences you start to notice are the same.  \n\nNpc's can be formidable and sometimes land some crazy shots on you, shooting can literal hit and miss.  I feel that some of the guns need work in the way they shoot or recoil and hit shots.  Graphics are typical unity engine stuff, with the game looking very much like Rust.\n\nLoot system is quite decent, you seem to find what you need eventually without much effort.  The crafting system I like as its simple to understand and learn as is the user interface for this.  Inventory system is quite nice, could do with a little polishing but its fine to interact with.\n\nBase building and snapping of some items needs work.  There is so much scope for the possibilities of what could be achieved with this with patches and of course community input for what is desired/needed.\n\nMap feels on the small side once you get to the faster transport vehicles.  You find yourself quickly destroying enemies at outposts and doing super quick loot runs.\nMore references to the movie waterworld would be nice lol.\n\nOf course I have plenty of gripes with the game but so far so good, the biggest one for me was the ability for individuals to randomly enter your game world despite passwords, kicking them works fine though.  I have experienced some issues with ingame storage but I'm confident bugs and glitches like this will be addressed by the game devs.  \nI do feel that some things could be done now quickly to make the game better, dedicated servers would be a big one and maybe adding pvp as an option.  \nWell I look forward to seeing what content will be added in the future and how the game will progress.  It certainly feels worthy of its current price tag and to spend time on and importantly the devs seem very active in developing the game in to something great.", "timestamp_created": 1694797751, "timestamp_updated": 1694797751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685213327407836914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147739672": {"recommendationid": "147739672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039943988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1696598771}, "language": "english", "review": "In it's current state I can't recommend this game.

It needs a lot of small tweaks and the multiplayer sometimes doesn't let people in your server but That said-\n\n- its a lovely looking game, especially underwater\n- the music is really good and makes you want to keep scavenging all day\n- there are some really interesting things they have done with items that help separate this game from raft\n- The Raids and factions are fun and a great start for something they can develop\n- Sounds can be janky but some they have done great such as gun play, it feels great as well.\n- Its harsh enough to feel like your fighting for your life at first but to me it just made me want to overcome the sharks/factions/hunger......oh god hunger.... \n- looting and mining are fun and loot is diverse, especially fashion!\n\nAll in all, well worth the price. A great game to play now and invest in for the future.

I am looking forward to the complete release. Couple to things that could make it better, more water creatures. The water feels too safe, It feels too easy to scavenge under water, so far I've only seen sharks. I feel the npc's needs to be worked on. Their AI are not that good, when I invaded their island they don't attack unless I am really close to them. Another thing that would have been great would have been a generated map, but it's probably too late to do that now.  I forgot to mention day time needs to be longer, I could hardly do anything before its night. If possible it would be cool to implement a scale where players can set how long they want  day and night to be when they create a world.\n\nAnyways thank you for making this game, I really enjoyed it and I am look forward to continue playing.", "timestamp_created": 1700245447, "timestamp_updated": 1700245692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633200764656066895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156232392": {"recommendationid": "156232392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198813544562", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 3321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 418, "last_played": 1708291585}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Raft with enemies, which makes it cool.
