The combat seems somewhat fresh for the type of game that it is, the character progression feels real and interesting as well. The passive abilities leave much to be desired, but I understood what type of combat this game inspired, which would make activated abilities much harder to implement. I got that. The atmosphere, music, theme, character design and armor/weapons all look great. The engine is a bit wonky, but I've dealt with worse before. It is playable in that department. I will not critique its technical limitations.\n\nThen comes PvP. This game throws you into it, and while that is not a problem, the entire point of this game is PvP. This means that any living person of another faction that you find is going to kill you, and likely chase you very far to get you (they barely have to if they just have a bow). Again, this is not in and of itself, by itself, an issue. It is the fact though that anyone who you run into, is typically level 100. This completely outclasses you. Okay. Fine. That's expected. Oh they looted my corpse. That's fine too. My gear is replacable, in fact, I like that aspect of the game. Gives weight to decisions and combat. I just need to get higher level, practice a bit more, and I'll then feel more impactful.\n\nNah.\nOnce I started to get into the level 70s, I was beginning to wonder when my damage would ever change numbers. I had seemginly, despite leveling and even using better weapons, not really doing the types of damage that is required to even kill anyone let alone actively PVP or participate in a meaningful way. An enemy approaches you, and typically finishes you in a couple swipes. Literally, everyone will be doing at least 200 to 300 damage per hit, and you are basically rarely ever 1v1ing anyone in this game. So you stand a literal, no chance. You see, this is fine. It raises concerns about what the end game really is about (which I suspect is just a gear race and grinding money to either buy or craft superior equipment) however. And considering that gear is actually difficult and annoying to obtain, the fact that it gets looted whenever you die in PvP is actually where this becomes slightly more aggrivating. You see, because gear and valuables are painful and boring and actually highly costly - people aren't really willing to actually \"PvP.\" At any sign of trouble (their zerg is bigger than your zerg), people immediately hit their ESC button and tap the \"Unstuck to Capital\" button. This game's version of the Hearthstone in order to get you out of a sticky situation as long as you have the time. So what does this ever actually boil down to? Not that much PvP at all. You're mostly just (like with a lot of these siege oriented PvP games) trading castles and keeps and outposts. Defend? Why risk losing and losing costly gear? Just wait until they go away to take it back. What are they going to do? Take it back only for us to just take it back? A contested castle can switch hands at least a dozen times in a night, and at some point you're left wondering \"Why am I doing this?\"\n\nOkay fine. I put my hands up. I said, look. I'm giving this game a try. It has a lot of elements that I enjoy, and I think that if I finally hit level 100 and begin digging into the gear and loot system things might start making sense. What do I do to level? Well don't believe what people tell you in chat. Arenas? I can't even seem to get them to pop a queue. Tourny? That happens a whopping 3 times a night, with a non-Loot siege afterwards which seems to be the most enjoyable thing in the game despite people rarely even succeeding the sieges. Capturing outposts and PvPing? Ehh. That *can* be good in theory, but you typically need a group and people that won't just tuck and run at the first sign of trouble. When you go on a tear through enemy land, there's really not a whole lot to go through and capture for even remotely reliable leveling. So what's left? Blue events on the map. Blue circles on the map appear that are akin to Public Quests from Warhammer Online. You get participation trophies for killing and contributing. However, nobody is ever doing these things - so you're left to your own devices. Great. This works for quite some time until I begin reaching the 60 - 70 range. Now the blue quests are getting methodically longer to reach my xp mark for the next level. Now I should go look into doing more difficult areas closer to more hotly contested pvp areas. Sounds fun actually. I trek my way over there, and begin fighting mobs. These blue circle events seem to have a different mechanic where npcs like to start swarming in from essentially a nether void. Because my gear and weapons are utter shit, fighting them is a nightmare, and having any more than one on you is just asking for death. To make matters worse, these things are typically located on mountain sides and the NPCs you're fighting are glitching and hovering through the ground and sliding towards you with entirely inconsistent movement. You work your way up to the final mob of the event, and he's surrounded by about 4 different guards. You manage to kill all of them miraculously and tediously by not aggroing all of them at the same time, and then you go up against the \"Chieftan\" to finish the quest. He blocks 3 out of 4 attacks, drains your stamina down, attacks and interrupts your attacks faster than you can even swing, and deals about 300 to 400 damage with medium/heavy armor that you'd find from just leveling (even if your guild is willing to give you good gear, have fun managing to keep your hands on it if you plan on doing any pvp).\n\nThis game is just quite frankly an unfinished mess, that solves none of the issues that these type of siege oriented pvp games have always had in the past. Nobody cares about defending anything, everyone will port out before you even realize what is happening and abandoning a castle to the enemies, and attacking keeps usually just consists of you and a zerg bashing a door down and killing some NPCs. Only to wake up the next day with the enemy having done the same thing. There's no point. Nobody is actually interested in pvping, and the gear grind is so real that dying is truly annoying especially since your entire power in the game is derived from your gear.\n\nJust avoid.

They set out to make that experience a reality and I have to give credit to the devs for trying.\n\nSome aspects of Gloria Victis are thoughtful and enjoyable, it's particularly interesting to see when and where a dev clearly took extra time and care when implementing certain features. I was excited to discover I could get worms and beetles from harvesting crops and that I could use them as bait to go catch different kinds of fish. Pretty thoughtful right? How about when it's raining I don't have to water crops or worry about them drying out? Seems like the right thought process, seems like someone understands the genre and with this intuition about the people behind the game I decided to bite. I bought the game for my family, loaded up on the in-game currency, and got ready to bring my crew into the game in style. I was excited for defending castles against other real players, I was excited to enjoy and explore a seemingly open and unique world. I was hopeful and ready to immerse myself in a world devoid of magic and the usual cookie cutter RPG clutter. I wanted to be the peasant that later becomes a worthy opponent and valuable ally in a medieval universe.\n\nThen slowly came the realization that this game isn't for the players, it's for the devs. While there are certainly many behaviors in multiplayer games that the world would be better without, there is lurking behind the scenes a group of devs that treat this game like a sandbox for themselves to enjoy and dictate. I won't be shy to say that some of the passive aggressive behavior from the devs is actually more toxic than some of the worst players I've come across in any given multiplayer game. Someone can give you a hard time after beating you up in an in-game battle, but these devs will not only rip the game from your hands, they'll go out of their way to make you a liability to even speak to, even in other discord servers the devs don't own. I was cautioned by other vet players to not mention that I had been in the same channel as another previously banned player...on a separate discord server, in someone else's social space. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, the members of the discord server were afraid of having the devs take actions against THEM for even speaking with a banned player. I was new, I had no hand in any of the drama you can read about in other reviews but I can assure you, if you invest your time and build relationships in this game, it is subject to the devs leveraging it to dictate your life outside the game. That's not behavior I would like to support and for that and many other reasons I would recommend avoiding this game. Perhaps a more level headed and more competent group of developers can better represent the genre in the future, until then, this is not the game or social space for those looking for an open world medieval pvp experience.\n\nAll the social drama and developer's toxic behavior aside, the game engine itself is built on an old version of Unity. Like a castle built on sand, I don't see this game lasting long or ever living up to what it describes on it's store page. The gameplay is clunky and sluggish, the graphics are a little better than the original EverQuest and the combat is a battle of who can out glitch another player's glitch. The animations are inaccurate and show you one thing while something entirely different is happening in the code. I was taught by vets to ignore the animations and look for certain glitches, and to use those glitches to compete. This almost sounds like cheating and exploits right? Except these are all things the devs know, the devs use, and the devs ignore or call features....except when they don't like you.\n\nFor example, if I go die on a patch of my crops, the enemy can't loot me because their interact button would be to destroy my crops and not to loot my corpse. If my enemy is behind a tree or poll, I need to use a particular swing to attack THROUGH it. If I want to kill something without risking being hit, I can stand on certain hills at just the right height so all their attacks go through me and all my attacks hit. Swinging through walls or hiding behind invisible hitboxes that are throughout the map and part of nearly every collidable object is the normal and everyday experience in Gloria Victis. Want to hit that guy on the catapult that's about to throw a rock at your face? Too bad, you can see them, they're close enough you could even spit on them if it were real, but the hitbox is literally a giant rectangle around the entire model, they know this and will \"hide\" behind it, and that's normal here. The incompleteness and bugs in this game are toted as features or even praised as something charming to be embraced, as mentioned by a dev themself when saying to \"embrace the clunk.\"\n\nI gave this game and it's devs the benefit of every doubt, I trained, I learned, I gave this game time and plugged into the community. I participated in battles and sieges, I crafted, farmed, mined, and fished. I gave honest feedback, even spoke with a staff member for over an hour to share my experience and better understand the state of the game and where the devs were coming from. (You know who you are and I thank you for your time and wish you the best)\n\nIn the end it's a marathon of mundane grinding, typical one-sided faction warfare (most people join or switch to the winning nation), and an endless study of how to exploit an old and busted game engine while balancing your favor with the devs.\n\n0 out of 10 and I regret every penny spent.", "timestamp_created": 1646230872, "timestamp_updated": 1646230872, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 174, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.8858489990234375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1646736623, "developer_response": "Hello!\n\nI'm sorry that our project did not appeal to you, and I'm also sad to see that sometimes something could lead to negative experiences.

We appreciate your perspective on the game and understand your concerns regarding armor and weapon damage in PvP. However, we would like to clarify a few points to provide a more accurate representation of the game's mechanics.\n\nFirstly, it is important to note that it is impossible to one-shot a player in Gloria Victis. The game is designed to prioritize skill-based combat and strategic gameplay rather than relying solely on gear levels. While higher-tier players may have advantages in terms of gear, a skilled player with lower-tier equipment can still compete effectively and have a fair chance in PvP encounters.\n\nGloria Victis aims to create a balanced environment where players can rely on their personal abilities and tactical decisions to overcome challenges. The game emphasizes the importance of skill, timing, and teamwork in combat rather than solely focusing on gear progression. This approach ensures that even newer, yet skillful players, can contribute and enjoy the PvP aspects of the game without feeling overwhelmed by veteran players' gear.\n\nWhile gear does provide some advantages, it is not the sole determining factor in the outcome of PvP battles. Skilled players can utilize various tactics, such as positioning, timing, and coordination with teammates, to outmaneuver opponents and overcome any gear discrepancies. Please take a look at one of the videos of our Community members that shows his combat skills during his journey to achieving the max level in the game, take note how his combat skills enable him to kill even a better geared player: https://youtu.be/Zp8fIQ516dM?t=173\n\nWe understand that you may have experienced situations where higher-tier players seemed overwhelmingly powerful. However, we encourage you to keep exploring the game, improve your skills, and seek out opportunities for strategic cooperation with other players. By doing so, you can gradually bridge the gap between gear levels and find yourself on equal footing with more experienced players. I strongly encourage you to check out a selection of the combat tutorials created by our Community:\nhttps://youtu.be/FOsaO3FtKC0?t=378 In the video above in 6:17 you can see how a player deals more damage with a low-tier hammer than a high-tier sword due to using a proper weapon type for the enemy's armor type.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiLcdWPLrAU\n\nThank you once again for sharing your thoughts, and we hope this information clarifies the game's mechanics for you. We invite you to give Gloria Victis another chance, and reconsider whether it deserves a negative review. \n\nBest regards,\nJesper, Community Manager"}, "23546867": {"recommendationid": "23546867", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970647506", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2000, "last_played": 1473869010}, "language": "english", "review": "A group of 10 of us left our homeland at night and ventured into the unknown wilderness.

They're all most often available at the market for a fair price.\n\n[Guilds]\nThis game is best played when in pack. Bring your friends in! At the beggining of the game you pick a nation, which are always your allies, but you're free to create/join a guild and stick with them. Guilds earn points, upgrade their technology for bonuses and compete in seasonal rankings. They will (soon) (again) be able to freely build their own castle from the ground up.\n\n[Territory Control]\nAll locations on the map, except the capitals and their bridgehead forts, can be captured. From there they can be upgraded, upkept, and exploited for resources, as friendly NPCs appear to serve your needs regarding gear repair, item trade and recipe learning. This turns the open world into a persistent game of conquest.\n\nGuild controlled Castles are soon coming (back) to the game in form of islands.

I understand it's an early access game, but seeing the way it's being developed leaves me questioning the future of it. The game has sold ~400k(?) copies but only 500 people play it at a time. It's pretty clear that new players don't stay in the game, while the veteran community stays active. Looking at steam charts the average amount of players hasn't really changed since launch in 2016. \n\nI see three possible reasons behind this:\n\n\n[b]1. Too heavy focus on developing end-game.[/b]\n\nI'm happy to see a small team of developers with a project of this scale actively ask the community for feedback and implement their ideas in the game, but with a small community mostly consisting of veteran players, it means that the focus in development remains too heavily in the end-game, only keeping the regulars/veteran players happy. \n\nThen let's look at the first impressions the new player gets. The early game is a quest line that repeats the same 7 quest objectives over and over again. Talk to someone, kill bandits, burn tents, steal supplies, gather resources, hunt animals, kill boss. Brain dead enough to turn away new players, but luckily this only lasts until you're level 50-60 which is fast to reach. \n\nI don't know if it's a good thing to have the game start with a quest line that ends at level 50-60 leaving the player mostly confused of what to do next. You can participate in the world events as long as you match the level criteria, but the game doesn't really inform the player about events/activities they unlock, most likely while they're still on that first quest line.\n\n\n[b]2. Not enough information about the game/in-game guidance available for new players. [/b]\n\nWiki seems empty and outdated, in-game guides are lacking or easy to miss. There is a help chat where you can ask other players for help, but relying mostly on other players for information about everything is not the way to go. Encouraging teamwork and communication is not a bad thing at all, but leaving this much responsibility to the veteran players simply doesn't work. You can't really expect new players to integrate and become socially active in the community right away.  This will leave a lot of new players clueless and make it harder for them to get access events and other content in the game, possibly turning them away.\n\nI also want to mention that the veteran players have formed their own protocol of communications, using acronyms etc. for communicating. Calling people in to an event with a message that everyone can see but only some can understand is a big middle finger in the new players face.\n\n\n[b]3. Unbalanced economy.[/b]\n\nAsking people around how to make money in the game mostly leads to answers like \"mine some coal\" or \"farm some herbs\". Coal can be mined idle/AFK from a vein that'll last for good 40 minutes or so, but does this, or farming crops let you enjoy the game? No, in these amounts it definitely doesn't. As I stated before, in-game guidance is lacking and it leaves a lot of new players clueless of the game mechanics. If the only easily accessible options for gearing up is to do boring stuff for excessive amounts of time, it's no wonder new players won't stick to the game. \n\nThere are some PvE events that offer a mediocre amount of money/loot in the game, but they can be activated only every 1-2 hours or so with a cool down and there can be only one instance going on at the same time. You might not even get any kind of a notification of them starting and even if you do, some of them have 5-6 players limit and you won't make it in. Some of these have to be activated in the open world and are practically impossible to solo for new players, if they can even find them. Finding a group to run them with proves to be quite hard too.\n\nI think this could be fixed by increasing rewards from participating in events or making NPCs drop more loot, even at lower levels. This way even the new players could have fun and make progress in the game at the same time.

You can buy everything that you see in the cash shop by using non-premium currency, which is gold coins, and Contribution Points. Players are \u201cselling\u201d their ambers.

These points players are receiving by taking part in events, during location sieges. They are easy to obtain and you can collect a lot of these points in a short period of time if you are an active player. By using these points, you can't buy skins but you can buy many other things, such as attributes and skill resets, many cards with experience boosts, nation change, character's name change, guild name change, and so on.\n\nWe are trying to create a fair environment where players can get a lot of things without paying with their real money and to be honest, I don't any other game that is allowing players to buy skins by using nonpremium in-game currency.\n\nI hope you will rethink if our game really deserves a negative review.

That's EIGHT. YEARS.[/h1]\n\nAt some point you just have to accept that as a developer you are using the EA system to mask your inability to produce what you've promised. If you need 8 years to produce an MMO then by the time your game releases it'll no longer be able to reach its full potential with modern systems and be completely irrelevant due to the progress in the market. I bought this game 4 years ago and the situation was dire. The quests were as bare-bones as barbecue grilled ribs after I got 3 minutes alone with them. I come back after 4 years to see what's improved and, admittedly, they've added some nice touches like accurate and polished shadows and footsteps left on the soil textures. But the quests have not changed. Go to person A, kill X amount of Y, go back to person A, get reward and be directed to person B, collect X amount of Y, and so on. It's dreadful, it's boring and it's the least engaging content I've ever had the displeasure of turning my nose up to. Not just that, the game is filled to the brim with bugs. I just gave up after I was unable to collect 5 mushrooms because the \"gather\" prompt simply does not appear. I was told by the only helpful person still playing this game that the latest update caused a bunch of new bugs and a few systems no longer functioned as intended.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\n\nThere is no sense of direction, there's no story, there's no plot, you just are. You materialise in this massive and empty hub that's supposed to serve as your starting town, essentially your tutorial area. It's completely forgettable yet far too overwhelming. It's huge but most of the space used ultimately serves no purpose. There's a big yellow marker telling you who to talk to and that person will tell you there's something happening and something's under attack and you have to go help. Then it tells you how to do that but it never tells you [i] why [/i]. I'm doing things for the sake of doing things but there's never any purpose to do doing so. I get that this is the way it is because the developers are relying on the other players to provide the content, because there's such a large emphasis on PvP. But when your community is as toxic as it is, and your new player experience is as uninviting as it is, how are you reasonably expecting more new players to join to keep that content going? This game will be as dead as Mortal Online 1, and most likely Mortal Online 2 will die before this game does, but eventually this game's community will consist only of the sunken-cost cultists that will remain only because they've convinced themselves that this game is perfect because they keep investing more time into this game and more money into the premium cash shop.\n\nThat's another thing; The game has a premium cash shop while it's still in EA. Early Access is supposed to be a small phase in a game's lifespan that allows the community to experience the game and help the developers by finding inconsistencies and bugs and suggest improvements. When you're in EA for 8 years and you introduce a premium cash shop there is no excuse, you are by definition a released game. You are monetising your game rather than improving it, polishing its systems and perfecting its mechanics. It conveys that you're either confident enough in your product that it can be judged like any released game or that you've simply stopped caring and want to turn a quick buck for your time. If it was the prior it wouldn't still be in EA.\n\n[b] Verdict. [/b]\n\nGloria Victis is a game with a lot of beauty, a lot of potential and a lot of ambition, but neither the budget, the team nor the competence to make it happen. I [i]love[/i] this game on paper. I just love thinking about it. I love going to bed and thinking; \"Wouldn't it be cool if there was a game where...\" and then I'd go on to describe something like Gloria Victis. But what we have in practise is completely alien to this image of an excellent experience. I praise the developers for trying. It's a lot of work to get started with a project, and it takes even more effort to continue to work on a project. But Black Eye Games is a team of 30 people sinking their teeth into a project with a scope far larger than they could ever reasonably hope to chew. They should've started off aiming lower. They should've made something smaller and made it really good, then they would've not only had a lot more experience but they would've been able to take that product into their portfolio and shown it to publishers or investors and say \"this is what we're capable of, fund us.\" They could've then progressed to take on a project with a scale as large as an MMO. Gloria Victis is a lot of dreams, a lot of cool ideas and undoubtedly a lot of love and passion, lost in development hell.\n\nhttps://steamcharts.com/app/327070\n\nIf I've just saved you \u00a314.99 may I suggest you get yourself a nice, warm takeout and share it with your dog while you tell it fairy-tales of knights, medieval political intrigue and warring factions.

Sadly i can't recommend this game, and here's why:\n\n1. Updates \nI've been playing for almost a year (since Nov 21) and since then we've got a regular weekly updates for the game. That's actually a great sign that the devs care about their game, but it's not that simple. Since that time the game received almost zero really usefull updates, which impacted the game in a positive way, the only being the archer nerf and maybe the map ui rework, which was actually not really needed. All other updates were either a small ones or were negative. This, of course, is my subjective perspective, but i can't mention that i'm satisfied with the direction where the game goes.\n\n2. Combat\nThe combat is not \"Skill based\", despite the devs saying otherwise. You can learn the combat in under 2 weeks and be better than 95% players. Skill ceiling is pretty low, the only \"advanced\" mechanic being chamber, which gives you 0 advantage against good player. \n\nWhat will take much more time to learn is how to counter people who abuse bugs (for example clipping and teleportation bug), which are not getting fixed for years. Those players are not being punished, taking top 1-2 of arena standings every season, so be free to abuse them as well, as they are incredibly powerfull and you will most likely lose without using said bugs.\n\nAnother thing is a keybind input delay. Some guy who thinks he is an expert in all areas suggested to add the artificial 50ms delay to the keybinds, and surprisingly devs listened to this b4llsh1t. There are many more better solutions to the problem of inequality of keybinds and mouse-based blocks/attack directional combat. Who would have thought that adding an artificial delay to the fighting game is a good idea, while every other game is trying to reduce the lag between physical input and game response? Gloaria devs. What makes it even more hilarious is the fact that they keep listening to him despite receiving a negative feedback from the community.\nThe combat needs a complete overhaul and i fear it won't be changed for a long time.\n\nCombat UI is misleading as well, as it may show you that you are charging a yellow attack (50% dmg) and instead dealing full-power red attack. Several months before it was even worse, but i wont go into much detail.\n\n3. Open world is dead.\nThe game has an average online of 300 people, who come mostly in the evening. And even then it's hard to find people because there is nothing to do in open world. The only people here are the people who look for PvP, and the encounters are extremely rare. And the devs are killing it even more, by making the damaged items unsellable except one day in a week, which makes the looting almost pointless.\n\n4. Client is not optimised.\nEvery menu option opens with a very noticable delay, especially the inventory menu, extremely annoying when you are trying to loot someone and then you must wait for 1.5 seconds before you can actually start looting, and the looting process is time-restricted too ;) .\n\nWhile having a large fights (50 people for example) expect a huge fps drops, no matter what specs you have. Even at all \"low\" settings it's not possible to have good fps in a large fight. It got better with the engine upgrade but not much.\n\n5. Servers\nServers are not optimized as well, having 100-150 people at the siege will make the server lag a lot. Makes the game literally unplayable. I can understand that so many people are causing a huge load on the sever, but it makes you question the game design. Kinda negates my point about the low online numbers, because larger numbers of players could not have been handled by the server.\n\n6. Worst Community manager i've ever seen. Being widely criticized for his biased views and some unjustified bans he is still \"managing\" the community. There are lots of examples of his actions which were reported to the lead developer and company lead (same person), but no actions were taken to replace him. Looks like he suits them well, but i really haven't seen a single player who would have not ironically said that he does his job right.\n\n7. Basic features.\nSome basic features are just not there, for example the long asked Guild Banks or even \"Logout to character screen\" button. No party size number in the group UI. And many other things. For a game which is being in development for over 5 years these are must-haves, but somehow they just don't exist in the To-Do list of the devs.\n\nTl;dr: Gloria Bugtis 4.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1629228447, "timestamp_updated": 1629228447, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 152, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835361182689666748", "comment_count": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1629288990, "developer_response": "Hello, sir, and thank you for taking the time to share your opinion.\n\nWe are grateful to receive such feedback because thanks to that we can make the game even better.\n\nPlease allow me to address some of the points from your review. \n\nSpeaking about updates, I am happy that you mentioned that it is visible we care about the game and community. We are one of the smallest independent teams that challenge themselves to create an MMORPG, and your words are encouraging us to work harder.\n\nIn last year, counting from November 20, when you started playing, we introduced a lot of interesting updates. For example, the Bastion system, which helped to stabilize the game economy and become a new goal for players to fight for. We improved the resource gathering systems and reworked the game economy.\n\nWe overhauled the Freebuilding system, addressing all found and reported issues and bugs, and extending the system greatly. We upgraded the game engine and ensured better performance, with countless optimization updates.\n\nWe are now working on the full rework of the user interface, and I am happy to see you like the new map. I hope the Party Finder system was also welcomed by you.\n\nI am aware, that some balance changes could not be fully embraced by the community, and it is easier to focus on any potential negative aspects. But I just want to encourage you to have a bigger picture of the whole process of the game development, and I hope you will see a lot of nice things that you like in the game.\n\nRegarding combat, especially the interface, it is good, that you see improvement while looking at the past. Our combat designers are working hard on that. \n\nIf you have any pieces of evidence on players who may abuse any possible bugs, please send them to us. Developers are playing the game on daily basis, but it is sometimes not easy to see the problem when you are playing the game for such a long time. Your help and reporting any issues would be much appreciated, and I know developers will do their best to address pointed issues.\n\nJust right now part of the team is working on expanding the world and filling it with new things, quests, challenges, and battle opportunities. New systems of Character development that should be introduced later this month will encourage players to roam more around the map and bring more features of the game - like gathering or exploration - more rewarding. \n\nOptimization of the client is something that is worked on constantly. I am happy that you mentioned the delay in opening some windows for the first time in the game - this is a problem that will be resolved with ongoing User Interface rework. \n\nRegarding basic features, I had the pleasure to already forecast the upcoming \"log out to the character screen\" option. It is already being tested on global servers by team members, so you can expect it soon!\n\nI am thankful for your feedback, and I hope with the information I provided above, you will give the project a second chance and give the game thumb up since I believe it is still giving you a lot of fun.\n\nHave a good day!"}, "43406961": {"recommendationid": "43406961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009228194", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1567, "last_played": 1558066837}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to like this game.

Even loosing in some of the field skirmish was still fun.\n\nI jumped in and really like the game.  Did a stream and gave away a copy as well as a random giveaway along with getting a few members from our gaming community in on the game as well.\n\nThe problem though is the player base, or rather a small portion of the community.  There a is a group of known hackers / cheaters that jump from server to server (cool feature but never ends well) that can teleport (speed hack) and infinite headshot / backstab through any object (because we all know that archers can snipe you through a castle wall in the head with your shield raised).  They will call you trash when they kill you in global or female genetalie when you dont defend yourself.  I asked in nation chat why we dont do anything and their response was \"Known group of cheaters, you cant win and they will just take your mainhand gear.  Best to ignore and server hop until they get bored.  We'll reclaim the areas when they have moved along\".\n\nWait what?  Known hackers allowed to just roam freely and the community has responded by just ignoring a swath of the game because there isnt anything you can do about it?  Surely the devs are doing something about this?\n\nDecided to take a gander at some player numbers (thanks steam api).  Prior to the 4 logging in server pop was at 173.  They started their rampage and pop drops to 91.  Maybe they are directly related, maybe they arent but when your averaging 109 players and your peaking at 206 and 57% of the pop logs because of 4 players, MAYBE its time to clean up your player base.\n\nHopefully they do something about this, but for now I think this has cost them 7 players.

I've put over 1,700 hours into this game. I used to love this game, but now I'm now writing this to shed light on why I lost my love for Gloria Victis, I'll try to be unbiased as possible but these are my personal experiences I've dealt with in this game (good and bad) over the last 3 years. If you would've asked me 2-3 years ago my thoughts on this game I would've highly reccomended it, this is the story that has changed my mind on the matter. Around 1 year, maybe even a year and a half ago, some friends of mine and some members of the community got into a bit of a drama with part of the veteran community who were constantly pushing new players out of the community and game by means of harassment (in and out of game), by kicking players out of groups in some instanced content (so cases I did understand why they did, others it was to force specific individuals out of the game), using exploits to grief said players (new and veteran alike), etc. I will NOT be posting screenshots of these events (due to I do not want them or others to receive backlash from the toxic players, devs, and not to mention there's no point in rehashing old wounds with them. Not to mention I do consider this to be petty). Some examples of these would like this. Person A: Hello *Insert nation name*, 10 different people: Shut the F*** up. There would also be racial and homophobic slurs mixed in to these dialogues people would use in the game's nation chat (it does not exist anymore but it used to be the main way of talking with other players in the nation across the server). At that time, we had contacted the developers, reported these said individuals multiple times, in the end out of the many who had harassed us in game, out of game, did these said things only 1 player was banned, yet it took the developers over 3 months of doing this with hundreds of screenshots sent to them and other friends of mine. I will also add that I do not believe all parties involved were right or wrong for how everyone acted toward each other. After dealing with these for 5-6 months, along with other patches that many I knew and other players were extremely angry towards, then the server fire happened (which caused everyone's accounts to be rolled back). I do not blame anyone for the last, I understand that was unforchent events, but at the time we were all fed up and took a breather from the game. I personally came back to the game around August or September of 2021 (the current date as I'm writing this is 02/26/2022). to find all these said players to moved on to other nations and still remain in this game to this day. Currently at that time, many new players started running the nation I played in. I will say I had an amazing time with these new players, they've become some of my closest friends to date and some of the best people I've personally met in this game. Then the developers implimented many new systems (some were amazing while others were completely awful). I kept trying to see the good with these updates but the more updates and patches that came out, the worse some of them had gotten. We started reviving a guild I had been in for over 2 years, the tragedy struck. In January 2022, the leader of my guild and his wife were banned. I had spent hours trying to figure out what had happened and why they were banned, to find out that they were being accused of haboring a banned player. None of us even knew that a banned player had joined our guild (We had open recruitment so anyone could have joined). The developers had told us along the lines of that our guild leader knowingly habored him, upped his rank in guild too quickly (the guild had ranked them to officer not long after they had joined as they had been donating materials to crafters and helping us in many ways. we figured said player was a veteran, but we never questioned it due to they weren't being toxic to anyone at that time, they were being helpful to newer players in the nation, etc.). This was the developer's reasoning, no evidence was provided on what had made them think this other than word of mouth, not to mention there were supposed ingame messages that looked like they might have known (yet in most other ban cases in this game they provide evidence in the ban hammer archieve in the official discord.). As a result of these events our guild leader and his wife were banned, our guild's castle was neutralized (meaning anyone could take it). Later that day after finding all of this out I contacted the developers in their discord to figure out if we as a guild were going to get our guild castle back, in the end I was treated like a scapegoat. Later that day I was offered my guild's castle back along with our guild's levels but they had a catch, I was told from then on out anyone who looked suspecious/even new players that i had to get a background check from a developer. Firstly before I continue, as a player it is not my job to go out of my way to find people that a game's company had banned and these people are circumventing bans to keep playing. I will also say in the other discord servers, My friends and I were harassed constantly by moderators for this game about the issue, saying \"We should be greatful that we recieved anything after what had happened\", I was even seeing this being said by the owner of the game himself. After the events of this we originally had 20 players active in our guild, we lost 15 of them due to this and how upset they were over this. They all knew the mechanic was in place for a situation like this, a owner of a guild deleting their character, etc. After all of this I become extremely stressed and frustrated with the game and the developers and it's why I've taken so long to write this review, I wanted to cool off and not lash out in emotion over these events that had occured. I ended up restarting the guild under a different name and look in fear i'd be held liable or friends of mine for any banned player that had joined (us unknowingly) the guild by the open recruitment system. In this time as well, I never had believed what many had said about these developers and their mods until i started seeing it with my own eyes. These developers also play by favortism of players, I will not name any individuals in this as they do have the power to have anyone they want banned at any time. Since that ban purge back in January of 2022, I've still been playing because of friends of mine. These friends had been struggling to stay in the game and help support the players of the nation we all lived in, if I left at that time most of them would have left due to the crafter shortages at that time (during that time I was 1 of maybe 2-3 individuals who could help supply). I kept going and playing only because of these indiviuals, that was my main reason for staying so long, I didn't want my friends who still enjoyed this game to quit because they couldnt get the items they needed to play. But in this time I've had many friends quit, due to the incidients that occured in January 2022, Mods berating them in private guild discords, that veteran player base from before, and much more. In this time as well, I've seen many times Mods thinking they're above everyone else, laughing as they report people for the smallest things (their names, which in some cases was needed but others it was everyone questioning why, names too similar to another player, etc.). There has also been cases where people have been banned for \"being a banned player\" with a similar names who weren't actually that said player. At this time of posting, I risk my account being banned. I never wanted to see this game in the state it is currently in, I will say to whom is reading this. Read the other reviews and heed their warnings before trying this game, but most of all, form your own opinion and don't just take my word for it.

On one side, we can be closer to you all, treat you more as individuals, and have more time for each one of you if needed. On the other side, problems with behavior or attitude are much more visible and affect us all harder and for longer. It's always easier to focus on something negative, as it hits harder and stays in memory for longer.

As we always say - we only need a little faith and cooperation to keep Gloria Victis's world and community a safe and welcoming space for everyone who does have a good heart and some reason. We're aware that players can be very vocal about their issues and opinions, and we do respect them all. We hear them, and we understand. Still, we cannot make exceptions to the chat and game rules we created in close cooperation with players, as the community requested that from us.

You can set it to where the direction you move in controls your attack/blocking direction. On top of this you can bind blocking and/or attacking from specific directions to number keys. With a gaming mouse this allows you to just tap 1 to block left, 2 to block right, 3 to block center/stab/overhead, 4 to attack from left, 5 to attack from right, 6 to overhead. This drastically increases your reaction time and essentially dumbs down the cool actiony combat system this game attempts to mimic.\n-Lag apparently affects attacks/blocking.

But how can that even be remotely true when your base level resistances are 100% determined by the armor you wear? Higher grades and higher enhanced gear can have upwards of 50-70% higher stats than unleveled/blue or green gear.

I had just hit lvl 40 and finished what I had thought was the \"Tutorial\" bit of the game - it stopped giving tips on how to do basic game functions. (Not like how to do anything useful, just ya know \"Press 'e' to pick up stuff.\" \n\nWhat was the question \"What does it mean when a flag on the map is burning?\"\nNot a single answer came until I joined a privated guild discord server and voice chatted with someone about my question. How ridiculous is that? The community is too toxic to even try and pretend to be welcoming to new players. They all wonder why the game cant ever break 500 players, but its 100% because the community sucks and actively chases people away.\n\n----------  Not an MMO, But really wants to be in all the BAD ways. Grindy, Pay To Win, Toxic Community.\n\nI am literally pleading with you not to waste your money on this. I bought it on sale for $10 and I regret it. I cannot fathom spending $20 on a game that is as far from the mark as this one is. Uninstalled at the 19th hour. 3 toons at lvl 50+ so you cannot say I didnt give it a fair go. One toon used a shield build, one was archer, one was a 2hander. I tried all routes to enjoy this game, none of them worked.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMY RESPONSE TO THE DEV RESPONSE:\n(Pardon the heat, but dev called me a liar without giving any evidence aside from his word.)\n\nImagine that - a developer reply that attempts to dismiss everything I pointed out as a negative with the magic words of \"Its impossible\". Well sucks to suck mr.Dev, but it very much is possible and it happened regularly. You applying 'A small, temporary debuff' to a horde of 100 players from china that joined to steamroll the US server map doesnt do jack shit. Whats more? 96 other people have now marked my review as helpful. Do you dismiss that obvious support of what I have said? Do you openly deny 100 people that are in agreeance with me?\n\nIt will take a lot more of a defense than a developer saying \"You didnt play my game long enough! Those things dont happen! My community may be toxic but thats just people! The mentoring system is our tutorial!\"\n\nA: I played 20 hours. If you cant tell enough about a games core features in a 20 real world hours of being IN THE GAME - you suffer from some sort of impede. In 20 real world hours I was capable of defeating players in higher level gear just because I played better by a large margin. Does that mean the game isnt DESIGNED to be grindy and pay to win? No. \n\nB:And you can also purchase bundles of raw materials, fancy weapons, etc. You can swipe daddys credit card and this game will 100% put you ahead of someone else. \n\nC: Developer admits that theres no real point to play the game yourself - just beg in map chat for end game gear! :pepehands:\n\nD: You failed to mention anything that actually prohibits what I just said from happening. You quite actually proved it possible by mentioning the measures you have in place to handle when massive hordes of other players join another server - in the form of that 'severe but temporary debuff'. \n\nThe developer is legit trying to throw up a smokescreen to save face. Notice he doesnt propose any actual counters to my points? The most he does is elaborate on them by saying \"Well yeah, but theres also this thing\" He does not every outright say anything I claimed is false except the doughnutting - which is literally the term coined for when it happens. the way the flags are set up will end up looking like a burning doughnut on the map when all of the castles/forts are under siege.\n\nLiterally laughing right now at this response.\nImagine being a Dev and LYING to try and make your game look better?\nI have video footage of doughnutting taking place and screenshots of people discussing it in that guild discord I was FORCED to join to get any answers from anyone in the game.\n\nImagine defending a toxic community like that by saying \"People are people\" - well sorry to inform you Dev, but your 'people' are bad ones. \n\nIn the future - don't respond to something very clearly marked \"Comments not Allowed\" with some b.s cover up you think nobody will come back and call you out on.\n\nYou're a developer. You helped build the game.\nThat does not mean you know everything about how the players FACILITATE the game that you helped create. Perhaps spend less time defending the game in comments and more time getting in touch with your playerbase and community/potential costumers by acknowledging their feedback instead of attempting to dismiss it with blatant lies. \n\nFrFr. I have no interest in your game anymore and further your handling of this encounter has left me even more inclined to steer people away from your game and company. If anyone would like substantial proof of my claims before purchase I invite you to add me on steam and we can vc/screenshare while I walk you through the videos,pics and testimonies I have that support my side of things. I may not have been vampirically drained of all life and emotion by wasting my soul away for hundreds of hours on this game, but I only ever do that for games that earn it. For games that feel worth it to me.\n\nAnd at the end of the day?\nThis game did not and still does not feel like its worth even $10.", "timestamp_created": 1591861313, "timestamp_updated": 1606079986, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 122, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819693863391876221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1595497646, "developer_response": "Hello,\n\nI am sorry that the game doesn't made your expectations.

Some folks call it \"Doughnutting\".\"\n\nIt is impossible, you can indeed login to the other server but only if your nation is not having the biggest number in the server.

There are players who are helping new players every day and get rewarded by newcomers for doing that.

The closest you get is a 30v10 Wherein its 3 dudes on 1 until the small group has their booties sandblasted. \"\n\nWe have systems allowing only a certain amount of people joining at closed events, like Valley of Death where situations like this cannot happen - since enemies won't be able to join if other nations will have much fewer numbers. On a balanced situation, nations can fast travel to events only if they have same numbers as enemies - the only edge case is when dominating nation attacks underdog at their homeland. At that moment underdog can fast travel with more members than a dominating enemy.\nObviously, at the open-world there will be situations where a guild will get together in a bigger party - but that's something normal in any open-world game and players shouldn't be punished if they can/want to group up.\n\n\"-Catapults that do absolutely nothing when its faster to just axe the gates down. \"\n\nOn the low levels axing gates down might be the best solution, but surely any veteran player would agree that on guild battles you cannot Siege a castle without Siege engines. All other cases are simply up to players - I don't know what reason it would be to make players forced to use Siege engines and disallow them axing it down. If defenders allow it, it's their fault. It is an open-world game and I can assure you that it is simply a matter of your play hours that you felt that way.\n\n\"-Lag apparently affects attacks/blocking. Meaning someone with lag can effectively teleport and evade your attacks. \" \n\nThis is not even remotely a truth due to having server-side architecture, for unknown reason some players say that way but we gave a 200$ worth bounty for ANY proof for that.

Just for sake of players feeling that they have no chance because enemy has level 100 (which can be gained within a week) we are restreaming videos of our players/devs playing characters around 50 level at our Steam Broadcast. This movie gives more insight into that matter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOsaO3FtKC0 an starting weapon can deal more damage than best weapon or other type if used properly.\n\nAlso, your armor wear is not restricted to anything and you can get high tier armors in no time simply asking for that in nation chat.\n\n\"Grindy, Pay To Win\"\n\n- You can get max level within a week, you can level up by doing quests/pve/pvp/arenas against other players or even crafting.\n- You can throw money in our game and buy skins which are fully cosmetic.

Seems during the State of War events, they constantly have someone DDoS'ing the servers and haven't been able to fix it. Devs release fixes of things in weird orders and make changes that often break something else. Horses can run underwater now.\nOne of the more intense things that has been recently occurring (as far as I've been aware since starting) is Devs are going full blown censorship. One of their recent policies was saying things like \"EZ LOOT\" or \"EZ WIN\" is now toxic and ban-able. I've never been a big trash talker nor a fan of elitist behavior, but to censor it seems authoritarian and absurd. As far as I've heard from other players, Devs seem to also try to \"infiltrate\" private guild/player made nation discords and monitor people there as well (though I repeat, this is simply what I've been told has happened in the past).\nThe other reason I leave a negative review is based on customer support.\nI joined the GV official discord, but didn't register my private cell phone to it. I didn't care to add to the trash talk or type in it, so why register my private cell? I used the server to read updates and read content related to the games social environment. I saw in one of the channels, a player of an opposing faction getting trash talked by players from a second opposing faction. He replied with, (referencing in game as its a PVP game where you literally kill each other and loot their corpse) \"I will smile as I stand on your corpse\". \nOne of the GV staff flagged him as making a death threat. I PM'd said GV staff member and asked why he didn't address the content of the other members from the other faction. Essentially this led to a conversation about \"woes me I get worked to the bone\" and ended with him asking me that if I see things that break the community guidelines, to help him out and report it so he can handle it. \nWanting to make sure there wasn't a faction favoritism, I took him up on the offer. Sure enough the next couple days the same players of the faction who initiated the trash talk toward the guy that got flagged started making personal attacks and very inappropriate and sexual remarks towards a person of another faction. I took screen shots and sent them after waiting a day to see if said GV staff would handle it. He did not. I DM'ed them the screenshots. He claimed they weren't offensive and had no context and I could be editing them. I provided direct links to the comments. He claimed they weren't against the rules, despite clearly breaking several. He then said that since I hadn't typed into the official discord today, his \"CEOs\" and he think I was \"obviously a troll\" and blocked me.\nNow, due to my habit of procrastinating, I will have to worry as to whether the Devs will claim I'm part of a conspiracy of \"negative review bombing\". But, as mentioned above, I procrastinated... and the recent behavior of the Devs has made me feel more motivated to post this overdue review.\n\nTL;DR?\nGame is fun to play but has fun zapping and combat breaking bugs.\nDevs \"fix\" or change things in the strangest ways that breaks other things.\nDevs are going into extreme player monitoring and moderating measures.\nGV Staff that I dealt with were incredibly rude and unprofessional while showing a clear bias in that situation.\n\nHopefully the game improves and I can change this review. Or at least parts of it.\n\n\n-----Edit March 7th 2023-----\n\nRecently decided to look back into the game only to learn not much has changed according to friends who still play from time to time and the relatively recent/recent reviews. Also discovered in some of the reviews the devs/staff are claiming the people who left neg reviews were permabanned players being salty. I wasn't banned before or after I wrote this review as shown by the 150hrs I put in after this review:\n\nNot Recommended\n0.0 hrs last two weeks / 1,087.5 hrs on record (934.6 hrs at review time)\nPosted: Mar 9, 2021 @ 5:01am\n\nThe game was a hot mess with update spam and constant broken content and excuses around it as opposed to solutions. Many players on all three of the factions voiced it and the players who were in the Ismir and Sangmar factions voiced it especially in game and in the GV Official Discord. The staff also seemed to play favorites on who they applied rules/bans to as the same toxic peeps were still in game despite their claims to \"fight toxicity\".\n\n@BartoldGV (one of the devs) claimed I was banned in a response to another neg review that referenced/linked my review. I was not temp banned, kicked, or permabanned in GV and likely still have access to it. I quit playing of my own accord. \nThey released another spam of updates that constantly broke things and I decided to just let the updates sit for a while. That was after I wrote the review. \n\n(This break lasted a few months and ended up being a nice break from toxic players, and no not the \"says mean things\" type of toxic, they were the gate keeper kind that go out of their way to exclude and fck over new/other player's ability to play the game. Even made accounts for opposite faction and camped players on thier main faction strictly to bully them out of playing- very easy for them to do on a game with such a low pop, and no I wasn't one of the excluded people, but I was in the discords where they admitted or were actively doing it)\n\nI was logged in while writing my review and played for days after writing it... Even went back and tried it again after finally updating several months later. But the same toxic players the staff claims to fight and the same game killing bugs and breaks were there.. and there was barely anyone online ( about 4 people on Sangmar) aside from the few gate keepers mentioned earlier (toxic players)... But hey, y'all had released some costly skins for players to spend money on...\n\nI would appreciate if the staff (@BartoldGV in particular) edited the false claims. I assume they are either malicious, or ignorant. Malicious if he is painting any who neg review the game as \"permabanned\"; ignorant in the case that you didn't even read and check the links he posted to see who he referenced... \nIf not edited I suppose it is more than Daimon Frey (the dev I kindly left the name of out of me initial review) who is unprofessional among your staff and shows the mentality of the GV staff in general.\n\nGV staff have been one of the major disappointments for me with this game, of which I had recently contemplated checking out with some of my friends again... They claim to fight toxicity, but allow some of the most toxic players remain in the game- who coincidentally dump money into it. \nPainting all neg reviewers as ill-intended coincides with their behavior when they received a large amount of poor reviews (around the same time I made mine). They reported people for \"review bombing\" (and demanded their reviewed be taken down- of which Valve did remove many) despite many of the reviews matching the very complaints made by players in game about the broken coding, buggy updates and following a large amount of hypocritical/bias-revealing bans (temp/perma) that were called out by players of multiple factions (some were reversed later). \n\nWhen I played I had managed to get scores of new players set up and into the game only for them to be chased out by the toxic peeps the staff continuously ignored while banning the players they didn't like and that called out the issues with the game and the staff. Even long time players, who were playing long before me, had to take intermittent breaks due to the toxicity. Yet for some reason the toxics remained in game (yes these toxics were reported, many many times).\n\nGV staff needs to quit lying and trying to save face. GV needs to be changed to GL for Gas Lighters...\n\nWas hopeful.

All of this is to be expected! This game isn't finished. Not even close. This is clearly stated on the Steam storefront page.  At this point, purchasing this game basically means you are donating money to the devs to continue and hopefully finish development. \n\nIn my opinion, alpha players should focus on where the game is headed and provide constructive feedback to help improve it. But to do so you have to see the overall vision, not just the pixels. If you think the game is total crap, cool. Just be sure to tell the devs why it is crap, and f you\u2019re feeling extra charitable, maybe throw in a suggestion or two as to how they can fix it. As an alpha player, you have one of the rarest and most exciting opportunities as a gamer; you get to help shape the future of a game and truly make it yours. \n\nHoping the devs read these reviews. If so, here are my two cents.\n\n---The Good---\n\n-Excellent musical score and sound. \n-High potential for immersion. \n-Very good looking graphics & environment. \n-Innovative weather and seasonal system.\n-Intuitive controls and default key mappings.\n-Outstanding UI. Very logical, minimalist design. \n-Skill based combat. Archery is already pretty good as is.\n-Outstanding crafting system. \n-Hybrid PvP looting system.\n\n---The Bad---\nGeneral:\n-Bugs, exploits, glitches and optimization issues. You already know about most, if not all of this. Moving on\u2026 \n\nPlayer Movement:\n-Walking, running and movement feels slow, unresponsive and cumbersome. Jumping and climbing are awful. \n\nEnvironmental Interaction:\n-Character feels very separate and disconnected from the environment. Character should feel connected to the ground, not floating on top of it. Fences, rocks, bags, etc. seem to have invisible force fields around them. This is very distracting and ultimately hurts immersion. \n-Fix tree animations. Trees look like someone is violently shaking them or they are floating in water.   \n\nUser Interface:\n-Separate chat into zones. Otherwise global chat will be an absolute nightmare. \n\nCombat:\n-Collision physics and hit reg. This needs A TON of work. Hitting an enemy should feel impactful, satisfying and rewarding. Not random, weak and detached. \n-Player animations. I believe you are already addressing this, but it still needs quite a bit of work. \n-Responsiveness. Weapon swings and meter charging should be a bit faster and much more responsive. This should help make combat feel much more fluid, organic and immersive. \n-Sync graphics, sound and hit reg. If I miss an opponent, I should hear a \u201cwhoosh,\u201d not a \u201ccleave\u201d or a \u201cthud.\u201d\n-Add visual hit display for melee combat. The point of impact should be visually apparent on the enemy\u2019s body (similar to the system you already have in place with arrows). \n\nFeature Requests:\n-Battlegrounds. Lots of them. Capture the flag, king of the hill, etc., etc.\n-Medieval siege weapons (trebuchet, etc.) for RvR and PvP battlegrounds.    \n-Arena (1v1, 2v2, 5v5, etc.). \n-Mounts and mounted combat. \n-Crank up the gore and animations to reflect medieval brutality. Beheadings anyone?!?!\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n-Personally, I think the combat system mechanics are the single most important thing to focus on and will ultimately make or break this game. Make Gloria Victis the preeminent medieval MMO it is begging to be!

I think the answer hides behind all the hard work the developers are putting into the game, and how perseverant they are, gradually shaping a true MMORPG experience out of their game.\n\nYou need to know [b]that the development of GV started many years ago[/b] with a prototype game called \"Ether Fields\", made in custom engine from a couple of Polish guys who wanted to create a massive multiplayer online world set in a low-fantasy setting, inspired by western european folkore. The idea they tried to push consisted in a non-targeted combat, medieval warfare type of game, with classless progression, crafting and questing as core features.\n\nProblems arose though, some of them were technical and others were communication related, because back then the game was barely translated. Every piece of information was scarce and it was scattered on their forums, mostly written in polish. There were issues with their engine which was lacking important systems that needed to be developed, with time and money that small independent studios like this one (at the time) often can't afford.\n\n7 years have passed since I've read about the game for the first time. Many things happened in between, starting with the switch to Unity as the game engine of choice and the simultaneous rebrand to the current \"Gloria Victis\" as we know it today. From there, the development kept going forward, even after [b]a failed kickstarter back in 2012[/b], the developers kept working on the game, making slow but steady progress over the years, communicating now with their playerbase and overall improving the quality of their game and its systems.\nIts main theme is composed by the man who wrote the score for The Witcher, a combat update released last year brought many so needed new animations for the characters and NPCs (thanks to an experienced animator who also worked on The Witcher; Polish guys being bros I guess), and the game core mechanics are all in place now. There's a game you can actually play and get looped into its systems. Not long ago Gloria Victis also suffered from serious connectivity problems where players had to experience constant lag and desyncs from the servers, which to be fair are still an issue sometimes, but then again it is far from what the player were experiencing just a couple of months ago.\n\nYes, the game is clunky and yes, there's still much to do in order to call it a finished product, but seeing how hard working the team is I'm confident we'll get there one day, and no, I'm not good at predictions. \n\nHonestly, I'm not going to explain to you all the features the game has to offer. Most of them are the standard stuff you'll find in any title of the same genre: linear questing, mob camps, resource nodes, markets and trading, crafting and so on... But I'd like to tell you what this game stands out for, aka, the things that should make you decide if this is the game for you.\n\n[b]Endgame is mostly PvP[/b] if you don't want to be a crafter. There are 3 factions in the game, each one visually diverse, and you have to choose one, having the other 2 as enemies that you need to fight in order to control the many outposts and castles that are placed on the map. Having more of them turned to the color of your faction offers different bonuses to the player characters who belong to that faction. If you have ever played Daoc or if you have familiarity with the most recent WvW systems of Guild Wars 2 and ESO, you already know what you're getting into and where the enjoyment comes from in a game like this. The main difference from the last two games I mentioned tho, is that the PvP doesn't take place in an istanced map, separated from the main game, but it is instead the main component of the experience and it is played where all the other people are also crafting, questing and trading.\n\nTo support that game loop there's [b]a different kind of combat iteration[/b] from the standard MMO you have been accustomed to. Gloria Victis gives the players directional blocks and attacks, meaning that you can move your mouse in 4 different directions and your character will play an animation accordingly, similar to how the more famous Mount & Blade franchise work. It is fun, because combat despite not being \"flashy\" or offering active skills bound to an hotkey (not in the traditional sense), promotes smart play that rely on stats management, player skill and tactical manoeuvers. \n\nIn the end it's a game about player interaction. GV should be played in a guild, and grouping is promoted by the game systems. For istance, there are various PvP events you can take part in that popup every day and that let you group with other players automatically if you decide to partecipate.\n\nIn my opinion, [b]if you like MMORPGs you should give the game a try[/b], or at least, you should put it in your wishlist, so that you can follow the development process and eventually hop in when you feel the game is ready to be played. Gloria Victis is being updated weekly and if you don't believe me I urge you to go looking at their news stream here on Steam, to see how in the two and a half years the game's been released there are already [b]150+ updates[/b], in the form of new content, patches, hotfixes or just diaries and notes that the devs write for the players to read.\n\nTo my friends who are skeptical I'd say that \"time will tell\", but also that by knowing something's history you'll have a good perspective on how things may turn out at the end. In Gloria Victis' case I guess it will translate in a very good MMO, maybe not the definitive one if such thing even exist, but definitely a good one.\n\n[b]TL;DR: the game has the potential to become an unique MMO because of its setting and combat mechanics, plus it is being devolped by people who are showing they care, by doing good PR and releasing updates on a weekly basis.[/b]",

"language": "english", "review": "IMPORTANT FOR POTENTIAL BUYERS :\nDon't let yourself be fooled by \"the average steam review\" rating, a lot of positive reviews come from players with 60 hours or even less (surely not enough to really see all the mechanics of the game, let alone fully understand them and see all the flaws), I've also seen a lot of negative reviews \"mysteriously disappear\".\nI'm fairly convinced that the right \"average steam review\" rating for this game should be \"Mixed\" or even lower.\n\nPROS :\n-It has (HAD imho) a huge potential, could have been a gaming milestone in the hands of a better development team\n-Roles and Builds are really significant\n-You can customize your character (passive) abilities in interestings ways, so you can make/find a build that fits your playstyle better\n-Being able to play with others as a team and follow strategies is often more important than being a solo pro-player who can easily win fights 2v1\n-The Loot-System is rewarding (if you're the one looting) but not too punishing (if you're the one being looted)\n\nCONS :\n-Its potential is completely wasted since most of the game features are completely wrong or filled with deep flaws\n-Devs/Admins are ridiculous, personally I've never seen them do anything else than making things worse (and I'm referring to both developing and managing community problems)\n-The community seems nice at first, but its just another disguise, the more you get to know the player-base, the more you comprehend that the vast majority of the players are toxic people that only play because they want to be praised for their virtual greatness or enjoy the perpetual in-game drama (of course there are also some TRUE nice folks to meet)\n-The build system is not that bad, in fact it's also listed as a pros, but its totally inaccurate, the numbers you read on the passive skills descriptions are incorrect, so if you build a character without knowing the game really well you end up picking some really not-great skills and not picking up others skills that could actually improve your performances on the battlefield\n-A lot of others info the game give you are totally incorrect, so it could happen that you plan something but end up with different results from the ones you has been expecting\n-Team-play is often more important than being a pro-player, yes, it is also a bad thing, because doesn't matter how good you are at fighting, you can't do almost anything on your own and since the game has a low amount of active players its not always easy to find someone to fight with\n-Horses are just wrong, nothing about them is how it should be to make them work properly with the rest of the game, devs tried to balance them, but they somehow managed to make them even worse than before, multiple times\n-Being an archer in GV is like going on a very long and very strange rollercoaster, devs keep changing how they work and keep making things worse and worse for both archers and melee players that have to deal with them, the majority of the players I've met started as archer, then turned to melee out of dissatisfaction or sometimes even desperation\n\nLong version (advised if you STILL think that the game its worth buying) :\nThis game is pure cancer disguised as an Early Access game to convince potential buyers to think it is worth a try and be more forgivable on bugs or whatever issues they could see before buying, it lures curious people into buying, makes them play a (IMHO boring & useless) \"tutorial\" that doesn't actually teach anything really useful about the game with the excuse of making the player level up fast and be finally able to enjoy the \"real content\" of the game, with that subtle trick devs make sure that you play more than 2 hours (so that you lose the chance to refund) before you even start to wonder if you will enjoy the game at some point.\nAfter the useless time waster that the \"tutorial\" is, you will find yourself lost in the reign of StoneHolm (so original :P), without any clues of how to craft, how to join events and above all how combat mechanics and loot mechanics really works against real players!\nIf you're lucky you will find someone kind enough to take some of his time to explain you the basics and maybe even to do some sparring session with you in the arena, so that you can start to really understand how the fighting system works (when it does :P ), but due to the obvious lack of knowledge you have about the value of items, you could also run into someone that will almost rob you while pretending to help you understand how the game works.\nBut after you play for a while (lets say a couple of months) it gets better, right?\nOhhh, I wish it was that simple!\nNo, when you've been playing the game for a while you will surely start to understand things better, fight better and loot more efficiently (if you ever manage to loot), but you will also start to understand how profoundly flawed and broken the game is and how bad things are managed by the devs.\nAs you will start to play better you will also start to notice that the players that at first seemed unbeatable pros were just players never willing to join a fight unless they were sure to win and never willing to fight with less than a full gold equipment.\nAs you will start to realize how in-game market works you will also start to realize how much the prices and the crafting features are messed up and unbalanced.\nAs you will start to recognize the players and their nicknames you will notice that a lot of \"good players\" will go to battle but never join the fights or leave the fray early because they're more scared of losing a piece of equipment than how much are interested in fighting side-by-side with other players with the purpose of winning for their (in-game) faction.\nThis game had an IMMENSE potential, its one of the few online medieval games, it has an overall decent build-system, an almost-decent fighting system, a loot system that gives the perfect amount of satisfaction when looting without killing the mood everytime you're the one that is being looted and a huge crafting system that at first is a bit hard to understand but becomes more enjoyable the more you understand it, the core problem of the game is the dev team, a team that prefers to ignore and hide problems instead of accepting the feedback and fixing the issues.\n\nConclusions :\nThe game is hardly enjoyable, unintuitive, a lot less fun than you could think, more time consuming and frustrating than it should, badly managed by its devs, has a toxic community (imho \"thanks\" to the previous reason), is full of issues that never get properly fixed despite being patched frequently and is an abomination for whoever likes medieval settings, hystory and/or weapons.\n\nIf you like medieval style games, here are a few titles I personally recommend:\nKingdom Come:Deliverance, Exanima, M&B2:BANNERLORD, M&B:Warband, Hellish Quart, Medieval Dynasty, Going Medieval, Manor Lords (coming soon) and Renown (coming soon)\n\nP.S.\nI know that some devs feels like they have enough time to spare to come here and complain about the negative reviews instead of appreciate the feedback (since even negative reviews can help improve the game through constructive criticism) and use it to fix the game, well, this message is for you.\nStop deleting negative reviews or even replying to them so you can lure new players to buy your game and use that time to fix your glitchy game instead!\nBy now You could have a really good game in your hands if only your endless efforts were put into fixing issues and develop balanced features instead of constantly finding new excuses and pretend to improve the game by adding features that only a player that NEVER actually played the game before would think to add (unless his purpose is to destroy the game).\nNow go on, make this review disappear too if you feel like it, knowing that it would only be another proof of your failure, otherwise you could show you are mature enough to admit your wrongs and accept the feedback. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1634056096, "timestamp_updated": 1634056621, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 143, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790599167346954346", "comment_count":

I am glad that you were so kind to share a lot of positives, and even in the things you do not fully like, you pointed some bright spots.\n\nAllow me to address some of your words to assure the best insight and explanation for the people reading our game reviews.\n\nFirst, let me assure you that no reviews are mysteriously disappearing.  They may be changed or removed by their authors who changed their opinions or deleted by Steam Moderation if the reviews are violating Steam Community Guidelines. Developers cannot remove reviews anyhow. We can only answer a review, and if needed, report it - same as regular platform users - if it is not following the Steam rules.\n\nIt's correct that some of the players changed their opinions or removed their reviews after reading our answers, in which we are trying to help or explain everything and address their feedback. Some have been removed by Steam moderation for violating the Community Guidelines.\n\nWe are happy that many new players love the game after spending a relatively short time in it - but, to be honest, the positive to negative review ratio is much lower when you are looking at the short gameplay time. The game has a much better score when you are counting players with much more hours. It is easy to check by yourself using the playtime filter in the reviews section: 1-10 hours - 60%, 5-15 - 77%, 10-30 - 80%, 20-50 - 80%, and looking at 50+ hours of gameplay - 76% of Gloria Victis reviews are positive.\n\nAs one of the smallest, independent teams in the World that created a non-target MMORPG game without any budget and investors, we cannot be happier to see such positive receiving of the project.  On the other hand, I do not fully understand why players who have thousands of hours in the game post negative reviews after not launching the game for months. Just on your example, you were not playing Gloria Victis for over six months, missing 25 updates, including two major ones. You have almost 3000 hours in the game, which is just about the time people are spending working for two years. That's a lot!\n\nThe game is constantly evolving, and we are working hard to deliver the best possible experience for everyone with every weekly update, so please, remember that you are more than welcome to visit us from time to time. We are always happy to hear your constructive feedback and suggestions. I appreciate your review and would love to discuss it further. I believe more details on some matters would be very helpful, cos most of your arguments are relatively broad in understanding.\n\nPlease, consider all that fun time you have spent in Gloria Victis, remember all those friendships you made through it, and rethink if the game deserves a negative review. Thank you in advance.\n\nDistinti saluti :)\n\nDaimon\nCommunity & Support Manager"}, "84525195": {"recommendationid": "84525195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065841050", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 27800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8647, "last_played": 1618964566}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer : This is not a \"burned out review\" or \" revenge review\" as some like to brand all negative review to be. \n\nDon't join the party late. \nYou will be fcuked, repeatedly by the bullies in groups.  \nThe vets will loot newbie blinded and run their mouths about it. \nYou are either in that sorry faction who get constantly wrecked because of the 1 to 10 in numbers, \nor you are the A-holes who 10 to 1 others and laugh about it. \nPlus the devs don't seems to think this is a problem. \nDon't get me wrong, I backed this title when they \"green lighted\" in 2016, left to all those bs happening in game, came back in 2020, this is still fcuked. or should I say worse in \"community\" wise terms.  \n\nWould have loved the content, (maybe extract the getting looted blinded part) but don't bother. \nEspecially if you think you would have time to solo roam build up your gear by crafting etc. \nyou don't even get a chance to gather needed resources without being harassed. \n(before the smart-a came in, no it's not in your \" conflict zones\".)", "timestamp_created": 1610415082, "timestamp_updated": 1611067296, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787068843841552734", "comment_count": 46, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1610459910, "developer_response": "Hello!\n\nIt was very unlikely in the last months to one nation had more than a 30% average concurrent numbers difference due to the balancing system recommending nations to potentially weaker nations - as you have mentioned you have been outnumbered 10 to 1.

From toxic community members, to cheating, hacking, exploiting, you name it...this game suffers from it.\n\nNow I am not bashing the game due to bugs or anything of the sort as I have been employed on early testing teams for multiple titles...so I understand this is to be expected. What I am bashing is the fact that the response to testing and reports is absolute garbage.\n\nThe dev team behind Gloria Victis has done nothing to improve the games hacking, cheating, racism and overall disgusting chat both in and out(forums) of game. What they have done is extremely small and for the most part...a lie. \n\nA lie? What do you mean by that?\n\nWell I will tell you. The dev team behind Gloria Victis has intentionally released fake patch notes regarding fixes to exploits. By fake I mean the \"fix\" they stated in the patch notes was not actually fixed at all. This was done in an attempt to reduce the amount of players using the exploit. \n\nFor instance: \"Fixed an issue that was causing a character\u2019s data to not cleared completely after deleting character, allowing players to gain extra attributes and abilities points by creating another character with the same name\" - This specific bug has been reported to have been fixed multiple times even before the Steam Early Access Launch. I have worked very closely with the team regarding this very exploit on multiple occasions and multiple times it has been reported as being resolved. When confronted about the fact that the exploit still remains, they said \"We have posted this in an effort to reduce the use of the exploit, we are sitll working on actually resolving the bug.\"\n\nIf that does not raise an eyebrow or two, I am not sure what will.\n\nBy the way, the aformentioned bug, while it is now fixed...the results of players using this exploit has not been fixed. The players still have the cheated arritbutes and ability points because the players we not forced to respend them.\n\nAfter a quick meeting in my TeamSpeak server with a dev, we decided we would call it quits....this was the final straw. I quote \"We do not care who is cheating and exploiting at this time and have no plan to punish these players.\" \n\nAs you can see from my play time, I have invested a lot of time(and money) into Gloria Victis, I can say from my experience that the dev team behind Gloria Victis is extremely amateur and has very little hope of releasing a polished well moderated title.\n\nIf you do play Gloria Victis you can expect a multitude of progress losing bugs, cheating, hacking, exploiting, and an all around disgusting player community. Want to picture what this community is like? Picture all the players of League of Legend sharing ONE chat channel...YUP this is actually what this game does. ONE global chat channel. Have fun with that.\n\nYour valuable money and time are better spent elsewhere. \n\n\nP.S. Feel free to look at the ever dwindling population of Gloria Victis. Looks like a lot of players have also come to a similar conclusion. I suggest you avoid wasting your money on this failure. http://steamcharts.com/app/327070\n\n\nEdit: I decided to add some additional information about the moderators of this game. The moderators are players themselves, which means they are members of guilds. This has created a huge problem...a problem known as favoritism. From editted comments and deleted/locked threads...it has all occured in efforts to remove any information that would damage the image of the moderators guild. Do a bit of searching on the forums and you will find some locked threads with proof of specific guilds hacking and cheating.

Not many have followed, but for this game I made a exeption. With a grand total of 1600+ hours, I have to admit I enjoyed playing this game, although my time has come now, lost interest, I still want to share my thought with the rest of the interested community. \n\nGloria Victis, a faction based MMO, both for PvE\u2019ers and PvP\u2019ers. Combined with a M&B-like directional combatsystem, it would be a game where many M&B-like players would dream of, so I thought. \n\n*Gameplay* \nTo keep it short, the world excists out of three nations, divided on one map. Players can capture \u2018flags\u2019 to gain glory for their nation. Every nation and settlement is unique, so is the world. Fight mostly play around the flags or PvE locations. Game is, besides SoW-days, running smooth. Graphics are decent, not anything spectacular - do not expect that from a Unity engine (if I remember correctly). Animations can somewhat be clanky, but in general, the game is playable. \n\n*Combat* \nFor ways to attack, three ways to block. Easier than M&B and also easy to master. Combat can be slow from time to time, which is amplified by the fact people can also keybind attacks and blocks. Since the combat is so slow and you can barely one-shot people it is a very \u2018number\u2019 based game. Most oftenly parties with the bigger sized group, often win sieges or battles. And then I will not even talk about the fact that most of the servers have underdog nations, which means the activity in those nations is lower than their counterparts. Overall, combat can be fun, but do realize that getting \u2018zerged\u2019 is a thing in this game.\nUnfortunately the combat is also very ping based, if you have high ping - fighting a low ping enemies you have a clear disadvantage. The responstime is way lower if you have \u2018good\u2019 ping. \n\n*PvP*\nA big world full of pvp, dying means getting looted in GV. Besides your standard sieges or front line battles, what made this game appealing is openworld PvP. Your random small group versus small group entertainment. Unfortunately for me, this is gone now. With the implementation of horses, by far not even close to your average M&B-horse gameplay, the respons time to transport bigger numbers to a certain place has been lowered, thus the zerg feeling amplifies. Also, escaping from a outnumbered situation, which in the past you could outrun people in light gear, is not excisting anymore. Basically, one runs on foot after your enemy, while the second player summons his or her horse and catch the runner in no-time. The changes of survival are gone now. \n\n*PvE*\nPlayable really, can be worthwhile to do - but it is very clunky. It works, but it should not be the reason to buy this game. \n\n*Crafting* \nWay too grindy, but simple to do. Plenty of proficiencies to master, but only with a fortune of gold (or time) you can reach it. \n\n*Free Building*\nOnly available for the (vice) - leader of a guild which occupies a Guild Castle location. If you do not have that, you can only upgrade nation hold settlements. Average player will never be able to acces the free building option. \n\n*Development team* \nBack in 2016 the game was in a very bare bone shape. From what I can remember I only played one month, and returned playing different games. Luckily I started playing in 2019 again, and, wauw, I definitely had a blast playing the game. Considering 4 years has passed, the small development team still managed to update the game every week. From this day on, they are still doing that, in combination with the fact that most of the changes are based of the subjective view of their community. \nThis ofcourse sounds great, but in reality this is not always the case unfortunately. With their newly inplemented ingame questionnaires they form THEIR OWN questions and label it as \u2018asked by the community\u2019. Good way to gain statistic results, but you are measuring in a very biased way. \n\n*Special mentions*\nThe tutorial in this game is poorly executed. The tutorial does not give new players a compleet overview of the game, and especially not a good insite in the combat. This is being amplified by the fact that there is not place to train against a dummy or a NPC-trainer. The only way to properly learn this game, is by contacting players who actually want to help. This should not be the case, especially when people suggested plenty of solutions. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n*Summary* \n\nPro\u2019s \n- Dedicated development team (patch every week). \n- Community is being heard by the devs. \n- Plenty to do in the world of Gloria Victis, from local quests till pvp adventures. People make the game alive. \n- Combat is, in general, playable. \n- Performance is decent. \n- Graphics are decent. \n- PvE is accessible. \n- Crafting is working propperly. \n\nCon\u2019s\n- Game is being played around numbers, party with the biggest party often wins. There almost is no room to clutch and win against the bigger force. \n- Game is ping-based. Low ping means a slight advantage over higher ping players. \n- Horse-gameplay is horrible, and not even close to the M&B counterpart. \n- People make the game alive, and also can make it feel dead. \n- NPC\u2019s act weird and are poorly designed. \n- Crafting is a grind and most of the time only for the rich. \n- Freebuilding only available for a very small group of players. \n- Poorly executed tutorial, lacks a advantaged training option. \n\nI do still recommend the game, truth said, after 1600 hours it would be biased to say if I wouldn\u2019t. I only do recommend it for people who like the medieval genre; experienced games like M&B, Mordhau etc.; do NOT mind losing stuff; do NOT mind clunky NPC\u2019s and, in general, is not easily triggered. \n\nTo be honest; I still have a lot to talk about. Unlucky, steam does not allow me to process everything I have to write. One thing what I have to say, is that the dev team lack a clear vision of how they want to design their game. Most oftenly I feel they do not know what is happening inside their own game and lack knowledge about the basics. They are constantly placing plasters to fight the symptoms, while forgetting to solve the main problem. \n\nFor now, I am done playing GV. The game looks promissing; it is playable, but it still has a long way to go.

This was a step in the right direction but created a over population of hp/STR builds. Gear makes a difference to the tune of 70 dmg vrs 280... These players will hunt and loot you so you never get those items, they will spam like children, and outnumber you at lvl 20 with a full squad of lvl 100's. This game caiters to the dev and his friends, thats about it. Worst part is the combat mechanics that are exploitable and overused make combat look unrealistic and a joke. Just watch a high level video people crouched and spinning running around backwards at 100mph. This is not how battles looked.... It should be more Kingdom Come even, parry and fluid reposte, calculated but twitch, just watch this clown show of pvp the community deems \"skilled\" may aswell be crawling on the floor next throwing arrows.", "timestamp_created": 1569445087, "timestamp_updated": 1569445087, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770962417125701904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1574936054, "developer_response": "Hello,\n\nThank you for your feedback. We\u2019re reading all the reviews carefully in order to find aspects which can and should be improved, so Gloria Victis can simply become a better game. Some of the points you\u2019ve made have been already addressed, while some others come from the very core design of the game, so I\u2019d like to elaborate a bit about them:\n\n1. Comparison to Mount and Blade, Chivarly and Mordhau (I believe you meant this title, since Mordheim is a turn-based game)\n\nI\u2019ll start from this point, as it determines many other aspects touched in your review. There is one but important difference between our game and the other games you\u2019ve mentioned: while MnB, Chivalry and Mordhau (great games btw, we love them too!) are games with matchmaking battles of limited size, taking place in closed arenas, Gloria Victis is an open-world MMORPG. This single difference causes several consequences, but 2 most significant of them are:\n\nA) Latency \u2013 when playing a matchmaking game, you\u2019ll naturally look for a server with the lowest ping possible. Ideally, you won\u2019t ever look at the servers with more than 50ms of ping. Gloria Victis, on the other hand, is an MMORPG with a single server per continent. It means that the game must be equally playable for both players having quick physical route to the server \u2013 which, in fact, can get close to 50ms \u2013 and the ones living far from the server\u2019s location (which is, obviously, more frequent) so they have much higher ping.\n\nB) Persistence and progression \u2013 as an MMORPG, Gloria Victis has many layers which normally don\u2019t exist in the matchmaking games at all or are heavily limited, namely the player character\u2019s progression, the entire economic layer and persistent world. I\u2019ll explain it with more details in the next point, as it touches the same aspect:\n\n2. Dependency on gear\n\nFirst of all, Gloria Victis is an MMORPG, with the full RPG aspect and with no magic. It means that there is character progression, which still has to remain credible enough \u2013 so while most MMORPGs would involve magical features to let you boost your character, Gloria Victis puts more emphasis on the equipment selection. Moreover, the equipment itself is strongly tied to the player-driven economy, which is one of the core pillars of Gloria Victis as a MMORPG with persistent world.\n\nHowever, the combat mechanics make selection of the equipment to counter the enemy\u2019s armor more important than the item\u2019s level on its own. As an example, even the best sword in-game will deal less damage to an enemy wearing full heavy armor than a starting bludgeoning weapon \u2013 which greatly increases the variety of viable builds and tactics, depending on the battle scenario. This mechanic, among many others, has been explained in details in this tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOsaO3FtKC0&\n\n2. Archery\n\nActually, the archers can be so effective in battles \u2013 especially when defending a castle \u2013 that many players have felt forced to wear heavy armor all the time, as many archers can focus on specific targets and hit them from large distance. For this reason, we\u2019ve made some balance tweaks to achieve 2 goals: allow for more variety in viable builds for melee fighters and increase the meaning of skilled and devoted archers. For this reason, archers now have a number of dedicated passive abilities to choose from and each type of bow \u2013 regular, reflex and long bows \u2013 is viable against a given type of armor.\n\n3. Friendly Fire\n\nThis topic has been discussed many times, so let\u2019s make a short summary. We\u2019ve already tried friendly fire turned on all the time, but it caused problems in dense battles, like in shieldwall formation which is a natural choice in castle sieges. A single player could simply get into a group of enemies who couldn\u2019t even hit him. Anyway, we have plans to improve the group vs group combat, i.e. we\u2019re now working on the diminishing number of targets being hit for cleave effect when hitting through allies.\n\n4. Slowing down\n\nActually, there is a pretty simple mechanic allowing you to slow down the enemy: legshot with full power. This mechanic is in the game for pretty long time already.\n\n5. Spinning\n\nWe are carefully analysing why even the players would like to spin more than they would naturally and constantly improve the combat mechanics. For instance, the recent updates introduced the rotation speed clamp for kicking (such a clamp has already been present for any other combat situation). There are also the improved blocking markers which let the players set custom colors for them so they don\u2019t blend with the background, and thus spinning/changing the direction of rotation quickly to misguide the opponent is not a viable tactic anymore.\n\n6. Community\n\nGloria Victis is a competitive game with persistent world \u2013 many players know each other well, so taunting is a natural thing. However, we keep doing all we can to make the game\u2019s world a pleasant place. We have expanded our moderation staff some time ago which really helped improve the players behaviors and reduce the overall toxicity. Of course, being a really small independent development team, we\u2019re not able to watch the in-game chat all the time, but there\u2019s an in-game player reporting system which has proven many times to be very effective. If you\u2019d ever experience any problems with some other player\u2019s behavior, please simply report it using the in-game tool which can be accessed in the ESC menu \u2013 our moderation staff reads all the reports daily.\n\nAnd the last thing: Gloria Victis is still in development. It\u2019s not feature-complete yet and some mechanics will naturally change and improve over-time, according to the current needs of our Community. The point is that we\u2019re actively talking to our players and listening to their suggestions, at the same time updating the game every single week. For this reason I hope that you\u2019ll give us another chance someday and find the game more enjoyable, and fun to play.\n\nHave a great day!\n\nBest regards,\nBartold"}, "49280736": {"recommendationid": "49280736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035417773", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 33702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24409, "last_played": 1681428341}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello there, person who is wondering about this title. Let's get started!\n\nI highly recommend picking up Gloria Victis. If you are able to catch it during a sale that's a great time to do it, but if not, the game is easily worth the normal $20 price. \n\nMy brother and I started playing about 4 months ago, and quickly fell in with a great guild on NA - Ismir, Aesir. They helped train us up, and generally showed us the ropes. You probably don't care too much about the details of my experience, so here is a list of reasons why I have recommended the game to friends.\n\nThe World:\nOne of the first things you are likely to notice is the sweeping vistas that lay before you while you're first exploring the world. Even after playing the game for several months, I still take a few moments to stop and appreciate a sunrise or sunset in game. The lighting is beautiful.\n\nLeveling:\nIt is very easy to level in Gloria Victis. The most efficient way is probably to use the arena and wait until the last twenty levels or so to complete the starter quests. This is also an excellent way to learn the combat system - though it may be more punishing than many would be willing to endure. If you run the initial quest line, however, you will end around level 30'ish. By completing other world events (blue circles on your map) and participating in PvP even a casual player will likely be level 100 within a week.\n\nGear:\nGear is easily attainable on the market, or from the corpses of your enemies. On the flip side, the loot system prevents you from losing more than two or three items in the event that you are the corpse, rather than the looter. \n\nCombat:\nThere are opportunities here and there, but generally I find the combat to be responsive, and skill-based. I have watched guild-mates who are excellent duelists run around on a low level alt and kill fully geared, level 100 opponents. If you are like me and are losing some of those \"twitch\" reflexes in your old age, you can still find ways to be successful. Timing, knowing how and when to feint,  when to block or drop your block, etc., all make a big difference. In extreme cases (like me - I suck), become the best damn medic you can be by rezz'ing people, filling gaps in a shield wall, or stabbing past the shield wall with a spear. \n\nPvP:\nI know, I already wrote a little about the combat, but this part is the \"context\" of that combat. I grew up playing Ultima Online, and later played Dark Age of Camelot for about 8 years. Gloria Victis doesn't have everything I loved about those games, but it's closer than many others have been. \n\nThere are three nations competing for territory. The map has an outer ring of castles (large flags) and resources (small flags), most of which serve as places to gather, farm, or manufacture goods. The ones closest to enemy borders tend to \"flip\" frequently. When you're looking for PvP action, you can usually find some around these areas. The other reason to capture these is that there are 3 \"temples\" where additional gear (weapons) can be obtained, and which have excellent resource nodes. Beyond the gear and resources, owning certain temples appears to annoy the other nations quite nicely. The castles act as a sort of buffer for those temples, because cutting off their supply lines by capturing the surrounding castles (visible on the map) will prevent guards from spawning at the temples. The most frequent PvP action (and non-loot siege events) occur in this outer ring. \n\nThe middle of the map is where things get to be much more fun. Guilds can claim castles in this territory, which offers some tangible benefits like additional resource nodes, crafting opportunities, etc. For my purposes, having a guild castle also provides you with another location to teleport to for certain world events, and again, owning one seems to generally annoy  your enemy nations. These castles usually flip far less frequently. In order to siege, or be sieged, the castle has to be \"tokened\" by an enemy guild, which allows you several hours to communicate with guildmates and arrange your defense efforts. It is a pretty common practice for other players from the same nation (but not the same guild) to assist in those defenses. \n\nUnfortunately, there are times when no attack comes - a strategy used by some over a period of weeks to reduce the number of defenders. On the plus side, that's a great opportunity to read a book/forum for an hour, or hang out in comms with some people from your nation who you might not otherwise get to know. When attackers do show up, the fights are intense, and full of loot.\n\nCatapults have recently been added, and it has added yet another dynamic to sieges which can aid both attackers and defenders. Figuring out how best to use these has been a lot of fun, and is still a work in progress for the people I run with.\n\nFarming/Crafting:\nThis is a thing in the game. People tell me they like it. Sometimes when I want to kill enemies, someone will say, \"One second, it's raining - I need to plant my crops.\" I don't farm/craft, so that's all I can say.\n\nThe People:\nMMOs are, in my experience, very much what you make of them. A big part of that is finding a decent group of people to spend your in-game time with. Find yourself a group like that; a group you can have fun with and that can guide you through some of the experiences in-game that are not fully explained. Your experience will be better for it, and the game will be better for having more people like that. There are some trolls, just like every game, but it is my experience that they are a minority. Also, muting people is very easy should the need arise.\n\nI hope you found that useful, and I hope to see you in-game, either as an ally or a loot bag! :)\n\n~ Cir", "timestamp_created": 1551369795, "timestamp_updated": 1551370811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769945383071899414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67874337": {"recommendationid": "67874337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041213870", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 198193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 170570, "last_played": 1605701328}, "language": "english", "review": "GV is an epic game but I feel compelled to come here and complain about a few things:\n\n- It's sad to see what the free building patch has done to guild castles.

As an avid fan of non-time restricted  Realm vs Realm games like Dark Age of Camelot, Warhammer Online, Guild Wars 2, and Elder Scrolls Online I have found Gloria Victis quite enjoyable. It has gone through a lot of changes over the years. Some the community loved, others the community hated, but the one thing that remained true was the developers ability to listen to feedback and adjust. Looking through several of the reviews on steam you can see the eb and flow of this games life. Through the bright spots, and the dark. \n\nWhat I can tell you as a person that has spent almost 300 hours with the game is that this game is ever changing for the better. The developers are not afraid to admit their mistakes and revert systems that didn't work out as well as they plan. They have had a constant ear to the community and have adapted to the desires of the many. They host regular surveys for everyone to participate in and listen to the feedback provided.\n\n[b]The Current State of Gloria Vicits (Pre-1.0)[/b]\nEach round of changes improves the game. Over the past few months we've seen the safe zone for new players to learn and gain an understanding on the game grow. There is a much larger area that they can go and not worry about being looted. For those who like a little bit of risk with their reward the center of the map features everything your heart desires.  In addition a storyline and full main quest line was introduced to help guide players through the various system and explain the why behind the three realm war.  In addition it has had another round of graphical improvements, a enlarged map, combat improvements, and more. Every week brings a wealth of new improvements as they approach the 1.0 release.\n\n[b]My Take[/b]\nGloria Victis is a indie MMORPG that does it right. You can tell the developers care about their game and pour their hearts into it. It is in a constant state of evolution and is constantly improving. When evaluating this game as a possible purchase you should disregard older reviews as much has changed since a year ago or even a few months ago. Things that have been complained about have been resolved and there is a wealth of activities and opportunities for players of all types. Even people who hate PvP can find enjoyment in this game now. There are tons of popup events, crafting, exploring, and hunting that can keep you entertained for a while. If you go into this expecting a AAA MMORPG experience you will be sadly disappointed. This team is about 1/50th the size of most mainstream MMORPG's but what they lack in numbers they exceed with heart and passion for their game. \n\n[b]Pro's[/b]\n* Responsive development team\n* Activities you can do while AFK or do them faster by engaging the activity\n* Friendly community that is helpful\n* A Low Cost Buy-2-Play Title\n* A really cool Clan System that lets you design your own coat of arms.\n* Castle Management & Upgrades add some value to keep taking.\n\n[b]Con's[/b]\n* Combat takes some getting used to.\n* Steep learning curve to PvP. You'll die a lot early on and thats ok!\n* Population isn't too high yet. Still a small MMORPG with just 3 servers and a thousand or so people playing. \n* Needs more marketing, promotion, content creators. Gotta get the word on the street more. Most people don't even know this gem exists.\n\n[b]Quick Tips[/b]\n* If you have a 12 button mouse configure your mouse to use each of those buttons for a directional attack. This makes combat and farming much easier as each thumb button can be for a different attack. \n* Stay on the outer ring until you get the feel for combat and how things flow. \n* Talk to the community, there are tons of players that will help you if you simply ask. \n* Take some time to explore and take in the sights. The atmosphere in this game is quite nice.\n\nYou can catch me streaming this game on occasion at https://twitch.tv/gaiscioch or check out our community at https://www.gaiscioch.com/ We're always looking for new players to help learn the game!", "timestamp_created": 1671566581, "timestamp_updated": 1671566581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.76571500301361084", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44763345": {"recommendationid": "44763345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067645706", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1817, "last_played": 1663517950}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love games like Kingdom Come , Mount and Blade , and MMOs.

This tells me, that they aim to deliver and care about the wishes of their customers, the true way of developing a video game. \n\n\nI kept an open mindset and acknowledged, that this is a early access game and in this updated review, I try to bring out the pros & cons of my current experience with the game. Decide for yourself on what is important for you, here's what I've experienced:\n\nPros: \n* Active community. Community is friendly and helpful (find a guild immediately and they will show you everything you need to know). There are enough players, that will try to hunt you down in the open and if you're lucky, some of your own will fight to assist you.\n* Dedicated developers who actually care about what the community wishes, feedback is appreciated, fair to say, that the team behind this is customer satisfaction oriented.\n* PvP focused combat development (a good thing if you are into PvP like I am), PvP combat is what the game currently lives for. If you are having troubles, check your \"Direction Indicator Sensitivity\" option, it is not where mouse speed option is (which would be much more convenient), check under game play settings.\n* Massive battles (sieges, open battles etc).\n* Interesting and challenge able skill based combat system, directional to be specific (something similar to \"Mordhau\" and \"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\").\n* Massive crafting system, many items to choose from, recipes to be learned etc, something for any completionist.\n* Personal heraldry - customization option if you like shields, I really appreciate such features, I wish I could also paint my gear and maybe even use war-paints before going to battle. A round shield for template (Ismirs side) in customizing shields would be nice (atm I design emblems for round shield, but the template is not round upon which one can put them).\n* Awesome skins for items. Fair prices regarding skins (about 10\u20ac for a sword skin for example), discounts are also a thing here, easy way to look good and help towards development. Not sure how many skins are there or how often is their availability rotated, but they look awesome! I would recommend adding even more, to speed up the development process where money is a question, these type of game development can be quite costly.\n* Not a pay to win game.\n* Frequently updated. Improvements towards old functionalities and introduction of new elements.\n* In-game progress rewards, quite often occurring, which is a nice thing, items feel hard to come for a long time, I wish there was an option to see an equip/reveal window when choosing between three common type gear rewards, that to choose \"the best looking\". Also, the armor parts, they are not as easy to come by, but easy to lose when in PvP area (that's where the quests lead you).\n\n\nCons:\n* Lag spikes, time to time not constantly (including rubber-banding, I got solid connection), I hear they are working on these issues at all times and it has gotten much better, good progress there.\n* PvE combat is quite bad, fighting NPCs can be quite frustrating, it's something to tolerate until you reach level 100 (I was able to reach 53 within a day of playing). The worst part about it is, that the PvE combat has no immersion, it just feels empty at current stage, hits are not always registered, opponents could be because targets can be \"jumpy\" in a chaotic way (bit of few meter teleportation here and there). Also, a side note here is that wild-life is designed to attack you in any scenario, even if you do not aggro first (perhaps it could be changed to the point where angry birds don't chase you when you pass them?).\n* User interface that feels like something from early 2000's (similar to Gothic 2...), perhaps different theme options could be added (different colors might help for a start, transparency option as well if possible)? Maybe there are already in-game possibilities to change, something that I have not noticed. \n* Not enough guidance and reset possibilities for abilities/stats setup (would be great to have unlimited resets, I'd say that this is a must have feature (even if it would cost in-game currency), so that players could learn from their mistakes and develop their play style with ease). I can see this being a limit for people who are not very talkative to go and ask their guild mates.\n* Horses and their usage - horses age and become less useful (not sure what it really means yet, they do not die though) after riding them for a while, I would not recommend such approach, rather let people bond with their rides and make them stronger in time (average horse lives from 25 to 30 years if realism is the goal). Their spawn time is about 15 seconds (bit long in my opinion, could be less unless in combat area or recent combat interactions, currently quite annoying setup). Their way of spawning (inside the character) is also bit off. I understand that this feature was just recently introduced, I hope it is getting some changes, also with movement speed (which is way too slow at all times). Good side of this is that you can tame a horse and name it, but haven't seen different colors. Horses also have stats which I do not yet understand (what do the stats stand for?).\n* Lack of voice acting. Perhaps this could be solved with simply hiring some people from the street to voice act through the main story line, this would help, even if side quests do not have it. It could later be replaced with professional voice acting if needed. Something to consider I suppose.\n* World feels quite empty in regards to models and some of the models are just not looking right (water hangs in the air, dead bodies the same, not everywhere though, some scenery is actually very well made, like bodies on spikes etc). I wish the homesteads and main areas in the world would have more models within them, would create some immersion.\n* Lack of compass option, it is possible to mark an X on the map though, but a centered compass option would be much welcomed by many for sure, especially new players, sense of direction could be improved by that.\n* Lack of quality PvE content in general, which is not a major issue (considering the stage of development) for those who would like to try out this early access, PvP makes up for this.\n\n\nAdditional thanks for good communication from developer side regarding my troubles with the game.\n\nDeveloper (BartoldGV) who responded to my feedback was very open about the possibility of changes and explained the whole background of having relatively small team working on the game, 15 people as I mentioned before. Understanding their model, the way of working, I understand, that changes take more time than for for their mega-corporate competitors- I can respect that, which brings me to a understanding that they have actually accomplished quite much since the beginning of development.\n\n\nCombat presentation/overview:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOsaO3FtKC0&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=GloriaVictisMMO\n\n\nI would also mention that optimization of the game is not as bad as I expected, I haven't participated in massive fights yet (people say they turn their settings low for those), but I run on high/very high settings and have something between 60 and 120 fps most of the time. Massive battle brought my fps to 32 at minimum.\n\nMy rig:\nCPU: i8700k (4.70 GHz)\nGPU: GeForce RTX 2070 Super\nRAM: 16 GB\n\nI will try to update my review again in the future when I have played more.", "timestamp_created": 1599499373, "timestamp_updated": 1599599446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762132227420806885", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1599555876, "developer_response": "Hello,\n\nThank you for your honest feedback! We read all the reviews in search for precious feedback, and yours is quite interesting! However, I\u2019d like to address some of your concerns.\n\nSpeaking of combat, would you be that kind and tell us what exactly causes the \u201cvery bad\u201d feeling for you? We\u2019re continuously working on that aspect as it\u2019s one of the core features of Gloria Victis, and almost every weekly update introduces smaller or bigger improvements to combat, controller and synchronization. However, we might have simply got used to it, the same as more experienced players who spent hundreds, or thousands of hours in the game, and having such fresh insight from a new player would be priceless.\n\nOn the other hand, I greatly appreciate your will to learn the combat and practice it. Obviously it\u2019s great to learn from the experienced players, but I believe you\u2019ll benefit from watching this combat mechanics breakdown which explains both the basics and the advanced techniques:\nhttps://youtu.be/FOsaO3FtKC0\n\nAs for horses, they don\u2019t actually die of old age but become less useful at their max age. Horse recall time, unfortunately, can\u2019t  be too short, or it would be possible to call you horse out of the blue in the middle of a PVP battle. This would allow players to escape immediately when it becomes risky, and we actually want players to think and take the risk, not cheat it around.\n\nAnd for the materials in crafting, such as the fuels you\u2019ve mentioned, have you checked if you can swap them to select the ones you want to use? Many recipes allow you to use alternative materials, may it be such a case? Also, could you tell me what unusable items have you encountered?\n\nSpeaking of looting gear in PVP, it\u2019s one of the mechanics required to make the items crafted by players valuable and, in the effect, to allow having the truly player-driven economy, which is one of the 3 main pillars of the game, among Open PVP and Territory Control. Also, the possibility of being looted makes the tactics and cooperation much more important. And since going out in the best gear is somewhat risky, it helps to keep the power difference between veteran players and the others at a reasonable rate, so skill matters more than gear or level.\n\nAs for budget, you might not be aware of that, but we\u2019re an independent developer without any investor or publisher behind Gloria Victis. Moreover, the game was a startup made without any initial funding \u2013 we only have the income from the game\u2019s sales. And since Gloria Victis is an MMORPG (that\u2019s the genre where an average game costs dozens of millions USD to develop, and hundreds of developers, while we\u2019re a team of just 15 guys with pretty limited funds) well, we have to choose wisely what to work on.\n\nThat\u2019s why we engage our players, to share their feedback, ideas and the current needs. The players can do it with the in-game questionnaires, but also on our official Discord. https://discord.gg/3vKpTu5\n\nSpeaking of the skins prices, we believe it\u2019s a fair situation \u2013 that\u2019s the only type of the game that is only to be obtained for real money (or from the Market, if other players put them on sale) but it\u2019s 100% cosmetic and gives no measurable advantage. Everything else can as well be purchased for the in-game currency which you gain for just playing, so we stay as far from p2w as possible \u2013 and that\u2019s important for us and our players.\n\nWe agree that the game\u2019s interface has some room for improvements, and we\u2019re actually in the process of updating it. However it\u2019s quite a large game with many systems, so we do it step by step. If you could tell us what exact windows or other UI elements would you like to see updated first, it would help us a lot!\n\nAnd for the positives, I\u2019m happy to see you like the game\u2019s Community and the way the game promotes helping new players! I\u2019m also glad that you see the real progress. We work pretty hard on this game, regardless of being a team 10x smaller than average MMORPG developer, and we update it every single week \u2013 and knowing that our work pays back is a real motivation boost. I hope that, one day, you\u2019ll find the game fun enough to give it a positive review, as maintaining the positive ratio allows us to get more publicity and simply work faster on the game.\n\nHave a great day!\n\nBest regards,\nBartold"}, "30824274": {"recommendationid": "30824274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128710096", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7532, "last_played": 1506008794}, "language": "english", "review": "I've spent quite a bit of time in this game and here are my impressions:\n\nThe Good:\n\n-Non-lock combat with directional attacks and simple block mechanic\n-Variety of playstyles: a heavily armored knight wielding a greatsword, a light-armored two-handed axe user who flanks the enemy, or maybe even a deadly but vulverable archer?\n-Partial loot system makes getting kills rewarding but getting killed not a game-ruining experience\n-Leveling is relatively easy and quick: there are quests scattered around the map and \"world events\" that bring many players together for great XP and loot\n-Crafting is a worthwhile profession: it can make you lots of money and allows you to make the best gear available\n-Speaking of that, recipes are lootable but require craters to use them to create armor and weapons. This creates a strong trade economy.\n-Devs are dedicated and extremely active. Usually a patch per week that fixes a multitude of bugs and adds some new features.\n-Sieges are fun. Really fun. Seeing the banner fly over the (newly added!) keep after breaking down several gates and fighting the player and NPC garrison is very satisfying. Defending a castle against superior numbers and winning is great and even losing can be rewarding - you'll go home with bags full of loot!\n-Graphics are ok. Nothing to marvel at but good for an MMO. They are improving slightly as new graphics settings are added.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-Animations are a bit odd (especially jumping) and can sometimes be a bit glitchy. However, new motion-capture animations are promised to being coming in an update soon.\n-The weapon balance isn't too good. Two-handed axes do insane damage, while greatswords are only viable if you're wearing heavy armor and need to conserve stamina. One handers are generally bad and are only good when a shield is needed for a formation or when facing large groups at a chokepoint. Spears fill a useful role for stabbing through gates and standing behind shieldwalls.\n-Player counts on some servers are low (Russia, SE Asia, and Oceania mainly) but US and EU servers are always very populated.\n-Community is generally helpful and positive, but there is some turmoil among the many guilds (which has sometimes led to civil war and teamkilling)\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n-THE DESYNC: The desync is sometimes insanely bad, to the point where the location of an enemy will be shown to you with a one second delay, causing none of your hits to connect and blocking to be almost impossible. This isn't always a problem (most of the time the desync is fairly minor) but it's most annoying when playing an archer. The desync fix should come soon with the new animations.\n-The optimization: This being an early access game, some lag is to be expected. If your system isn't too up-to-date, don't expect good framerates. Now that I'm playing on a 1070 and a 6700k I get 60-70 FPS at 1440p ultra, but on a laptop with a 940m I was getting 15-20 at 1080 on minimum/off settings. The game is constantly getting small performance bumps though.\n-The faction system. Players can create characters of both factions and switch between them easily. This allows enemies to create characters that teamkill and open gates to make taking castles easier. This ruins the game for everyone.\n\ntl;dr\n\nThe game is fun with good base mechanics. The combat is a highlight and the devs are hard at work, releasing patches frequently.

PvP is a truely rewarding experience, it is easy to grasp but if you manage to master it you will make a name for yourself amongst your allies and your foes. There is a partial loot system which is perfect I believe. The risk of losing something you put time and effort into crafting causes you to choose your fights carefully, but not so much so that you never see PvP. \n\n     If you really want to get the most out of Gloria Victis join a guild and get to know them, learn how they fight, and discuss strategies. Top tier gear and weapons will not save you from an equally numbered enemy with a well thought out/executed strategy. Another rewarding feeling in GV is being part of a guild that has made itself well known even across servers. \n\n    Crafting in this game is amazing. See something you'd like to have? First of all you have to find the recipe. Then travel throughout the world gathering the resources you will need to craft all of its components. Bring your materials back to a castle your nation owns, and take those materials through numerous processes at various workstations. What you just made could be a standard piece of equipment, but with a little luck it could be Pristine. Every piece of armor and weapon in the game ranges from base stats to +6. Your chance to create a +6 item depends on your reputation, the crafting station you are using, the level of your profession, and the amount of territory your nation owns. This motivates even the crafters to come out and PvP. \n\n     The developers are constantly making improvements and fixing bugs found by the players,and has made a lot of progress since I began playing.

We are happy to see you spent so much time in the game and still providing some positive aspects of it at the end of your review. Please allow us to address some of your points, as we would like to clear some matters for you and others who read our game reviews.\n\nI think you should be aware that the very most of the \"autoblock\" reports which were happening in the past were reports against our game developers. Precisely - combat system designers, who know the system very well and know every aspect of it.\n\nWe have seen some people being able to do such things in the past, many years ago precisely speaking, (they all have been banned) and from that time we have reworked our code, did many more anti-cheat measurements, and gave so many counters to players it is impossible to be a workable and usable auto-blocker in here. If anyone can do such a thing and prove it to us, we would reward this player like he would be reporting a critical bug. We have mentioned that many times already for years, and while many tried, no one was able to prove they can do anything like that.\n\nNation Change Scrolls were removed from the game in the past because of their impact on servers' balance and community. And yes, it helped us to balance the servers in the short run, but new issues emerged soon after. We do not want players to feel trapped in the nation - especially in situations where guild or friends of a player transferred to Underdog nation, and someone was left due to inactivity or simply missing the opportunity. This is why we brought the scrolls back. Please remember that this is impossible to exploit them in the way you pointed out, as it is impossible to transfer to the nation that is dominating the remaining two nations on the server.\n\nWe can already tell that upcoming map changes you can expect within a week or two will have a very positive impact on the server situation. We will change the way how the game can be played and create more space for both - PVP and PVE gameplay, allowing players to grow roots and always have something fun to do in the game. We are also redesigning the guild content, making it so that every small guild will be able to represent itself, have its piece of land, have fun in its way and prosper. Nobody will be dependent on huge guilds and veteran players' power.\n\nI hope you will stay in the game and will be here to see the changes and improvements we prepared for you. Maybe you will be able to give the game thumbs up for our efforts, understanding, and care. We are always here, and we are listening.

I personnally joined a small guild when I started and the first time we captured Audunstede (am I spelling that right?) we were ecstatic, we took selfies everywhere\n-When you kill someone in 1v1 it's just... seriously I can't really explain it you'll have to expereience it yourself but I remember one time when I was around lvl 20 two midlanders came at me guns blazing and everything and I managed to 2v1 them without taking a single hit. Just imagine how powerful I felt ^^\n\n\n\nWhat I didnt like:\n(Scratch the first one, you are now limited to 1 faction per account, I won't remove it because I wan't people to know that the devs are listening to their community)\n-Since you can create a character in each faction you can switch side anytime, so if your guys struggle to take a location you can switch side and sabotage the enemy, you can open the doors, shoot some arrows at your allies  when they dont look, you can block them... \n-The bank, the fact that you need to buy new slots and bags for your own bank pisses me off and it discourage me to start crafting because money isnt that easy to make if you don't sell your item to other players... \n-I have no confirmation that they didnt add one but I looked for one and didnt find it... The guild bank... For items I mean, this game absolutely needs this. I remember my guild's crafters having to keep the guild's stuff on themselves or in their own bank struggling to craft new items because they were out of space...

I am now providing one that is based on my own opinions and conclusions. I offer apologies to any offended parties.\n\nI'll start with my biggest gripe about the game. Gloria Victis has been a game that's been playable for over 3 or more years. It's a purchased game that features a fully operational microtransaction store with gameplay complete enough to have fully functioning and playable map, numerous \"seasons\" of glory (A point system you increase by killing enemy faction members and attacking their holdings), and a large number of events including streaming events that you likely see above. This is not an early access game. This is not a game in alpha. Should you play this game, I wholeheartedly recommend you treat this as a fully created game that is receiving content updates.\n\nThe gameplay features a four directional combat system. You have overheads, lefts, rights, and stabs. The blocking features a similar four direction however you can block stabs and overhead with either vertical direction. You can feint and kick your foes as well. Compared to games like Mount and Blade, Mordhau, and Chivalry (all similar melee combat type of games), there is significantly less that you can do as a character in combat. It isn't as indepth compared to its competing games. \n\nGloria Victis is open world, boasting to be similar to Planetside 2 when it comes to open world engagements. This could not be further incorrect in my opinion. Instead I recommend you look to games like Darkfall that feature similar holdings. This game does indeed have three factions, all capable of capturing holdings throughout a decently sized map. However this system feels more like an afterthought and build up to what would be considered the \"endgame\" (I will mention this later) of Gloria Victis. In which castles are held by guilds, not factions. (I should note that it tends to be faction vs faction combat either way, however the way that they have built the system makes me feel like factions are rather pointless in this part of the game.)\n\nSpeaking of endgame, there is very little. Reaching level 100 is the official end of your progression. There is no prestige, alternate advancement, flag, reward, or anything along those lines in the PvE area that encourages you to further play your character. This game is by no means a true PvE game in my opinion, despite the extensive crafting, farming, and event systems that they have. This is far more a PvP game, and until they finally begin providing content toward a true endgame, I would heavily recommend treating it like that.\n\nAs for the reason I view this game negatively. It has been in development for a long time yet does not have the polish nor completeness of what the game should be. It is heavily riddled with bugs. And despite the community's efforts on helping report these bugs, there is always far more than what should be there. Making progress on the open castles is pointless, as any ground you make one day can and will be gone overnight. Features such as Unstuck to Nearest Spawn allow for players to ignore the repercussions of being out of position or somewhere else. Fast travel encourages players to remain at the capital city of their faction at almost all times. There is little value into leaving the capital city unless you seek to fight other players. The gameplay, while fun in some cases, ultimately feels lackluster compared to the other choices. Finally, and I will not give details, the Development Team is a double edged sword of constant communication. You can reach them easily by simply looking at most negative reviews, joining the official GV discord, or finding them else where on social media. They are very active, and it is refreshing to see that activity. However, they are involved in enough drama to choke a horse. Often times you will see one or two of them conflicting with players. They are in [b]desperate[/b] need of someone to be PR for them so that they can remain focused on completing their game.\n\nIf you believe that none of this is an issue, then by all means I do recommend the game to you. It is fantastic with friends. But the problem is so is anything else.

I\u2019m sorry to see you\u2019re not satisfied with the game as a whole, but I would like to elaborate a bit about the game\u2019s completion and content, especially as you didn\u2019t play the game over the last 3 months.\n\nFirst of all, you said that there\u2019s no content to do after reaching level 100. Right from the day of Early Access launch, Gloria Victis continuously receives a steady flow of updates \u2013 at least one per week. These updates introduce fixes to bugs reported by our players, improvements requested by the Community, and new features and content.\n\nOver the time in which you didn\u2019t play, we applied 15 regular updates. Along many changes, they introduced:\n\u2013 Player-built siege engines (and other new objects built by the players), which changed the sieges over castles a lot;\n\u2013 Weekly Rankings, which allow players to compete each other in various activities even after reaching the level cap \u2013 this feature requested by Community and nicely expands the competitive content, adding to the already existing Glory and Arena rankings (former rewarding players for activity in RvRvR battles, and the latter rewarding individuals for advancing in ranked duels leaderboard);\n\u2013 A new world event \u201cFall of the Exile\u201d, which is a PVE raid for larger groups (with optional PVP, as it takes place in the open-world location, so other factions can access it too);\n\u2013 Another new world event \u201cAbandoned Route\u201d, a dungeon-like content designed for groups of 5 players where you can gain a lot of valuable resources;\n\u2013 Taverns to be built and upgraded by players in castles and towns controlled by their nation/guild;\n\u2013 Many improvements to combat and its balance, as well as to the RvRvR balance as a whole;\n\u2013 Numerous roleplay additions, like a dice game which expands the non-combat content and displaying guild emblems on shields.\n\nThese are just some features from the last 15 updates. Anyway, we don\u2019t consider Gloria Victis a \u201cfully created game\u201d yet. It is still not feature complete \u2013 we say it clearly in the store description:\n\u201cPlease remember that the game is currently in alpha stage and you may experience some issues or some of the features may not be implemented yet. We recommend supporting us only if you want to help us develop the game!\u201d\n\n\nOf course, as you said, the game is designed and developed in a way that it\u2019s fully functional and playable since Early Access launch, but it\u2019s still not the final release yet. Reason is pretty simple: while it\u2019s a standard for MMORPGs to be created by teams of hundreds, we\u2019re a small indie company with about 15 guys on-board, so it takes time.\n\nSpeaking of factions \u2013 this kind of open PVP everlasting confilct is one of the Gloria Victis main pillars, and guild+controlled castles are another layer of it. It\u2019s true that Gloria Victis has a pretty strong emphasis on PVP itself, but we believe that the nations system makes it easier for new players to join the game and make an impact on the game\u2019s world than you have in the classic open-world PVP games which primarily focus on the guild content.\n\nSumming up, I\u2019m wondering if you could possibly re-think if we really deserve a negative review just for the fact that the game isn\u2019t fully completed (both feature- and content-wise) yet. We know it, and we say it clearly. We\u2019re not a super-large team, but I believe our hard work is easily visible. We update the game every week, we\u2019re as transparent as possible and we carefully listen to our Community. In the end, you\u2019ve already got almost 400 hours of playtime, which is always a nice feeling for any game developer after all. :)\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nBest regards,\nBartold"}, "59250515": {"recommendationid": "59250515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101854371", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3051, "last_played": 1646796085}, "language": "english", "review": "Gloria Victis: First Impressions & Initial Experiences:\n\nI've had the game for a few weeks now and have played about 8 or 9 evenings + 1 weekend (Not much really, due to Thanksgiving and holiday travel). I am level 63 or 64 as of last night.\n\nI've participated in 4 Sate of War, large group combats, spent 1 night roaming around with a group of 7 or 8 for light skirmish PvP, and also got about half my levels just grinding the Arena to learn how to fight (status: poorly. I fight very very poorly. :P). A few of my levels came unintentionally through SoW PvP, which felt nice.\n\nFor the few hours I've logged in the game I feel it has already earned the $20 I spent on it. I've joined a fun and very helpful guild and have had a blast learning and playing from/with them.\n\n\nMy First Impressions (related to combat & PvP):\n1. No one denies the combat is a little slower than most games today. This took some adjusting as I came from Conan Exiles and a tiny bit Ark/Scum. This slow down I feel is necessary (and welcomed by me, tbh) for the direction combat. I've never played Mount and Blade and the directional swinging/blocking + shield bash + kicking in combat have been quite a bit overwhelming, but fun. Last night I managed to get 3 kills in 1v1 Arena with a shield/short spear and it felt VERY rewarding. I like the slowed down, more intricate combat system.\n\n2. Slowness acknowledged, it doesn't feel that way at all in large group PvP. You (or I've at least) find that 80% of the battle is movement, shield wall, blocking, and making the 4 or 5 smart attacks that drop the important enemies to keep your group alive. I love it.\n\n3. 1v1 PvP still feels clunky to me and I need practice. I'm pretty miserable at it still so all I can offer is that the free, no-penalty 1v1 Arena is probably the best way to learn the mechanics of combat. And you get a VERY good amount of exp doing this. It that EXP from 1v1 scales with your lvl vs. your opponent's lvl, I always gain about 15-40% of my current lvl (that's 15% of a level for LOSING).\n\n4. The castle siege/defend mechanic is awesome so far. At my first SoW event I was in the 30s, with bad gear, so useless little me just drove the battering ram around... felt great to contribute! and even greater to knock down doors with a battering ram!\n\n5. Small group raids on the various settlements, villages, and towns are very fun. Even if you don't stir up some PvP ... you get exp for capping points and frequently find some decent crafting materials as loot. You live in a constant state of \"oh \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 what happens if 15 of them show up and it's just 7 of us...\"\n\n\nNon-PvP Impressions:\n1. All community members seem to be really helpful. I enjoy that the game is about large scale PvP and the players want to protect the quality of that over everything else. People have been throwing consumables, gear, and information at me as fast as I can use it/them so that I can better contribute in war.\n\n2. I love the intricate crafting system. It took a while to reverse engineer how everything seems to work and go together, but it's great. It is also super easy to get distracted gathering and crafting everything...\n\n3. Leveling. if you want to lvl fast for PvP I suggest ignore crafting skills. Just gathering and selling raw mats for $$ will more than support your gear needs. Focusing on the quests and grinding out the area (blue circle) missions as you move across the map seems to be the best. Both your quests and the Area Missions give good exp and usually decent items and $$.\n\n3. The auction house seems to have a decent amount of medium-level gear and ok prices. I still suggest finding a guild and just supplying a high lvl member the mats to make you stuff. The AH is mostly a way to redistribute crafting components from what I've seen, as it's cheaper to buy the stuff and have a friendly crafter make your items.\n\n4. Gear: Even with crappy gear and weapons, if you work as a group your damage can be a significant boon in group PvP. My wooden mallet (one of the first things you learn to make) at quality level 6 delivered the killing blow on 4 players in one SoW battle. There seems to be more or less about 5 tiers of gear, and any piece of gear can have 6 (7 with special items) qualities. A Tier 3 weapon only requires basic steel, and grinding out of a few of them for a +4 to +6 quality (random) is pretty easily done and feels perfectly serviceable in warfare.\n\n5. Looting the people you murder. Or being looted by your murderer... The system seems balanced enough to me. I don't fully understand it, but basically looting a dead enemy costs some kind of points (which you've a limited amount of until you re-earn them somehow)... so you really have to want what you're taking. This keeps people from just robbing you blind. I died in my second battle pretty early on and THE ONLY ITEM I HAD WORTH TAKING WAS BANDAGES. After I was so scared they would take my super cool +6 axe I made...it was still garbage to them. lol\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI don't know what games you like, or how you prefer combat. I am pretty open minded as long as there is lots of group PvP stuff. In GV there is. It's great. If you're OK with a little ambiguity going into it, and you're willing to make friends and feel dumb asking questions, I think you'll do fine. You may even really like it. I really like it.\n\nGiven the cost of going to a movie, or out with friends for a few drinks, I would say the cost of Gloria Victis is well worth the enjoyable time you'll likely have.", "timestamp_created": 1575506340, "timestamp_updated": 1575506340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732838630676269531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62897764": {"recommendationid": "62897764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062519493", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11277, "last_played": 1581815328}, "language": "english", "review": "The combat in this game is what makes it terrible.

I\u2019ve got a feeling that there are some aspects which simply aren\u2019t explained good enough, or would indeed need more polish but we\u2019d need more details on it as well.\n\nFirst of all, the combat in Gloria Victis has been designed in the fashion of directional, non-target systems like in Mount and Blade or War of the Roses. However, in such matchmaking games the balance is usually targeted at ~50ms, since you have a variety of servers to choose from. Gloria Victis, though, is an MMORPG and has servers covering entire continents, so its combat dynamics have been tuned down to work with average 150ms latency.\n\nSpeaking of the other players appearing faster than you because of your ping \u2013 this shouldn\u2019t take place, unless you\u2019re playing with 200+ms more latency than the other player. Actually, there have been several situations when an American team won a 5v5 tournament at the EU server and vice versa. Maybe this feeling is caused by the fact that some transitions of the animations of enemy players are displayed a bit quicker on your end to give you more reaction time?\n\nAs for the spinning \u2013 we\u2019d like to get any more detailed insight why some players even do that and, if needed, apply required improvements, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nAlthough it has been said many times already, to fix a bug or improve a mechanic that needs it we must know what\u2019s working wrong. In 90% of the cases, the best way one can do to help us solve such an issue is to report it using the in-game bug-reporting tool, or to record it on a video and share it to us at support@gloriavictisgame.com \u2013 this way we can greatly reduce guessing, since we see the issue as the player sees it in a full picture.\n\nWe update the game every single week and 80% of each update are improvements and fixes requested by our players, so if you happen to experience an issue with the game, please be sure to report it so we\u2019ll have a chance to improve such an aspect.\n\nHave a great day!\n\nBest regards,\nBartold"}, "134014883": {"recommendationid": "134014883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026882309", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 62216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8473, "last_played": 1693521165}, "language": "english", "review": "MOST RECENT REVIEW: \n\nCannot in good faith recommend this experience to any of my friends.

There is hardly any proper PvP in this game.\n\nVery poor community management, on top of that nothing feels very meaningful when capturing a location.\n\nThere is actually no point to spending your time on upgrading or even defending a location properly. There aren't even any mechanics for it.\n\nIt's all pre placed destructible structures with very few upgrades available, none of which are even very meaningful, yet they are very expensive. You cannot build walls or anything to defend an objective. It all just gets \"zerged\" because your Nation is off doing PvE events\n\nThere are no voice communications, and most players don't type anything or even look at the chat box when orders are being given, IF any orders are being given at all. There is no way to make an announcement on the screen where the tunnel vision players will see it. \n\nSo many of the people in this game are just smooth brain shills and it shows, you see the same people every time you log in, and they are never doing anything different or better. It's always the same pointless crap.\n\nThere is a lot wrong with the game, bugs everywhere. Sure it shines in some areas, but once you've seen it, that's really all there is to it.

This one is a pretty big issue in my opinion, the combat system is awful its dreadful. It sounds great but its so poorly implimented, you can look up to attack or block from above and still will do a downward block or attack or even look up and somehow manage to attack from the right or left.... same goes for any direction really.... they need to get a centering feature implimented to make this more accurate....\n3. Game imput delay.... Now I have a direct ethernet connection before anyone responds to this and at a fairly high speed. Only on this game out of everything i play has the imput delay been so noticeable. Its not miliseconds its actual 1 or 2 second delay... Kicking is just one example i can push the button to kick but it takes noticeable time for the game to even register what i want it to do. \n4. Headshot hitboxes are inaccurate like smaller then the actual head and for archers that matters, unless your shooting them in the top half of their head it doesnt count as a headshot.... because a arrow in the mouth going out the back of your head apparantly doesnt do that much damage....\n5. The crafting system for the most part its great but some things however dont make any logical since, for instance if im a master crafter have maxed a skill out why do i have to pay someone for me to sign my own items i created with my name???? Let alone the fact that it costs a whole gold do so????? why do i somehow not know how to sign my own items as many master crafters obviously knew how to in that time period???? There are quite a few other things as well that are just like wtf??\n6. The \"monsters\" in this game are just well..... not very monster like..... There is a \"monster\" called a skeleton for prime example.... pretty easy and basic monster to make right????? well most people would think so, nope.... not here.... just took a normal npc make most of his skin pitch black and painted a skeleton on him that looks like a really bad childs halloween costume. From what i heard from other players they used to be actual skeletons but for some reason decided to not let them look as such anymore.....\n7. Dissapearing nodes... you can be out farming mining or w.e and the node of metal next to you or the tree in front of you will just vanish in to thin air without anyone touching it.\n8. Bugged horses that will randomly decide to climb ontop of your teamates who where next to you or you can watch your friends fly accross the screan...\n9. Your storage capabilitys are a complete and total joke, its extremely small and for some reason you have more room on your actual person to hold more things then you can in your depo/storage which makes no logical since. If they were to flip the depo capacity and the inventory max capacity around it would make things alot better.\n10. Somehow a two handed sword will swing faster then any other weapon in the whole game faster then any 1 handed weapon as long as you swing from the left.....\n\nThese are all the cons i can think of at the moment so next lets move on to pros:\n\n1: As long as you can find the right people the community for the most part is really great to get to know and get along fairly well.\n2: Something I think is really cool is you can talk to members of other factions but.... you cant. The game takes into account that all nations would have their own language so if you try to speak to anyone from a different faction what they see is a translated version of what you said into what the game has designed your nations language to so they cant really understand it unless your in the arena then you can speak  to other players normally.\n3: Despite the combat mechanics being horrible seiges themselves are really really fun.\n4. THIS GAME IS NOT ABANDOND. The devs seem to put out new updates every week, usually implimenting new things or sometimes breaking them but they try to fix what they break and try to add new aspects to the game which i really appreciate.\n\n\nNow gameplay and combat controls make me really want to not reccomend this game as its still a very unrefined game at this point... there are some great things about the game but not as many as i feel frustate other people about it especially my friends who ive tried to introduce to this game to get them to play with me that just felt like it wasnt good enough.

Sure, it's got its fair share of bugs and desyncs, but overall I can see that they have put a lot of thought into the combat system, the crafting system and the world map alike.\n\nYou load up the game and you are greeted by a character customisation screen with some simple elements to change such as gender, hair styles, height, and the other usual choices like eye/hair/skin colours etc. Once you've named your character and chosen a faction (each with its own lore), you are ready to join everyone else to fight for glory for your faction! (Or, you can be a traitor of course... depending on your game style)\n\nFor the first few levels I did a B-Line through the quests while I grasped the game. The combat is directional like you'd find in games such as mount and blade, and you can choose whether to aim your mouse or use shortcuts in order to attack a certain direction. There are sometimes issues with desync and latency but the devs have just today released a patch which is helping to combat such problems. Things aren't 100% perfect, but for a game which has a really active dev team, you can't really fault much.\n\nAfter I journeyed through the game a little, captured some enemy flags, got my first few kills and of course - died in a humiliating fashion, I discovered the crafting tree. And boy, oh boy, are you in for a ride there. You can't immediately craft everything, you have to discover recipes along the way - as well as buying them from vendors for a small fee (or more pricey if you want to buy the famous Knight's Chuck recipe for glory points - get PVPing bois!) but once you have recipes, then you can craft them. You may have to travel to a fair few places on the map in order to gather the materials needed for your craft, but there are lots of nice and unique things you can make. Including armor and weapons - or quality 10 foods in order to give yourself stamina boosts. Also, before I forget to include it, farming is another way to get your necessary materials. \n\nThat said, crafting can take a long time to level unless you monotonously craft thousands of one thing, while leaving the tab minimized to watch Netflix or whatever is popular with the kids these days. However, I personally have fun by just trying to craft whichever recipe looks interesting and helpful to me, and to my guild. Which is another thing. Guilds.\n\nGuilds are a wonderful way to seek the help in PVP and PVE victories that you need. Loot galore! Combat galore! Arena brawls, tournaments and actual castle sieging. In coordination with a guild, all of these things become extremely fun to do. However, be wary, as sometimes there are some guild politics within servers, and as a new player, you might find yourself a target for an old player's grudge.\n\nFinally I just wanted to comment on the actual graphics of the game. Unfortunately my rig is a piece of shit so I have to play on low-ish settings. But the game itself looks really good despite this. You can take some nice screenshots and explore the map for some really different and pretty looking surroundings. I took several hours just to explore the map alone, and hunt for hidden treasures which are scattered around, and I still only discovered a small section of the world map. It's honestly quite expansive.\n\nAll in all.\n\nPROS\nGood graphics\nAmazing combat concept\nIndepth crafting system\nFarming potatoes for lil spuds like me\nEasy to get into\nPlayer economy\nHilarious fall damage sound\n\nCONS\nRepetitive music, I had to turn it off.\nIssues with desync sometimes\nBugs, bugs and more bugs\nChat can be unnecessarily awful\nNot the most populated game\nSometimes on server restart, it can rollback your items.

A lot of times I take damage and can only tell because I looked at my health bar. I should hear and feel each impact I land or is landed more so than now.\n\nAgain, the game isn't perfect but I've really enjoyed my time with it so far. It's like an mmo M&B as many people have stated and it's a blast defending castles / towns / chasing people down on horse back / putting out fires etc with dozens or hundreds of people around. And when you get tired of combat just go fish, or craft, or play the marketboard. Or do some npc quests, or some other event.\n\nHopefully the devs have a lot more content planned in terms of events and possibly leagues. If they want to sell skins and glamours etc in the cashshop they better find a reason to have people stick around and come back. Holding down a never ending cascade of forts and castles does lose it's appeal after a while, when the battle line is never stable longer than you can sleep.\n\nPolish, again my only real suggestion to the devs. Polish what you have, make it better, don't shit on top of it and try to rub it in.", "timestamp_created": 1676394524, "timestamp_updated": 1676394524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724867463111877441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39931838": {"recommendationid": "39931838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198435789305", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11548, "last_played": 1666961487}, "language": "english", "review": "So you've seen the trailer, you've done a little bit of research on the game and you're like : Hey, this game looks pretty epic. Kind of like Mount and Blade in an open world. Seems pretty sweet!\n\nAfter playing the game for about ~200 hours it's fair to say I'm comfortable expressing my personal opinion with you on the current state of the game. \n\nThe gameplay is incredibly clunky, there's a huge desync issue. The combat isn't fluent at all. You'll find yourself getting hit when you shouldn't have. You'll often notice how the texture of a player is displayed in a position where the actual players hitbox isn't located. The game attempts to compensate for this but it results in what appears to be rubberbanding. Due to unstable internet connection the servers provide you'll also notice how animations aren't being displayed properly half the time. Resulting in rediclious gameplay.\n\nPopulation inbalance has huge impact on the game. 75 percent of the game is in one faction, leaving the other two subject to being zerged over and over again.\n\nBut hey, the game is in Early Access. So maybe you should try it so you can attempt to assist the developer by testing their game and giving them some feedback?\n\nI would not recommend this at the current time. Negative feedback isn't welcomed. Especially when you mention it in public. The Developers are too afraid they're going to lose players due to people not recommending the game. This results in the Developers attempting to silence criticism by shutting players up. If you do not comply with their request of cease and desist they will ban you.\n\nThe community is small due to it's small player base, this opens up people to frustration due to being confrontated by the same individuals over and over. Resulting in extremely salty behavior and an extremely hostile enviorement.\n\nThe Developers are more busy trying to implement useless features in the hope for better reviews on Steam then to actually polish the current things they've got into the game. You'll often see the developers complaining in their discord that they've had too many negative reviews on Steam. And they'll literally ask people to compensate by putting up some good ones.\n\nIn it's current state I cannot recommend the game.\n\nTL;DR, Cash grab, don't get tricked by the videos and promises.", "timestamp_created": 1518102733, "timestamp_updated": 1518102956, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722685396671295166", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55574110": {"recommendationid": "55574110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031577038", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3747, "last_played": 1676099727}, "language": "english", "review": "I have always mained as an archer in medieval type games and after coming back taking nearly year break from the game it seems they have destroyed archery in this game making it a melee slug fest.

I hope this combat tutorial video will give you an insight into them:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FOsaO3FtKC0\n\nOther than that, Gloria Victis becomes much more enjoyable when playing in a group. Have you already tried asking for a group or guild in your nation's chat? Most guilds are openly recruiting new players and helping them to level up, get equipment and learn the game's mechanics \u2013 and it will simply be the best way to get as much fun out of the battles as possible.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll give us another chance someday and eventually find Gloria Victis to be an enjoyable experience.

The system feels clunky at times where you will click to block or raise your shield and it just wont do it or it will block in the wrong direction or it will be delayed. \n\nThe main issue I have with the combat is that its not based on physical contact its like most other MMOs of this type where you hit in the general direction of the enemy and it will hit them if they don't block, this is particularly bad with spears or when you are running away you wont get touched but you will still take damage. Spears also do full damage no matter how close you are to someone, you could be in their face and they can still stab you for full damage\n\nAnother issue I found is with animations, sometimes the animations break and you will see people sliding (not t posing but similar) or attacking without moving their weapons this is usually the case with NPCs making it a pain to deal with them.\n\nAdditionally, rubber banding in this game can be really bloody bad... a rubber banding player paired with a spear was the most cancerous thing I have encountered in this game so far.\n\nLastly, there is a system in place that encourages players to join the underdog faction by offering additional xp and loot and whilst this is good on paper it ends up creating a skill gap where you have a hoard of new players (like myself) vs maxed level players with end game gear for this reason there will be people who don't even join events because of it for example I joined a death valley event this morning where there were only 3 players on my team (myself included) vs 20 on each of the enemy teams (there are 3 factions so it was 3 vs 20 vs 20)\n\n\n\nEdit: I have now made an archer and discovered even more issues with the game\n\n- Arrows will phase through enemies and deal no damage, you can see the trail of the arrows go through the enemy.\n- Spears seem to be affected by the no animation (bug?) more than any other weapon, people have just been staring at me and I take damage\n- There are some cheaters who use scripts to automatically block attacks (These encounters are apparently rare though)\n- Enemy players sometimes turn invisible when they are right next to you (this has only happened a handful of times)\n- When upgrading castles you can contribute 99% of the resources but you get 0 exp because  only the person that completes the upgrade gets the xp (this happened to me I was 1 log short and someone stole the upgrade)\n- Enemies in Heavy armour can somehow outrun you whilst swinging their weapons even when you weigh a lot less than them\n- Players can sometimes Block/chamber attacks from behind (they can also on occasion hit you whilst you are behind them)\n- NPCs will sometimes block attacks (namely from arrows) whilst they have a bow equipped\n- Blocking on a horse rarely works, only seems to work somewhat reliably against other enemies on horses\n- Servers aren't great, sometimes everything works fine other times you will have a delay (I believe this is the reason for players instantly appearing behind you, attacks hitting you before the animation has even started, blocks/attacks being delayed etc) [my ping is always around 45 btw]\n- Attacks will pass through certain terrain like some boulders and trees, this results in ranged NPCs sometimes shooting arrows at you when you cant even see them\n- NPCs will sometimes instantly change attack direction or block without any indication (for example the indicator and animation would suggest an overhead swing but when you attack the attack gets blocked and you still get hit, as if it the NPC was doing 2 actions at once).\n- Sometimes when trying to block it doesn't actually block the attack, you can block in the correct direction but the indicator wont change causing you to get hit, on a similar note you can block in one direction and look at the floor and magically block attacks from both the left and right (practically all players do this)\n- Interactions break easily, you can be trying to get on your horse, upgrade buildings, mine, farm, loot, woodcut whatever you do if you cancel the interaction by mistake (like taking a step) you cant interact with the item until you get rid of the interaction indicator, if you don't do this and press to interact it will do absolutely nothing this is really bad when you are trying to get on your horse to run away from a group.\n- NPCs will sometimes walk through walls and other objects which players cannot pass through\n- Items sometimes just pop into existence and some enemies sometimes don't render correctly (invisible heads etc)\n- If you are too close to an object that would block your path or if there is something as minor as a small stone in your path the game will keep forcing you backwards as if you were rubber banding\n- Ranged enemies can miss their shots but still hit you, the arrows stick into the air so when you run you just have floating arrows around you.\n- Some of the objects in this game extend further out than what can be seen for instance some pallisades wont allow you to shoot arrows near them as they get blocked by an invisible wall, it is annoying when you are running and just get blocked because you are too close to an object  (this also ties into the previously mentioned \"Rubber band like\" issue)\n- There is a dice game where you roll dice and sometimes the number on your roll will just change, you will see a dice roll 3 for example but then it instantly turns into a different number infront of you\n\n\n\n\nEDIT EDIT: I have changed review to negative purely because the game  is still in early access after 5 years and it has so many issues

They do not allow negative reviews simply because it outlines the flaws within their programming. They do not take player advice because they believe every player wants their own benefit, which just means they have poor judgement skills. There's a reason this game hasn't moved in any direction since it's release, and it's because the developers are stubborn, tyrant control freaks that won't even think of changing their own behaviour in order to progress their failure of a game.\n\nThe playability is fun at first, with the variety of abilities you are allowed to venture through from leveling 1-100, the quest line is well thought out and the playerbase is a playful toxicity that is fun to be around, the friends you make can really be the reason you still play the game, even if you hate it. However, with pros, come cons. Content is player driven, without players there is no content. Developers do not support the playerbase therefore the game does not grow, NA servers crash every SoW, denying content. Developers have been recommended fixes by players however they do not take any of it into consideration, even though developers themselves do not know how to fix the problem. \n\nThe day this game progresses is the day the developers decide to take advice and have open minds. There's a reason why this game failed their launch goal, because it simply was not ready, and it still isn't after almost five years of release. If you want a summary of the skill that the developers have, they still have not created a 'Logout to character selection screen' after almost three years of requests because it's 'too hard'. Instead of the developers taking this review into consideration, they will respond with what's wrong with my review, pointing out minuscule inconsistencies within my analysis, then proceed to ban me from the game. I guess this is goodbye everyone.\n\nUpdate: After the new launch, the game has significantly improved and I recommend curious individuals to give it a try! Questlines have been improved, PVP has improved, the game has become a lot more newbie friendly whilst still providing great content for endgame players (Which is the best part). Developers have improved their attitudes, and old moderators have been removed and replaced with actually competent moderators. They even added a RETURN TO CHARACTER SELECTION SCREEN OPTION!! The only issue that I see now is they don't have a return to server selection screen but you can't always get what you ask for. Considering that's the only problem within the game, it's amazing how far they've come.", "timestamp_created": 1614912684, "timestamp_updated": 1677118391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708803117275238037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1614944352, "developer_response": " Hello Sir,\n\nNo one was banned in our game history except either exploiting, toxicity, avoiding previous bans, or blackmailing.\nTo give a bigger view - we have more than 300 000 in-game accounts, while actually there are less than 50 players banned, which means 0.01% of players being banned.\n\nOf course, your friend case (which made the last 3 days review bombing started) already had 8 accounts banned for manipulating game ranking months ago, which might mislead your point of view, but once more - your statement that we \"ban everyone who writes genuine review\" is false when bans are fewer than 0.01% players population banned in our game.\n\nI can't even comment on the rest of the review, because mentioning that \"NA servers crash every SoW\", while it happened 2 times during the last year is simply manipulating and lying.\n\nYou are 100% free to not like the game, you can write your negative review after 1500 hours and keep playing saying how bad the game was, that's fine, that's your time you spent on something you hate.\n\nAs we are 100% aware that this entire encouragement of such behavior is being made outside the official social media of the game, please be invited to join our Discord, we are there speaking with the players every single day, but of course, it's not a place for toxic people, which has their moments outside official Discords manipulating you and other users, which is only hurting you and other users who want the best for the game.\n\nSuch an attitude won't make the game any better - and if someone believes that they are doing anything except hurting those who actually play and enjoy the game, he's wrong.

My support ticket requesting clarification regarding the reason for the ban has gone ignored after many attempts to reestablish contact.\n\nI can't speak for everybody's bans, but I do know that this isn't the first occurrence of this treatment from reading other Steam reviews. Use your own judgement with this information.\n\nBuyer beware.\n\n[1.0 Update below original review]\n\nYou'll see the amount of hours played and wonder why this isn't recommended. A substantial portion of that time was spent afk crafting while working, but fair enough, I did spend a good bit of time here. GV players are generally one of three types: lifers drunk off the koolaid, those sticking around mostly out of obligation, and new fellas who'll move on after a few days. While I won't gossip much, I will say that the rumors are mostly true. You know which ones. Additionally, with the player count being what it is, there is a common mentality  alongst the playerbase of avoiding negative criticism so as not to 'scare away new players'. Not saying every fella that likes the game is lying, but take it all with a grain of salt.\n\nThe new player experience is self-taught. The tutorial quests introduce you to some mechanics, I guess, but it's mostly something you'll run through on autopilot. You aren't directed towards how to obtain a horse, you aren't directed towards fast travel, you aren't directed towards using siege equipment that's actually used, the list goes on. Sure, there'll be a learning curve in any game, but some of this stuff is so basic that leaving it out is negligence. As an added bonus, new players get a cool logo by their name so more experienced players can identify who will die quickly (leading to a numbers advantage). It is what it is.\n\nCrafting is a fool's errand if you're just starting out. It's time-consuming and can be very expensive to level. It's common for updates to take something you normally do and stretch it out so it takes longer (we call it content). I understand that things do get rebalanced but it's been a consistent trend towards the hamster wheel we're all on getting a little bit longer each week. \n\nPlayerbase is pretty lukewarm in both quantity and quality. You can see the numbers for yourself so I won't dwell on that. I'll be real - there's a lot of dorks here. Yeah, yeah, we're all dorks that want to play internet knights but the amount of (supposed) grown men that bicker and whine is astounding. There are some really cool people also that are a strong reason to deter quitting, but they're outnumbered by the cornballs (employees included) that screenshot conversations, gossip behind each others' backs, and act like children. You can encounter that anywhere, I suppose, but it's definitely present here. \n\nThe good - combat is fun. If you like Mount and Blade, you'll like this. Looting is generally done well - not too punishing but still feels good. Poking fellas with a spear feels good. Sieges and large pitched battles are also neat. You'll have some really cool moments that are hard to replicate elsewhere. Maybe that's why we're still here. Maybe it's a refusal to ditch our boys. I can't say for certain.\n\nWould I do it all over again knowing what I know now? Probably not.\n\n*1.0/Full Release Update*\n\nI wanted to update this review now that the game is (allegedly) fully released, and I'm disappointed to find that the 'No' is only solidified. There are a few different reasons for this, but by and large it's clear Gloria Victis was not prepared for full release. \n\nAs other reviews have made clear, the 'launch' has been plagued by various issues. It's not an exaggeration when they state that they are unable to play the game; progressing past Steam Authorization is a crapshoot, connecting to the servers is a crapshoot, your characters loading is a crapshoot, etc. Crashes are common, and game mechanics have to be disabled to mitigate strain on the database (more on this later). For this reason alone, I wholeheartedly recommend waiting until the dust has settled and waiting for things to stabilize before exploring what Gloria Victis has to offer.\n\nDesign decisions have only gotten more questionable. Shortly before the 1.0 Release, the game's main draw (State of War, a feature that permitted open-world PvP to contest semi-permanent ownership over ingame locations) was removed. It was a running joke that the majority of Early Access players would only log on for these events because it was the only (almost) guaranteed good content. Black Eye Games is allegedly reworking this feature, but removing the main feature of the game right before 1.0 Release is objectively a backwards decision. If reworking the feature is the intention, why not release 1.0 when this feature is re-implemented? Many of the executive decisions here don't add up. \n\nFollowing the game's 'official' release, things have been shaky. First, players encountered a 'Firewall Issue' that prevented them from connecting to the game servers (it became apparent that the Firewall Error text was placeholder text and had nothing to do with an actual firewall; nor was this a player issue). Most recently, the game is (allegedly) subject to DDOS attacks that are now responsible for most (if not all) of the issues players are encountering. I personally find this skeptical, but regardless - it's clear that the infrastructure is unable to handle the strain that 1.0 has placed upon it. Database issues are common, and the necessity of disabling the more demanding game mechanics to prevent overloading the databases only reinforces the hardware suspicions. \n\nIt's unfortunate to see Gloria Victis mismanaged like this. Underneath all the nonsense, there is a neat little game there. As time goes on, the game is only further buried underneath both inexperience and preventable decisions. In its current state (and sadly, for the foreseeable future), Gloria Victis is only a harder pass. The indie studio/small dev excuse was worn out long ago.\n\nI hate to keep saying 'not recommended for now, but maybe in the future if things get better'.

SERVERS ARE CLOSING OCTOBER 31!!!\n(i called it being dead on arrival when it releases in my original review, no one believed me lol)\n\ndevs have no sense for priorities when it comes to what needs rework or implementing \"new\" things. this also shows through the fact that they don't have a current roadmap (you can still find some that are years old). the latest changes are mostly going against the will of most of their players, as of the faster durability loss, intensifying the already huge grind this game expects of you. as example if you wanna craft T5 gear you'll already take hours (maybe even on multiple days) to farm the materials or the gold to buy that gear (depending on your playstyle / time you invest). plus you can't repair your gear forever as your maximum durability decreases with every repair, the whole economy/gameplay loop revolves around breaking gear, horses ageing and spending the little money you get from doing the daily scheduled events, heck even the process of crafting itself costs you money.\n\nanother stupid change they pushed out was the change of the shield bash button bind. before you were able to use all combat actions with directional button binds, which means you did not have to use the mouse to control the attack direction, so i could move my camera freely while using the button binds to attack directionally, INCLUDING shield bash.\nnow they changed it so you can't control the direction of your shield bash with the directional attack buttons anymore cause they combined it with the kick button instead, so it became blocking+kick+direction controlled by mouse instead of the original block+directional attack. the whole reason i used directional attack buttons is because i DO NOT want to use mouse directional control, not that hard to understand right?\n\nsince the guild castles got removed there is basically no call to arms anymore to fight over the central part of the map, they're just like the other castles on the outer ring now, basically taking the mass battles out of the game.\nyes they were planning to bring instanced guild castles into the game to give MORE guilds the chance to own one, but by taking away the center guild castles so loooooong before even implementing the instanced ones there will most likely be LESS players and guilds still active, cause they just cut out one of the main weekly events while not delivering any meaningful replacement.\nand this game lives of those players who basically main this game, that live and breathe this game. it's easy to get fed up due to such changes take a step back and realize, damn there's so many games i own that are actually so much better than what GV offers me during the same gametime, and those other games don't change central mechanics that don't even need such an unflexible \"rework\". i wouldn't be surprised if player numbers are dropping currently, since they are doing everything right for such a result.\n\nanother useless rework they did a while ago was moving the capital cities to islands separated from the mainland. sure they did that when the outer ring of the mainland wasn't a no-loot-zone. but that shows how little the devs actually plan into the future. since the no-loot-zone change there is no reason to \"protect\" new players on a separate island anymore. heck the whole island is 90% just a copy-paste of the original capital city and its surroundings/quest locations. its very visible if you see roads going into the ocean where in the original spot there was a bridge, in the copy-paste there wasn't even a extra building placed there or anything to give that road any sense. c'mon you can't tell me that adding (copy-pasting) another building was to complicated to do, while you rise a useless island out of the sea.\nmoving the capital city out of the mainland also increases the fast travel cost, as example, if i wanted to go the farm before the change i could just walk 30 seconds from the capitol so i got there for free and quick from wherever i was, since i could recall to the capitol and get to my crops. now you'll be outside of the mainland whenever you take part in a VoD, go to the arena or are just recalling cause you were on a frontline castle, either now you spend multiple minutes walking and using the ferry or spending more money on fast travelling to get back to the farm quickly. overall that decision decreased quality of life for all players, but my review only covers the sangmar region cause i haven't seen the other ones.\n\nlet's talk about the things that should have actually been reworked but they didn't: hitboxes for melee (currrently up to 1m past weapon), collisions between players and siege machinery basically lag-locking you in place, streamlining quests (mining being instant pickup in the early quest, then turning to actual mining with tools in the later ones, a siege ladder being part of a quest creating unrealistic expectations cause they are not implemented into actual sieges or rly anywhere past the main quest/tutorial)\n\nwhile the weekly news do everything to make the game look alive and the community active, the devs do everything to make a lot of the normal players go: these changes take away playability (binding change) and reason to be involved into my nation (state of war removal / no sense of territorial control through a guild owning central castles) or involved to the game itself (devs making incredibly random changes / focussing optical changes like SSAO shader reworks while the game is badly optimized and can't render objects that are further away than 50 meters including players disappearing while technically still in bow range).\n\ni had my fair share of fun, met great ppl n all, took part in some state of wars and a lot of sieges during my short but very active phase in this game. but this is not the focus of this review, cause sugarcoating never causes change where it's needed, so i'm critical and pointing out what's wrong in the hope that things will start moving back into a good direction.\n\nfor me it's very clear that this is a dead-on-arrival game, already being past it's probably best state a few versions back, that i never witnessed cause i only discovered it last year. with DOA i dont mean it will have 0 players, but instead it will never reach the full potential this game concept could have had and most likely will never see those epic mass battles everyone was hoping for. don't forget that you can't trust the \"current players\" number on steamcharts because there is AFK farming mechanisms like digging and fishing.\n\nTLDR: devs have no clue what to prioritize when doing \"reworks\", currently on a steep downwards slope, devs think balancing economy means players should spend more money on repairing / buying new gear / travelling and removing choice of how long an item is to be placed in auction. the game was already a grind before, becoming even worse.\nconsider well if you wanna pay money for a game that can be broken and unplayable for you within a few updates.", "timestamp_created": 1674489965, "timestamp_updated": 1696613986, "voted_up":

negative.\n\nHowever, I have seen that the last time you logged into the game was over a month ago.

I'd like to thank you for your feedback which can be found within this review, and be sure to contact Coragon#2441 via Discord should you want to share more of your feedback with us.\n\nI hope that you will log in to the game once again to check out the changes (since your last activity a lot of things have changed) and that once you give Gloria Victis yet another go, you will reconsider whether the game deserves a negative review.\n\nKind Regards,\nJesper, Community Manager"}, "54598992": {"recommendationid": "54598992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047665695", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 390, "last_played": 1682456976}, "language": "english", "review": "First Impressions: Bought it installed it, logged in.

I am currently about a straight 6 hours into the game and don't want to log off however i have work tomorrow so i had to peel myself away from this game. \n\nCombat: it's amazing! its really hard at first but once you get a hang of it its very skill based. Arrows are blocked by shields !! long pole arms have far reach, so you can hide behind your friends shield wall and use the pole arm to do damage from the second rank. 1v1 seems a lot of fun as well, you have different types of directional slashing attacks, which your opponent can then counter by blocking, and you can counter his block with a kick which can stun him. There's a lot of potential for counter play and skilled game play. i recommend setting keybindings for your attacks, seen some youtubers do it for their blocks as well.\n\nPvP: Meaningful PVP!! players fight over farms which you can use to get resources, and castles for your guild to control and upgrade. Multiple ways of getting experience!!! Your alliance captured a castle and you are online? you get experience, you are crafting? you can level up ! (not just crafting but your actual character level)\n\nHave not been this hyped for an MMO since my first one (UO) way back in the day.

I have played this game for a long time over the years, and i was recently banned for doxxing someone and using inappropriate language towards a person who 100 percent deserved it. The game is fun, the devs however, make it to where you cannot feel confident in going to them to resolve anything unless you are in good with them. The community has a group of toxic individuals on NA that have been allowed to cause any mischief they want, including doxxing. I didnt threaten anyones life, saying someone deserves to die is not a death threat. \n\n     I was doxxed a couple years back, i provided screen shots of the players name, and the devs refused to do anything about it because it was a \"common name\" and they did not allow me to prove who i was, but i was banned for doxxing another player who also had a common name, was this person allowed to prove who he was? or did they just take their word for it. This player, Itdad and his group dove into my life through my reddit account and even brought up my child at one point in a distasteful manner, all in the gloria victis discord and they are still allowed to play this game. So i do not feel bad for calling him out and saying what i said, however, i believe i only deserved a permamute instead of a 100 year bann, per the rules the devs have put into place. Itdad was caught duping and his group is an overall cancer to this game. They celebrate when people quit the game or become banned because of them and then cry when theres no one to fight.\n\n     When i brought my doxxing situation to the devs, i was told to \"get over it\" numerous times and they did not take my situation serious, but they decided that this other individuals case was more severe than mine. This is why i say there is a clear display of favoritism and it is indicative to how these devs operate and make their decisions when it comes to specific groups of people. \n\n     Below i have left you with the conversations that me and the developer Daimon Frey had with each other, there is no personal information in the video.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65eaofwbaTU&t=15s\n\n    At this point, i dont even care if i become unbanned, or if itdad gets banned, I think people deserve to know the truth on how incompetent the devs are when it comes to situtations, there was also an entire guild that was banned for over 100 years because they allowed (unknowingly at the time) a banned player into their guild, the entire guild was deleted by the devs. What type of developers do all of this?", "timestamp_created": 1644690702, "timestamp_updated": 1646270394, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694121241569519043", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1645036924, "developer_response": "Hello.\n\nThis person received a permanent ban for death threats and doxing aimed at another player.

Every time you are contacting our team members with those random baits, we are saving it for legal reasons, and if you will be continuing your abuses, we will be forced to bring a restraining order against you, while we have more important things to do. \n\nPlease, find something that will bring you joy in your life without parasitizing on people working on their dream, I am sure there are lots of things you can enjoy without trying to hurt others. If you would like to have a contact for some help with your issues, please let me know, I will do my best - that's the only thing I can help you with.\n\nThanks [Black Eye Games] Jog", "timestamp_created": 1641413861, "timestamp_updated": 1651364823, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689700722694396973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1641567783, "developer_response": "Hello.\n\nSince the game was released on Steam, so for quite a few years already, we have banned 34 people. Out of over 350 000 accounts we have in our database.\n\nSome of the recent bans were new accounts of those permabanned people, who harmed the community and game with their toxic behavior, and after that, received further bans on newly created accounts for ban evasion.\n\nRecently we banned three accounts, and as two of them were owned by the leader and vice leader of a guild, it automatically led to disbanding the guild, so its members could reorganize. With the full cooperation of the game administration, they created a new guild the same day. After that, they received back all the guild points they had and regained control over the guild castle they owned.\n\nWe are obligated to take care of our community as a whole. Supporting permabanned players, helping them to return to the game, and actively collaborating with them to harm other players or break the game rules is a violation of the game EULA. \n\nI wish you a good day.\n\nDaimon\nCommunity & Support Manager"}, "145379860": {"recommendationid": "145379860", "author": {"steamid": "76561199523906040", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 167, "last_played": 1693096793}, "language": "english", "review": "DO NOT BUY GAME IS CLOSING!", "timestamp_created": 1693488042, "timestamp_updated": 1693488042, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689580321311950684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41900455": {"recommendationid": "41900455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982903073", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1291, "last_played": 1637994974}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels like a mount and blade MMORPG, very similar combat system.\n\nIt's getting there.
