After 1.0 I played a PVE server. While 1.0 has improved, there are glaring issues:\n\n1.) Loot boxes for cosmetics in the store. They do not list the % drop, which is illegal in some countries. In Canada they are not illegal but fall under a category called, \"deceptive practices\". I think it's evidence that the developers want to extort as much money out of their players as possible. I'm not against companies making money, but they have to create something worth the money. Loot boxes are not it.\n\n2.) Combat was pure jank 2 years ago and is still jank. PVE enemies have 100% aimbots and do not miss, they telegraph block your melee attacks with 100% accuracy too. PVP combat boils down to whoever gets the first hit, especially on horseback, at higher levels you just one-shot eachother.\n\n3.) AFK grinding, most of your time playing this game will be actively not playing the game. The proficiency level up system seems fun, until you realize you just sit at a bench and wait for hours and hours and hours.\n\n4.) Chinese players on EU/NA servers. It breaks my heart to say this, but the Chinese players treat everyone who is not Chinese absolutely horrible, it's pretty disgusting. They do not speak the same language, they don't want to engage, they only want to cheat, steal, grief, exploit, and ruin your experience (even on PVE). It really sucks because even your enemies in a raid can become friends, but there is no friend making with the Chinese players.\n\nI want to love this game so bad, there a lot of unique mechanics and enough to explore for a while, but the negatives outweigh the positives for me. Many of my criticisms the devs could fix very easily, except the Chinese players. Unfortunately they have completely ruined this game for myself and many others.

If you plan on playing PvE only, STOP and go buy literally any other survival builder that has a foreign language localization that wasn't done by some shoddy outdated version of Baidu Translate.

If this sounds mind-numbingly boring, it's because it is.\n\n[u]Taking too much damage?[/u] Trap a bunch of foxes into a building with a respawn point, punch one of them on its stupid fuzzy jaw, and let them slowly nibble your ankles to death. Respawn and repeat for a few hours until you level up your health enough. If this sounds absolutely stupid, it's because it is.\n\n[u]Not dealing enough damage?[/u] Clip a bunch of torture racks together and tie NPCs to them. Slap them with a rake for a few hours until your weapon skill is high enough.

Go fight some nerds alongside your guildmates! You gear up, run to a battleground, and start smacking them in the head with your spears. If you're winning, guess what happens? They will slap down a temporary structure with a respawn point, retreat their low health players back to this base, suicide, respawn, re-equip their gear, and get back into the fight in a matter of seconds with absolutely no penalty.

Hit detection is inconsistent, and enemy AI is frustratingly unbalanced, making some sections of the game unnecessarily difficult while others are trivially easy.\n\n[b]UI[/b]\nThe user interface, which should seamlessly integrate into the gameplay, is often obtrusive and unintuitive.

I'd start off by saying I've had a long break from games, for over a year now. Just lost that spark, hadn't found anything that kept me interested for longer than a week. When this game first came out on early access.. I instantly got sunk into it. ~300 hours, before the lawsuit came. I found out it was back two weeks ago, and put another ~250 hours since then (working from home). \n\nThis game feels like a very modernized old-school RPG. Grind-intense, open-world, community-based, slow character progression, AFK skill grinding.. The vibes it brings are very much similar to something like Ultima Online, Everquest or RuneScape. If you've played those games and enjoyed them, you'd love this game, without a doubt. People who've enjoyed less grind-intense MMOs like World of Warcraft, or survival/building open world games like Rust, Ark, etc .. you'd most likely enjoy it as well. But you'd probably want to invite friends to play with you, or join someones guild in-game. This isn't meant for solo'ing, for the average player. If you intend on solo'ing this game .. intend on pouring dozens of hours per week to see any significant progress.\n\nThis game doesn't really start opening up with more avenues of game play until you start making decent progress into your character progression. At first the game is very slow, you'll still enjoy it since there's a pretty large learning curve that stays pretty intriguing all the way through. But it isn't until you establish a good base, tons of workbenches, decent amount of skill progression -- that you finally start being able to venture out into the harder parts of the map. At first, you'll die to about anything. Within about 20 hours you'll start handling just about anything in your starting area. Depending on your play style, character skills focus, guild population, etc.. you could be exploring deep across the massive map (emphasis on massive .. probably takes an hour+ to travel from one end to the other) within 100 hours. Or, if you're solo and focused a lot of crafting skills.. you could be waiting 300+ hours before you can venture that far out into the map. Your characters level doesn't mean much .. it's the skills you've leveled that determine your characters ability. \n\nOverall I feel like the game is awesome, filled a void that has been missing in the gaming industry for decades.. If you're a hardcore grind-fest MMO type of guy.. This game is what we've been missing. I can't speak much on the PVP, since I've stuck to a PVE server this whole time. But -- I do plan on transfering to a PVP server after release -- with some friends. That is another cool aspect to the game .. your character isn't stuck to one server. You can transfer your character to any other server within your region. You can even establish your guild across servers, and make a base in any of them. \n\nThere are a lot of CONS though. Most are ones easily ignored, some probably worse depending on PVP/PVE servers.\n \n1. Translation. It's terrible. It's not just the wording, it's the formatting as well. In some cases there is valuable information cut off the screen, because it fit in Chinese, but didn't fit in English. So in those cases you have to switch to Chinese just to see a number you needed. Not only is the translation still needing major polishing (which I suspect they may do after the 1.0 release), there are too many instances where things are referred to as different names, depending on which screen you're looking at. A particular attribute could be called \"ABC\" in one page, and then called \"ZYX\" in another page. \n\n2. Server regions aren't locked. Meaning EU, Chinese, NA can all join whatever region they want. And the Chinese players take major advantage of this. The map contains areas that can be 'claimed' by your guild marker, particularly farms. And it's also advantageous to build near mines. 75% of the best spots to build your base have already been claimed by Chinese players. And once it's claimed, very unlikely they'll ever leave as you can prevent your base from decaying for 2 weeks. Major problem on PVE servers. On PVP servers -- technically you could raid their base and try and claim the land. But ... again .. since it's not region locked Chinese guilds usually established dominance on every server. So if you're playing PVP .. probably want to avoid messing with Chinese guilds. If you're playing PVE, you don't have much to worry about Chinese guilds (other than losing out on prime building areas). The game is also set up so that guilds can become \"magistrates\" or in other words \"King\" of the server. In that case they can receive taxes on all players in that server. Chinese guilds usually hold that title in every server. This game would be a ton better with region locking. \n\n3. Combat, it's almost there. But still feels very clunky. You can play with 4-direction combat, or 8-direction. I will say 8 direction is best, and the hit boxes are actually very well-done for direction based melee combat. Shields are broken. Literally useless, only time you actually block is if you continuously walk backwards and prevent NPCs/players from getting face-to-face with you. Once they are directly in front of you, their attacks just clip through the shield. Parrying works very well, but it's extremely difficult, as you need to parry the direction of the swing. Often times hits just don't register, although the animation/voice registers. Certain animals are still very broken in terms of pathing .. especially bears. They just seem like they're whacked out on pure Colombian snow. Movements are spazzy, they randomly go from normal pace to lightning pace.. From what I've read -- PVP is mount/polearm only. Two-hander is backup when on foot. Supposedly you can just 1 shot anything with horse/polearm. Bows/crossbows are pretty much useless at end-game levels of PVP. One handed is okay, it's fast and you can almost stunlock. But two-handers do much more damage, much more capable of AOE, and they have a special talent suited for PVP -- heal upon killing an enemy. All in all, the combat is very similar to Mount&Blade .. just a bit less polished. \n\n4. Music. What music. Seriously, with 600 hours of game play, I've probably heard about 1 hours worth of music. Very quiet, mind-numbingly quiet. Great for watching videos on the other monitor though. \n\n5. I haven't looked much into it, but it looks like ever since the lawsuit and they had to privately sell the game -- they've adopted micro transactions. Most of them seem cosmetic only. But some of them seem eerily pay-to-win with resources being purchasable. Extremely lame. Hopefully they smarten up and get rid of that. \n\n6. The game has virtually no helpful content online. What's out there, only really covers like 20% of the game. Most of the videos, articles, posts you see about this game just cover early level stuff. The other 80% of the game, you're a pioneer and learning things for yourself. This isn't directly a con, because some might appreciate that aspect. But if you've got a specific question about something .. chances are you aren't finding that answer. \n\nAll in all -- amazing game. MASSIVE potential. It's currently already very much a full game, with enough polishing to be enjoyed for a long time. But if they truly focus on optimizing the game -- and not going down the silly road of over-stuffing it with new features.. they have the opportunity to create a new longstanding classic in the hardcore MMO genre.", "timestamp_created": 1706764739, "timestamp_updated": 1706764739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.81818622350692749", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160592149": {"recommendationid": "160592149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006149632", "num_games_owned": 554, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 22775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22775, "last_played": 1710031483}, "language": "english", "review": "This game had potential but the support system is a joke.

Having said that, a game needing work is, to a large degree, to be expected for EA games (although MoE now sells as version 1.0!). While MoE is in better condition than say Conan Exiles (being a similar game) was when the latter first released, MoE still has some really awful rough edges that can make it a pretty painful experience to play. \n\nFirst off, the game is very doable in SP and can provide a good SP experience, even with the issues I discuss below. I have not been everywhere in game and certainly not done all there is to do, but after 40+hours I have gotten into what I think is mid-game (level 40 character, iron armour/weapons, base, followers, horses etc) and have had some fun doing it - but there has been a lot of expletives and a lot of 'taking the Lord's name in vain' along the way - sometimes a combination of those two things at once.\n\nSome positives first as there are PLENTY - for example, there's a mod workshop, the game world looks great, there's a great array of assets (buildings, trees, grasses, rocks etc), there is a lot to do (build, combat, explore, complex farming, taming, cooking, medicine,training, upgrading everything, taking over existing settlements etc) so it holds your interest and there's seemingly always more to discover and try out. Skills (swordsmanship, lumbering, mining etc) are learned by doing while benches, build sets (which also look great) and weapon/armour types etc are accessed by spending points gained with character level rises - which is a great combo. The map is big and feels it, there's a good variety in the mobs and how they wander around (not always the same animal following the same path when you go into an area, so like ARK), the follower system is not just copy-paste from Conan (hard to understand all that is going on here - including bench/settlement automation via thralls -  but it seems a fresh take on the idea), the workbenches, weapons and armour etc all look fantastic and the skins available for them only add to this being an impressive aspect. The character creator is solid if not amazing, the tattoos add a nuance if that's your thing (although almost constantly hidden by your armour, of course) and, after 40+ hrs, I have had zero freezes, crashes or error message pop-ups. There's more good, but this is already a long read so I won't detail it all. \n \nWith the bad, where to start? Some stuff is a bit meh and/or somewhat annoying (the UI/UX is pretty busy and fairly invasive for example - I can't tell my horse's 'quality' because the classification is obscured by other UI elements), however, other things just drove me nuts. - like the lack of info. There is a lot going on in this game and the learning curve is pretty steep, however, the instructions are limited at best, A LOT is simply not explained at all, even when checking online (what does 'Comprehension' trait do exactly?) and the limited instructions the game does provide is in such awful English they make no sense. This is an all pervasive problem as, adjusting server settings is possible (thumbs up, great but many settings don't actually change things in game and changes you make don't save from session to session meaning they need to be redone each login) but what are \"Compulsory Creep Kill\", \"Switch of the Money Tree\", \"Player's Collect Damage Multiplier\" (this is in the 'Collection' settings, not combat, so..?) and \"Sidebar Durability Loss on Battlefield\"?. Should the \"Hunger Decrease Multiplier\" go up or down to reduce how much I eat per day (FYI, it has to go down) and in the 'Damage Settings' the \"Unused Parameter\" is set to 1.0 by default - is that a good thing, is it even a parameter given it is apparently unused? Parts of the UI are still just in Chinese.\n\nThe building system is as ordinary as they were 20 years ago - want an overhanging roof/awning, roof pieces only angle up from walls not down (snap points only at the bottom of them it seems), foundations don't snap to ceilings, no height adjuster for foundations, no parts overlap (can't even place walls on a foundation after stairs are placed on that foundation) - but roof pieces clip through walls into 2nd storey rooms. Roofs don't snap to ceilings or each other, only walls. Terrain clipping that prevents building is brutal (only try to build on super flat land), stacked stairs that 'zig-zag' back on themselves (hard to explain but a neat design) don't allow a standard sized character to go up them unless you crouch. Placement is also EXTREMELY twitchy: select a piece you want to build, on screen it drops into the space you want it to be in, press click and it builds at 90 or 180 degrees to what was shown, again and again and again. You can place a pillar on the corner of a foundation then add a wall to the foundation edge, but you can't place the wall then the pillar - this 'sequential placing' happens with roof pieces as well. Corner roofs have no snap points that allow you to attach another roof to them. You get the idea.\n\nThere are certain indestructible bushes that can't be harvest or removed in any way that will clip into your base if you build on them.\n\nWork benches can't be freely rotated before placement - you have to place them facing you, leading to all sorts of problems in tight spaces or placing them on the edges of raised floors/foundations where your character drops off the edge before getting the bench in place. Some benches require (relatively) huge amounts of empty space around them to place - and some already occupy an area of 2x2 foundations.\n\nThere is no pick up or moving anything - place a cheap nasty vase in the wrong spot- it's there to stay, misplace a top-tier foundation, it's there to stay, bench too far from the wall - demolish with 50% resource refund and re-craft is your only option.\n\nThen there is combat...OMG - it's not just a button mashing fest, and that's a good thing right? However, at level 42, with iron armour/weapons and a reasonable sword skill level (300+?), I had my ass comprehensively handed to me by a level 16 bandit captain who shrugged off 30-40 hits from my sword before providing me with the mercy killing I probably thoroughly deserved - ok, I'm not the world's greatest swordsman but a level 16 guy using gear that was visually lower tier than mine should not walk away from a fight with a character 3 times his level. Oh, did I mention NPC's using missile weapons NEVER miss, literally, hit rate is set to 100% unless the shot is blocked by a rock, building etc. On the whole, combat is slow (the bandit above took probably 2-3 minutes to kill me), pretty painful, quite technical (8 options for directional attacks which you need to master - like the bandits already have) and a bit janky as both the animations and hit boxes seemed to me to be a little off. Damage values also cannot be effectively varied - sure you can pump up/down the damage you do with a blade....but it's server-wide so all the NPCs get the same buff/debuff. My doctor has told me not to discuss the mounted combat....it's enough to say only use a polearm as a weapon and...urghhh...I have no words.\n\nThere is more but suffice to say there are issues both great and small - hopefully these get fixes and some TLC over time, including optimisation - I have a GTX 1080Ti with 16GB and an i7-8700 and get wildly fluctuating FPS between 10-60 on medium settings, 15 FPS on high settings.\n\nIn short, it's not a bad game, there's a lot here to like and if the devs persist building on what they have this will be another game like Conan/ARK that I will sink 1000s of hrs into, but if you jump in now, be prepared for some SP frustration.", "timestamp_created": 1708879879, "timestamp_updated": 1708962237, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711716115474700928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1709117081, "developer_response": "Hey there,\n\nThanks for the detailed review.

As of now you only have a NEARBY,  COUNTY, and GUILD chat system. This communication system definitely needs to be enhanced.

I always have the option to travel on over to a pvp server anytime I want. If you are really big into the pvp stuff I would still highly recommend you find yourself a nice place in a pve server to level up to 60 before making the jump into the wild wild pvp world.  This game is so much fun just playing solo in pve. It's better than ATLAS, VALHEIM, RUNESCAPE, GUILD WARS 2,  ELITE DANGEROUS, SKULL AND BONES, STARFIELD,  etc. I have all those games and many more.

Lots of shortcut commands (similar to ARK, same engine) and layout is aces once you learn what everything is.\nWhat else are people complaining about?  I think it was mostly UI/Lag, and the company is already working on improving the official servers.\n\nThis game 100% supports PvE with plenty of content. \n\nInsanely good progression, we're on a vanilla rates server and it feels fantastic.\n\nLog in and your horse is gone?  mia?  nothing?  most games; that's it, curtains.  MoE?  Check the log, it'll say HOW and WHERE and WHEN it died. (or just look at the map if it's alive and you'll see markers for all your warriors & mounts)\n\nSo many endless problems from other games are solved in MoE, it's insane.  Thousands of hours in ARK/Conan-style games and this is by FAR The king of the crop.\n\nCons?  \n-structure placement is like vanilla ARK, it doesn't like \"placing\" in the environment/ground/terrain.  So you gotta be cheeky if you're OCD on how things look.\n-server running, setting up, editing, modifying, configuring; it's all a bit of a pain.  Lots of communities working together to try to get things working, again, much like Vanilla ARK.  So give this game time to grow, get some modders to give us a S+ style building, or the company to give us a CVAR.  \n\nYou're missing out if you're not giving this game a good shot, especially if you're already a fan of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1709065164, "timestamp_updated": 1709065164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606413483619689941", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1709109420, "developer_response": "Thank you for the kind words!\n\nWe are working hard at improving the custom server functionality to make it more intuitive and easy-to-use.

But it's not. (rant)\n\nI can't really boil down my problem with the game to one specific point because (almost) nothing in this game is gamebreakingly bad but so many little things accumulated in the past few days... \nso i'll try to give some bullet points of what i think breaks my experience.\n\nThe big ones:\n- The game feels way too slow. Movement, crafting, resource gathering, every activity feels, as if you are doing it stuck in quicksand.\n- It feels like all the stuff you can skill appeal more to your dopamine receptors than anything else.\nLike: Oh, shiny new unlock, so cool! But in reality it has literally no impact on your gameplay.\n- I'm constantly struggling with mechanic-limits, that feel out of place. For instance, i can't let an NPC protect my camp and run around with another because i'm too low level.\n- UI / UX is absolutely horrendous and triggers me the most.\nIt looks outdated, feels sluggish, text is missing or written in mandarin. The Map doesn't save the location when you close it and centers randomly.\nInventory is making me mald HARD, because i can't place items directly to a slot, it always goes to the first free one. This is one of my biggest pet peeves.\nYou also can't really see, if there are more slots below the first 3 rows, only if you scroll.\nSometimes, there is just red text all over the screen instead of an actual UI element. Feels extremely cheap, just like the game as a whole.\n\nThe other stuff (talking about the defaults here):\n- Balance of everything is shit, there's no other word for it\n- Weapons and tools break way too quick\n- Combat is tedious, human NPCs block EVERYTHING and you have to juke them into attack animation so you can actually hit them\n- if you want to make use of the attack stances, you have to move your hand from the mouse. Like, wtf?\n- i have literally never played a more grind-y game. if you don't boost EXP to at least 3x and loot to 5x, you will die IRL before you have built anything meaningful\n- Animations could be better\n- Armor looks all the same (kinda)\n\nGood item descriptions or functional/populated wiki? Non existent.\nStable or moderated official servers? Not found.\nusable info/resources on how to host a server? Nope.\n\nWanna host a server on linux with specific parameters like EXP multipliers? Oh boy, get ready for a wild ride.\nHaving to pull up the PrivateServerTool on windows every time you want to change some defaults is just stupid, not to mention, that you have to purchase the game to get the tool. (There is literally a dedicated server in steam available but the PrivateServerTool isn't there... why?!)\n\nPLEASE PROVIDE A USABLE DOCUMENTATION FOR DEDICATED SERVERS!\nPLEASE PROVIDE A USABLE DOCUMENTATION FOR ITEMS/SKILLS/MECHANICS! (or do a better job introducing them in the game, because the way it's currently done, it sucks ass)\n\nBefore the release and all the legal stuff there was one instance, where Angela Game delivered an intrusive Anti Cheat with an update. No legal agreements, no information what or why, it just came overnight.\n\nI never thought i'd say that, but at the moment, you'll be better off playing conan exiles than this.", "timestamp_created": 1710107476, "timestamp_updated": 1710107809, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 119, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569687187671661377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1710212791, "developer_response": "Thank you for your feedback, if you wish to share more insights about the game with us.

Even so, compared to other survival games I've seen so far, I find it better.\nBuilding system. I haven't experimented too much, but if you position yourself well, it works. You need to know what sticks and what doesn't.\nCons:\nFirst and foremost, it's a pay-to-win fest.\nLong crafting times and a few things that, although sometimes useful when I'm busy, aren't always welcome or at the right time.\nOne day I watched a streamer, and they were full of maps and keys. Although I've killed all the elites I've encountered and even dragons, I barely had a few maps and a few keys that I can count on one hand. In a guild I was in, I spent some time gathering money for the guild's skills and technique.\nMaybe this isn't the best review, but I believe there are better games than this, and even so, the game is enjoyable up to a point.\n\nEdit: Did I mentioned the lagn fest. everything over 40 players on the server yitn in a lag fest.

In a PVP/PVE world they just let you do one or the other but this? this is on another world. . .I still can't fathom why other PVP game doesn't implement this yet.\n\nYou jump into a server thinking you're going to be pvping and surviving against other players until you start noticing the game have \"missions???\" complete missions to earn extra xp to lvl up faster. \n\nOnce you lvl up enough and you're ready to PVE go to a hostile NPC village and bring your soldiers with you to raid. Some mission will have you do raiding. There's also mission that cycle daily that requires you to raid NPC villages for loot. \n\nThis game is ARK/Conan/Black Desert Online/ all of the possible PVP/PVE that you can think of. \n\nWant to have a horse? sure just go and tame it out in the wild. Their taming mechanism is so easy, you can easily tame horses all day and just trade to lazy players.\n\nCons:\n\nIt's hit box does need some work, sometime killing them crazy foxes doesn't add up cause your spear will not hit them when your cross hair shows that it clearly landed that hit.\n\nFighting is sluggish because you're so slow but again, there's level to everything that you do such as riding horse, fishing, building, lumbering, etc. so I wonder if your proficiency in fighting is max out that you'll actually fight faster than when you first started out in the world? That's why I don't know what to put this one since I haven't gotten far yet. Let's just say it's in the pros if that actually is what the dev wanted us to do, level up our fighting skill to hit faster and move faster. It's con if none of this is true. \nIt is a Chinese game, they do like the idea of cultivation on everything to get better at each specific skill set.\n\nThis game is good! trust me. You won't be disappointed. If you want to play solo you can as well since you can recruit npc warriors in a PVP/ PVE server!! no pvp game ever have player recruiting npc before since that'll crash the game with so much things happening.

Out of all the games we've tackled recently, Myth of Empires stands out\u2014and not in a good way. It's probably the worst. I've come across single-developer projects that are more polished than this. Writing a review is a bit tricky because pointing out the glaring flaws might make me look like just another hater. But I really did try to give it a chance, even with my already low expectations based on other reviews.\n\nIt only takes about 60 seconds of enduring the low-quality \"motion blur\" as you move through the game world to start questioning why someone decided it may be a good idea to forcefully worsen your visual experience. Turn it off, and things seem better\u2014until you start gathering materials and are forced to excuse the questionable character animations. You might hope these are merely cosmetic issues, but alas, it only gets worse.\n\nThe game seems purposefully designed to be sluggish. You're met with slow character movements, slow (and borderline unplayable) combat, unnecessary crafting countdowns and more. It feels like the game is stealing moments of your life. The animations are primitive and unnatural, seemingly ripped straight from games that are 30 years old. As for the game\u2019s UI, it's a disaster (and let\u2019s not even get started on the poor translations and the UI's failure to adapt to the resulting texts).\n\nI spend some time reading positive reviews just to understand why there are any. Basically any other \"Open World Survival Game\" on Steam would be \"overwhelming positive\" compared to this. Try Conan Exiles, Enshrouded, The Planet Crafter, Soulmask and many others ...\n\nMoney wasted, moving on ...\n\nNote: While others have mentioned a few innovations, enduring even the basic mechanics of this game makes it a tragic setting for such potential breakthroughs.

It generally looks pretty.\n\nBuilding is OK-ish, if you can understand WTH they are talking about in the game. Often building is BUGGY. Pieces just wont do what you want them to do, even if the game shows you it will fit together a certain way. Building pieces sometimes move when you try to set them....and it is NOT convenient when that happens. You have to destroy and create new pcs. There is no grace in building here. None. Zero, Zip. Did I say buggy yet?\n\nOften translations are not good, or inaccurate. For example, a quest may reference a skill or recipe, but using different terms, interchanging English words when the text needs to be exact. Sometimes this is very confusing. \n\nLet me reiterate...Menus are horrible and unclear. The UI was designed by a 3rd grader. It looks and plays like an amateur title.\n\nIf MoE was decent enough, I could overlook just horrible their directional combat system is (or vice versa). Combat is horribly thought out and executed. You can die to a level 6 fox (mobs are also buggy), in full armor, shield, and weapon.

They are ran by giant Chinese alliances that have huge numbers of bot accounts so they can take over even the PVE servers economies and charge exorbitant taxes on PVE and raid anyone who tries to build on PVP. There's no place you can hide from them and admins don't take kindly to English speakers vs their Chinese customers. Lots of unenforced cheating also. You pretty much need to play unofficial to enjoy it.\n\n2. So you need to play unofficial to enjoy the game, fine, I can do that. Except unofficials have lots of issues holding them back that devs have not addressed. In order for me to recommend this game for $40 these need to be addressed at minimum:\n      -The clustered servers in the server browser do not show player count, therefore if you want to expand your unofficial into a large scale clustered server to make it better and make it more like the game was intended to be played you are handicapped, as nobody will join these servers because they cant see the pop. They are all dead. This is such a simple fix.\n      -Much of the features on official like governance ect are limited or non existant on unofficial and this hasnt been rectified for quite a while. You are simply forced to miss out on parts of the game.\n      -Unofficial PVE servers are nerfed. On official PVE and PVP are connected and you can transfer between them, therefore the PVE servers are more limited so people cant amass materials ect there as fast. The problem with this is they also nerfed unofficial PVE servers in many ways even though they arent connected to anything. You cant place as many structures, cant do as much, its just a very frustrating and limiting experience for server admins.\n      -Server admin abilities are very limited compared to games like ark, you cannot customize as many things leaving alot of these issues unfixable. They need to desperately broaden the server configs for server admins because there are so many issues with this game that could be fixed by admins if they had the ability.\n\n3. I was forced to buy the game again after I already purchased it once. They re-released this game on steam and had a short window to get a replacement steam key during which I was out of town. I contacted support and got the runaround. I cant play the old version either. If you buy a game you should not be forced to buy the same game again, period.\n\nIf they can address these concerns with unofficial their game will become extremely popular. As of now the game is hemorrhaging players because they cannot find a stable and balanced place to play without tons of frustrations.

NA are in NA, EU are in EU and so on. this has been revealed by many running trace routes that all data at some point goes to Singapore and servers are in fact not at there stated locations. with this in mind there seems to be a data dump going back to Singapore every few minutes or so that cause game to freeze briefly followed by rubber banding for a further 5-15 second.\n\nSERVERS PART 2: \nthere are servers that are region locked with a flimsy system at best to try and stop the Chinese hordes from over running pretty much every server they get into. these regions are supposed to be for the likes of NA and EU players who don't want to have to deal with them. sadly this system is failing and the Chinese have infiltrated just about every server locking some of them down to 1 guild per server because every one else has sadly been raided or simply quit.\n\nTHE GRIND:\nthe grind for non paying casual players is substantial. in 100 hours i have managed to get to level 35 with help from the AFK system. i believe an option to buy experience has just been added to level up faster but not grant any special weapons or tools that give an advantage if you choose to shorten the grind.\n\nCRAFTING:\nthe crafting system is huge and quite in depth and fun to work with. gives you many options for stuff to be built. like structures, lots of weapons and armours and much more.\n\nTAMING:\ntaming is fun when done manually, build a pen and trap a horse and break it by riding it. some higher level horses can take some time but worth it. animals can also be put in stables to be tamed with AI assist if you don't want to ride them.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nthe graphics look quite good in most aspects and pleasing to the eye, there is some locations you look out and think that looks impressive. then there is under the water that leaves much to be desired.\n\nin conclusion i am not going to recommend this game at this time due to the horrible server setup they have in place producing pings of 300ms - 400ms for the majority of people playing and the very very flimsy region lock that has failed so many looking to enjoy the game. \n\nif in the future they do fix the server locations and region lock then this game would most defiantly be worth playing.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1711731683, "timestamp_updated": 1711731683, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556044638156890869", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1712043857, "developer_response": "Hi spyhunter,\n\nWe're sorry to hear about your negative experience with the servers, but thank you for taking the time to give us your detailed feedback.

Not to mention it lets you host a server and I'm pretty sure you don't have to rent one which is huge. Also there's public lobbies and private ones to try if you want to get a PvP experience.\n\nYou can buy skins for various items but they aren't stat increasing or anything.\n\nGripes:\n\nThe building is specific on how it wants to be built so you have to be careful what direction a wall is facing which is annoying.

Love the building, crafting, and variety of mechanics.  Graphics are great as well.  As you progress into the game is when you start to see the flaws.\n\n1) Very Equipment centered.  Whoever has the higher tier equipment will most likely win because the higher tier (even just 1 higher tier)  heavily out performs the lower tier.  I can understand 2+ tier difference, but where I play my guild has the 2nd best tier equipment (just started on the 1st) and we can easily see the difference.\n\n2) Need to get higher skill or you will be dragged to the ground.  Example:  I'm almost 750 skill in heavy armor, polearm, and 750 physique.  If a player with over 750 (not quite 900 yet) hits me the damage they will do is significant.  Combine that with 1 level higher tier equipment... you get the point.\n\n3) The server ping currently is unbearable.  If you get under 200 ping that is a blessing.  Normal ping sits around 300 or higher.  I don't know where the servers are located, but the server I play on is NA (North American) and I live in Florida.  I play using a Fiber Optic internet with 100up/100down speed.  Everything is working great.  So the issue isn't on my side.\n\n4) When PvP involves more than 5 vs 5... it can get very laggy and rubber band lag quickly.  We had a siege the other day and between putting down defensive structures and players in the field... the lag made it very difficult to fight because of all the PING issues and rubber banding.\n\n5) Extremely time consuming.  This is NOT for the casual gamer if you are on the live multiplayer servers.\n\nIF they can fix this terrible PING and rubber banding it would be helpful.  The other flaws I don't know if they can resolve, but I guess it is possible if they even out the advantages of having 1 tier versus another in equipment.", "timestamp_created": 1710804347, "timestamp_updated": 1710804347, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533577024936676025", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1710833449, "developer_response": "Drahcir,\n\nThanks for your feedback about equipment and leveling, I have forwarded it to the devs. Server ping is an ongoing issue that we are working hard to alleviate by improving performance and adding new servers as players need them.\n\nIf you have any other feedback you'd like to provide, feel free to reach out ot pemulis on the official MoE Discord: discord.gg/mythofempires"}, "163258523": {"recommendationid": "163258523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830785054", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 578, "playtime_at_review": 511, "last_played": 1713736693}, "language": "english", "review": "My review is based off private servers.

It's not for everyone. To many people get beat, loose their stuff and rage quit because they were to attached to their stuff in-game. I see it over and over, then they come on Steam to give the game a bad review. You need a good group of people to work with. It doesn't have to be a big group. 2 or 3 friends and you can have a blast in this game. There are so many things you can do.\n\nDo you like Farming? Cool, pick up a hoe and start tilling a farm plot. The resources you acquire from it helps in the production of food, medicine and even weapon and armor crafting. So even if you are not a pvper your contribution to a clan's success is huge! Just please, don't try to go at it alone out there. You will end up back here giving a bad review on this game because some clan big or small rolled through your wooden base and took all your sh!t. All before you can truly explore the beautiful land ahead of you and everything it has to offer. \n\nProficiency points is key for personal progression. If you are make it up the levels and decide to jump on a horse with a polearm to try your had at pvp but haven't worked on your armor, polearm, riding and physique proficiency's, you are probably in for a rude awakening during your encounters and will end up dead. You have 2 choices from there, either start your proficiency grinds to improve your abilities or rage quit, come onto Steam and complain how that 3 man clan was a chinese zerg that raided you in your sleep and how they exploited to kill you.\n\nThis game also has other fun things to do other than the open world, you can try your had at prefectures. Win or lose, the longer you last the more merits you earn to spend on a type of ore to make better weapons and armor. Want to learn or get a better understand of how to raid? Do a few Siege Battles to both better prepare you and also earn merits you can use to buy important things in the guild shop. Heck, do the jousting event against other people to get a feel of where you stand with both your skills and build vs players.\n\nAll and all, this game is put together very well for an online survival game. Does it have it's cons? Yes, Server stability could be improved, lag spiking from time to time that effects both official and unofficial servers. One of the Iron mines on the new map is glitch as F%$# and will have you floating if you step in the wrong spot. Also, exploits have been found. The devs have been pretty good on patching those up though my clan found one last night that could break raiding. We have sent that one straight to the devs so they can fix it asap. My clan and I are doing our part to help make this game even better. Is it a perfect game, no. But it really is a fun game with beautiful ascetics and great gameplay.\n\nSo in closing I will recommend this game to everyone but with some cautions:\n\nDO NOT PLAY ALONE. Join a clan or get a few friends to play with you and start your own clan.\n\nTHIS GAME IS NOT INTENDED FOR KARENS. If you have a tendency of rage quitting after a death or 2 please don't bother buying this game. I really don't want to read your Karen a$$ $hit in the reviews later.\n\nPlay unofficial servers if you don't like the grind of official servers.

Has an in depth progression system with many paths to choose. The tame breeding system is exemplary with huge payoffs for specializing in taming, breeding, and running your own horse mill. The game makes use of a quest based tutorial system which helps and guides the player through the many aspects of the game. There are dailies and weeklies to help gauge your progress which I believe aids the game immensely. \n\nThe game also makes use of an interconnected auction house between all the servers in your cluster. This allows you to specialize in one area and sell your business for in game currency. In game currency can be used to buy 'anything' on the market so you don't have to specialize in everything to gear up and play the game.\n\nCons:\nYour capacity and ability to PvP/combat in this game is gated by an extreme grind which requires an exploit to progress to the level to remain competitive. Whether this is oversight by the developers or quietly intended by them it is a huge game killer. The damage you deal and the health/resistances you have is tied directly to what's called your \"proficiency\". Proficiency is gained by hitting enemies with the weapon of your choice to increase that proficiency. More proficiency = more damage overall. This creates a massive divide in player capability on the battlefield.\n\nCompetitive players and groups increase this proficiency by exploiting the thrall (NPC Slave) taming system and herding foxes into a 2x1 hut. I'm not going to disclose how this is done but it is a ridiculous exploit which requires a ton of time and menial mouse clicking/and or macro autoclicking (not consuming the content of the game, like doing treasure maps, clearing camps/bases, etc). If you're not performing this exploit you're going to essentially be unable to participate in any PvP or high tier combat activities. The entire premise of proficiency gain in this game is regulated by this exploit which makes the game not very fun; which is a shame because the game has good bones.\n\nAn addition to this problem is the fact that you have to keep the game running in the background of your PC to gain what's called 'idle proficiency', which acts as a booster to proficiency gain overall. It's just my opinion but I find having to keep the game open to gain idle proficiency ridiculous and I speculate this is used to pad gameplay hours for reviews such as these and maintain a healthy steamchart status.\n\nOverall conclusion:\nI wouldn't recommend this game to any players who don't enjoy grinding. Grind is the foundation of the game and if you don't enjoy it you won't enjoy the game at all. There are some great aspects of the game where you can log in to enjoy some relative simple tasks on PvE servers such as farming and horse taming but if you want to PvP in this game you're going to need to partake in numerous exploits to 'get ahead'.

I really liked this game... at first... after being in the world a bit... it's a hard learning curve, and even then it's one hell of a grind. Everything I came across disappointed me more and more. \n1. The grind isn't even the hard part, the hard part is if you want any Quality tools/weapon/armor you have to go afk... the dumbest crafting mechanic in a game ever! In order to increase your crafting skill you have to, well, craft at a bench. Here's the kicker, yah gotta stay there, crafting a million bullsh*t items to raise your level, not moving and just on autocraft... for hooooooooouuuuurrrrrsss... Dumb.\n2. If you are going to have a game that has combat... make it fun. There are sooooo many problems with combat it make you wanna bang your head on a rock. The melee isn't that bad, you choose from 8 different points of attack direction to swing, and your enemy has to block by the same direction or avoid by stepping out of the way. Simple and complex. The ranged is a joke! For the player, it take at least 4-5 second to knock an arrow and get it into firing point, hold it beyond that, you can't aim proper, oh and you can't move to fire, if you wanna hit your target. For the NPC, they can hit you across the map with pin point accuracy. While at the same time, walking ever closer to you all the way. Thats just the bow, if the NPC has a THROWING ROCK! your f*cking dead cause that hurts MORE and recharges faster...\n3. The leveling system is lacking to say the least, talk about living in the game. There are these dumb*ss mechanics that you have to do to level your skill. Fire literally millions of arrows out into the distance to get your bows up. Or enslave thralls and tie them up to beat them with a sword/pole/axe ect... for hours! to level up melee. \n4.Building in this game was stupid, I had to come up with so many work around to have a build that wasn't just a block. If you are doing to put that much custom interior stuff, you should be able to make neet buildings with curves and you know, design!... not just square/rectangles. Also in a building game, people (Myself included) like to make awesome building designs and fun concepts. Over water/valleys/rocks, your gonna have a bad time. Unless you pick a spot that is flat/boring/dull. Last be not least, you can't MOVE ANYTHING once it's placed down, nothing. You have to demo it if you f*cked up the placement or wanted to see what something would look like. You also would get all your mats back when you demo'd. also stupid.\n5. The storage in this game wasn't bad, but for the love of what ever you pray to, if you make a game that has crafting and lot of different work benches, have PULL FROM STORAGE!!!!\nI only played this game for 40 hours so there is a lot I didn't even get to see but just from the start I could see where this game was going. I didn't even talk about the time limits on the decay and guild TAX that you have to do to keep all you sh*t at your base.

That being said, there is one major flaw that is keeping me from investing in this game. Admittedly, it's not a problem that would affect most players- but it is a simple fix that can help bring in some players. \n\nWithin the options menu, you can change almost every keybind except for the interact key. Now I'm a weirdo and play on ESDF rather than WASD, and the default interact key is E. Because of this, every time I move I interact with whatever is in front of me and it makes for an unenjoyable experience. Even for those who don't play on ESDF, having a changeable interact key would be a nice simple change for those who don't like E for interacting.\n\nThere are also some minor changes that I would like to see. As others have mentioned, the UI is pretty cluttered and there are some parts that are in Chinese despite having English translations on. Some of the text doesn't fit within its window, and it's kinda jarring to look at- especially with a price tag of $40. \n\nThe tattoo and beard customizations are fantastic. You can place several tattoos wherever you wish on your body, and it's nice to have scruffier/thin beard options rather than the typical giant ball of fluff that most games have. Despite that, I'm surprised that there's a lack of changing eye color. Again I know for most people this won't matter- as you'll most likely cover your head in a helmet, but I think having a bit more customization options would allow for great roleplaying potential for players wanting to join an RP focused server.\n\nOverall, I'm excited about future development of this game- as there's not anything like it on the market. I recommend this game if you're fine with the default controls and are looking for a survival crafting sandbox while also being able to team up/fight against other players on a bigger scale (though you can also play solo if you wish) + aren't too bothered by small details being off.

Solo experience is a miserable grind and one fuck up could ruin your entire play-through, because again, the game doesn't respect your time. Optimization is ABYSMAL. You have to put time into taming, training, armors, weapons, and raising your warriors just for them to be completely useless in a fight. If they're gonna be cannon fodder, make them easier to obtain. Missing way too many quality of life features that are staples in most survival games, also missing quality of life features from the command mechanic that they very obviously copied from the Mount and Blade series. If you're looking here for a Mount and Blade experience, run away quickly, go play Mount and Blade.

There is no real blocking mechanics aside from the janky physics based parrying but realistically, you're not going to outfight a higher level NPC. Its just a numbers game. Not engaging and just boring.\n\nPhysics: Falling from less than 5 feet down the side of a hill instant kills you. Enough said. Physics engine that belongs in the 2000s. \n\nMovement: You are slow. You are slow no matter what. Forget not traversing with a horse, even for less than a kilometer. Getting out of my base and walking to the front door feels bad. Horses aren't even fast unless you start going for the mid/endgame stuff. Then you feel like you're going....except when you're not and the shitty terrain makes you fall five feet and your horse instantly dies.\n\nUI: It's not intuitive, the translation to English is fucking awful.

The representation of Myth of Empires in promotional materials may create misleading expectations. The actual gameplay experience deviates significantly from the content showcased in the provided videos.\n\nMyth of Empires faces challenges in providing an enjoyable experience due to its plethora of overly complicated menus and skill tree systems that seem to lack significant purpose. Furthermore, the user interface appears to be stuck in the early 2000s, presenting an unnecessarily cumbersome obstacle in terms of usability and navigation.Additionally, a significant drawback arises as substantial sections of the game lack proper translation into various languages, and essential tool tips that would elucidate the gameplay for the player are notably absent.\n\nThe game's animations could benefit from more depth, character, and a smoother overall feel. Currently, the gameplay feels somewhat cumbersome and fatiguing, particularly in combat situations. These issues could potentially hinder the overall gaming experience, especially in a PvP setting, making it less enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay experience becomes quite demanding in this game. As you progress in your skills, one would expect tasks to become more manageable. However, the reality is that each advancement introduces a heightened level of difficulty to every process. Transitioning from stone to bone to bronze tools should logically signify an improvement, yet it leads to an overwhelming resource grind. This dynamic creates the sensation of navigating through the game as if on an endless treadmill with no clear destination.\n\nIn essence, Myth of Empires attempted to emulate the success of titles like Ark: Survival Evolved and Conan Exiles. Unfortunately, it falls significantly short, failing to capture even half the essence of the gaming experience offered by its inspirational sources. Myth of Empires, positioned as a survival game, struggles to find its identity, often veering into the realm of an MMO. The overly complex systems within the game contribute to its lackluster appeal, leaving players with a sense of dissatisfaction and frustration.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.", "timestamp_created": 1708567827, "timestamp_updated": 1708703239, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505424976348876953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1709194520, "developer_response": "Thank you for your feedback, if you wish to share more insights about the game with us.

I've found immense enjoyment in constructing and expanding my empire, while also relishing the excitement of engaging in combat and gathering valuable resources. Additionally, the ability to team up with friends in a guild adds a layer of camaraderie and shared adventure that enhances the overall experience.\r\n\r\nWhile my exploration of the player-versus-player (PvP) aspect awaits, I anticipate diving into it soon. However, one aspect I hope to see improved is the management of server regions and guild sizes. Limiting the influence of other regions on servers and imposing restrictions on guild sizes could help prevent large groups from dominating the game's landscape.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"Myth of Empires\" earns a solid 4.4 out of 5 stars from me. It's a fantastic game to enjoy with friends, offering an accessible experience that doesn't overwhelm newcomers. As the developers continue to roll out updates and improvements, I look forward to revising my review and witnessing the game's evolution. Whether you're seeking adventure, camaraderie, or strategic challenges, \"Myth of Empires\" delivers an engaging experience that's well worth exploring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1710891092, "timestamp_updated": 1710891092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159728154": {"recommendationid": "159728154", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039357678", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 984, "last_played": 1710916735}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are looking for a vast, aesthetically pleasing. and endless hours of gameplay. please get this game. wow!", "timestamp_created": 1709424372, "timestamp_updated": 1709424372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159643279": {"recommendationid": "159643279", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123952048", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 38589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10595, "playtime_at_review": 5194, "last_played": 1713773114}, "language": "english", "review": "LAZY REVIEW STOLE HUGE POINT FROM ANOTHER PLAYER WHICH I 100% AGREE WITH\n\nThe key problem is that if your skills are low, you are literally useless. As soon as you have your first PvP encounter, it is abundantly clear that the only way to not die in one shot, or to do any appreciable damage to your opponent, you need to either no-life this game for 20 hours a day, or resort to some stupid kind of borderline exploit. This means that, in order to be able to play the game, you have to NOT play the game (the actual fun bits, anyway). Here are some ACTUAL examples:\n\nLevel too low? Make a bunch of stone sickles and go cut grass for a few hours until you level up. If this sounds mind-numbingly boring, it's because it is.\n\nTaking too much damage? Trap a bunch of foxes into a building with a respawn point, punch one of them on its stupid fuzzy jaw, and let them slowly nibble your ankles to death. Respawn and repeat for a few hours until you level up your health enough. If this sounds absolutely stupid, it's because it is.\n\nNot dealing enough damage? Clip a bunch of torture racks together and tie NPCs to them. Slap them with a rake for a few hours until your weapon skill is high enough. If this sounds eye-wateringly tedious, it's because it is.\n\n\nThe grind aspect of the game is flawed in any large game due to players finding the most efficient way to grind /meta\n\nI love the game its tedious af and its a huge time sync but my honest opinion is unless you have a 50 man guild and have done all of the above things or your own method of them then you will litterally be walked all over.\n\nlets say level 10 has enough coins and enough time to grind out these stats he would beat a level 30 due to his skill being better \n\nThe game could work well if all stats were tied to xp this would still allow us to grind even if we had to grind levels x5 as much and the xp gap was larger at least its only 1 stat rather than doing weird things for 30+ stats \n\nPutting a thumbs up because we have a large group and can sustain the grind.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A CASUAL PLAYER GAME", "timestamp_created": 1709335009, "timestamp_updated": 1709335009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159208168": {"recommendationid": "159208168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198985502703", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 782, "last_played": 1708898219}, "language": "english", "review": "a", "timestamp_created": 1708832395, "timestamp_updated": 1708832395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159185008": {"recommendationid": "159185008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132143886", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 12172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 483, "playtime_at_review": 3254, "last_played": 1713554582}, "language": "english", "review": "i played this game be for i left steam and and new it back steam its a good game to play with friends and to make friends", "timestamp_created": 1708809002, "timestamp_updated": 1708809002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159140303": {"recommendationid": "159140303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033095179", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1534, "last_played": 1709570979}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

So I've spent 16 hours in the game, give or take, read the manual for it, and I've done enough content to comment on this a bit from a huge survival genre fan standpoint, but also can comment from a more technical standpoint as i've worked in the game development field as well.\n\nThis game is pretty good. that is your TL:DR of it. If you enter this to compare it to conan exiles, RUST, mount and blade, conquerors blade, ARK, Life Is Feudal, etc. then you are already setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nThis game is very early access. Yes, it has a huge amount of content, sandbox building, skill trees, in depth grouping, guilds, city government type stuff, and other really unique features I was surprised to see. But some of the more core game mechanics need polishing. The combat is very rough around the edges as they focus on 2 different combat styles. This is coming from someone using their classic combat mode, I will be switching next time im on the other combat mode.\n\nAlso, everyone is really early level. My current official server, the top is lv 28 before penalties, And i've been putting a lot of time into the game as well, but I am no where near top level or high level crafting. I don't even know where to get Iron yet.\n\nThe PVP i cannot even comment on because I am on an official server which is PVE currently, but you can take your character to other servers (Counties).\n\nTranslation needs work, combat needs work, some animations need work, the building system needs a few adjustments but it works.\n\nAgain, its not a terrible game, It is pretty, its fun if you are into these sorts of games, and I cannot wait to start getting into diplomacy, seeing how transactions and trades work out, see a huge siege battle or huge armies marching by.\n\nAgain, if you come into this game comparing it to others, you will start off having a bad time. Every game everyone is comparing this too all started in this state and crawled out of their bad reviews slowly. Giant survival games like this take a lot of polishing before they end up great. Some dont even make it to the great part.\n\nThe state of this game and early access, and if you like survival type games? I can recommend. It is constantly being updated, bugs are getting squished, you can tell by the systems in place that the developers like what they are working on, its a good game. Will it get better? in time of course. They seem to be listening to the playerbase / early access buyers, so yeah, I can recommend. Needs work though, but its playable and enjoyable. Also, go start in the riverlands or the mountains, its beautiful out there.\n\nI would ignore the low hour count reviews. Not disregarding their opinion, but the game does not really open up till around lv 20. A lot of today's pc gamer's demand a lot of instant satisfaction and do not realize this is a slow burn game like ARK or conan. It takes time to get to where you need to be, but each tier is rewarding and does not feel grindy.....yet. time will tell though.\n\ncurrent state? 7/10\n\nIts not bad, but needs work.", "timestamp_created": 1637381753, "timestamp_updated": 1637381753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 451, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911618828773498535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104396697": {"recommendationid": "104396697", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961098610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 712, "last_played": 1638046246}, "language": "english", "review": "The game (on PvP servers) is entirely run by a MASSIVE Chinese alliance with hundreds of members across 30+ guilds that run from server to server wiping out everyone they see.

The world looks gorgeous. Nothing wrong there. The map is beautiful, the characters creation has lots of options and the items and gear look for the most part very well done.\n.) Controlling horses feels interesting. They are not easy to control but it gives the game a good feeling. Horses don't just stop on the spot as if hitting some brakes. They also don't turn around on the spot. The game does this very well.\n.) Crafting has depth and is rather interesting. The modular house building is well done.\n.) The map is big! This is amazing to me. I like big maps.\n.) Animations are exceptional, especially for animals. How they move and act feels very natural and realistic.\n.) Bugs are not very widespread, in this regard it is very solid for an early access title.\n\nThen there are things, that some might like, that might still be improved on that I don't worry too much about, but that I personally don't enjoy in its current state:\n\n.) Walking speed is what one might be used to from other survival open world games, nothing new there. Sprint speed however is extremely slow. One could argue about realism and all that, but in the end it's still a game. It's not fun feeling like a snail that has a sprinting speed only like 20-30% faster than walking speed.\n.) NPCs don't do much when it comes to resource gathering. You only have a few and you cannot have your own little army. The amounts they gather is minuscule and really not worth mentioning in the overall scheme of things and its mostly a time sink. It doesn't help much when you have one of your NPCs gather ore for a dozen hours only for them to come back with a few hundred pieces. That's something you make yourself in 5-10 minutes. If you could have dozens of NPCs it might be different, but with such a low maximum, the effort just isn't worth it at all.\n.) Many mechanics look like they offer a lot of depth, but they fall flat and are just made overly complicated to provide very simple things. This includes the whole nobility rank system, most of the taxes and benefit systems and most of the farming and food stuff.\n.) There is no proper storage solution. You need raw materials and processed materials in all kinds of crafting stations, meaning you spread out your resources over multiple crafting stations all over the place instead of just being able to store your items somewhere and then using those stored items in some range directly to craft. The outcome is a lot of running around just dragging resources from one storage or crafting station to another.\n.) Durability for tools is unbalanced to the extreme. You barely use some tools a few times before they already break. What's the point of having a horse with a cart when you can't even fill it up with a fully repaired tool?\n.) Having torture devices as a means to make subordinates loyal to you is both questionable from a lore point of view, as well as very bad taste. There is no game reason to torture people. I'm neither squeamish or very worried about some cutscene where torture is implied, I'm also not worried if it makes sense in the game, for example if you have some enemy spy and want to get some information out of them. But for acquiring subordinates? That just makes no sense whatsoever. You don't torture people and then expect them to become your loyal followers. You might threathen them as a tyrant, you might torture others to intimidate them, but you don't just randomly torture someone and expect them to become loyal.\n\nThe game is still in early access and many of these things go along with balancing. The others are not bad enough to not give a recommendation. Theres a few things however that I dislike to a point where I didn't enjoy playing the game:\n\n.) Mouse controls for the character feel horrible to the extreme. There is an insane delay of up to a second when turning around. It feels as bad as if you would be playing an FPS title with mouse acceleration turned up to the max. You cannot make precise movements, it feels clunky and unresponsive. Especially as this is a game that focuses on action combat, it makes the whole combat system garbage\n.) You have no way to preview buildings that you place. You see a random light outline, that for the most part gives you no idea where the front entrance might be, how the building might look when placed. On top of that once placed, there is no time to move, turn or change it in any way, as such you can only destroy it and make a new one.\n.) Combat balancing is so far off the charts that it makes fighting anything a bother. You can be level 30, with a full set of bronze armor and weapons, but a level 15 boar or wolf will still come close to killing you if they are alone, and they will massacre you if there are two. We're not talking about some legendary animal. It's your low-end run of the mill animals. That doesn't feel fun and makes no sense. A person in full leather armor with a sword not standing a chance against a wolf that cannot even bite through your armor is not very logical. Even from a game aspect, an overleveled, overgeared character shouldn't have any issues fighting a few animals if its boars or wolves. Heck even foxes kill you easily if there are 2 or 3 at the beginning.\n.) There is nothing interesting to explore. The game currently feels like you run around pretty landscape, but at no point do you find anything \"new\" that is interesting or cool to see beyond appreciating the nice looks. The amount of enemies is rather small and they are all the same, other than perks there is no real reason to even explore in the first place and it feels like getting around is not only slow, even with a horse, but also pointless.\n\nWhile Myth of Empires has definitely potential, and a first look is definitely interesting, especially the AI could be cool, it is not at the point currently, where I personally see it as fun to play. It feels too clunky, too unpolished when it comes to mechanics and combat and other than grinding stats and building a house, there is really not much to see when it comes to PvE. As for PvP .. with the combat controls this bad, it's not much fun either for me.", "timestamp_created": 1638375969, "timestamp_updated": 1638375969, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 117, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.79220736026763916", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103156517": {"recommendationid": "103156517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036886144", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 9404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1708594778}, "language": "english", "review": "Ark, Conan Exiles, Life is Feudal and a bit of bannerlord.

There are tons of building pieces, crafting stations, weapons, armor, etc. to unlock. To give a good example of this, I think there are 4 or so tiers of building pieces in the game (Wood, Clay, Stone, Metal) To put this into perspective, Ark: Survival Evolved released with 2 tiers.\n+ The map is also HUGE. I've only explored maybe a 1/5th of the map in my whole 20 hours. There are also different biomes to encounter as well. The biomes can range from swamp, mountains, plains, rain forest, etc. \n+ To add onto the map, there are a good amount of AI camps which you can go and try and kill or capture them. There are some friendly camps as well which allow you to peacefully recruit your \"warriors\" by giving them certain items (Ex. 18 bandages, 22 raw meat, coarse leather armor). \n+ The skill system is pretty runescape-esque and diverse. You can level up woodcutting, physique, riding, etc. Each of the categories comes with their own perks you can unlock as you level up. If you love grinding, then you'll love this. \n+ The guild system is pretty interesting and in depth as well. You can level up your guild by spending coins and activity points (You get these points just by playing) on buffs that apply to everyone in your guild. There are also certain guild buildings that can be unlocked and used by your guild. Trade posts, watch towers, territory marker, etc. \n+ Game performance is pretty decent. My rig isn't the greatest either and I can run it just fine on low-medium settings at 60 FPS.\n\nNow that the good features in this game have been outlined, let's get into the bad of the game... and there are a lot of them. \n\n- Myth of Empires (On vanilla rates) is so FUCKING grindy for a solo player. Honestly, this is more a me problem than anything. This game was clearly meant to play in a large group. The guild system is HEAVILY favored towards large groups (duh). Those guild buffs can be super helpful too, if you don't have them you'll be playing at a disadvantage. So if you're thinking about playing this game solo, don't. \n- There isn't much PVE content in the game. Most of your time will be collecting resources to craft new items and buildings. This is just so BORING... there is a quest system to help alleviate that boredom, but even that is boring as fuck. You'll get quests to craft XYZ item or go collect XYZ resource. I haven't seen any main quests deviate from that method. There are some exceptions but even then they're boring.\n- The movement feels so slow in this game, I understand it's trying to be realistic but come on... I can't even tell the difference between my character sprinting or walking. If you want to do any sort of traveling, a horse is pretty much required. Even then, the horse still feels slow. Now with breeding and training you can upgrade your horse, but holy fuck the early game feels so boring.\n- The translation in this game is very... meh. I understand the development team is Chinese. But can't you hire a translator who's competent in translating Chinese to English? It feels like they pulled some random Joe off the street who spoke English, told him to translate, and called it good. Sometimes I get the general idea of what a certain item or feature is supposed to do, other times i'm at a loss for words. Some items just aren't translated at all either, the item or item description is still in Mandarin Chinese. \n- Building on my last point, this game is so confusing at times. The MOST important parts in the game are not explained whatsoever. Which I think for a survival game is fine! Trial and error can be super fun and rewarding when you finally figure out how something should work. But in this game, it's just frustrating. You want to know how to refresh your decay timer on your flag claim so your buildings don't decay? Nope, not explained! Well how do I make \"donations\" to the Imperial court, what about selling my items? Nope, fuck you not explaining! The amount of times I've seen people ask questions in in-game chat is astronomical (Most of which remained unanswered). This makes it so much worse with a language barrier and poor translation between the devs and players of this game.\n-  The combat in this game is so bad, lol. MoE's combat system reminds me of a \"For Honor\" type system where you can attack and block at certain angles (up, right, left, down). But it feels so much worse, It feels so unresponsive at times. I cannot imagine how PvP is right now, and I don't even wanna know with how bad combat is right now. \n- This game is somewhat buggy too. Items and buildings not working correctly to the music cutting out and not playing at all making it dead silent. For an early access game released a couple days ago, that's to be expected honestly. More are bound to pop up so don't be surprised. \n\nI could go on but I think you get the general grasp of how this game is in its current state. There is so much to talk about that it would be impossibly long to cover everything. The foundation is definitely there, which I cannot say the same about other survival early access titles out there. I also haven't been able to explore everything there is to in this game, such as the government system. That would take waaay too long, and I honestly don't want to invest more time in this game until they polish it more. If you're desperate to play a Survival MMO game with the boys or just bored at of your mind, then I'd lightly recommend it. Otherwise, I would just wait a year,two, or even three before buying it. And who knows, maybe they'll just abandon the game and leave it half-finished. \n\nTL;DR.  Game has a lot of content, huge map to explore, and lots of features to learn and enjoy. But it feels too half-baked to warrant any sort recommendation.

at times bad but thats the only bad issue with game probably going to be solved sooner than later.\nGraphic wise there are some points to be improved, but it has great graphics in total, better than conan or ark, and with almost 0 bugs and lag issues.(watch the top of the mountains on the moonlight while u fish and u ll understand me)\nGameplay: now i ll sound harsh but it has more depth than life is feudal,ark,conan,last oasis and close to or similar only to kenshi (kenshi is a bit better on details)\nThe gameplay where u can hunt animals and according to your behaviour towards them, u gain or lose reputation that results to animals to act \"friendly or indefferent\" to u, to even attack on site reactions\nU can build castles (imagine the size on conan  but without the gods and constant hunt for priests) very big buildings,multi leveled, with defferent grades of material(wood, clay and so on) and make your structure more ressilient to attacks\nU can build all kind  of weapons but i would like a bit more variety on it, like i like there are 2 kinds of shields but not round shields cause chinese didnt use them, or differnt kind of swords, and so on\nUI is amazing and has sooo many bars and skills and traits and progression to do and to unlock,i cant give an example of a game so good made in ui aspect ,not even close\nThe game is grindy but to the point  of realistic not crazy\nIF u want a big castle u need alot of mats that are hard to gather,dangers are all around the corners  to kill u even by accident\nThe sec u throw your arrow on a fox and 15 come to kill u as they do u ll understand how realistic it is, wolves can be solo or in packs of even 5-6 , pigs are almost always in pairs , deers in 3-4 and tigers so far i ve seen only solo :P\n(yes there are tigers and it instant killed me and my horse at level 28)\nhorses can be tamed and used in mellee or ranged combat like conguerors blade but not as smooth(as said this is realistic)\nArchery is amazing and on to the point with the targeting system\nMellee fight is similar to the last oasis directional hits action combat\nCRAFTING is amazing and u can craft almost anything u imagine (sure some things are missing but i am not in the end game i am in early game)\nyour actions in game contribute points to the guild that uses your activity points and gold to improve its status and influence\nAND to top that all u can go to npc camps ( there are hostile and friendly ones) where u can fight different level of npcs which like in conan u can drag around and start torturing so u can have them as slaves\n(in conan u put them in wheel of pain and u wait for them to be ready , here u can tie them up and litterally u beat them to hell and back and u increase stats by doing so too ....CRAZZYYYYYYY!!!)\nu can discover mineral places and make mines for using them yourself to mine what u need (copper, iron.etc) or use one of your beloved slaves\nall in all in 30 hours i think the game needs a few additions,the european players just started founding about this game, they just added 3 more eu servers yesterday, but as a game in early access its OMG\nand this comes from a player that plays all kind of survival games with 1000s of hours gametime\ni really think  u should  give this game a chance already 25k players everyday enjoy it \nAHHH forgot it also has pvp if u so choose \nhope i see u in the official server\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1637589698, "timestamp_updated": 1637589698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score":

game.[/b]\n\nWhile it has progression via quests and side quests a lot of the game is left unexplained, being so new game guides and wiki are sparse and many of your questions about the game cannot be found even on their official discord. An example would be your quests lead you to create a personal claim, that claim is protected from decay via a personal claim banner that has a 2 day timer. When you hover over it, it has text saying you have paid for protection, interact with it and it gives you a method of selling items for currency to the lord or the land. You would assume (based on games like Rust with their resource cabinets) this was a way of increasing your protection window but that isn't the case. Essentially you have to destroy and replace the personal claim flag to reset the personal timer, which isn't stated anywhere. Oh and when it comes to guild claims, you CAN reset the timer without replacing, which leads to confusion.\n\nServer Selection is... weird. I assume you start by selecting a Global Hub, Then a regional server hub (EU/NA/Asia) and finally a game region. Thankfully when you rejoin the game there is a \"quick join\" option but I hope friends can join me via steam friends as I have no idea how to find out exactly what/where I am located. I know that each server is 80 players and you can transfer from one server to another via ingame currency but I've yet to find the NPC to allow me to do so.\n\nGraphics are decent, The game puts my poor RX 580 to 99% utilisation however hidden under the nice grass and foliage most of the actually ground surface lacks detail like you would find in games like Conan Exiles. Its a game that looks nice with full graphics but looks like a game from 2002 if you strip away the foliage.\n\nCombat Mechanics are clunky. You have two modes \"MoE\" and \"Classic\". The only difference I could see is MoE's own mode blocks while you hold the attack key down and you move your mouse to the direction you want to attack from, while Classic Mode enables right click block. I need to input here that you right click block with off-hand when one is equipped so I'd recommend using MoE mode. At any rate, this game is not a fast paced twitch shooter, more like a combat simulator in which player tactics and positioning will be key over player skill and reaction time. It play like Last Oasis but much slower and without grappling, nor is it as fluid as games like Conan Exiles.\n\nCrafting is good, its slightly too resource intensive early game, talking 1000's of grass turned into rope and 100's of trees for a basic 2x2 house and armour. I've not even gotten to the smelting stage yet, although I have gathered copper ready for it. Your early game is wood, bone then hide/fabric. The Crafting progression is nice, earn points with actions and use points to unlock a progression tree split into 4 or 5 different tabs.\n\nNobility system is still early days for me, I've ranked up once which gave me 2.5% more HP. From what I've seen thus far you can become a lord of the land and such, have peons to work for you like Thralls in Conan Exiles but I've not gotten that far. I did find recruits, who when you walk upto them and press E they list the various stuff they want as payment for you to hire them, thinks like raw meat and armour.\n\nLevelling seems to happen as you play, gathering, crafting and completing quests. There are even daily quests and such but at this time levelling up is a secondary while I construct a base and progress through crafting. You level quite quickly just by progressing through the main quest line.\n\n[b]Why do I recommend?[/b]\nThis game starts with your run of the mill sandbox survival game core and adds questing, governance and server transfers. If your like me and you own practically every game under the survival sandbox genre, there is a lot here that is unique to the title to justify the box price. As for the games longevity only time will tell. If the studio behind this title keep building on the foundation they have here this game could become very popular like Rust or Conan. If however they keep it as is, you will get your hours worth out of it with the content available as of right now. I would say though, the game while not in an alpha state is still rough around the edges in certain areas, if you can live with that then go for it.", "timestamp_created": 1637419286, "timestamp_updated": 1637419286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744044184684753418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103050908": {"recommendationid": "103050908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249603794", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 42392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1670759260}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent game.

It is early access, so what I have to say needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. The game looks quite nice and seems to run stable enough on my RTX2070. There are deep mechanics at play here. I'm not sure if they are too complicated though. Casual players might find this to much of a grind fest. But for now, it's a thumbs down until devs change a few things. Firstly, it's not very solo player-friendly at all. Most NPC camps have large numbers of soldiers. Fighting them is a death sentence. Maybe with a lot of time and grind spent in the game, I could level up enough and recruit more NPC warriors to fight with me. Until then, it's really just a survival game with hunting and mining. Secondly, the run speed of your character is painfully slow. Even now, I have tamed a horse, even that runs slower than what I'd expect my characters sprint speed to be. It's really getting on my nerves. Not sure if it's devs trying to pad out travel speed or what. Maybe the running speed is tied to skills you upgrade, but it's really unbalanced and needs some taming. Combat is not that good, with attacks feeling slow and clunky. They have a directional attack system, which feels odd. They should streamline the combat to feel more like games such as Assassins Creed Odyssey or even Dark Souls. It needs fast fluid combat with dodge rolls and less complicated attacks. Resources are too slow to harvest; you need so many sticks to craft stuff; I'm sick of chopping trees. I'm aware levelling skills linked to this will increase yield, but it's slow going at the early stages of the game. My review is almost a positive one, and it will be if I see changes implemented to balancing the game as I've mentioned.
