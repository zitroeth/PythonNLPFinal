Took me about 25 hours. Here's the skinny:\n\nGame is indeed like a combination of Forager and Factorio but does neither of them better. The beginning is very fun. Probably the first 9-10 hours you'll just be excited to see what's around the corner and what else will unlock. This isn't a bad game. In fact, I enjoyed it a lot. But I feel like I have more criticism than I do positive things to say about it at the moment because the end of the game spoiled the first 3/4 of it.\n\nI've put many, many hours into Factorio. The greatest thing about Factorio is the idea that THE FACTORY MUST GROW. You have a practically infinite map with a blueprint system and can make the most massive factory imaginable.\n\nThis is NOT THE CASE HERE. You have very little space to work with. Towards the end I was cramming all these assemblers on a tiny little island trying to get the last few products (which take a very long time to make by the way) and had no way to speed up production because I was literally out of space to place more production building. This is even with the gem speed-up upgrades.\n\nLogistics and collector robots also need a serious upgrade because only being able to have 5 per island is not enough when you start dealing with packaged products. At no point in the game can the logistics robots carry more than 1 individual item at a time, yet packaged products need 100 of an item to make? So you seriously need to make 100 trips per package? Why can't they carry stacks of an item? It feels like the devs themselves only seriously playtested the game's last 25% to make sure it was at least functional before shipping it.\n\nAnd yet I still recommend the game. It's fun. I think it's going to get better. But you'll see what I'm talking about as the game nears the endpoint. We need more space to work with. If it were me, I would make each island about 50% bigger or add 50% more islands. It's silly that there are at least 3 islands we can't actually build on.

However, I felt like the trailer for it is a bit misleading.\n\nIt feels like it's telling you there's exploration, but there isn't. Everything you see is either part of some minigame, or very integrated into the game. For example, you cannot travel to islands before you unlock them. However, each island is a biome, which provides you with materials you need to unlock the next island or tech. Therefore, it's not that you \"happened upon\" that part, it's not that you \"explored\" it either. It's that you had to go there to progress.\n\nThe skills and bonuses you get are an absolute necessity. I'm currently at end-game, and the grind is real, even with every single bonus in the game. Some rewards are skins for your character, which was also a negative for me. Even completing an area at the museum simply gives you a skin and a boost to max HP. I am only struggling to complete it now because I'm a completionist. There really is 0 reason to complete the museum.\n\nThe most necessary bonuses (gem tower, house comfort, etc) are gated, and the gate is at a very low limit. For example, you get a bonus where your buildings work faster. If you upgrade that bonus to the final tier (which will take you a while), that bonus is only 50%. Not even 100.\n\nThough the game starts in a cool manner, you drop to an alien planet, and have to figure out what to do etc, I almost immediately lost immersion as there are many other people who have already built a settlement next to you lmao. Yeah, they're necessary as you can trade for stuff and buy stuff from them, but again, I was expecting something else.\n\nThe limit on the bots per island (yeah, there is one) is just 5. Though 5 is initially more than you need (well, u have to upgrade that to get to 5, it starts from 3 I think), in the end-game it's extremely low. This could be solved if logistic bots could be upgraded to pick up many materials at once, there is no such upgrade. In general there is only a few signifcant upgrades, without which the game would grind to a halt. And then there are many completely unnecessary upgrades, like \"auto-use medkit\" and \"auto-use oxygen bottle\", which you get towards the end-game and by then you no longer need them.\n\nThere's also the flying bots. You have to manually tell them what to bring where. Meaning, get this item and deliver it to that specific storage. However, there are item-specific storages, which the logistic bots see. So there could be an auto-button, that simply delivers that item to any specific storage. Or a setting on the storage itself, like, \"auto-deliver here\". There are no such things. The reason I'm saying this is because at some point in the game you have to deliver up to 4 items to all islands. You have to build 4 storages on each island, then make 4 flying bots (1 for each item), then manually select each route for each island. This is completely silly and needlessly time-consuming.\n\nThere are no priorities. You cannot set any importance of any item delivery. Not even in world-wide logistics. I don't know how priority is calculated (maybe it's just a loop) but it's really bad that you cannot set at least an \"important\" button.\n\nAnyway, I'll stop here, I'm sure you get the gist. The game is fine, it's cool to play, but for this price (10% discount, 18 euros) it's not worth it imho. I don't want to collect skins, I want my character to be what is advertised (that futuristic girl in the trailer) and then I want actual rewards that matter in the game when I do quests.\n\nSo yeah, I recommend it, it's fun, but not at this price, and not at 10% discount either. This would be more like a 5-7 eu game. Even 10 would be fine.

If you never played Forager or Factorio then you could enjoy it but please first check both games before Nova Lands because you will see how Nova Lands is just a waste of money.\nBelow are some small spoilers to the game (but you will experience them in the first 2 hours of the game).\n\nPros:\n- Definitely feels like a vibe of Forager\n- Bots are available almost from the beginning of the game. It can start feeling like a Factorio type of game since the first 20-30 minutes of the gameplay\n- Fantastic animations, sounds, soundtrack, whole visual effects\n- You can do a bit more complex \"base\" compared to Forager (or even Stardev Valley)\n- Really relaxing and chilling for the first 2 hours\n\nCons:\n- After the second hour of gameplay, you cannot return the game on Steam and from this point I started feeling like the whole game has been created to deliver fantastic first 2 hours and then it's going down with whole quality.\n- Costs more than Forager or Factorio and got MUCH MUCH MUCH less content than both games.\n- Feels more like \"copy-paste of Forager\" instead of \"Forager genre\". The way of levelling, the skill tree, etc. Nova Lands is using these systems in a much worse way and the original design from Forager (or Factorio) is much more fun.\n- Compared to Forager: Skills are boring and you cannot go with all directions in the skill tree. Many skills are not extending the content but changing the numbers (\"+15% quicker production\").\n- Compared to Forager: You will have a place to collect items but each collection will give you just a new skin and +20 to health. Disappointing. Each reward is the same and each collection is easy to find in game.  In Forage you could get a star which was used to progress the skill tree or get an additional bonus later but here you have just dissapointing reward.\n- Compared to Forager: Upgrades to weapons and equipment are just numbers: +25% quicker harvesting, +25% quicker walking, etc. Forager had many weapons, many unique upgrades and tools which upgrade could extend the content. Nova Lands hasn't got any of them. The first weapon is your last weapon.\n- Compared to Forager: Enemies are extremely boring and easy to beat. Bosses and \"puzzles\" are even worse and dissapointing. I skipped one boss fight by accident because I resolved really simple puzzle before the fight. I didn't know how I could re-do it and do the proper fight.\n- Compared to Forager: Except 2 puzzles related to 2 bosses, you will not find any more puzzles in the game. It was a big part of Forager. Both puzzles are very simple and feel like placeholder instead of real proper puzzles.\n- Compared to Factorio: You can create a more complex \"factory\" between islands, but what's the point? The \"Factory must grow\" type of vibe isn't here because the space is limited and the game is not offering tools to do it with the same pleasure as in Factorio (or any other Factorio-ish game).\n- Compared to Factorio: Bots are very limited. The complexity is minimal. You can try to speed up a bit this and that in your \"base\" but at the same time game hasn't got mechanisms to do it quickly and without pain. Manual work is always required because Nova Lands is not offering proper blueprints.\n- Compared to Factorio: Nova Lands is trying to borrow some complexity from Factorio-ish games but at the same time, it's stuck in the middle and cannot deliver the proper \"I have automatised my base\" feeling without frustration. Many times I felt like \"oh man, I could do this so faster in Factorio\".\n- Some mechanisms could be cut out. Example? Oxygen. After the first 20-30 minutes (and unlocking some skills and upgrades) the oxygen wasn't a problem till the end of the game. Why add and continue using this mechanism till the end of the game when it can be fully skipped after the first 30 minutes? It's giving a part of survival like in Forager but Forager was connecting it with stamina and health. Nova Lands simplified it in a bad way.\n- Some reviews on Steam mentioned missing tooltips and I fully agree with it. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what is the third item I need for plasteel (it was a scale from one of the animals - the icon was absolutely rubbish and the tooltip was missing, so I spent ages trying to figure out what's that).\n\nIt's been 1 month since I created this review and since the release of the game and devs didn't update with any future roadmap or future updates.", "timestamp_created": 1687634736, "timestamp_updated": 1690712822, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 86, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765478074550628662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145879733": {"recommendationid": "145879733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068249299", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2469, "last_played": 1694125540}, "language": "english", "review": "7.2/10 \n\nPros:\n+ Automation game play\n+ Nice art style\n+ Decent casual music\n+ Worth while 100% achievements \n\nCons:\n- Very slow late game scaling.\n- Museum is tedious\n- Needs minecraft item stack manipulation \n\nConclusion:\n\nI enjoyed my time spent playing this.

For example, I found several problems:\n\n1) Recipes in the ovens have different font sizes for some reason, such as modular bricks. \n\n2) encountered incorrect display of items in warehouses, ie, they just disappeared (but after some time may appear)\n\nUPD: I've had items disappear after I put them in a warehouse (modular bricks, iron and copper ingots, charcoal, etc). This happened at completely random moments.\n\n3) The thing that annoyed me the most was that backpack items were disappearing, i.e. resources that I was collecting. There was a full inventory, and after restarting the game they were gone...\n\nI can say that, the game will still be refined and has a good chance of being a decent indie. Even though my gameplay experience wasn't perfect because of the bugs, I thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay.\n\nP.S. I'll be waiting for the hotfixes!\nUPD: the first hotfix has already been released!

You constantly unlock something new that demands your attention, always doing something to improve your factory - setting up new production chains or reorganizing old islands to be more efficient. The game also throws in a little variety to mix things up, there's an occasional simple boss to defeat and an asteroid mining mini game which rewards you with efficiency upgrades for your whole factory. \n\nUnfortunately as you're nearing the end game the simplified systems start to show their ugly side. There is no way to set consumption priority for buildings or regulate the flow of resources in any way. This manifests in having no way to control what will starve if you're underproducing some resource because you cannot tell the game to deliver more resources to one place than the other. This is especially annoying in the end game where it's hard to overproduce certain resources so you have to rely on turning facilities on and off or manually moving stuff to compensate. It's not as bad as it sounds, but it sticks out. Also, the last story quest as of writing requires a bunch of end game resources that are easier produced just by leaving the game idle for 4 hours than trying to speed up its production. \n\nDespite that I still recommend Nova Lands, It's a fun, rewarding < 20 hour playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1702151019, "timestamp_updated": 1702151019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738505899906158447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "154658281": {"recommendationid": "154658281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043017274", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 676, "last_played": 1704136541}, "language": "english", "review": "The game I wanted Forager to be.", "timestamp_created": 1703797421, "timestamp_updated": 1703797421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732348799705505371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143654260": {"recommendationid": "143654260", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994679213", "num_games_owned": 1012, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 588, "last_played": 1691078999}, "language": "english", "review": "Forager meet factorio light, but not remotely as fun as either.

In many ways this discounts the purpose of having trees, since you can't actually pursue one without pursuing all of them since you won't have the items or upgrades needed for the other. So for example if you wanted to just focus on farming and animals and turn the game into a farm sim you couldn't do it without first upgrading the automation, logistics, and potentially combat trees. So perceived choice without actual choice or depth.\n2) There's a major lack of information in the game of what items are, and instead leaves that part to finding a specific image in a sea of areas. Might be on the upgrade module, might be produced in a building, might be collected from an island you haven't unlocked yet, you just don't know. And when these specific items are needed to upgrade the tree and it's the only thing you need it only makes finding it that much more frustrating, as you're effectively soft-locked in progression until you find a needle in a haystack. At least give it a name, or add a book with items listed so you don't spend 30 minutes trying to figure out what you need to do. \n3) No tutorial :( Not necessary if you're familiar with the genre, but could be tough if it's your first entry.\n4) There's are unnecessary time restraints put into the system that don't add to the game but rather slow it down for no reason. You need a mountain of mushrooms for a specific recipe in order to progress the game, but I was only able to unlock one island that had them, so I wound up spending 2 hours waiting around fully capped in automation because an item just didn't spawn regularly enough to keep things moving.\n\nRECAP: It's a beautiful game artistically and in creativity, but falls short on many of the automation basics that are the bread and butter of the genre.

They are overly obtuse and not fun.\n[*]Add challenge achievements, rather than just time achievements. \"Defeat X boss without firing a shot\" should be something you should strive to be possible.\n[*]Provide a way to direct bots beyond just requester and provider chests. Maybe prioritization settings? Or more types of bots?\n[*]Reduce the overall skin unlock count and just provide most skins as \"alts\" of others, all unlocked at once.\n[*]The final unlock for the museum is pointless by the time it's unlocked.

I'm glad the description of the game mentions Factorio, Forager, and Satisfactory, because those are definitely the most apt comparisons, while I haven't played Forager myself, I am a huge Factorio addict, so I decided to take a chance on this game, wondering how it stacks up.\n\nI would say that, if you are looking for a more relaxed and casual Factorio experience, this is probably what you're looking for.  While the game does feature combat, it isn't particularly deep and I would not say I was challenged at any point, however for those that DO find the combat challenging, the fact that there are alternative solutions to the few boss enemies in the game that don't involve combat is a neat addition.\n\nWhile you won't get the absolute HIGH of Factorio, you will still get that great experience automation games give you, of having an incomprehensible and complex looking factory, where logistics bots are flying around, collector bots collecting, crafting stations crafting, and items in general just flying around the map to where they need to go, and as such I think it succeeds at being an automation game.\n\nI would say the first 3/4ths of the game is very solid, and I have very little criticism I feel I could give.  The last 1/4th however, just after you finish Plasteel research, is where I felt the game was dragging.  process timers in Assemblers and Refineries are pretty excessive, forcing you to build at larger scales, however this comes at the cost of resource generation.  I think ultimately the math works out because I would say there's at least 2 islands that I think you would have no issues if you just filled out the entire space with your actual factory, and the rest you would want to carefully think about how you're laying things out, but once again thinking about the process timers, i feel like there's just something to be said that one of the end game mechanics is just laying in bed to get a productivity bonus, really encourages just speeding up the timer rather than expanding out.\n\nThe game isn't very long, probably 20-30 hours to 100% it in it's current state, but I think that's absolutely fine for a game at this price.\n\nUltimately, if you're looking for a casual Factorio experience, it's a game I can recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1688923780, "timestamp_updated": 1688923780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618146240711212158", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140511089": {"recommendationid": "140511089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142019150", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 254, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1688329747}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game with open world.

For a game that is $20, I shouldn't be completely bored and over it so soon in. What sucks is that I have been looking forward to this game since it was up for wishlist on Steam. I even really enjoyed the demo that they made. I don't know what happened between here and there, maybe it is me. Who really knows.

Doing this makes the entire tree farm do nothing as the beam is stuck on the first tree and does not automatically harvest the hive.\n\nHarvester priority can be somewhat annoying when trying to capture creatures that move a lot as the harvester (on controller) will often prioritize everything but the creature. This can be made worse if you have a fighter bot on the island as you can't temporarily disable them except by removing them from the antenna and in many cases, the bots will often either kill the creature first or it will be very close (bots can kill a creature that is in the capture animation or being mounted).\n\nTrying to send bots on more than 7 islands is effectively impossible on m+kb because it will keep trying to return to the top, but there are 8 islands that you'd want to send to. On controller it is just barely possible if you hold down the button.\n\nAs a note: It is possible to jump into the water instead of onto an island. If you do, you'll just walk on the water for a bit until you jump back onto an island.", "timestamp_created": 1693800972, "timestamp_updated": 1693835028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576987683773040771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156477851": {"recommendationid": "156477851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332701463", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 6679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6676, "last_played": 1711930983}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game in part for the exploration, combat, and zelda-like presentation, but then I realized it was 90% a factory/automation game.

The aesthetic holds up well, and the interface seems well-polished for doing the kinds of things one might want to do in a base-builder. You can tell a lot of care went into this game. Typically, the game does a great job of showing the player what's going on.\n    [*] Controls for your main character are great, and seem to work equally well on keyboard / mouse and with a controller: I was able to enjoy the game with a gamepad from my couch, and didn't ever feel like I was missing out on anything. I never felt like I was getting stuck on obstacles or that I was building myself into a corner.\n    [*] Amazingly \"chill\" vibe, subtly amazing music, and a great library of \"techy\" sounds that fit the whole theme and make the world feel like the best parts of your favorite sci-fi movie. The game is relaxing to hear as you play it. Even the \"out of air\" warning chime is kind of adorable.\n[/list]\nCons:[list]\n    [*] Gameplay is deceptively linear, especially if you're starting with a firm grounding of other games in the genre: there's about five seconds of \"decision\" at each step, which is just going into the research tree and discovering what you need to unlock the next thing, followed by several minutes of waiting for your bots to make it. Any time that the game looks like it's about to \"branch off\" into possible tasks A and B, I end up \"conveniently\" gated behind some arbitrary limit where I end up having to do everything in A-B-C order anyway, no matter what. The tech tree isn't really a \"tree\", but a very twisted tree-shaped line.\n    [*] There's no REASON to do any of the things you're doing, except for the sake of following the formula to say that you've completed it: no overarching villain, no pressure to keep going, no reason to actually spend your resources on anything. Just... Harvest A. Use A to make B. Repeat X times to unlock C in the research screen. Use C to open up a new island with resource D, and then repeat. Instead of unlocking cooler machines to automate stuff better, I end up just giving myself more work to do. After unlocking bio fuel and seeing the absolute slog it takes to get to plasteel, my soul gave up.\n    [*] Related to the above: I couldn't see any real consequences for failure. It'd be REALLY hard to lose this game in any meaningful way, and without any real challenge there isn't any sense of accomplishment for doing anything. With every obstacle I came across there wasn't ever any question of being able to complete it, but just a lot of groaning at how long it was going to take to collect that many resources.\n    [*] There aren't really any differences to all your tech levels; nothing unlocks a new gameplay mode or a new way to harvest stuff. Upgrading equipment and such makes you faster, or tougher, or better at mining, etc... in other words, it allows you to do the exact same stuff a bit faster. Nothing feels like an upgrade or progress, it's just moving from Some-Furnace to Slightly-Better-Furnace. \n    [*] Each research just gives you a new building that can process a different set of things. I then produce some other arbitrary resource in that building and wait to produce some arbitrary number of those for the tech tree, unlocking the next resource in the chain. Then I repeat the whole shebang again to harvest a new resource on another island, with the same five bots and a slightly different biome and (oh, joy!) another NPC with a slightly different list of grocery shopping I need to do for them before I can unlock the next doodad I need, which is just another building that can process the stuff you've conveniently just unlocked.\n[/list]\nMaybe there's more depth as you progress onward past the first seven islands... but I got completely burned out on the gameplay loop far before then.

Forager met Factorio'. Read the description, was confirmed and immediately wishlisted for when time would be right. I loved all games this one took inspiration from and was very happy to see old ideas well recreated and new things sprinkled in so it does absolutely not feel like a plain rip off. \nI quickly lost track of time and just enjoyed the gameplay, which feels natural and relaxing. Mostly. I like games where the devs managed to find the right balance between guiding the player too much or not at all. Nova Lands is like Factorios younger sibling. Ab bit more friendly, not as serious and unforgiving. Basically cuter, more colorful and of course way simpler to deal with in general.\nStandard early game, collecting stuff, slowly mining by hand and then start delegating most of the repetitive tasks to the bots. \nAssigning them works mostly fine, only while handling crops they mess up from time to time. I missed some way of setting priorities to prevent the bots from using up complete harvests and not filling up the extractor enough to resow the farm. It felt like this behavior gets worse, when using multiple advanced farms on one island and only one extractor.\n\nExcept from this I've had a lot of fun exploring the world, the mechanics and the unexpected surprises for the first ten or fifteen hours. After that, when the endgame comes in reach, I should have just quitted, because the next long hours have been nothing but chore. Part of this goes on me, as I tend to overthink the simplest decisions, like what island to use for what production (or only a part of it?), while having a hard time keeping the perfectionist down. But here is my complain: in true style of Factorio the endgame is mostly not exploring or managing new things, but instead repeating everything you've done so far in a bigger scale. You basically have to, or it would take forever to get the massive amounts of everything you need. \nWith completely upgraded everything the construction of the final items take around 15 minutes each. So, of course, you just build a massive machinery that makes multiples of the desired item at the same time, so you don't have to wait for 25 hours for one assembler crafting the 100 hypercomputers. That's what these games are about, right? I'd love to, but in my opinion the map is simply too small to fit as many buildings as you'd need. I planned for at least 25 assemblers for the hypercomputers, to reduce the total waiting time to around an hour. Preferably even more assemblers, but after basically filling most of the map with everything for the final chain, it took four hours of mostly waiting, until the last numbers finally ticked towards 100. I covered 3/4 of Rock Island in furnaces, but even 25 continuously smelting steel were not able to keep up with the demand. I used advanced furnaces, as the game shows the same ratios for furnace 2 and 3. If I had checked the wiki while playing I probably would have realized, that the mega furnace has the same ratio indeed, but is waaaay faster und using it would have probably solved most of my trouble.\nI'd like to suggest to increase the island sizes in general, for people who prefer to spread out a bit and not like building cramped factories. Also it would be so very handy to have the corresponding times shown together with the recipes.\n\nAnd one more thing: Please change the way the player selects buildings. This 'selection depending on the characters previous walking direction' is just so annoying, especially when navigating between multiple buildings. Please create an option for using the cursors position or at least 'select what the character is facing'. That would be awesome.\n\nEven I missed the part with the different durations and scrubbed hard against the rage quit, I enjoyed enough of my time with the game to absolutely recommend it.
