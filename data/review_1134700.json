This game has protected and promoted real money traders/bots at an alarming rate. They ban anyone who exposes it or speaks out about it. The top guilds admit it. Players outright tell you that you're too poor in real life to catch them in game. Progress is made by spending money. The developers will allow it. But do not allow you to expose it. My review was removed by Juvty's staff/mod team earlier. Now I leave you with this review. PM Me for screenshots of it all. Beginning to end. We have more than enough evidence that this game is a virtual scam. I will be banned or removed from Discord (Again). but who cares. DO NOT BUY THIS SCAM.\n\nTHIS COMPANY IS A SCAM YOU WILL NOT BE REFUNDED BY THE TIME YOU SEE THROUGH IT. The tutorial is over 2 hours for a new player.\n\nEDIT: As expected. Myself and others were banned from Discord again for exposing the actions of a certain Discord mod named \"Kirtis\". He has been known to delete player support posts inquiring about \"Global chat harassment\" and other forms of abuse in game. Resulting in deletion of posts and banning of multiple early access supporters/backers. He is an active player, profiting in game from the behaviors explained above.  I have been told he is responsible for removing all of my negative discussions as well on Steam Via Mod Wholf. So I will continue to write more and more. \n\nUntil Real Money Trading, Terrible Discord Moderation (Especially Kirtis), In game global chat harassment from players such as \"Noslive\" on NAE, and exploitative behaviors by a certain group of players are handled in game. You have absolutely ZERO reason to play this game.\n\nWe also have a screen shot of Mod Kirtis saying \"Do not forget to give me your gear when you quit\" When being confronted about his toxic behavior. Just stay away. I only play it anymore to literally warn others. I want this game to succeed. I really do. But at this point. You are helping a very scummy group of people by spending ANY money here.\n\nEither Juvtys Developers are actually scamming everyone. Or a few bad apples are ruining this community from top to bottom.\n\n\n\nEdit 2: I am now banned permanently on the Discord and Steam discussions forum by mod Kirtis. Confirming that Juvtys Staff is still trying to silence me. This review will be updated with each patch. Outlining the developers negative behavior and lack of moderation. Daily, I am still harassed in game on a very personal level. It's allowed. The developers are ensuring this by not creating a Terms of Service. Anything you want to say, no matter how hateful. They allow it. They can not ban anyone and have mentioned they are nervous to do so, out of fear for legal repercussions, as no Terms of Service exists. Therefore the game is pure anarchy.\n\nThe developers have now announced a functioning report system and bans were said to have been issued. But upon logging in. The same dudes who run the RMT market in game are all still here. No change. Still selling items only one group of players has access to via Player Auctions.. Some items are obvious and only 1-2 people on the server have them. But they are \"for sale with 20 min response time\" It would seem RMT is the way the devs want to go with this game. I'm still banned from Discord for mentioning it months ago. I have screenshots of mods admitting RMT is an issue. But mods are not devs. The devs haven't taken any long term actions against the actual characters with levels to harvest the items they sell. Basically banning alts and saying they are fixing it. Where the real offenders are playing on there main accounts all day long farming the items they sell via alts. At one point I got a gold seller named \"Art\" to even try and sell gold to a mod. So far that is the only known ban to have come out of this with any positive impact/setback to RMT. And only because a mod reported it, not a player. Any player who mentions it is banned from the Public Discord.\n\nI'm not changing my review to positive in any way until we see actual proof and progress that the developers care to stop/intervene and unban the wrongfully banned.\n\n5/7/21 - Devs have now allowed a man to openly harass me and try to sell my personal home address in game for in game gold. I took screenshots and have him admitting it in Discord to a moderator. This kid didn't get even a silence. This is apparently allowed. And instead of banning these toxic players. The potential to be swatted because someone doesn't like you is just allowed. This is malicious behavior outside the game. ALLOWED. \n\nWe have a EULA and a fake report system. The dev team is too small for them to care about literally anything. So don't come here for fun. Games dying. It's Real money traders vs like 1 guild. Abandon this game. \n\nTold yall it would end up dead because of the devs. They got your initial cash and they are dippin. What a great scam this was. Now that the player base is dead. The devs have all but abandoned the game and slowed updates. This is the same story of a cash grab remake using old code to pass as a new game. Fraud from beginning to end.\n\nWARNING TO WHALES: You can spend hundreds of dollars on cosmetic packs and in game items. That is what this game is entirely based on. \"pack sales\". I strongly advise you read the reviews and understand your money is wasted here on virtual goods with no meaning. The packs are nonsensical at inflated prices. You will get a mount or some house items for hundreds of dollars. You can spend 60$ on an entire game somewhere else. Or buy a mount here for 200+.  You will only be standing out among the 10-15 people who play daily. Just know that buying these packs is what the main focus of the game is for the devs. The updates are small/useless and few. Just know that YOU are the true victim of this game. This product is entirely based on the hopes to sucker in a few people with too much money. That is why the RMT is/was so rampant as well.

I've played MMOs since UO, EQ, WOW, Shadowbane, LoA, etc etc etc and I really wanted to love this game.  There are some very good things, but mostly poor things currently in this game.  \n\nThe Devs did a GREAT job addressing the lag issue in this game very early on.  I still \"rubber band\" from time to time, but nothing like before where the game was basically unplayable. \n\nCrafting:  The map size is too small for the massive grind you are required to play with, if you want to gather/craft at all.  What do I mean?  In UO for example, I may have been required to farm  1,000,000 ingots to gain a level.  That's a grind right?  Sure no problem.  Because in UO there are hundreds of caves in different zones, and almost \"endless\" mountains I could get ore from.  In WT2, there might be 4 iron nodes in the gorge, and if you're lucky another 5 or so in the Cave after you spend an hour clearing it.   So you spend about 1.5 hours to get at best 9-10 iron nodes.  Which then turn into a few ingots.  The problem is, when you need tens of thousands, spending a few hours for 20 ingots isn't going to work.   The crafting system is designed so each level you are required to earn more exp, 100k one level, 113k another level, etc.  (Numbers are estimates are level 48 ish skill).  That isn't the real problem, as I said the real problem is the fact that the item/thing what have you to EARN the skill is VERY LIMITED.  So when you require 113,000 exp points, but you only earn 05 exp from making one item that took you 4 hours to grind the mats to make that one item, you get the idea. \n\n*IF YOU ARE A SOLO PLAYER YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROGRESS IN CRAFTING.* (Or if you try it, it would literally take you years, yes YEARS)  Again, not because the crafting is hard, but because of the LACK of resources in the world to gather to then craft.  \n\n\nThis doesn't just apply to blacksmith work either.  It's basically the same for every crafting skill.  As a tamer you need to tame wolves, hundreds of them.  Well when the world has a total of about 35 wolves, shared between you, other tamers, people leveling weapon skill, and people farming for leather, you get the idea.  \n\nThe grind itself isn't the problem; it really comes down to the lack of available resources to even try to work the grind.  \n\nDesync - Ever press an instant cast spell and have to wait 3-5 seconds before it is applied to a target?  No? Me either until I played WT2.  I have gig fiber and run pretty smooth 40-60 MS ping.  The game is so based on a stun, that it's basically who gets stunned first? Okay then die.  There is no real way of healing, so everyone is stuck with 100 HP.  But the desync issue is, a player can be right in front of me, I press an instant cast stun, but because it takes 3-5 seconds for that stun to show up in game, the player I was attempting to stun is now 7 paces away from me.  So now you're stuck trying to press a stun 5-7 paces in FRONT of a player with your shield in hopes that that player will continue to run in the same direction to then have your stun applied.  Understand? Yeah... complete B/S.\n\nPVP- I don't care about loot dropping in PVP.  It's a PVP sandbox, people should learn that before you buy it.  BUT what I do care about in PVP is balance.  When 90% of PKers have throwing stun --- > Fire arrow --> poison arrow, and the other 10% of  PKers is Throwing Stun -- > backstab.  It gets old.   There is no balance. There is no melee-based PKer in the entire NA server.  Not without Throwing Stun.  Why?  Because there is no stun break (see above) and no gap closer (lack of WOW warrior Charge).  So if you are an axe/sword/dagger/mace user, you can be kited -- slowed and stunned, all fight until you die and there is nothing whatsoever you can do about it.  Balanced?  \nPKs aren't flagged, they don't show up RED, or anything like that.  The player's guild name don't show up above there head either until you mouse over their names, which if they are a PK by the time you do all that, you're already stunned and basically dead.  And because the zones are so small, the PK can loot your body, run 8 spaces north, south, east, or west, and be back into a PVE zone, free from risk of dropping loot.  \n\nLastly RNG:  Everything in this game is RNG.  There is no player skill, there is no difficult boss fight, there is no WOW hardmode type of thing.  There are no interrupts, effective stuns (see Desync/PVP Stun), etc.  It's purely RNG.  What do I mean?  The Cave has level 50 bosses, 3 of them.  And all you do is one person stands in front being a dodge tank, hoping the RNG is in their favor.  While at the same time the other group members stand behind and hold R-Click (attack).  That's it.  No seriously, that's it.  You might fight this boss 100 times, 30 you never get touched once, 30 you die from getting hit twice in a row, 40 you get hit, and dodge the rest.  It's 100% completely random.  There is no such thing as a \"good tank\" like in WOW for example.  Its just purely RNG.  \n\nI mean there is so much more but I'm done typing.  If you want to play, check it out, the devs are talking about good things for the summer of 21, such as an auction house, and stuff like that.  But for me, until they fix the desync issues, the pvp balance, and the pure RNG of the game, I wouldn't play this game. \n\nMaybe in the future if they address the above issues and others, maybe.

And I also had some nice time of fun, but...\n\nI have lost confidence that the devs will make it a good game, one that, as an MMORPG, is expected to offer fun for many months. You probably can still have some fun for a week or 2 though, as the early game feels very nice. Ok, some examples:\n\n- Crafting was a very nice feature in the game. Though many hours of grinding were required, it felt very nice when you finally could hit that level and upgrade your gear. Now, unless you are the top crafter across all servers, you don't get rewarded for upgrading your crafting skills, because no one will buy your low-quality gear as everyone (including you) can just buy it, with much less grinding, in the cross-server Auction House.\n\n- Fishing is notably (including by the devs) one of the worst features in the game and people have been botting a lot at that. What did the devs do? They made fishing mandatory for obtaining some of the end-game items. Quite hard to understand that decision.\n\n- Heavy armor has been much superior to light armor, specially in late-game; it is so imbalanced, most people use heavy armor all the time, even for DPS roles. What do the devs do? They make light armor even worse by virtually taking away your main protection when you are mounted: your dodge chance is now divided by 4. While for heavy armor, you don't lose quite as much protection.\n\nI am not to say they haven't made some good decisions as well, but these examples show they are not minding the consequences of their design decisions, making the overall game experience degrade over time. Sometimes it looks as though they are just throwing random stuff around.\n\nSo now they go ahead with more and more imbalanced gameplay, a faulty economy, close-to-irrelevant crafting and a 30% monthly reduction on an already small player base with the illusion that more content will make the game better. Some people think more content will be a game-changer, I don't. Maybe you'd better wait and see, but don't expect those basic problems to be corrected anytime soon, as devs seem oblivious to them, even when presented with strong evidence on some bad choices.\n\nI don't think the game is beyond salvation, as it has some really interesting premises, but I don't see it getting good anytime in the next one or two years, unless the devs start thinking hard about their decisions and their consequences.

The combat seems a bit sluggish or slow/un-responsive  though in due time i'm sure that'll will get looked into - With almost daily (every 1-2 days) patches and update and a great community on discord I'm sure this game will work towards to be something amazing.\n\nIf you're unsure then there is a Road map stating what they've planned for this game - however the price tag is a bit hefty for some especially for a game that is Early Access..\n\nOh right forgot the Big Elephant in the room - is this game pay to win? Of course it is - when you have pre support packs and current Packs which gives you an advantage over others like - faster mounts - no loot drop bag (items can't be dropped in these slots) then yes i'm sorry but that's my definition of pay to win -But that doesn't stop me from enjoying this game everything they've offered in the game to have over other players I've yet to have it bother me in any of my experience with the game...\n\nHaving said all that I would still recommend this game to those who are a fan of the old style Ultimate Online and other games a like. I will try to come back to this review at a later date in time.\n\nThank you for reading.", "timestamp_created": 1612874690, "timestamp_updated": 1614466959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 79, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824126243591308594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86543776": {"recommendationid": "86543776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000550416", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1044, "last_played": 1613036295}, "language": "english", "review": "Game was decent at first, got cucked early on because a friend and I started at the same time and since he chose lord I figured I'd choose peon and just focus on gathering... until I found out that there was absolutely no advantage to being a peon AT ALL, and I was just wasting time because re-rolling lord would have benefited us more.

When the game was released the devs introduced a first-to-achievement competition for the new servers when they released the game and sold 1-2 day early access. Most of the prizes are won before most people even get to play. That's more than a bit pay to win.\n\nEdit: Before reading this review, please keep in mind that I do want to like this game and I hope I can give it a recommendation in the future. Negative feelings about the game are mostly tied to the actions of the developers and my concerns about the direction they are taking this game in right now.\n\nWhat I like: I like that the game takes effort and cooperation, and overall is a decent game in it's genre. I also like the friendliness of a lot of the community.\n\nCaveat: Keep in mind the devs say they want a skill to take 1k hours to bring to level 60 (with max level being 80) so it's going to be slow going: there are 6 gathering skills, 6 crafting skills, 4 assistance skills, 4 'other' skills, 6 weapon type skills, and 5 defense type skills. If you don't want to put in as much time as a full time job playing a game, this game won't be for you even when the devs goal of 1k hours to level 60 is reachable.\n\nWhat I don't like: It's in alpha so some bugs are to be expected, but a lot of the updates seem poorly thought out. A fair while ago update to the taming skill increased it's difficulty and cost significantly, making leveling it to 60 take way over the dev's target of 1k hours. On top of that a new update has to the combat system been almost universally hated by the community.\n\nShould you buy it? That's up to you. I personally can't recommend it because of the dev's willingness to give people who played the game earlier an advantage while making the skill harder to level for everyone who did so after the update. I will be updating this review as the game develops. [strike]One reason to get it is that the devs do somewhat listen to feedback[/strike], but only sometimes and sometimes they just seem like they are not around. This review will be updated as I play the game more and as the devs make new changes.\n\nUpdate: They made an update to the game that reduced everyone's speed by ~20%. This was not in the patch notes and refused to answer if this was a bug or if it was intentional for over a week. This is part of a pattern of non-communication with the community.\n\nUpdate 11/10/2022: The devs had what I thought would be a great idea, introducing a first to achievement competition for the new server with prizes. Unfortunately they made most of the achievements easy to get and sold 1 to 2 day early access to the new servers. Unsurprisingly, most of the competition prizes are already won before most players even had the ability to log in. Talk about pay to win in a literal sense...\n\nUpdate 11/11/2022: [strike] The devs banned the word Dupe and Exploit from the discord to stop people from telling others about the existence of an item duplication exploit. Seems like a messed up choice, people should be able to warn others of potential server resets. [/strike] EDIT: The moderator who did this stepped down from the moderation team.\n\nUpdate 11/24/2022: The devs made a really good patch to the game. They had an issue with the release that they quickly patched, but overall it's a great storage update. I also appreciate that I don't have to click on the well hundreds of times anymore!\n\nUpdate 2/4/2023: I found out that horses (The only not-paied 100% speed mount) could randomly get a penalty of summoning speed as a level up perk at level 40. That's just objectively stupid.\n\nUpdate 2/9/2023: The devs decided to make it harder to level some skills for newer players joining now, made a previously one handed weapon two handed completely obseleting it's use cases outside of PvP and making it impossible to switch between it and one handed weapons, and just generally made a lot of changes the community is not happy about.

I knew it was PVP but after reading a comment saying the community on EU2 was pretty nice I thought I'll give it a try.\n\nAnd I had a blast playing on the starting island, enjoying the oldschool feel with a lot of QoL features, building my small camp, doing quests, hunting, taming, fishing, crafting gear, food and finally my very own ship to leave for the main land. \n\nBut this is where the fun stopped.\n\nThe mainland is small. Very small. I would guess around five minutes to run from one side to the other. And a big chunk of this land are full PVP areas with mobs. So you probably don't want to build your new home in the hostile areas. And if you are like me you don't want to just build it in the middle of a grassland either or right next to the main city, but somewhere near or in a forerst, a little bit secluded, maybe a fishing spot close by. Yeah, those spots were all taken.\n\nOf course you could just settle close or next to another player. But first of all you never know how they will react to that - this still is a PVP game. And second: the building system makes you put down a stonemark as center of your land and you can build in a  square around that. Most players kinda obviously opt for putting walls around their dominion. So what you get all around the map are equally big wallsquares with buildings inside. And if you put a few of those next to each other it looks like a darn prison complex.\n\nSo to make sure there is enough space to build the devs went for a decay option: if you aren't online for some time, your dominion will be packed up and sent to your inventory. You don't loose anything, except your building spot. The time you got? Five days. Can only play once a week? Too bad. Vacation planned? Family emergency? Business trip? Too bad. It's your fault you have a life afterall.\n\nAnd all that said - considering every player should have his own dominion - the server was empty. Of course I didn't check the whole map, but I saw maybe ten or twenty dwellings. Yes, you can make characters that can't own land, and maybe that's how guilds work, no idea about that, but at that scale it more seemed like one guild playing on a server together and not an mmo.\n\nSo for me, my very joyfull journey ended there.\n\nThe game needs a LOT bigger maps to explore, gather, hunt and build. And more players.\nPVE servers would help with that, so all the peaceful crafting folk can gather, as the forum shows.\nDedicated or private servers won't help the public servers, but might get some sales in for guilds or groups of friends who actually just want to settle together and do expeditions, or RPG project servers. Especially if you can turn off the decay.\n\nBut the devs are obviously more concerned about creating item packs to sell; right now Halloween, five cosmetic items for 20 \u20ac. Or the item packages on their homepage for up to 250 \u20ac - which all have the disclaimer \"Most of the rewards are still in development.

It is now Monday, as of this review.  The game is unplayable by any normal measurable standards.  The lag is atrocious and seemingly spread across all servers.  This is an impressive feat considering that the total population of the game at peak hours on a Sunday evening was around 1,500 - spread across several different servers.  This is billed on the store page as an MMORPG.  What kind of MMO cannot handle 1,500 people?  I'll tell you.  The same one that cannot handle less than half of that at 3am on a Friday morning.  The developers have released several patches since Thursday and they have made almost zero (and I'm being generous here) effect on the insufferable rubberbanding and general high latency that for moments at a time is tolerable but never goes away.\n\nAt one point I was willing to give the developers the benefit of the doubt that they would fix this.  Now I am dubious they have any clue how to make an online game.  Given time, they will - probably - fix the lag issue, but the game has other issues as well that should make it a pass for most sane people.  Briefly, the chief negatives for me beyond the obvious are the fact that the game is - intensely - grindy for no real overall purpose beyond padding playtime, the mainland is very small and has little to actually do beyond grind, the potential for griefing its population away with Alpha guilds is already beginning to manifest, and in general the game is not pleasant to look at graphically or artistically.\n\nLastly, I'd like to mention that while I have nearly 14 hours played in this game, at least 3-4 hours of that were spent in the tutorial.  The tutorial itself is a long grind to get off a small island overpopulated with other newbies to get to a slightly bigger island populated by no-lifer Chads and their victims.  If you were to try this game with the intention of getting a refund if it was not your cup of tea, it is extremely unlikely that you would get to the \"main game\" before the two hour refund limit.  I'll give the developers the benefit of the doubt that they did not do this by design, but nevertheless, I would advise anyone from buying this game at least until they \"fix\" the lag issue.

Show me how to craft, manage my dominion, attack, catch things, all of the basics as quickly as possible and once ive been shown a system, dont make me use it again. its a tutorial. I dont need to be shown how to tan small AND medium hides, craft multiple different levels of gear, fish multiple different fish (ill come back to this one...). Show me the systems and get me out as quickly as you possibly can.\n\nFishing.... jfc the fishing. It is, without a doubt, the WORST implementation of a fishing system ive ever seen in a videogame. The game gives you 3 buttons, drag out, yank and pull. Gives you ZERO explanation of what each of those does, or when to use them, and forces you to just \"figure it out\" and by figure it out what i really mean is go to discord and ask questions and get pointed to a visual guide on how the hell you catch a certain type of fish required by the tutorial. (for those wondering, you catch a roach by waiting for 2 bite messages, hoping the 3rd message says \"tension loosens\" (if it doesnt, try again), then you get a third bite, and then you press R and then you press E. If youre reading that thinking \"what the fuck\" yeah, me too dude. It also takes like 20-30s per fish.

Only if there are no new major updates in the game, such as new group dungeons or new islands, all the small updates are of no use. They don't advance the game.

This is a SLOW game.  This is a GRIND to level skills.  You will be happy that you build something because you earned it.  When i get ready to make a new recipe it's because i grinded, not only for the cooking experience but also the agriculture to support making it.   Yes, there's PvE combat and the potential for PvP (i think the server is a little young for a lot of PvP yet).  And it's worth leveling your combat skills to get some resources, but i've noticed these really push you towards grouping up for the highest difficulty, which is great.  It makes you work with your guild mates.  I have 150 hours since launch, and i didn't play the betas, and i love it.  \n\nPros:\nSlow grind that certain types of players will love.  Skills take a long time to level.  Crops/animals take a long time to grow.  Leather a long time to produce.  Etc.\nRuns well\nOwning land and building in a way where each plot of land can be unique.  \nOn the flip side, if players go inactive, their town and all items/buildings are picked up for someone else to build on after 3-9 days of inactivity based on the size of the property.  This ensures lands being open for new players while not harming old ones.\nFeeling like you earned what you have\nWhile there are \"packs\" you can buy, they're not pay-to-win and no where near required.  No microtransactions.\nInspiration system - You can store up to 50k xp worth of 'inspiration' which is gathered by being offline.  So if you can't log on and do alot for a couple days it's ok.  You get triple XP when it's turned on until it depletes and fills up over 3 days.  \n\nCons:\nGraphics are effective, but simple for today's games\nLow population according to steam charts (I'm on NA East and we have a good population, i can't speak for other servers)\nLimited Gameplay (what's there takes a long time for newer players like myself to get through, and i'm not through even a quarter of it 150 hours in, but i could see how experienced beta players could consider it a limited amount of content).  \n\nThe game has a lot of potential and room to grow.  I just hope the development team can push out content quickly enough to keep people interested.  Even if content does turn out to be low, and i eventually get bored, i'll probably still log on and do my crops and animal stuff in preparation for future content.

Where's the profit going to be in dungeons with a bow any more? I guess we use bow for survivability so we can dig a hole in our coin purse. Coming from a new player where the struggle was already real to begin with, I don't see it getting any easier if we want to continue with light armor/bow. I even swap to light/sword/shied but even that hasn't been unsoiled (shield strike nerf). Food too? Wrecking every new adventurer's experience from the start to the end lol.

doing no damage for multiply swings in a row..if i could swap back to my mace and shield id win the fight and not die..sometimes if your lucky you will win with almost no health..then have to wait 5 mins to resummon your pet..so im forced into using a mace and shield..over trying to be a healer/tamer..id be fine with this if i could swap the weapons out in combat..i have to lvl up gathering masonry blacksmithing to make a pottery wheel then have to level pottery to then start making healing items that lvl up my healing better. then ill have to level up healing far to get expensive healing oniments because i have no way to heal except to get out of combat regen stam then wait for 1hp/s health regen to kick in..can get 2hp standing next to camp fire, but you cant use them in dungeons. this can take 10secs to 5mins of sitting there if your pets on cooldown.. say you get into a fight the guy gets you to 80/100 hp you now have to regen stam and then health..waiting 20+secs to move onto the next enemy...making the game slow fight one enemy at a time, not healing it like i want because itll die instantly when i pull out the staff since i miss and do less damage then the pet the enemey will just hit the pet and ignore you..i had to be a melee/range class and only use the healing staff after combat to speed up the wait time..but you pull out that staff on accident in combat say good bye to your pet and maybe even you..spent my first 1g on a better pet that had more health and damage and the dung still felt the same.. one enemy at a time with the pet dying if you dont pull aggro first..then you got someone with 100's of real money buying a pack getting a knight and his knight can tank a bear that i couldnt. i i spent 60hours getting 1 gold to buy a bear that is just ok, since the one i wanted was 6gold..i only made it this far because some people helped me advance quick and hooked me up with gear..other wise i would have had to spend that money on gear first and wouldnt have had as good as stuff..since it would take me even more time to get to a point where i could craft a master craft item getting the better stats. had fun and didnt mind the grind..but the healer staff and ability is garbage not a play style you can really use untill you have leveled a bunch. im no where near this point and see having to play for 100's more hours to maybe be ok. your time will take longer since i had rings and necklaces that increased heal xp gain..which i couldnt afford even with my 1 g i made. maybe but then if your not lucky and didnt get the jewlery and gear from people your doubling your time to get to my point. somestuff after certain levels will no longer give xp when crafting or 1 or 2 xp out of thousand needed to level next. taking more xp with each level..will play again if they let me  switch weapons from staff in combat, and the first heal skill on the pet can actually be cast every few secs as long as you have the stam to cast..and i want to not miss 4 hits in a row with a staff then only hit for 6 when a mace can hit for 40. but if you nerf mace and change ill not play either no nerfs just buff the healer.",

The chapel I was just able to do with wide bandages that take hours of grinding to find.  That's 200 hours to literally be able to do the first dungeon.  This games experience levelling is purposely ridiculous as if it's a joke on you.  Here's an example.  I have mostly only been able to just mine and harvest because the monsters were too difficult to do without quality bronze, or green level bone armor.  I really only did that for 160 hours, so 160 hours of just trying to level gear, only to find that the next level, iron, will take an even greater time.  I'm an efficiency player, with 5000 hours in ARMA3, 3000 in Conan Exiles, and so on.  I'm used to rolling multiple characters, and long XP grinds.  This game not only has a XP system that will require at least 2 years of grind to do the end game, but fails you 1 out of 4 times with an 87% success rate in whichever skill you are attempting.  That means the Dev is purposely being a d bag, because that math doesn't add up.  The designer is purposely trying to make this game \"hard,\" while basically turning almost everyone in the world off to this game unless your autistic and have to drive on because of your brain damage.  I really tried to get into this game.  I spent a whole month just picking things up off the ground, not being able to do the content even if I wanted to.  Beyond that, the clans camp newbie areas where the Dev made it PVP, so you lose all your gear, controlling the market so that you have to buy from them to move on since they were here since day one.  All in all, DO NOT BUT THIS GAME.  The designer is purposely making this take years to complete even if you put 10 hours a day into the game, and the map is so small you can cross it in 2 minutes literally.  That means you'll spend 1000's of hours in the same areas in a never ending failure struggle to even be able to do any of the dungeons.  Even with 200 hours, working together with 2 other people who were focusing different skills so we could cut down on time needed, we could only do Chapel, and the \"new,\" hideouts on easy.  You will not like this game, I know you think you will, but it is deceiving because the algorithms they use for skill are purposely wrong, keeping you in a never ending crafting cycle.

I love the crafting system. The way it works is just amazing, and there are things that I discovered myself or found out on discord about crafting that had me shaking my head in disbelief of why I didn't think that's how it works or how it just made my crafting a lot better and faster. I'm not going to spoil it, but crafting is great. Yes, it takes a lot of time, but this is an MMO, and things are grindy in MMOs, or otherwise, you have them beat in just a few hours.\n\n90% of the negative reviews are about the server lag we had in the first couple of days; those issues have been fixed, and the devs are always improving the performance. I got to warn you that if you play in a high refresh rate monitor, you are better off capping at 60hz and turning on vsync, or otherwise it will use too many resources on your graphics card for nothing, the visuals are OK, but it's not something to write home about. \n\nThe whole world is Open PVP, but only specific zones are areas where you lose your inventory if you die, players can technically attack you anywhere, but they usually leave you alone in non-loot zones.\n\nFor us, PVE folks, it's harder because lots of higher-end resources can only be found in full loot zones and higher tier mobs or bosses are in full loot zones. I had the experience of being killed in a looting zone when I was trying to train my gear, just because some high geared person was guarding a boss.\n\nThere are no actual combat levels in the game; you train whatever you want to use. There is currently light armor and heavy armor, and you need to level each separately, with each set having its unique feel and boosts. The same goes for weapons, and you have to train the type of weapon you want to use like Bows, Spears, Swords, etc...\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game; try it and don't let the tutorial island drive you away; some people actually wished they had stayed longer there, all the progress in the tutorial island carries over because you will end up packing your base and take it with you to the main world. Oh yes, you can have your own piece of land, there are 3 different sizes you can have, and whenever you feel like you want to move to another spot, you can just hit move out.

Ive been playing for about a month in the late beta.  I was attracted to this game because people were saying they were getting Ultima vibes from it.  It is a persistent state world, with player and guild housing, including permissions, has PvP, and has broad and deep crafting.  The core of the dev group are UO fans and worked on EQ2, Asherons Call and STO I think it was.  The game definitely has that feel and even the interface is a clear nod to UO and other elements of the aforementioned games are present, although its been a LONG time since I played Asheron's Call.  And I don't think I played the Star Wars game that these devs worked on.\n\nThere are safe zones where if you die, you dont lose anything.  In other areas, your corpse can be looted.  PvP can take place anywhere, in 'safe zones' and in 'pvp zones'.  But, if you're attacked in a safe zone, youll faint, wake up in a few seconds at half health and nothing dropped.  So, there's no incentive for people to do that  unless you run or but even if you're kill.  You can build walls around your plot.  But, no part of your plot can be attacked or damaged.\n\nIm a crafting type and I liked the fact that theres no skill cap and that my avatar can take on all skills.  Also, its a skill-based system.  Use the skill, gain xp in the skill.  Theres good agriculture, seeds, fertilizer and the chance to 'upgrade' a seed to a different fruit or vegetable.  Also, many meals to be cooked.  Of course, smithing, carpentry, masonry, jewelcrafting, pottery, item ID, animal taming (not very detailed [yet?]), fishing (challenging.  Like a mini-game.   Takes some experimentation and practice (or just read XanXia's Fishing Guide), Jrewelcrafting, Healing, Cartography (not implemented yet?),.  Leatherworking is interesting.  There are 5+ stages.  solutions to be made and soaked in vats.  Alchemy is there also, I havent done much with it because i joined the beta kinda late.  I also like that i can make and repair my own tools and machines.  Theres another category called Exotics that I have not delved into vey far.  Late game craftable exotic gear and weaps. \n\nThe guild system works well.  We got a guild up and running and partying is easy and effective showing tags along the edge of the screen to where your party members are.  Stability has been good overall and the last update that went in about 45 minutes before the Steam launch improved all of our pings.\nThe plot management is epic.  You start with a small empty plot. collect resources, and start practicing easy items to raise skill.  Then, easy to lay down and move machines or boxes.  You can even pickup your *entire plot* (taking up 1 slot in your pack), and move it someplace else.  You can upgrade right in place (as long as theres space. yes, this creates issues). \n There a simple set of necessary components to build a house, or shed, front porch, living area, etc.  I built up to a 4th floor on the test server in beta (vids on YT).  But the 4th story isnt buildable.  its only like 3.5 stories.  minor bug with stairs. but easy to work around by re-logging.\n\nAfter people started joining en masse, there were some minor issues with spawn rates.  not enough mobs for everyone.  the devs  adjusted spawn rates and made several updates over the 48 hours prior to Steam launch.  Most updates only lasting maybe 5-10 minutes and most people did not lose any time.  On one occasion today, about 12 hours before launch, the server came down and we got a  message in Discord that there was a database problem and the servers could be down a while.   but, it was back up in about 30 minutes with minimal, if any rollback time.  In some cases, *some* people experienced lost time (or a 'rollback') while others didnt.  This was just before the database error.  But we didnt hear of much talk after it came back up.  So, as with any MMORPG launch, issues are to be expected.  But, so far, and now even that Steam players are logging in, things are still smooth.  Im enjoying it and considering getting a second account for gathering.\nOh, i forgot, all the bling, tricked out plot buildings, clothing and mounts are very popular.

With its blend of survival mechanics and medieval gameplay, the game presents an average adventure that leaves players with a sense of mediocrity rather than exhilaration.\n\nA World of Potential, Held Back: 2.5/5\n\nWild Terra 2 introduces players to a vast open world ripe for exploration and adventure. The potential for engaging quests, resource gathering, and crafting systems is evident, yet it fails to reach the heights it aspires to. While the idea of building, fortifying, and surviving in a medieval landscape is intriguing, the execution falls short of fully realizing the game's grand ambitions.\n\nUnpolished Gameplay Mechanics: 2.3/5\n\nThe core gameplay mechanics in Wild Terra 2 feel unpolished and lack the depth needed to keep players engaged for extended periods. The survival elements, while present, fail to create a truly immersive experience. The combat system lacks the finesse and excitement of more refined MMORPGs, leaving battles feeling lackluster and repetitive.\n\nUninspired Progression and Exploration:\n\nThe progression and exploration aspects of the game fail to evoke a sense of wonder or accomplishment. While the prospect of discovering new lands and resources is enticing, the execution lacks the excitement and rewards that motivate players to venture further.\n\nLackluster Community Interaction: 2.4/5\n\nWild Terra 2's community interaction is hindered by the game's lukewarm gameplay mechanics. The lack of depth in activities and interactions creates a barrier to forming meaningful connections with other players. The sense of camaraderie and collaboration that often defines MMORPGs is sadly lacking, making the online experience feel isolating.\n\nTechnical Hurdles and Performance: 2.2/5\n\nThe game's technical performance leaves much to be desired. Frequent glitches, bugs, and server issues detract from the overall experience, causing frustration and hindering players' ability to fully immerse themselves in the world. These technical hurdles dampen the potential enjoyment and contribute to a sense of disappointment.\n\nConclusion: 2.3/5\n\nWild Terra 2: New Lands presents a world of potential that's sadly held back by unpolished gameplay mechanics, uninspired progression, and technical challenges. While the concept of a medieval sandbox MMORPG is intriguing, the execution falls short of delivering a truly captivating experience. If you're seeking an adventure that immerses you in a dynamic world of survival and exploration, Wild Terra 2 might offer some fleeting moments of enjoyment, but it ultimately fails to rise above the realm of mediocrity.", "timestamp_created": 1692148763, "timestamp_updated": 1692148763, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557434380054473877", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85636772": {"recommendationid": "85636772", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969394000", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 19740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1588, "last_played": 1616434811}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game so far.

So to sum up; If you like grindy games that are difficult with a heavy emphasis on PvP then you'll love this game, but if you don't like the grind or the pvp, or the lack of any sort of story line then I don't think this game is for you at this time", "timestamp_created": 1613256060, "timestamp_updated": 1613256060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555438518524169922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85773057": {"recommendationid": "85773057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204254552", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2318, "last_played": 1612724522}, "language": "english", "review": "Wait.\n\nBut Follow.\n\nThey have NAILED the Crafting system in this game.

I'm extremely interested in where this game goes once people have the best gear and can start PvPing regularly.\n\nMy only problems with the game are the RNG and the lag. There's a chance that the nodes you gather can just break, due to pure luck. Crafting an item? Hope it doesn't break or you have to go and farm again. I really hope this feature is removed entirely, or changed to a skill-based system. Failing due to luck is extremely irritating.\nThe lag is self-explanatory. I can only assume the devs didn't expect so many people to be playing. Rubberbanding is a common issue, and the animals in the game are very glitchy.\n\nOverall, 6/10.
