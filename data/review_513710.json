Scum drew me away from the Dayz universe with its straightforward crafting and base-building elements. I loved the simplicity and ease of looting various boxes, containers, puppets, and other players I encountered. The freedom to explore buildings and bunkers at my own pace was truly enjoyable. Over the past two years, I even went on to rent my own server, hosting up to 60 players.\n\nRegrettably, the recent direction the developers have taken is bewildering. They introduced a convoluted cooking system and implemented an exhaustion mechanic that immobilizes you, forcing you to recuperate in bed. Crafting anything without gloves now results in numerous hand lacerations. They removed valuable content and replaced it with undesirable features. Server performance has declined, causing lag and rubber banding even with just one person present, worsened in full servers. Zombie spawns are erratic, with the new horde system leading to zombies appearing right in front of you or dropping from the sky. Clearing out a town or bunker becomes a futile effort as they respawn within ten minutes. The hordes are a formidable challenge, making the game unbearable for even seasoned players, let alone newcomers.\n\nRegarding bunkers, instead of addressing lag and server stability, access has been restricted to mitigate stress on the servers. The last time the game felt enjoyable and stable was probably before they removed the old vehicles and introduced the new ones. I'm skeptical about the game improving; it seems to be heading towards increased confusion and bugs with each addition rather than addressing existing server issues. I didn't write this out of hatred for the game; it's actually my favorite, but it's currently in a dire state, and I don't foresee any improvement.", "timestamp_created": 1707186062, "timestamp_updated": 1707186062, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 112, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875255882740020752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1707238733, "developer_response": "Hello hxcwhiteford!

I spend 2-3 weeks a year at the Croatian coast on holidays and this game enables me to extend my holidays even if i am not there. Terrific!\r\n\r\nWhat has sadly always taken away from the game was the poor quality management of the developers and the server performances:\r\nWhile patches were coming out constantly in 2022 they seem to have become much less frequent nowadays. The developers always focused on introducing new stuff first which in itself would not be bad, but  even the stuff they newly introduced hardly ever worked out of the box while at the same time breaking older stuff on top of that and not addressing or resolving long-standing issues. Hey it's early access! - oh how i've become to love that argument... after six years of early access. This is a question of development strategy and method and not a thing of early access per se. My best example to show a different and successful strategy would be Valheim: Their topmost priority has always been to get everything they have stable and only then introduce new things that have been tested on public test versions prior to patching them in. On top of that they let you host your own dedicated servers and give you the option to run the servers and the clients on older stable versions.\r\nNow the server problem: Since I have been playing this game it has always struggled with server performance which is especially bad when in PVP but also problematic when in PVE. To this day servers seem to have to be restarted constantly (every 2 to 4 hours usually) as a \"feature\" to improve lags (!?) and server admins introduced a ton of restrictions on build elements or numbers of vehicles allowed on their servers per squad or player to combat poor server performance.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the reason I posted this review:\r\nIn a stroke of ingenuity the developers seem to have come up with a solution for one of the major reasons servers struggled with performance: A rework of the puppet/zombie system. Puppets and other forms of NPCs have been one of the main reasons why the game needed to communicate so much data to its players since dialling down on the amount of puppets on a server always significantly improved performance.\r\nBack in 2022 the developers showed how to improve server performance from their end: They completely removed all the birds in the game never to be seen again. They were cute and I miss them... But their vanishing was not gamebreaking.\r\nNow obviously they could not do this same move for the puppets or the rest of the animals so they came up with \"improvements\": A new much more exciting way to hunt animals: Follow clues to find them and only spawn them in after you followed those clues to the end. I have stumbled upon 2 or 3 animals which must have been spawned in by a bug or maybe someone had hunted them and not killed them before. But the world is dead in this respect, there are no more animals you can stumble upon while roaming the map.\r\nA severe loss but still not completely gamebreaking.\r\n\r\nBut their greatest improvement is the new horde and dynamic spawn system. This ultimately completely kills the immersion in the game and breaks survival specific gameplay in every direction.\r\nUp to the introduction to this incredible feature you could spot and snipe puppets from afar, or decide to evade them or even sneak in and kill them stealthily and they would be scattered around the whole map, especially around points of interest (makes sense...)\r\nNow you have a completely puppet free map UNTIL you get to a POI, then they start spawning in right next to you. Mostly aggroing immediately, calling in more puppets while at it. Sniper rifles have become useless for killing puppets. Even if your teammate's presence spawns them in, you can only watch him combat invisible enemies if you are more than probably 30-50 meters away. Using handguns or rifles is often the only way to survive these sudden spawns while the shooting triggers even more to spawn in around you. And if you are in PVP you might as well invite other players in chat with your exact location to come kill you. Your only hope is that they have the same problem with puppets too...\r\nThis system is so absolutely broken. And I cannot think of any improvement to this system that could make it playable again. And the \"coolest\" thing: I don't really feel server performance has improved by much. More than 50 players and this game still rubber-bands, puppets and players are \"teleporting\" - stuff that has been the case before this system was introduced.\r\n\r\nThe developers do not seem to address this blunder when all they had to do was throw this system out again and start thinking of other ways to improve server performances. Even if server performance problems were completely solved now I would still absolutely prefer to have the old system back and simply play on a lower populated server to counter it. This spawn system completely kills the immersion and gameplay of this potentially awesome game that Scum was.\r\nPuppets have to be visible if they are in line of sight, just like a player. They have to be finite for a time so you can clear an area. Anything else is completely unrealistic in a game that puts so much emphasis on realism.\r\n \r\nWhich is why I cannot recommend this game to any new player or anyone who is thinking about jumping back in after a longer hiatus like I did. Wait until they patch this out of the game - Otherwise I predict this game will fail just a few paces from the finish line...\r\nSo sad - But one can still hope", "timestamp_created": 1713242227, "timestamp_updated": 1713242227, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647846341133117676", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1713251205, "developer_response": "Hi SGT-Sasquatch!

Everything else is heavily lacking in thought, balancing, and content...and probably always will be. The horde mode is terrible, it makes using a gun (even silenced) a never end loop of zombie spawning even if you kill them all. The building mechanic has a LOT of flaws that make it awful and useless, people literally build in prefab buildings on the map because it's a better experience all around. For example, you can not build a wall on an upper floor without having a support or wall under it on EVERY floor and you can't build more then 2 floors out without needing another support. Also, did you build a wall i nthe wrong spot? Tough luck, break it and you risk losing half your building even if it has support elsewhere. It seems no one on the dev team has any experience with construction or consulted one because it is bad. You will be stuck with a 4x4 box in most cases unless you hate yourself. The hunting mechanic is tedious and a waste of time, its terrible allaround. Fishing is overly difficult unless you cheese it and there is no drag mechanic or fish tiring mechanic, which is why it is overly difficult. It's impossible to reel in a fish without using the cheese method. Some content isn't worth doing other then just to experience it once or twice, like raiding abandoned bunkers or fighting mechs. The cost/risk vs reward isn't balanced at all and probably never will be. And while we are on the topic of balance, the game still has a LOT of balancing issues when it comes to skills/stats and food/water consumption on top of some of it not making any realistic sense at all like crafting and building not helping with strength, constitution, or dexterity when it uses stamina. It just levels engineering and that is all. Plus the fact your intelligence is locked in and permanently goes down if you suicide is a real wtf were they thinking moment. I guess humans forgot how to learn in this universe. And the BIGGEST downside for me is that you can not run your own personal dedicated server. The devs make every excuse in the book for why they did this, but none of them hold any water. The biggest one is always \"to keep people from developing online cheats\" and pat themselves on the back because no one has made a health hack yet. What does that matter when you get 1 shot to the head from 1500m away by someone using an ESP aimbot combo? A quick google search pulls up plenty of free and paid multiplayer enabled cheats that work and are undetected because EAC is garbage. Either fix it or let us avoid it without having to shell out more money for some crappy company to host one for us. This is purely a cash grab move.\n\nTLDR; This is just a 3D version of Project Zomboid but with a worse implementation and no dedicated server support. Playing with friends on a private server can be fun, but it is also frustrating a lot of the time, plus you have to pay for a server since you cant locally host a dedicated one for free...anything else isn't worth the time.\n\nEDIT: For Dev Response\n\nYou can say you will fix everything in the world all you want, but the fact of the matter is that literally every aspect of this game has issues that make it a very unpleasant experience. I actually cut out 90% of my review because It was just complaining the whole time and I felt bad for anyone who might read it. I get that the game is in Early Access and still being flushed out, and if this was on a 0.2 patch or something I would have some faith in those words. But it isn't, it's 0.95, and if the backwards progress of previous patches are anything to go by I am not gonna hold my breath lol. You can't build garage doors or hangar doors on a foundation? Makes sense, not. No form of supporting upper floors that doesn't put a huge pillar in the way everywhere? Makes sense. A M249 suppressor gets completely annihilated from firing 1 mag? Makes sense. You get hit by a puppet and it stops your current action? Makes sense. I for one would stop pulling out my gun or sword if my life depended on it. Don't get me wrong, I like the game, but some things are in the game to literally piss the players off and I just can't for the life of me recommend it to anyone with design choices like that when they aren't even realistic design choices. Which brings me into why I can't, and wont recommend this game. The micromanagement of the dev team telling players how they can and can not play the game is what really puts me off. Even if this game gets flushed out properly, I still won't recommend it because a game by a dev team that refuses to implement basic options to let players play how they want will be a terrible experience for the vast majority of players. Disabling Mr. Brenner for example. Being told flat out \"No, not gonna ever happen.\" because the dev team thinks they know better is messed up and any dev team like that I can not support. They may have an image in mind for how the game should be, but their are ZERO reasons to not allow these customization options if players want them, aside from arrogance or some twisted desire to annoy the players. An unkillable boss is fun, for about 10 minutes. Then players will find a way to cheese it because it is annoying, and that will get patched, then they find another method, and it gets patched, over and over again until it becomes a horrible experience and probably turns abandoned bunkers into unplayable content.

As for the vehicles, their removal was not intended and on purpose, but was necessary as they did not function properly once modular vehicles were introduced. We are working to add these vehicles to the game again. It is taking a bit more time than we, as well as our fans, would want, but were slowly getting there. The Brenner is simply a design choice. We wanted to create a sense of dread and fear as players are braving the depths of the abandoned bunkers.

So for starters I don't play on official and thankfully not after all the reviews I've seen about hackers on them. What I'm about to talk about is the game itself and some pretty wack \"features\" that actually boggle the mind. 1. The hitboxes. I like to brawl and melee the puppets personally the problem is that when you do some hits land sure. Others though will seemingly pass right through them without them registering at all and then because it doesn't register before you even bring your hand back from your swing they've already hit you. Like am I fighting Danny phantom here? Are you secretly obito activating your mangekyou sharingan so that my hits phase through you? And sometimes even if the hit does register they are completely unphased by it and again counter attack you before you can do anything about it. Like I'm sorry if I hit you full force with a frickin baseball bat or katana and you are so completely unphased like I just limpwrist hit you with a feather duster and you hit me back before my swing animation was complete that's an issue. It doesn't happen all the time but it happens enough. Speaking of hitting you know what's wild? Shooting a armored puppet in the face below his helmet with a armour piercing 45cal and it doesn't die until 2 or 3 shots in. Devs....armour piercing...defeats armour...typically armour piercing rifle and pistol cartridges are usually built around a penetrator of hardened steel, tungsten, or tungsten carbide, and such cartridges are often called 'hard-core bullets'. Rifle armour-piercing ammunition generally carries its hardened penetrator within a copper or cupronickel jacket, similar to the jacket which would surround lead in a conventional projectile. Upon impact on a hard target, the copper case is destroyed, but the penetrator continues its motion and penetrates the target. Armour-piercing ammunition for pistols has also been developed and uses a design similar to the rifle ammunition. So knowing this if I were to shoot someone with a round  like this at point blank would it take multiple rounds to drop them? Especially when I'm shooting them actually in the face and NOT their helmet? Probably not...but what's even more comical is the fact that their armor makes them somehow take ap rounds but YOUR armor can't even protect you from their BARE HANDS which is an absolute joke. I have the full tactical vest that says SWAT on it which is even more hilarious if I was a police captain ordering vests from a manufacturer for my officers that I expect to stop BULLETS to save my officers lives in a firefight and those vests can't even stop HUMAN HANDS from mauling them to death I would be suing that manufacturer into the ground. Literally armored as much as I can be in this game and thanks to the spawn and horde mechanic which I see others have addressed in reviews I end up with multiple bleed injuries. So tell me what's the point of even wearing armor then? Why even have it in the game when it can't even stop hands? Even regualr cloths like for example gloves im wearing gloves that have 100% durability a puppet hits my hand the gloves lose 4 so now theyre at 96% and somehow i have an injury on my hand? Go to a military surplus store or heck even menards buy a decent pair of gloves put them on and tell your buddy to hit your gloved hand if he even slightly damages those gloves AND causes your hand to bleed then he must be dr strange using magic which defies human understanding. Next is the lockpicking....oh boy. This...This is so obnoxiously absurd. Look I get that you guys wanted to make lockpicking difficult for pvp reasons but seriously the iron, silver and gold locks have almost seemingly no difference in their difficulty I've had plenty of times where the lock was completely horizontal and my pick still broke. Which btw I speak with experience on this I used to have locks that I'd pick as a hobby just to learn...lemme tell you Metal doesn't just snap like a wooden toothpick in a couple seconds. Nobody who has ever picked a lock is using that much force to snap metal. It actually makes me wonder if i crafted lockpicks out of qtips and scotch tape. Also why is lockpicking timed exactly who exactly is timing you the puppets? Now from a logical standpoint if you have time to pick a lock irl in the first place chances are there's no rush to do so. If you were in a life or death situation and you for whatever reason needed to pick a lock within 4 seconds (iron lock time) you might as well close your eyes and die because it ain't happening that fast. It wouldn't be so bad if on every attempt the \"sweetspot\" didn't change. With a typical lock it usually has 3 to 5 or 6 pins you use a rake or in this case a lockpick that you physically push up the pins and once it's up using a torque wrench in your other hand apply enough torque to keep the pin up in place so you can use the rake to go to the next pin. The pins DONT magically change position every single time you try to pick that lock they're in the same place every single time. So between the laffytaffy lockpicks, the timer that's there because apparently someone is timing you and the pins constantly changing positions like some type of amorphous blob creature you've made lockpicking in this game so stupidly difficult that even with advanced thievery it makes no difference. And I don't wanna hear no oh ya know there's so many players cracking gold locks first try every time yea no b.s not without scripts or some specialized equipment by the time you even get close to the sweetspot the lockpick is broke and the pins change or your 4 or less seconds are up its more about luck then skill. Like you know it's bad....when just to go to a regular bunker to get tears you gotta bring an entire hiking bag with 10 40 use screwdrivers in a vertical row all the way down (which are incredibly difficult to find better to play unofficial and have them added to the trader) with 4 bundles of 10 lockpicks in each row totaling 400 screwdriver uses and 400 lockpicks and only successfully cracking an iron lock 12 times....abandoned bunkers we have to bring 2 of those bags for the gold locks in the armory. Here's a suggestion somewhere in the coding for the locks put something like \"if lock is on a player item\" ie car or structure keep the difficulty the same for pvp reasons but if the lock registers that it's not on a player structure maybe nerf it a bit so that players don't need hundreds of lockpicks to open it a few times because there's no reason an iron lock on a box in a bunker should be just about as difficult and infuriating to open as a gold lock on someone's base or maybe make it so player locks keep the same difficulty and mechanics but nonplayer locks have a different mechanic where instead of moving the lockpick around a half circle it shows the pins that you gotta push up to open something like that. I won't talk about the hordes or spawns as enough ppl already have but I will say that their door opening mechanic is pretty wack. In an abandoned bunker you know the place where you need to turn on the power to open doors but the puppets can knock like the police and open them without power why can't we punch open doors if that's the case? The cooking is pretty wack too tell me why I make some I make some pasta that has 60g+ of protein but when I log out and come back in it suddenly has 16g of protein even tho no durability on it has been lost. It's like the very act of me logging off means the protein in my pasta found its chance to leave and took it.  The vitamins idk if you guys take vitamins but uhhh they certainly don't last for 2 seconds inside your gut before doing nothing more for you. So from fighting to clothing to looting to spawns to consumables these need to be fixed before I would recommend this.

Even with the beginner help turned on I was Googling and looking to YouTube and the Steam Community for help on what to do from the very beginning. That being said, I still find myself drawn to playing it, but in an almost masochistic way. I've only tried Single Player mode so far and, as a gamer who loves (and still plays) RUST and Stranded Deep, this feels very rough. It has a bit of a PUBG feel to it. After 4 hours of solo game play, I was finally able to craft a bow and kill some puppets, but struggled for almost an hour of real world time trying to craft and light a fire pit and cook chicken on it. It was almost comically difficult. I've had my eye on this for awhile and decided to finally by it when it was 50% off at $19.99. I don't think it's worth $39.99. Not yet, anyway. It's been out so long, I thought it would be more finished by 2024, but it seems like the developers and more interested in making DLCs for hair and cosmetics for an unfinished game, then polishing the roughness out of the ambiguous crafting and cumbersome inventory systems. In summary: Good graphics, good map and environments, great idea for a game, but the crafting and inventory management are so hard to navigate and understand, they need a lot of work. One of my biggest complaints is having to craft the same thing multiple times because the games default is to drop EVERYTHING you craft onto the ground where you can't see it among the grasses rocks and weeds, instead of just letting you hold it in your hands. Very bad design. Would I recommend this game to other players? Hmmm... I want to like this game, because it looks, based off of trailers and game play videos, like it should be awesome; but the confusing crafting system and frustrating inventory management ruin what should be by now, an awesome game. Side note: the players who understand and excel at this game have put 1000s of hours into it. Maybe after a couple months of playing this I'll revise my opinion, but as of April 2024, it still needs some work before its ready for prime time... and it may never be.", "timestamp_created": 1712136412, "timestamp_updated": 1712136412, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552178025245666504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1712137926, "developer_response": "Hi Duke_Kaboom!

New player's experience: it did not felt good. Definitely experienced everyone's first or second death, which is not knowing how to deploy your parachute and landed on your face. You get thrown into the map without any new player guide or starting zone, everything was too hard to figure out just by exploring. It only started to make sense only after I had someone who played the game before taught it to me.\n\n2. Difficulty: it's the same across the world. Of course it's more difficult inside the bunker, but what I mean is, no matter the Biome, they're the same zombie, therefore new player who hasn't figure out how to get a weapon yet, will not be able to kill any zombie with bare hand, but once you know what you're doing, you will do so well in killing the same zombie when you first encounter, the only difference is the spawn rate in certain poi.\n\n3. Feature: this game is very feature lacking. Yes it's early access, but a lot of other younger games has already done more for a fair comparison than this 5 years old EA.\n- You want survival? There's none. It's incredibly hard to encounter an animal, even if you got lucky and hear one nearby, it's either glitched to the ground (which you can't see, or you can see but will disappeared upon death), or it'll lead you to 3 more zombie spawned before you're able to get closer to the animal. Even if you've successfully killed something and cooked it, it won't fill you up, you get hungry so fast anyway and constantly has to eat and drink so much. Fruit and vegetable won't fill up much either. After I understood the game, the way to survive is just to grind for gold and go to the shop to buy the overpriced food from the store. You know, it cost as much as selling a gun.\n- Cooking: I looked up a beginner's guide about cooking, well.... none of them work, apparently they scraped the cooking system in 0.95 and only skewer works, killed a fat chicken but can't even cook and eat the drumsticks, only 2 made skewers that has 2 charges each, which is not enough to fill 2 adults from a single chicken? Not to mention that I also have to stare at the timer during the whole cooking process, in which I could already be starving and ate 2 bowls of cereal before eating the skewer. \n- Building: too many things that will de-spawn once you placed it out WITHIN THE FLAG area. Found a lantern? Nah, good luck remembering to put it back into the storage every single time or it'll be gone next time you log back in. Not enough building pieces allowed within the claimed area, even if you're building for a squad of few people, you'll have to buy more land expansion but it doesn't give you much more pieces to work with. It's not a game for you if you're into survival building where you want to build a separate room for everything (for example, kitchen, armoury, weaponry, crafting + player's room). It's a building only for just enough to get by. Maintaining the base is also a pain, the durability lost so fast that you'll have to constantly repairing it.\n- Crafting: overly convoluted and complicated. Not many things can be crafted too. The only thing that I crafted a lot is.... improvised repair kit to repair the base.\n- Vehicle: well... it's incredibly hard to get one in P v E. It's limited by the fixed number of a certain type allowed in the server, so in most days, you just walk, and they have a short despawn rate of 5 days. Good luck going on a holiday that is more than 5 days.\n\n4. Balance: horrible. For example:\n- Player stat drains too fast (I'm looking at you, constitution). In reality, after your workout, you need to rest your body, the recover day will also burn energy after you worked your muscle; but in this game, as soon as you stopped moving, you started to drain your constitution. Although slowly, but it isn't fair, because sometimes I could be standing still to chop wood and that IT IS hard work too, it burns a lot of energy to do it!\n- Horde spawn/normal spawn rate is abysmal. Re-spawn rate is super fast. You killed one 3 seconds ago, another one spawned, good luck in clearing an area because that will never happen. It'll spawn on a spot that you just cleared or walked on behind you. Sometimes after you finally managed to clear a room, another wild zombie spawned out of line of sight somewhere in a different room and immediately called a horde, from where?????? It's like they spawned and immediately saw us regardless of the wall in between us. The horde came quick and BIG!!!! I've experienced upon approaching a police station, we stopped 1 blocked away and walked in, we'd kite the zombie that we can see with a baseball bat and a bow that has 2 silencers in it, but it somehow spawned a horde of 50. Even if we killed the first wave, we opened the door and most zombies inside the building would notice us and charges on us, so we back out to the safer ground, yeah another horde of 50 would be called. We killed the 2nd horde, finally started to loot. half way looting, some zombie spawned somewhere outside of the building and called on a 3rd horde of 50 on us. All of this is on official server. I just can't be bothered to login now because what's the point if the reward vs risk is not balanced. \n- Using gun is a curse. First shot will immediately draw you a horde of 50. Is not like I don't want to use the gun, I just can't use it unless I want to commit suicide or having too many bullets on me to burn.\n- The character eats like a cow, it's an eating simulator. Realistically, you don't require that much food to survive unless you're someone who has an eating disorder? Like I've mentioned above, how much you require to eat just to get by the day isn't realistic at all.\n- The durability of the majority of items wear out too fast. This game is also a repair simulator. Base require constant repair. Clothes need to be repaired after every single trip. Weapon I can understand. But how does the canteen got beat up so much after few trips? Are you sure they're military grade not made of cheap plastic? Why is bank card decaying too? They're inside a pocket, which usually they'd last for years!\n- Why clothes get 100% of dirtiness so quickly, but a full bar of soap of 20 charges, can't even clean a single piece of it to 100%?\n- There's no point looting in town anymore. Like what I've mentioned above that, the re-spawn rate of zombie is too fast and the horde is crazy. Even if it's just a normal building not the police station, the risk is so much higher now that it's not worth looting the normal building anymore (I've even tried the small village). It's not same as what they claimed that the normal building is for new players who has nothing with them. You have to be an experienced player in order to loot the town now.\n- Imo death penalty should be reduced by half to encourage new player not afraid to take more risk.\n\n5. Glitch: zombie will glitch through the wall or any object while they spawned. I've seen them only has the head like a Diglet rushing toward me, and a beeper who I can hear it getting closer but cannot see where it was coming from until it was too close. They can also have part of their legs glitching (jumping) in and out of the boulder rapidly making it hard for me to aim, Oh yeah, sometimes they float in the air with a stiff motion until they reached your destination, but don't assume that you're safe if they are landing far, because they've already seen you. As soon as you hear anything or see any Diglet, run because they've already seen you while they were floating. It's also the main reason that I won't be bothered entering any bunker (this and the crazy zombie re-spawn rate plus the horde of 50 entering the bunker).\n\nSo no, I do not recommend this game,", "timestamp_created": 1710521978, "timestamp_updated": 1710766864, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550860941410064697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1710753763, "developer_response": "Hi Blueberry! First off, we'd like to thank you for taking the time to write this extensive and constructive review and for being so meticulous with your analysis of the game. We'd like to address several key points that you pointed out in order to alleviate some concerns:\n\nWe acknowledge that the new player experience can be vastly improved and that we have to improve the communication of our mechanics to the player. We'll be adding something akin to a tutorial eventually that will help guide new players and make the learning curve less steep. However, there is a manual that can be accessed by pressing the TAB button where all in-game mechanics are explained.\n\nHowever, the main point of contention that you have with the game stems from the inadequate functioning of the puppet/horde spawning mechanic. The team is well aware of the issues this mechanic is creating for other players and we're actively working to tweak it so that the puppets spawn much more organically and, of course, that they do not walk through the ground. After this gets sorted out, the issues that trickle down as a consequence of the hordes will also no longer present an issue.\n\nAs for the rest of the things that you've mentioned, we'll be looking into all the systems present in the game before we get to the 1.0 version of SCUM and invest a lot of dedicated effort to fix bugs and bring about necessary balancing changes in order to improve the overall experience.

Developed by Gamepires and Croteam, this game takes the survival genre to a higher level with a highly detailed metabolic system, realistic environments, and intense combat mechanics.\n\nGameplay:\nSCUM excels at offering a deep and immersive survival experience. From regulating a character's metabolism to scavenging for resources and crafting essential items, every action feels essential to survival. The metabolic system adds an extra layer of realism, requiring players to monitor their character's calorie intake, hydration levels, and even vitamin balance. The game's expansive open world map provides plenty of opportunities for exploration and discovery, with a variety of landmarks, cities, and military installations to plunder and conquer.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\nVisually, SCUM impresses with its detailed environments and realistic lighting effects. From dense forests to abandoned urban areas, each location feels different and immersive. The sound design further enhances the atmosphere, with ambient noise and environmental effects adding to the sense of immersion. However, occasional bugs and glitches can detract from the overall experience.\n\nCombat and Interaction:\nCombat in SCUM is intense and unforgiving. Whether engaged in close-quarters combat or long-range firefights, players must utilize cover, tactics, and skill to outmaneuver their opponents. The game's realistic ballistics system adds depth to gunplay, requiring players to consider factors such as bullet drop and weapon recoil. Additionally, SCUM has a strong interaction system, allowing players to communicate, trade, and form alliances with other survivors.\n\nCommunity and Updates:\nOne of SCUM's greatest strengths is its active and dedicated community. With regular updates and fixes from the developer, the game continues to develop and improve over time. Player feedback is valued and implemented frequently, ensuring that SCUM remains a dynamic and engaging experience for both new and veteran players.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, SCUM sets a new standard for the survival genre with its complex gameplay mechanics, immersive world, and intense combat. While not without its flaws, the game offers a challenging and rewarding experience for those willing to take on the harsh post-apocalyptic landscape. With a dedicated community and continued support from the developers, SCUM remains a must-play title for survival game fans.\n\nRequest: \nPolish this game so that it becomes smoother and the gameplay is still a bit stiff\nAdd and upgrade several NPCs, both zombies and NPC figures (quest reward items) because the game feels lonely and empty\nAdd features and items to build a base, hold a massive zombie attack  when you have a base\nAdd some characters or bots that help in the grinding process (single player)\nIncrease vehicle spawn when we have difficulty looking for vehicles\nAdd various animals to hunt for food according to the climate and place\n\nRecommended to play 5/5", "timestamp_created": 1707905392, "timestamp_updated": 1709435446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550144791603088379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1707989617, "developer_response": "Hi \ud835\udcda\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd93\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd71\ud835\udd6e!

[spoiler](You can pee on your enemies)[/spoiler] This realism adds depth to the game play and challenges players to manage their diet. So don't only eat trash food like me.\r\n\r\n[b]Character Customization:[/b] The game allows for decent customization of your character, from physical appearance to skills and abilities. This depth of customization adds a personal touch to the gameplay, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferences a bit. It feels similar to choosing something in fallout for a characters beginning stats. Kinda sorta.\r\n\r\n[b]Crafting:[/b] The game has some pretty decent crafting, with different tables and stations allowing you to craft more things than you can with your bare hands. Its a pretty solid formula for crafting, and is much like any other successful survival game with crafting.\r\n\r\n[b]Variety of Weapons and Equipment:[/b] The game offers a not so large array of weapons, gear, and equipment for players to scavenge and utilize in their survival efforts. Basic firearms, melee weapons, and ranged weapons.\r\n\r\nPositive Note: The game COULD BE.............[spoiler]so much more.[/spoiler] \r\nIt feels like a great foundation for a survival PvEvP game.\r\n\r\nBut for why you're here.

These technical issues detract from the overall gameplay experience and can make the game difficult to enjoy. My cherry on top for these issues; in SINGLE PLAYER, I've even had tons of items I've collected in crates, in a garage, and my own inventory, [spoiler]DISAPPEAR,[/spoiler] after logging off and back on from a break.\r\n\r\n[b]Lack of Content Updates:[/b] Despite early promise, Scum has struggled to deliver consistent content updates and improvements. This has led to a stagnant gameplay experience, with little to incentivize long-term engagement. BUT, they haven't had a problem shoving out a sponsored DLC with a very famous actor.

Yet the game fails to function even at a basic level.\nEssentially this is a running / bandage simulator made in UE so at least the trees look realistic I guess? Which makes it look and feel as generic as any other garage projects made in UE after 2 weeks of experimenting with its asset store.\n\nThe mechanics that are 'implemented' in the game are utterly broken for the most part:\n\nUnarmed combat doesn't do anything - even at max level and top strength you get killed.\nMelee combat is even worse because half the time the weapon just swings through the puppets.\nThen, through a combat armor, helmet, backpack filled with stuff, a hoodie, shirt, undershirt etc... a puppet even just glances at you causing your arteries to burst and you have to bandage yourself for 2 hours to stop the bleeding. I guess being punched through several layers of armor is somehow causing one to bleed from 5x open wounds?\n\nMy character is 150kg according to the BCU, just because he / she has muscles. That's really an accurate simulation.\n\nCharacter stats are tied to character looks. You can't be strong AND durable without being fat? Also being intelligent to any degree means you somehow can't be also strong, because.... reasons.\n\nStats are also randomly assigned to skills. I guess it takes tremendous dexterity to drive a car, and parachute all the same, and both of these activities really really require you to be skinny. I guess fat people can't drive?   And what does intelligence have to do with stealth? Having high stamina means you can run forever or stay in a fight longer, but... having high stamina (and running everywhere) somehow doesn't count, you are still fat because you aren't 'dexterous' enough to lockpick or improvise gunpowder - yeah makes sense -.-\n\nNature respawns into areas where it has no business being anymore. You chop down a tree, build a house of it and the next day the very same tree is grown back into and through the house you've built from that tree.\n\nYou may disable puppets vaulting through windows and opening doors, but fret not because they can still go through walls at their leasure or hit you through the wall, again causing you to bleed for 3 hours.\n\nEverything causes the player to bleed. A puppet hit you through 50kg backpack from behind - you bleed 3x C1 and a C2.\nYou land a bit harder than should from a height that DOES NOT break your leg but your sole bleeds??  You get bleeding abrasions for walking barefoot, but your completely fine and dedicated combat boot falls apart after having walked in it for an hour. That's some military quality boots right there. I wonder if my character will start to bleed from being hungry or thirsty? Which is just obnoxious too. Can't go half an hour without moaning for being hungry or thirsty, then you drink two gulps of water immediately causing bladder issues.\n\nPuppets struggle to find their waypoints. They relentlessly keep playing the running animation against a railing or wall instead of just going around it. Puppets colliding into one another does the same thing, the keep running in place forever or until one of them is killed.\n\nParachute spawning is bugged. At least one out of ten times it lands me in places that force me to suicide. Such as landing on top of large trees. Landing on utility poles. Landing on windmills (if it has a slight angle then you can land on its side so you have to press any button first to fall to your death). Once my character was parachuted out of bounds into the open sea because of the wind.\n\nThings that you would use disappear. Such as building / crafting materials, vehicles, weapons, food, puppets and their clothes. Things reappear that should not - such as cleared trees and bushes (in single player mode). I mean can I at least control the vegetation within my base area?\n\nAll in all this has the potential to be a good game, but until the devs put more effort into adding willy warmers and 'celebrities' (whoever they are, never heard of any of those names) in the game instead of finishing the game actually, it remains to be EA for another 10 years while shamelessly asking for your money now for even stuff that should just be part of the game by default.\n\nDEVS: fix the game as is before adding a new pink fluffy unicorn skin to the AK47, I don't think anyone cares how creative you can be with willy warmers and xmas ornaments as long as pretty much everything in the game is broken. It's been 7 years in EA ffs.

And one of those newer \"features\" overhauled the zombie spawning system, for the worse. Yes, they are still working on that system, and maybe even one day will fix the issue of zombies \"beaming in\" that most people have an issue with, but there are so many more issues with the new system than that, but this review is already long enough.

We have put several hours in so far and I will say we are enjoying this early access game.\nHere are some thing we like and don't like about this game. \n\nDon't likes: \nAt default settings, this game is WAY more grindy than most OWSC games I've played, but the solution is finding a server with an 8-10x loot modifier. \nThe game can crash at times, and it's annoying, but luckily your character isn't idle in server time, so when you crash, your character disappears until you log back in. \nThere can be some glitches at times: drinking or eating food straight from a box's inventory, can sometimes cause your characters ability to interact with anything disappear. Most of the time, a re-log will solve this issue. \nThe most recent glitch me and my brother found is a random occurrence where our truck, while driving, no clipped through the map floor, we were spawned back on the ground, but our truck and all the loot from a bunker was lost to the abyss. \n\nNow the positives: \nThis game is possibly the most accurate OWSC game in the gun department. IRL I am a gun nerd and seeing a game that implements correct loading animations for mags. drums, shotguns and also has accurate quantity counts (like 7rds. in a 1911 or certain shotguns have shorter feed tubes) is really cool and speaks to the research the devs have done. \nThe complexity of crafting materials, or \"grinding\" to build bases, the inner-workings of vehicle mechanics, charging batteries, repairing guns with the parts of an identical gun and resource gathering restrictions (only carry 2 large logs at a time) are just a few ways this game immerses you into the survival mentality.\n\nDon't let haters scare you off, but if you want the cleanliness of a AAA title then play a AAA title, but what I'll tell you is, I have not found a AAA title that itches all the spots of an immersive open world survival craft like this one. This isn't pay to win. Play with friends and enjoy a real walking dead world simulator where your day to day survival is based on how you maneuver through the challenges. \n", "timestamp_created": 1706530994, "timestamp_updated": 1706530994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162204325": {"recommendationid": "162204325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002224431", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 67021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9337, "playtime_at_review": 54761, "last_played": 1713797485}, "language": "english", "review": "Melhor jogo de sobreviv\u00eancia atualmente", "timestamp_created": 1712254631, "timestamp_updated": 1712254631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521550178527832031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162759752": {"recommendationid": "162759752", "author": {"steamid": "76561199606673915", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 282, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1712972327}, "language": "english", "review": "add controller support and i will give it a thumps up", "timestamp_created": 1712970315, "timestamp_updated": 1712970315, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521531343460083008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1713173441, "developer_response": "Hi mrpatrol4090!

(We did in fact not implode, I died way before that)\n-The lag when you're even thinking about heading into an outpost. \n-Items that despawns as you try to put them on, eat them or drink them from a closet, fridge etc.\n-Limping when you hurt your arm\n-Using a weapon with a silencer still can cause a horde\n\n\nAnd there are so many other cons, so please make the game playable again.\nMy breaking point was the zombie spawning, i would probably still play if that didn't push me over the edge", "timestamp_created": 1712256050, "timestamp_updated": 1712256050, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520105183124542236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1712305918, "developer_response": "Hi Sofia Bolem!

To no avail as the cheaters will buy another account and continue to grief players that choose to play the game legit.

Rendering is so slow.\n    I sometimes land and am able to walk through houses and other objects as they have not yet rendered. This can also happen when I run.\n2. Food is very hard to find.\n    I have died numerous times as I have been travelling and unable to find food, or enough food to make a big difference to your hunger.\n3. You can hardly carry anything with you.\n    To start with you only have pockets, and you cannot stack items. If you are lucky you might find a bum bag. I know you can craft a backpack, but you need a lot of stuff to do so.\n4. Items are sparse.\n    You can travel far and wide, but you will not find many needed items. It's not too bad in the city, but it's one thing finding stuff you need, it's another being able to collect it and take it with you (see 3).\n5. Zombies are too fast.\n    You can't outrun most zombies (you can, if you are lucky, run out of their line of sight). \n6. Zombies are too strong.\n    Even with simple weapons it is hard to kill a zombie.\n7. Zombies are too numerous.\n    Especially in towns and the city, you will likely get attacked by more than one zombie. Killing one zombie is hard enough but taking on 2, 3, 4 or more zombies is impossible without a gun.\n8. Base building is a nightmare!\n    a simple foundation requires several items which have to be added after you have placed the blueprint. 3 rope, 3 logs, 3 sticks (for example). so, you have to go and collect these items (as you can't stack items in your inventory) and drop them on the ground. Then go and find more.....and so on. SO a 4x4 hut would require so many items that it would take ages to build even if those items were available in close vacinity.\nThis is the worst base building I have come across in all the many games of this ilk that I have played.\n\n660 hours later....\n\n1. Well, the rendering is no longer slow.\n2. If you run at the default pace (second click on the scroll wheel) your food now lasts quite a long time, long enough to find a few veggies to keep you going.\n3. Still ca't carry much unless you are lucky enough to find a backpack or, even better, a large backpack. It can take you hours and several lives to get that lucky.\n4. Items/loot is still sparse and it can take forever to just get some decent clothes.\n5. Zombies are still too fast. It's not a problem if you get a head start, but if you come across one suddenly, you can't outrun it. Even running through bushes won't help.\n6. Okay, so, get your timing right and you can deal with a single zombie without too many scratches. But...\n7.  the horde mode is just crazy. I've been in a house making not the slightest noise when, suddenly, the horde starts yelling and gathering and they will normally find you even if you don't move. Fighting a horde without ranged weapons is (almost) impossible unless you can fight them in a doorway or other narrow place that will prevent them overwhelming you.\n8. Still not liking the base building system, though I did manage to build a 3x2 base, which took HOURS.\nSo, I managed to exceed 300 fame points in single player mode, but multiplayer is another problem (even with no PvP) as you have to start from scratch.\n\n    \n", "timestamp_created": 1707123482, "timestamp_updated": 1710441079, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512298524379730225", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1707126044, "developer_response": "Hi bruteforceoap! We're sorry to see that you we're disappointed with the game. However, based on the points you've mentioned, we believe it would be best to address each of them in order to provide much needed clarity:\n\n1. We're aware of the issue with rendering. The game still needs to be vastly optimized and we'll make sure to attend to that as we are nearing the full 1.0 release, which should improve this situation.\n2. The overall loot of the game depends on where you are looking and whether someone that got before you looted the place which rendered you unable to find anything. There are spots, buildings and POI's on the map where you can find food that would help you sustain yourself. However, if that is also not satisfactory, you can also try playing on private servers where loot is vastly increased, meaning that it would be far easier for you to find new stuff.\n3. You can bundle certain items such as short sticks, which are crucial for crafting initial items that can help you in the early game (such as the courier backpack that you've mentioned). It is intended that the starter clothes you have do not let you carry a lot of items as that makes you more inclined to loot and attempt to find better clothing and backpacks that will help you carry more stuff.\n4. We've already touched upon this in point 2. The game is designed to not shower you with loot. However, if you prefer playing with a lot of it, there are private servers you can join that have drastically increased loot spawns so if that is your preference, you are free to try them out. \n5. Puppets are designed to be a real threat in the game. It is very hard to outrun them in an open field, and you also have to keep in mind that all puppets do not run at the same speed and that your stats, as well as the weight of items you are carrying, also have an influence your speed.\n6. Your stats and the weapon you are carrying influence how difficult it is to kill puppets. However, by crafting either an improvised bow or a small stone axe, you should be able to get rid of them with ease.\n7. We are looking into this system. Their number is not so much of a problem as is their spawning, which is something that we'll be tweaking in some of the upcoming patches.\n8. We'll also be looking into this system to see if something can be done to make things easier for solo players. \n\nWe hope that some of these will provide necessary clarification and that you'll consider giving the game another chance eventually or at least when we manage to bring it to the full 1.0 version.\n"}, "159022535": {"recommendationid": "159022535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065798761", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5064, "last_played": 1709967433}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not bad game, but it's missing something to get recommend.\n\nI went in blind.

At this current state I cannot reccomend this game despite loving the survival elements present (nutrition specifically.)\n\n\nThings that need work -\n*Cooking\n*Crafting Variety/Complexity\n*Zombie/Puppet AI and animations\n*Melee Combat\n*Animals\n\nThings that are 10/10\n*Graphics\n*Player Character Movement\n*Nutrition and Body\n\n\nI would suggest -\n\nMelee, add a player shove when a puppet is too close to be hit with either a punch or melee weapon, like every good zombie game. Make kicking and combos require player input (Look at Kingdom Come's combat)\n\nPuppets just need a massive overhaul, and NOT spawning-wise. That's already borked and should be reverted. Give them the same physics as the player character or something similar, they shouldn't go from prone to vertical mid-swing.\n\nCrafting needs some higher level stuff and more crafting stations. Ever heard of blacksmithing? Take scrap metal, make stuff. Higher skill means better looking (and more durable/functional) stuff. Humans can make better things, we're not limited to trashcan armor and animal-skin pants IRL. Crafting could also have a mini-game for things like blacksmithing or maybe tailoring. Player draws a little stitch mark or something? Hits metal with hammer until it's to shape (with re-heating?) Vintage story does this very well in blacksmithing.\n\nCooking just needs an overhaul, the current system makes no sense. I guess skewers can be expanded to anything logically skewerable, soup/stew as well.

While the game's attention to detail and innovative features are admirable, it's essential to address two significant issues: poor frame rates and the impact of overly detailed \"jiggle physics\" on the female character models.\n\nOne of the main concerns for me revolves around SCUM's performance in terms of frame rates. The game's demanding graphics and physics simulations can strain even high-end gaming systems, resulting in sub-optimal frame rates. This issue can severely hinder the overall gaming experience, causing frustration and detracting from the immersive survival atmosphere that SCUM aims to create. This notable in the latest release which along with low frame rates suffers from late object drawing.\n\nTo address the frame rate concerns, the developers could consider additional game optimisation. This might involve refining resource-intensive graphical elements, tweaking the rendering pipeline, or providing additional graphics settings to allow players to tailor the game to their hardware capabilities. Frequent updates have been forthcoming from the developer so there is ample opportunity to roll out improvements.\n\n\nWhile SCUM strives for realism in its character models, the implementation of overly detailed \"jiggle physics\" on female characters can contribute to distracting and unrealistic visuals, particularly during intense gameplay moments.\n\nTo address this concern, the developers might consider implementing an option in the settings menu that allows players to adjust or disable the jiggle physics effect to their own tastes and system capabilities. Providing players with the ability to customise their gaming experience in this manner would strike a balance between realism and player preference, ensuring a more inclusive and enjoyable environment for all players.", "timestamp_created": 1707346040, "timestamp_updated": 1707346040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157670767": {"recommendationid": "157670767", "author": {"steamid": "76561199217300786", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8845, "last_played": 1711079237}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game is Fantastic!

Combat is super janky, mechs are unpredictable at times and your shotgun will shoot through puppets if they\u2019re too close.\nSo, what have I spent 150 hours doing in this game? \n\nI\u2019ll tell you what I haven\u2019t been doing. I haven\u2019t been running straight to the Airfield and getting frustrated when I die every 5 minutes because some geared player, squad, mech or puppet lagged out and killed me. This is not PUBG, if you want a game where the goal is to get looted and battle it out with other players, this game is not for you. \n\nFame points are an awesome way to limit your bad decisions. Not so hard to get that it\u2019s annoying, but not so easy to get that they are a waste. You need to plan your engagements. You\u2019ve got to be willing to lose your gear if a situation goes south.

It\u2019s a survival game.

I upgrade my throwing skill, because I\u2019m curious what the next level will bring. I wander from city to city, bunker to bunker and admire the beauty of this game. As an Avid outdoorsman I am blown away by how lost I get in the landscape. \n\nI have rebuilt my character many times. This latest build was focused on stealth, because a part of me wants to see if I can be a spear throwing shadow, destroying players with primitive weapons. \n\nI bought into the early access because I have been following this game for a while now and decided to take a chance on supporting the developer while they continued to build the game.

Was King...\n\n\nScum really hooked me with the Mechanics. If you don't know about them, check em out.\nNamely: \nMetabolism, Health, Diseases, Vitamins. \n\nIts something DayZ Doesnt Touch on and Project Zomboid Nails. \n\nSo I loaded Scum a few months back Perhaps August 2020. It was alright but eh. Something off about it idk. \n\nLoaded it this Friday and wow. The Changes are absurd. \nNo joke, as it stands right now this game is top top Survival for me. \n\nThe look of the world, the Graphics... they really upped the ante there. \nThe Sounds, Amazing. Very nice, Very Creepy. \nThe Environment is fantastic. \nThe world is huge.\nThe Gun play, sounds, and mechanics are tip top. \nThe Base building is amazing, it works. \n\nI spent a good 3 hours wandering around blasting the radio I found in game just survivin'. \nRan into 3 different people, 2 of which were geared. Put my hands up. Explained I just wanted a backpack. They threw me one and told me split and we good. So I did after thanking them. \n\nThe other two I ran into (Freshies) I offered help. They declined. They didnt try to suicide Charge me. (Playing on an unofficial Hardcore, higher pop) \n\nJust an all around good experience. Was refreshing. \nEventually Built a sh*** little camp, buried a box with some basic supplies and called it. \n\nI've been in a massive gaming rut, NOTHING has pulled me in or kept me. Nothing. Scum has done more than fill the void. \n\nOn top of that Im beyond stoked for .5 Patch update. \n\nSo for me.... someone whose played Miscreated, Zomboid, DayZ, Forest, Stranded Deep, Long Dark, Again.... name it. \n\n10/10. \n\nDo your research though. Camoflauge mechanics, Strength stats, archery. The Stat Systems and Metabolism and stuff. Thats what really sucks me in and the world and sh**, they did a great job.\n\n1/10/2021: Update on some things I noticed: \n\nI hear a lot of people complaining about Lag in game. Im on an Unofficial. Personally I havent encountered Any lag. \n\nVehicles however...... they are awesome But they do desync a TON. Saw someone drive by the other day and it was like.... skipping. Needs work there. \n\nLast night I had like.... 4 Fatal Errors. So, after about a week of PLaying I started getting them 4 in a row Just last night. I Verified and it seems to be stable. No more issue there.\n\nI play on an unofficial hardcore so.... as for how good officials are...  IDK. Personally Official Servers on most PvP Games are Trash imo. I hear there are some exploits that they know of but are working on. Also a ton ton ton of people HATE the lockpicking on mil bases. Personally I f*cking love it. Means people cant just spawn in and suicide run right to get geared. When game launched that was one reason I left. I was full kit in a few hours. Like.... 3-4 Hours I had an arsenal. \n\nI paid for the supporter pack last night just cuz Im loving the game and felt like supporting. \n\nMy Specs: \nNvid 2070S\nAMD Ryzen 3700\n32gb RAM\n\n10/03/2021 Update (Same PC)\n\nSo as of my last play time I went through a massive Gaming drought. Bored out my mind. I'd waited ages for the .6 update and while it was released i'd not touched it. \n\nI figured.... eh. WTH, Might as well install SCUM and see whats new. See that Metabolism. \nWell....... I think this week alone I played over 70 hours. \nThe new metabolism is amazing. Absolutely amazing. Even now it's not fully finished and omfg its so good. Loving the direction its going and I want more. Need more. I cannot freaking wait. Diseases? Bone breaks and such? PLEASE!!! \nMy last review stated Fatal Errors, those are pretty much a thing of the past. In the last 4-6 Weeks of playing I think I may have had Two? \n\nThe Graphics and Visuals are absolutely Stunning. My Lord. I honestly often find myself just totally immersed and staring off into the sunset or up at the moon and twinkling stars. Absolutely stellar job. The way the leaves all sway and rustle with the wind... oh and the sound effects? Amazing. Top notch, truly. The wind picking up and making it hard to listen. Wolves howling off in the distance. Rattling chain link fences. My word.... Fantastic all around. \n\nI've been to quite a few of the new POI's and just wow. Im honestly blown away since I last played. \n\nOH! And boats, sharks.... fishing!? The Fishing is freaking fantastic and honestly better than any other game I've ever played (Aside maybe ACTUAL Fishin simulators?). Definitely chill and relaxing to just whip out your rod... lol... and catch some fish. Taking a few mins to reel in a lunker. Nice lil mini game of sorts. \n\nThe boats work amazing, The first time I had one I had to Evac my buddy from Wep Factory in the dead of night. I got there and we went to get in.... Both of us standing on one edge and the friggin thing flipped. Like, that lil attention to detail. Amazing. Scared the Sh_t out of us. We lived. Then the storm comes, lightning cracking, pouring rain. Waves smashing the boat. What a feeling... This game creates stories. Adventures. Memories.\n\nUpdate 09/12/2022: \nI took a break last year whilst waiting for updates. Quit playing around February? \n\nCame back a week or two with the old squad. We promised we'd only hop in casual. No big deal. Just play here and there. \n\nThe games just good. 8 or 9 other friends and acquaintances bought the game as well. Everyone enjoyed it. Laughs were had. \"Oh Shit\" moments abound. Fantastic. \nSome new bugs, mainly with vehicles, but nothing game breaking. \n\nI was apprehensive with the traders at first honestly, but I genuinely like them. Gives me Kind of a hardcore sea of thieves/Tarkov vibe. Get loot or raid, sell. Repeat. Stack that cash. Guard it heavily. \n\nBeyond stoked for whats to come. My most anticipated is more medical/health stuff. Cooking. Vehicle parts and maintenance. Those three I think will really make it more difficult to survive. \n\nThe update to poisonous mushrooms was fantastic. Infections are absolutely wonderful.\n\nI would like to see some sort of possible parasites or something as currently, eating bugs is a bit easy mode.", "timestamp_created": 1609769734, "timestamp_updated": 1662981038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 240, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.930422842502593994", "comment_count": 32, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1610609405, "developer_response": "Thank you for the extensive review Baby Cakes, appreciate it!"}, "110221084": {"recommendationid": "110221084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144347235", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 17100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16933, "last_played": 1685282221}, "language": "english", "review": "i've loved this game for years now, but i just can't enjoy it for what it was meant to be, and isn't:  a survival game.\n\nthe devs listen to everyone, and i think they've been led astray by pvp junkies and looting fanatics.\nwhen the game started it was about immersion into the landscape, skills, camo, finding food and encountering other players.\nit was spellbinding, and i'd creep through the map for hours, building my skills and exploring, with the occasional pvp in a mostly-pve experience.\n\nbut then we got cars because people don't like to spend time walking.\nof course all the squads got the cars and locked them away.\nthen we got high loot servers and new weapons and points made in private pvp meant that killed players in squads could respawn literally 100m from the battle, and just re-join.\nand then squads got name tags.\n\nname tags did it for me.\nas a solo players against 3 others who can see each other on the map, while i can't, in a game that's supposed to be about SURVIVAL?\nsorry, that's a nope.\n\nnow it's about squads, that's all.\nthe solo bushmaster doesn't stand a chance.", "timestamp_created": 1644843222, "timestamp_updated": 1644843222, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 974, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.927836775779724121", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "153081472": {"recommendationid": "153081472", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990427994", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 16630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14990, "last_played": 1702956799}, "language": "english", "review": "Short review-\nbuy it on sale 10-15 dollars, especially if you are ok with rust, and like zomboid. If you can't make it past the initial huge learning curve you won't waste too much money.\n\n\nLonger review-\nRecommending was a toss up. There is so much potential it is insane, and I do ultimately enjoy it, but there is a lot to unpack. \n\nScum is the love child of Rust and Project Zomboid. Like Zomboid it has a steep learning curve. Very steep. If you are learning on your own, I estimate 50 hours if you have limited similar experiences to really have a grasp on how to survive, assuming you are learning most of the game and not skipping things.\n\nLike Rust there is raiding and pvp, but it heavily depends on the server. Make no mistake 60 people on 1 server at once is a lot. Once you have the basics down, you can largely simplify the game if you please. You can sustain yourself on a simple diet, and you don't have to build or farm, and making money becomes easier. Many players live off of stashes they place in world and are baseless.\n\nThe way I see it the devs care about the game, but not about the players. This deserves further explanation. There are basically 0 quality of life features. If you want basic wood arrows, you need to cut sticks into small stick, then craft each arrow. Find a box of nails? Have fun right clicking and then left clicking remove nail for the next few minutes. That isn't fun, it is work. \n\nTo add insult to injury there used to be faster ways to do it, like being able to craft a nail with the required material being a box of them, but that was removed for some reason. It is a simple recipe, it wouldn't take an hour to code it in from scratch, and if you just used a form it would take minutes. \n\nTo make things a little more aggravating you need dozens if not hundreds of nails, bolts and bobby pins, which means you are unpacking for an hour of two if you do it all at once. Again, this is work, not fun. Further, your first base will likely be made with primitive gear, which means a simple 2x2 can take hours. \n\nNot very much is intuitive either, so it can be VERY frustrating. There are even keyboard commands that arent shown on the keybindings, which should piss anyone off. Because of this the game ultimately feels like the devs don't respect the players time which explains why the game is on life support.\n\nIn my experience official servers are more toxic than Rust official. The main reason is feuding. Some people hold grudges in rust, but the reality is that in rust there is usually such a high pop that are all doing the same thing, that people forget because in 30 minutes it happened again 2-3 times. Sometimes it goes further but I have yet to hear about long time players holding a grudge more than a day or two without a specific reason, like racism etc. Scum servers have to be smaller, so people will try to punish you specifically often. While this can be fun if it is a friendly competition, most people who are new don't want to deal with that. Ever have someone find all your bases and only raid you and constantly hunt for specifically you, before you were really established? I have it sucks, and there was literally nothing I could do. I was prim, and he had rifles. Why? apparently I built my first base too close to him, but I had no idea where he was. Maybe 2 hours in on my first time loading.\n\nThe actual gameplay is great, the animations are really good, plenty of things to do if you just want to learn playing solo. I do find the shooting to be the most accurate to real life than in any game I have ever played, with there being a bullet rise before drop, windage etc. So sniping can be really complicated compared to most other games, and in one case I hit a friend in the head with a shot at over a grid away. Unfortunately most servers wont have draw distance that high, but hey that happened and it was awesome. The hunting is incredibly hard, and the best way I can describe it is like spot and stalk irl, which isn't practiced a lot, and is quite difficult, harder than irl to be honest. Anyone who hunts knows hunting is not easy either. The fishing is fun. PVP is fast, as in incredibly fast. 1-2 shots and it is likely over, and even if you win, you could still die from the injury or infection. That is why server pops can not be too high.  \n\nThe game can be very fun after the learning curve, and there are many people who are helpful, and nice (relatively speaking, don't ask where their base is and they wont say goodnight). The online tutorials are ok, but until you figure it out do yourself a favor and start on a pve server. The game is immensely different than any other I have found, and you will need time to acclimate to it", "timestamp_created": 1701992502, "timestamp_updated": 1701992502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 157, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.927142500877380371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128756684": {"recommendationid": "128756684", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967296571", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 28483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18561, "last_played": 1683914813}, "language": "english", "review": "Short version: Do not buy this game, it is full of bugs and missing a ton of features at the moment. Plus as of 12/14/2022 Gamepires was purchased by Jagex of Runescape fame. The future of SCUM is null, as Jagex revealed back in June 2022 their plans for a survival game set in the Runescape universe, what better investment than purchasing a company that already did all the work for you? https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/jagex-is-making-an-open-world-survival-game-set-in-runescape-universe-3254915\n\nLong version: SCUM used to be a good game, it had a ton of things to do and the devs continuously kept adding content to the game. You could play PvP, or go solo and even single player and have a more laid back experience crafting, cooking, hunting, building a base, fishing, etc. There were all kinds of vehicles to explore the map and it was a freaking fun game.\n\nUnfortunately the devs have been taking features away, there were planes - gone, there were bikes - gone, there was a city you could explore \u2013 gone, there were cars, tractors, quads - all gone, even the birds are gone now. \n\nSee, you used to be able to play SCUM the way you wanted, and you earned Fame Points for every action you did (it is supposed to be a game show after all), which were then used to respawn, from lower FP cost to respawn randomly on the map, to high cost to respawn at your shelter/base. With update 0.8 the devs introduced many new bugs and a money and gold system tied to respawn, basically SCUM is forcing you to play one way only if you want to have a chance to respawn and keep your character.\n\nWhat a game of SCUM is now:\n1. run around and loot\n2. once you have enough loot, run around to find a trader and sell your stuff\n3. run even more to find a bank or ATM to deposit the cash in your bank account\n4. repeat 1 to 3 until you have enough to respawn (min $250 for a random spawn far away from your base)\n5. repeat 1 to 4 to have enough cash to buy gold for an even better respawn choice:\n\nFrom the store page:\n- random respawn $250\n- sector respawn $1000\n- shelter respawn 1 gold unit\n\nOh and did I mention there are only 5 traders on the whole map? And if you are lucky to find that one modular car they added back, you will have to fix it first then push it all the way to a trader anyway to put in an engine. Enjoy that long walk.\n\nNow, maybe some folks like to do this, but that is not what SCUM was, yet with update 0.8 the devs also had the brilliant idea to introduce PERMADEATH! Meaning that after 10 deaths (or if you reach -$2500) your character will disappear forever. So leveling your skills no longer means anything if you do not first run around looting to gather enough funds to keep your character alive!\n\nAfter four years spent in Early Access the game still has many issues and definitely got worse this year, removing the vehicles was a major blow to playability. Yet the devs decided that the introduction of a banking system was a top priority. Which makes perfect sense if the game was ready to introduce a microtransaction system where cash for in game gold would guarantee you would never lose your character. \n\nWhich brings me to this: as of 12/14/2022 Jagex aquired Gamepires. What means financial salvation for the indie studio also brings a sense of dread for us early adopters of SCUM. We all know Runescape and the microtransaction galore of its store page. Yet here we are. More worrying still is that bringing up the topic of the acquisition in the forums gets you warnings (for trolling, offensive content and spam), and the discussions get promptly removed, as if the topic was absolute taboo to talk about. As of 12/17/2022 date I am posting this review the acquisition is not even announced on SCUM\u2019s store page. Draw your own conclusions as to what it means for SCUM\u2019s future, as Jagex is actively working on its own survival game set to be ported to consoles, and is hiring a whole team for this project. My guess is Jagex will let Gamepires release a bare bone 1.0 version of SCUM in 2023, or 2024 if they want all the skills systems up and running, before shutting down the studio and moving all the assets to their main Cambridge location (where new Jagex hires are located). Why keep a small 50+ team in Croatia when the new project will be based at their 400+ employees location? \n\nSo to conclude, SCUM had its prime time, but it is passed now and in light of the recent events, it will definitely not come back. Sad but true.\n\nEDIT 12/18/2022: As others and myself have mentioned in their reviews, criticizing the game, the update or mentioning the Jagex purchase on forums will get you warnings. As of the time of this edit I am now BANNED from posting in the Steam discussion boards! LOL\n\nEDIT 12/30/2022: After the temporary ban above I came back to the forums to find out that whenever I post any comment it gets promptly removed by the mods. Meanwhile the very same mods allow openly hostile and insulting pro SCUM players to thrive and attack those who dare to criticize the game or its features. The few players remaining (9K as of today) are becoming increasingly more toxic, better to avoid them altogether.\n\nEdit 1/19/2023: So about two months after 0.8 many people are still complaining about the lack of vehicles and utter failure of the two news cars reintroduced in the game (no engines available at traders, etc). Devs keep saying \u201cwe are working on it\u201d yet they are getting pretty shaky about the loss of players as they even released a Twitter poll asking what the players want: https://twitter.com/dedaPong/status/1612757942394036224 \nBut as always, bring up the issue (or any other problem really) on the discussion boards and you will be treated to some quality feedback by delightful people (always the same peeps BTW, mods let them freely harass others):\n\u201c- If developers would listen to everything players ask for, then we will have not a game but an unplayable hoax. \n- slow down and be carefull.......the vehicles are fine stop making these crybaby threads \n- Or you can indeed adjust your driving temper, this is not difficult at all. \n- Dunno why everyone is crying. New cars work great for me. \n- Everybody is crying because they love to whine \n- A few people responding to a twitter poll is not the majority of players.\nA few people coming to the forums and asking for the old ride backs is not a majority of players. \n- I can't play! I wanna play....crying... :D \n- You're not supposed to hit a stone. Do not drive without a license. Learn how to drive.\u201d\nThe wonderful SCUM community... \n\nEdit 02/09/2023: the sad upcoming future of Gamepires has been added to the my review, the question is: when will Jagex pull the plug on Gamepires?

I'll praise them where it's due and criticize them when its warranted.\n\nI installed this game awhile back when it was still killing you for touching water.  I installed again about 3 months ago during the peak of 0.75 release.  I was hooked.  Sure, there were bugs that would be frustrating at times but it was rare enough for me that I could deal with it personally as a dedicated gamer.   I got involved in the Scum community forums and pages, keeping up with the Dev's work and progress on 0.8.  They went as far as including the community and reaching out, getting polls, consensus of which models looked best for the Base Building, etc.  That added A LOT of hype to the upcoming 0.8 release.  Advertised farming, implied we would be getting 2 modular vehicles(car and a truck), implied animal taming \"might\" happen with the 0.8 release, boasted the Nuclear Power Plant POI and it's new features VERY HEAVILY.  In fact that was the main thing they seemed to be pushing with the new update and not so much the game changing mechanics of modular vehicles, base building, farming, etc.  Everybody was H-Y-P-E-D.  I'm emphasize that because the dev's and community admin's pushed this 0.8 update like it was the new flavor of the day and it was going to CHANGE SCUM YET AGAIN!  and FOR THE BETTER!  right?.....right?....bueller?.....\n\nThen D day happened.....0.8 dropped a nuclear BOMB on the ENTIRE community..and NOT IN A GOOD WAY EITHER!!!!!!!\n\nLet's run a few things that did and didn't happen with the 0.8 release.\n\nWe got the nuclear power plant poi and the features with that.  STOP.  This is the only GOOD thing I've seen added to this update in my honest opinion.  The Dev's put ALL their eggs in one basket with this added location.  It came out AMAZING....but then...they wanted to mess it up with HOTFIXES.  So now you can't run in a hazmat suit, hazmat lockers and medical lockers with phoenix tears can no longer be forced, you have to actually pick them now, after burning through 6 40/40 use screwdrivers and not unlocking a single one ive said screw it.  screw that poi, screw the issues with radiation and screw that POI.  I'll just avoid that entire area the rest of my life now because they've made it too much of a pain in the ass to visit regularly that it's not even beneficial as far as loot goes so other than my initial one time there in single player spawning my own gear to get in, I won't be back anytime soon.\n\nOther 0.8 surprises and changes:\n\nAnimal Taming - NO\nSCAR - NO\nFarming - BROKEN,  I had a 25 plot planter on a 10x Max loot server,  out of the 25 plants(cherries, potatoes, tomatoes, garlic, apples.  It took me several days to get them to be \"ripe\" and even then, total items collected over several days and COUNTLESS searching after restarts and loot respawning  (5 potatoes, 3 garlic).  That's it.  Never got an apple, or cherry, or tomato, and then they DIED.  No point in farming til u can actually get produce off your plants.  Otherwise, it's just for FUN!  CUZ GROWING PLANTS TO GET NOTHING IS FUN AMIRITE?!\nBase Building - Meh, semi-broken but with the amount of resources needed to upgrade each piece of your base individually, you'll spend days upgrading to just brick which can easily be destroyed with only 1 C4, and that's not even the last tier!  For perspective, I have a 2 story 3x3 base on the edge of the water with a very small yard by comparison to flag range, walled in.  I've made 3 runs to Brick Factory, Gravel yard, junkyard AND cement factory over 3 days and just NOW got my building to brick and have yet to upgrade the external walls beyond metal.  This is on a 10x MAX LOOT server.  Imagine trying to upgrade your base on a low loot or hell.....even a vanilla server.\nCars - Well let's see.  We had 3 diff types of planes, 2 diff types of boats, 2 diff types of bicycles, several types of motorcycles,  1 quad(four wheeler), an suv, a pickup truck, and a tractor...with diff color variants of the quad, motorcycles, pickups and suvs during 0.75.  They removed EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE FOR THE UPDATE... with 0.8 we didnt even get the truck, we only got a half broken red dinky janky \"wolfwagon\" hatchback that for the last month has been nothing but a pain in the ass for players.  Glitching, random despawning through the map, flipping the car on its side and roof with the only way to fix is either RAM it with another car or have somebody throw their body into your tires.....oh...but you have to STAY in your vehicle until that happens otherwise the car is dead in its tracks and you cant move it once you exit.  So if you get stuck, unless an admin, or another player decides to help you.  You're f*cked.   Oh but we also got a boat too still, which likes to disappear randomly and people could still steal it for weeks after the update even if it was locked.   Oh, and let's not forget to mention the dev's have HARD CODED a 100 VEHICLE limit per SERVER map, so if an admin spawns car 101, the oldest one despawns off the map....hence why most of your cars are despawning randomly...that or theyre falling through the map still.  \n\nThe SCUM Community had a meltdown.  We still are in fact.  Tomislav and the rest of the dev's don't appear to give 2 sh*ts anymore because NEWSFLASH:  JAGEX NOW owns Gamepires.  Yup...you read that right.  The company who bought Runescape and monitized it to Micro TX hell.  Every hotfix since the 0.8 update has only removed bugs that benefit players and nothing to fix the actual issues with the major issues players are experiencing.\n\nServer restart times:   Prior to 0.8, the server I play on was doing 2 hour restart times.  Restarts would take 2 minutes before being able to relog back in.  Now....it's 10 minutes and we can't even get 30 minutes into a restart before everybody starts rubberbanding and lagging on a 70/70 server.\n\nI get that it's in OpEn BeTa however, you can look up in the release date....2018....5 f*cking years almost and they haven't hit 1.0 yet.  It's almost as if they dragged their feet long enough waiting for a company like JAGEX to acquire them.  \n\nOne of the problems the community is facing now is suppression of our outrage.  Any forum(Discord, FB, Reddit, etc) that has community input are deleting NEGATIVE comments and REVIEWS about this game and update that players are making to try and HIDE the fact that this game is a hot pile of trash right now.  They're protecting the Dev's and don't want bad publicity on a major FAILED update.  \n\nThis game has a lot of potential and before the 0.8 update, was extremely fun to play.  I advise anybody looking to purchase this game right now.  DON'T.  Don't support these dev's right now because they def are coming across like they aren't listening or supporting the community right now.  Wait til 0.9...Hell wait til 1.0 and see how good or bad JAGEX makes it before buying, the price might go up 10 or 20 bucks but you'd be happier with your purchase THEN, than the feeling of wasting 35 bucks you'd be spending NOW on a broken game.  Dev's need to stop going out and drinking all the time, posting pics on social media of their shenanigans and get to fixing their product.  Hell, I'd have much more respect for them right now if they were to roll back to 0.75 and apologize to the community for this trainwreck rather than the current catastrophe that's occurring with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1671370175, "timestamp_updated": 1671370175, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1098, "votes_funny": 41, "weighted_vote_score": "0.917954742908477783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44508080": {"recommendationid": "44508080", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972699165", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 154579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3129, "last_played": 1706908627}, "language": "english", "review": "There is one thing you MUST know before buying this game.\nIt is a survival game.

There is a learning curve but I always am here to help noobs become pro. I was a server admin on some major servers and helped develop some hardcore PvE Survival Servers. Not the real premise, just some insight on this review. This game allows PvE and PvP so you can choose your play style. From where it began this game just gets less buggy and more amazing as it grows. Traders are new... allows growth at a faster pace than before. But onto the game. The combat is determined by individual servers. You can snipe from a distant hill, stalk players to their base, squad up and grow a killing team with all different attributes.\n\nThe map is beautiful, and I still don't have it down with almost 1,000 hours in game. This is the only game I've seen with a rolling weather system (wind picks up before a storm, clouds turn dark closer storm gets) and its my favorite \"show off\" factor. Sunsets/Rise are gorgeous.\n\nVehicles, planes, motorcycles, bikes, boats and bases. Build whatever you want, and craft pretty much anything with the right skills. Cities, towns, bunkers, vineyards, racetracks, quarries, hunter camps, airports, police stations, lighthouses, and docks are hand crafted beautifully. There are a ton more locations but from the freezing mountains down to the desert plains, it doesn't cease to amaze. You can hunt wolves, boar, deer, horses, bears and of course humans. Honestly I don't get how anyone can skip on this. Go fishing and then search an abandoned ship wreck. Go visit a castle in the mountains or hit the club.\n\nWithout the community Scum wouldn't be Scum. When you join a server, maybe you open a restaurant. Admins will host races and scavenger hunts. Some develop their own lore. Train new people to love the game like me. Collect every odd item. Have the biggest baddest squad, maybe the richest. I cant even begin to explain this game in one review. Just give it a go, but really dive into the game as a whole before knocking it.\n\nDISCLAIMER: You will die. You will blow up your car. You will lose it all at some point. It is the point.\nCollect backup gear, meet cool people, plan ahead and relax.

Looking forward to the addition of future vehicles!\n\n-----------------------------\n\nIf you're checking out the reviews, you're intrigued. I just have to write a review for this game - it is by far the most hours I've played since WoW or UO, although this is a totally different type of game.  I started playing with version 0.7, so I can't speak to earlier releases.  \n\nThe aspect that pops immediately to mind is the amount of detail.  The most recent example is when found myself running across a bridge and when my feet hit an expansion joint the footfall sound became metallic for those steps that landed on them.\n\nI'd recommend playing on a low population Official server first.  Mess around.  Learn the systems.  Kill puppets, get loot.  Get killed by a bear, start all over or run back to where you were.  Have fun.  Build a base, maybe get raided.  Start looking for information on YouTube.\n\nGet better, find a car.  Open up the map.  Kill your whole squad by learning that a shortcut through a field ends in a crash into a creek and both cars explode.  Find another car.  Start looting more difficult POIs.  Dodge mechs to try to get a plane.  fall off the plane just as you're about to take off.  Strip off all your items so you don't drown.  Repeatedly jump back in and recover your items one at a time, still dodging mechs.  Finally get in the plane, get blown up by mechs.  Repeat.  Finally successful take off.  Try to land.  Planes are made of paper.  Die.\n\nGo to outpost to sell loot.  Other players steal car.  Players harass you.  Set up squad mates to shoot harassers when driving on way out of safe zone.  Die, but your squad mates got the a-holes.\n\nJoin events.  MMA fighting ring, laugh while your squaddies beat the crap out of you without ramifications.  Just good natured fun.\n\nDie when wolves clip through your base walls.   Hit the most perfect Dukes of Hazzard jump in your truck doing 155kph.  Which gun works best for you?  Where's the best place to get loot?  Oh, crap there's players at your favorite loot spot.  Die.  lose everything, but you have learned to have spares buried all over the map.\n\nYou missed a beeper at the gas station.  Die.  Respawn.  Get truck back before someone else.  Found another vehicle! OMG it's the police car! Carrying gas/battery/repair kit/lock.  Score.\n\nDouble dip at server resets.  Player walks in on you while lockpicking.  Shoot them in the face, but you've got a C4 now.  Where's my tourniquet!!! \n\nFind the a-holes base that crapped on your windshield.  Metal detector.  Find mines.  What do we need to blow down the wall?  Can't figure out lockpicking well enough to get through their doors.  Here they are - contested drop.  Shootout.\n\nDrive through town, shots fired.  Flat tire.  Gun fight.  Fix flat tires.  Loot.  Drive away.\n\nSomeone has the seaplane.  Find boat.  Spend two days searching entire coastline.  Find plane.  Destroy it.  Haha!  Respawn, plane is mine now.\n\nGo back to base - squad that had the plane must have found it.  Everything's looted.  Hop on remaining vehicle, go to Army camp to try to start recovering.  Drive back by base, oh crap they're back.  4v1.  Dead before you can even drive past.\n\nRespawn.

Most of them from people with only a couple of hours in game if that, complaining about the game just because they can not do something or don't know how to do something in game therefore \"the game is bad\" and \"don't buy it\". So instead of going to the Scum discussions section literally right here in Steam and asking \"Hi, I can not work out how to patch a wound\" where there are more than enough 1000 hr+ players monitoring the posts and providing help for (particularly new) players and not to mention a number of Developers from Gamepires who are in the discussion everyday answering questions, instead of writing just 11 words and getting the answer \"you can find rags scattered around the map or you can cut up any piece of clothing and make a rag to patch your wounds\" within minutes, you spend 10 times as long writing a negative review about the game, telling people \"the game is no good\" and \"not to buy it.\" Think about it. Pretty well all the negative reviews relate to someone just not knowing that they \"can\" do something in game or simply don't know how to do it. Ask if you don't know, people are more than willing to help.", "timestamp_created": 1686969548, "timestamp_updated": 1686969548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 239, "votes_funny": 39, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90120851993560791", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49593822": {"recommendationid": "49593822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118088710", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7849, "last_played": 1552743637}, "language": "english", "review": "Just to preface this review, I have bought and played every \"survival game\" for the last like 5 years. I've been a server owner, modder, and clan owner on a myriad of survival games. \n\nThat being said, this game is headed downhill fast. And it is not due to a lack of effort on the Devs part, they are doing a great job. I think the biggest issue this game has is direction. You need to pick right now what kind of game you are going to be. This game has all the mechanics and structure to be a great survival game, but it like all others before it is going down the dark path to being PVP centered. You can't stop PVP, but you can design in a way that makes it not break the game, and make all of the other great features irrelevant. \n\nNow all you have is groups of people running around the server killing everyone and running the bunkers so that it's damn near impossible to get any good loot unless you are running with a crew. The PVP is a joke as well, you and the other players chop and glitch and disappear entirely. And the PVP wouldn't be so bad if you could freely respawn somewhere, grab a weapon and get back in the fight. But you can't in this game. Dying means hours of running and looting just to scrap together enough gear to try again. Only to encounter another group of fully geared guys with sniper rifles hitting, and I'm not joking I can send you the video on this.. 1500m killshots. 1500m Killshots. What kind of survival game needs the ability to make 1500m killshots? And to add to the frustration, you have to BUY a respawn. So then you are out of fame points, cant do anything but random spawn and frantically loot again as you run AGAIN back to your base, then run AGAIN to a bunker or some high loot area, only to be killed by some douche that logs off in the bunker and shoots you in the back when he spawns in. There is so much broken gameplay with this game, and so many things that contradict each other it is unreal. Like the metabolism and levels.. I never look at that, ever. There is this huge part of the game, and it's a major part in a survival game that hasn't been done like this before. But it is rendered completely useless by the fact that people don't live long enough to even worry about it. Other than eating or drinking whatever random thing I had on me at the time, I never had a need to look at it any further. \n\nFarming? So you're telling me that in a survival game, where people are trying to scrape up everything around them to survive there is no farming? No gathering of wood and stone to build with? No building? And I know this is on the roadmap, but I think it needs to be made a higher priority. The majority of players on the server are solo or small groups that need a place to store their stuff, securely. This lockpicking thing is another issue. Whats the point of scrounging all this shit together in a base after spending 100's of fame points, that aren't exactly easy to come by, just to have your stuff lockpicked by another crew. Is that what surviving is about? Breaking into your neighbors house to take stuff that you don't even need? Like 6 man groups are running around lockpicking everyones houses and taking their guns and ammo. They don't need it, they have more than they could ever use. And then what is the solo suppose to do, start over at 0 and spend MORE fame points to board up the same house, or another one, just for it to happen again?\n\nCars - The clans control the cars. If you have one, they will take it. There is no way to lock them up, and very few buildings that you can actually store them in. And if you do, it will cost you hundreds of fame points. And even then, it can be easily lockpicked and stolen. Or you hit a couple trees with it due to the ridiculous handling and squirrely back end, and it blows up. Want to take it somewhere? Well you can, but when you get out you can't lock it. And people will generally follow you and take it. Cars should spawn all over the place, broken and in need of repair. They should require parts and fuel to run. You should have to gather these things up and fix the car to get it on the road. It should have keys that you can make for it. \nBroken.\n\nAnimals - You can't pack out a decent amount of meat after you kill an animal. Sure you can't pack out a whole boar in real life, but you could take say a shoulder or side of meat and throw it on your back. Then when you are back at your camp cut it up. Also why is there not just a grill I can make out of metal and place over a fire to cook meat on. I can get to the point where I have full military gear and weapons, but I am still putting meat on sticks to cook it?\n\nThere is all this opportunity for great immersion into a spectacular survival world but it is being quickly overshadowed by PVP and base raiding. It forces people to just give up and never come back. I'm not saying cut the PVP out completely, but at least find a way to balance it. Rust has tons of pvp, but you can spawn back in 1 of 10 sleeping bags placed anywhere in the world. Dying doesn't cost you anything, and you can have a base that isn't as easily raided to put guns in so you can get back in the fight. No looking around for clothes to hold gear in, as you have an inventory and everything takes 1 slot. They chose the PVP path, and the survival aspect is almost non-existent. If people want to battle royale let them play PUBG. That is not why I bought this game, and it is not what was promised when this all started. \n\nMake it about survival! Traps around your house, fishing, trapping game, building a place to call your own, picking herbs, making medicine, crafting things that actually have a purpose. Survival should mean more than surviving going in to a high loot area and not getting shot by another player. \n\nBalance PVP - You could make it so that if a player kills another player, the drone follows them around for a set amount of time showing their location to everyone or have a humanity system where they get negative humanity for killing another player and then loop something else into that like a bounty system. Random respawns should be free, but after 1 make it have like a 5 minute timer so people can't abuse it to travel around the map. Take out the high end snipers.. why why would you need that in a survival game? Balance the guns damage and armor rates. I got 1 shot full health, full military gear with a shotgun from 20 feet away, come on now. More hunting guns, less military grade weapons. After all, in a survival scenario that's what you would find more lying around hunting rifles, shotguns, and pistols. \n\nStop focusing on putting more crap into the game, and fix the game that you already have.  Every item, feature, tweak you do to the game should be in line with wanting to push the game in a certain direction. Right now it seems like the dev team doesn't have a clear end game goal of where they want to be, and are just putting in things to try and get people to stay interested in the game with no regard to how it effects the overall gameplay. Or if at the end when everything is finished, it will even be the game we all paid our money for. Please. Please don't be the next Rust, or Arma. We have those already, and they are cancerous PVP games with terrible communities and aggravating play styles. Get a clear picture of what the final product is going to be, and stick with it. Number one because if you are just going to keep going this direction and end up just another PVP game, then people deserve to know now. Don't keep taking people's money and touting this game as a survival game with all these great survival features, only to produce a game that is just another PVP killing field. \n\nOverall this game has great potential, and the devs have done an amazing job so far. But I think that they need to pick a side and stick with it if they are going to be successful. If not then it will turn into another H1Z1, Miscreated, or Subsistence.

Most of the things you have mentioned are not in their final form so to speak, there is a lot of things that we intend to rework to make it better and less clunky like shooting and melee combat among other things. \n\nWith regards to PvP the further we get into development there is going to be less and less military loot just in the open world so you will rarely have actual gunfights cause guns will be a premium item to obtain later on. And as ThatWallyGuy mentioned this is primarily a prison survival show not just a barebones survival game. We have a clear endgame that we want to reach and we are slowly but surely inching our way towards that goal. \n\nThere is so much more to be fleshed out in this game, it is a passion project so we are trying to get everything right before we are satisfied.

Constantly need to search for how to do this and that. Tutorial is broken and incomplete)\n- Extremely realistic (which is good but it can be really frustrating and boring at times)\n- Laggy in big cities or during heavy rain\n- Buildings are repetitive (can be expected of a big world but would be nice if they add more unique buildings)\n- Crafting layout confusing and can't be searched\n\n3) What can be changed/added\n\n- SP is boring. Build up my defenses but no risk of attack at all. Would nice to have roaming hordes, or bandits. Someone to set off my alarms and traps or test my defenses. \n- Emotional health. Be the first game to account for player happiness. Like playing music, eating nice food, reading a book, catching your first fish, completing a big build will make the player happy. Things like recent death, death to a teammate, hungry, cold/wet makes player unhappy. Happiness affects speed and performance. No game has come close to being so realistic. Why not go for it? \n- Binoculars. I know maybe because of performance it's hard to zoom but would be cool\n- Animal traps. I think you guys have tried this but it would be fun\n- Treasure maps. SP is boring without goals. But imagine if during scavenging you come across someone's diary that has notes about where they hid their treasure, or maps to secret entrance to bunkers or tunnel\n- Trader. I know it's not realistic for a trader to buy everything that you want to sell, but would be cool to have an economy. \n- Inventory system. Something like SHIFT click moves all of the same type. Also having your storage open you can double click for it to store directly. \n- Looting shortcuts. A hotkey for \"pick up\" or \"pick up everything\"\n- Lots of random events. For example moving herds of deer, in SP have random dead bodies with loot like a crashed car, chopping down a tree sometimes you get a bird's nest with eggs, sometimes you get nuts/fruit....\n- Middle strength AI enemies. Right now it's either crazy mechs or weakish puppets. Random patrols of reasonably killable mini mechs or mercs. Right now no one dares to attack mechs. But give us something to shoot at. \n\nI was so excited when I bought the game. But the first 4-5 hours I hated the game. It was so frustratingly hard and the tutorial didn't help at all. The game has it's logic but the learning curve is steep. Then I started to learn and enjoyed the game more and more. Then I got my car, tonnes of food, a raft, and it seems I ran out of stuff to do. Looting became a chore and repetitive. Life in SCUM became boring. I tried giving myself tasks to make it interesting. Right now I still like the game but it can be so much better. The devs took on a tough route making it a super realistic game which I appreciate. But with that it can be boring and hard. I think they can add so many things to make it more fun but yet keep the integrity of the game. I hope they do.

Thirdly it is not another battle royal clone. It's more like a DayZ with a larger focus on survival (e.g. body stats; minerals & vitamins) plus some enemy [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502504173]mechs[/url] in addition to the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502498973]zombies[/url]. SCUM is an open island survival game set in a near future. The idea with the prisoner island survival show is good, but has to be expanded as well as the max player count of 64 per server. The map is really big and as there aren't 200 players on each island the devs put in a special zone for DM/TDM, which is at least a start for now. What you get is a lot of exploring, searching, looting, crafting, figuring stuff out and some killing besides the pooping - in a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1501470981]beautiful looking[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502499065]shaped world[/url]. In total Scum feels like a more accessible and more advanced DayZ in almost every way, especially when compared to its' early access release. For an alpha, the state of the game is really good(!), also compared to a lot of other early access titles I played on their release - don't belive the nitpickers. Hopefully SCUM will develop in terms of keeping the excitement after there's nothing left to explore (see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/513710/discussions/0/1737715419889405829/]planned features[/url])?!

Yesterday that finally happened and I have to say that on the whole I am very pleasantly surprised!\n\nI am a massive fan of survival games, even if I have become a bit fatigued with the constant stream of them over the last five years or so. But nevertheless, when Scum went live yesterday, I managed to get in just over 6 hours of gaming on it, both offline/single player and online with friends. I will say this review is perhaps a little premature in that respect as there\u2019s still so much for me to find out about the game \u2013 actually that\u2019s the first thing to note, there is  a LOT of content and a lot of game for an Early Access title . Much more than I expected and although there are bugs and issues (Early Access!), there\u2019s actually a lot less than I expected.\n\nThings that have impressed me so far:\n-\tSingle player mode/standalone (great way for players to learn and to sandbox)\n-\tSmooth gameplay. The game runs relatively smoothly and very well even on my older system! There is some kind of memory leak bug that leads to FPS drops the longer you play presently but I expect that fixed soon. A quick game restart sorts it out anyway.\n-\tLots of servers! Official regional servers are great!\n-\tAtmosphere and tone (It perfectly recaptures and represents the old Day Z feel but also adds some humour to it in places)\n-\tContent (Theres lots of loot and weapon and gear)\n-\tBody/Metabolism systems (Theres already a  lot of stuff in there in relation to the way your characters body works, but if you\u2019re no into all that you can easily play without paying too much attention to it)\n-\tMap (The map is a good size considering these no vehicles yet \u2013 big enough to explore and get space, yet also reasonably spaced to easily find friends and get where you want to be relatively quickly. It also looks lovely!)\n-\tHand to hand combat is pretty good but does need some further refinement\n-\tInventory system (very similar to Arma2/Escape from tarkov!)\n-\tAI (enough AI antagonists to keep you on your toes and despite bugs like warping, pathing, not being able to open doors etc. they\u2019re still a genuine threat)\n-\tCrafting (this is where the game excels, survivalists will cream themselves over this!)\n-\tThere is a  match system in game that I admittedly haven\u2019t used yet but looks good!\n\n\n\nBad things \n-\tThere are bugs and glitches, frustrating t times true. If this pisses you off, maybe wait to play till a few versions in.\n-\tA bit early to moan but no instant join on friends for multiplayer an the sever browser system isn\u2019t working very well (at time of writing) as its difficult to find friends. \n\n\nOverall, this is everything Day Z should have been. Is it too late though? Nah, it\u2019s an amazing game with so much potential. The devs have delivered a game Early Access that already knocks the socks off most rival games in the genre. Its exciting to think of how good this could actually be 6-12 months down the line! So far I\u2019d say its more than worth the money!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1535623140, "timestamp_updated": 1535623140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 175, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score":

But the time has come. There are 5 of us with over 1500 hours each and we always enjoyed the mechanics and game play of having to survive or die in different situation. The players you meet on the server are 90% of the time amazing.  We seen cars flying threw the air blowing up. Randomly falling into the ground into no man lands. Animals flying in the sky. Stuck in multiple places and having to commit suicide. Losing magazines when reloading. Traders losing items. Vehicles stuck on rocks and logs and hitting \"push\" for hours.  You name it we seen it, we understand its development and we keep coming back no matter how many or how bad the game issues are.  But the main issue is and will always be the hackers on official servers.  After every update or game sale the population increases on servers the hackers come out.  We try to build a base after every update just to see if the issues are fixed. We have always built up to the max at each update, with multiple doors with gold locks, advanced lock protections, 100s of bombs around. Everything the game is and will become is meaningless until the hacks and cheats are addressed.  In one day hackers come and pick locks, remove bombs and wipe out everything inside. How do we know its hackers? Happens to all the players bases on the whole server during the low population hours on server. Just recently today on US East Server 7 the hackers ran wild on multiple squads bases. Our base over 100 bombs - 1 kill.  Took off all the locks on every door and even the doors that had locks that went to same location inside base they removed just to leave the base with no locks.  Before you say we are crying and babies.  We have been raided the correct way multiple times before of the years of playing and its part of the game and enjoyable. As well as knowing the other squad put in work to get inside.  We will continue to play as always, but its back to pointless burying loot and hiding vehicles in bushes.So back to the recommend or not....I would say no if you cant handle cheaters and knowing 1/2 the game play (building/bases) is worthless.  BTW dont waste time or effort on league servers.  When others block the traders its ok.

Also the visual, to most extend, are astonishing.\n\nWhat makes the game SUCK, is that after nearly 2 Y E A R S of development, we still got bugs where suddenly items, or even your gun will randomly disappear ??

Speed hacks, X-Ray, ... you name it. And Easy-Anti-Cheat doesn't do SH*T!\nEven on private servers, cheaters are almost free to do as they please, because it's so difficult to get hard proof of their cheating.\n\nFrankly, I'm not alone with my opinion. More and more long time players like me get frustrated with that issue.

If you don't get back in time, goodbye gear/loots. On default loot spawn rate, that hurts bad. All +20hrs of previous looting...poof...feels like wasted time.\nWhen you die single player, I believe it only leaves your last body and the previous death disappears. So if you die again before looting the first body...oof.\n\nPros:\n1. I super enjoy the open world survival aspect. On foot the map is humungous and can take about 30min(irl) of driving to cross entire map by car. And the scenery is beautiful..mostly. \n2. The first time I almost died but killed a bear, chopped him up, cooked him, and ate him, I felt my balls drop.\n3. I like the inventory system the most. The inventory GUI just makes so much sense. The quick access slots make sense. Having to make decisions because of space or weight and being too 'far' from base storage to 'come back later'. Good times.\n   The GUI for adding items to guns like clips, scopes, etc. makes sense. Stacking/Adding ammo to clips makes sense.\n4. The 2nd thing I like are the different viewing angles based on gun/bow, based on an object in hand, based on crouching/prone, there is 'some' peeking, 3rd person/1st person for all the above as well. Well done and thank you for them.\n5. Skill leveling. I totally dig it but some skills level too quickly or too slowly.\n6. Your character can literally workout to get stronger. Load up your backpack with a log while also carrying a log, etc. and run. Burns alot of calories but starts turning you into chad mcbeefcakes which makes brawling/melee more fun.\n7. The amount of material required for crafting items seems good.\n    The cabins are predefined unlike building in rust. So fences/traps are depended on more than some weird half wall builds to slow down C4. You can also lock some doors inside towns to claim a room/respawn point.\n    I wish I had known about the improvised wheelbarrow sooner. Makes building a cabin/base much easier. Throw all the logs in it and haul it around instead of carrying 1 log at a time.\n8. You can basically kill everything with a crossbow headshot including heavily geared players. Silliest thing. That being said, handgun/rifle points level quickly with so many puppets.\n9. Scavenging, Hunting, Fishing, Cooking, Driving.\n\nCons:\n1. The spawn system is wonky. ie animals make sounds, and if you are listening you will know where they are and either avoid or kill them. But they can spawn within feet of you, begin their noises and sometimes its right next to you! Like they spawn nearby and are suddenly aware of your presence and attack you. Most of the time they spawn correctly and I can see or hear them nearby but far enough to react. (I've watched animals spawn in my view, puppets too!)\n2. I had to turn off motion blur because it made my cabin and only the cabin look like a warpdrive starfield.\n3. Cooking is ok but the kitchen pot/pan needs to be craftable and not a world spawn object. There was a weird workaround to only eat 9/10 of the food then unmake the food to keep the pot, but that was patched. Otherwise I would cook more.\n4. There is no way to 'charge' a car battery you find in the open but the phone batteries are rechargable. *shrugs*\n5. There are silencers for everything but shottys(really? they exist irl). I guess you don't really care about noise if you pull out a shotty....till it jams....a few times...like...enough times to no longer trust them -__-\n6. Puppets ragdoll 2-4ft in different directions when knocked down, but the direction they fall makes no sense. Unlike when they die and go limp. Always hilarious to watch a puppet jump over a fence and immediately eat dirt on the other side and die. Never gets old.\n7. There's no way to sharpen knives. There is a sharpening stone but its such a rare loot spawn that I hate using it unless its for a 'rare' knife. I just pick up extra knives while I'm out. Or rather, I keep all of the ones I find once I have storage setup.\n8. I can't add water into 2L Cola bottles even when they are empty\n9. Military water canteens decay way too fast to be useful other than emptying them into my water bottle and tossing.\n10. You can pull items from your backpack as quickly as if it were on shoulders. So I can throw a sword and shotty in my backpack and whip it out just as fast as if it were already on my shoulder? Seems silly. Not a con? Maybe? When you can fast swap between 5-7 loaded guns? Maybe?\n\nCurrent wishlist for single player game:\n1. The loot spawn rate is way too low for single player and PVP. Like, what does a normal start/loot/kill/run look like on a PVP server? ie everytime you die you fall further behind while the other guy gets your loot.\n   Spawn, make stone knife, cut bushes, make rope, make stone axe, cutdown tree, make club, make rope, run to closest town, kill puppet, cut their clothes into rags, make improvised backpack, chop puppet, put flesh into backpack, make quiver, kill another puppet, cut clothes into rags, make crossbow, make stonehead arrows, find chicken coups or hay, get feathers, make crossbow arrows, peak thru windows for backpack otherwise hit gas station or grocery store for food, find change of clothes and make improvised sword, start hitting bunkers/warehouses/airport for loot(assuming you already have a cabin/storage somewhere). This process can take 2-3days(8-12hrs irl, who wants to do that again for another 8-12hrs only to get wiped again?), while other ppl are trying to murder you, for the loots. Cuz who wants to be that guy at the top of the leader board >_> Rinse/repeat. Unless...you single player or raid the airport/military w/friends.\n3. A trailer or some way to tow 1quad or 2bikes. My goodness quads are fun and breaks my heart when I drive by one in my truck...and no way jumpstart it or take home... :(\n4. Some NPC's living in towns 'Fallout' style. Maybe on a 1-5 scale, 1 insta kill, 2 suspicious, 3 neutral, 4 good standing, 5 trusted. And maybe only be able to trade at 4 or 5. Actual use for the cash and opportunities for trade, chop wood, animal skins, fish, etc. And towns ppl may have special requests which increases your standing and loot quality with them.\n   But NPC's are getting sick. If you interact with or enter a sick person's house without a medical mask, you can get sick/nasua/vomiting for 1-2days in game.\n   If you loot an NPC house, have a timer indicating the NPC will discover your identity in x seconds(Wearing a mask increases the timer). Making loud noises(indication of a struggle) other NPC's come looking to protect. Once discovered, if they live they will tell others in town and all NPC's in that little town will have a 1 towards you.\n5. Different sized food containers after cooking(slows decay?)? Or does everybody just run around with random cooked steaks in their backpack? xD\n6. The amount of food prepared/added should somehow equal the portions of food in the pot. Right now the pot takes up tons of space but only gives 10 portions.\n7. I wish I could craft multiples instead of 1 item per craft. Like if I can craft 5, then hold down the craft button to chose upto 5.\n8. The town and buildings feel like dejavu. Overly copy/pasted textures and frames. I get lost because I think I'm in this one town but...its slightly different. I survive only because of the map and compass...if I had to use land markers and city layouts, I'd be screwed.\n9. The map fills in as I explore that area. I think I avoid some areas only because I have a filled in map.\n10. Waiting for 1.0 so the mod community can jump in with new maps, building textures, NPC's, etc. I'm stoked because this game has good bones.", "timestamp_created": 1645003622, "timestamp_updated": 1645022674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.844258010387420654", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134925418": {"recommendationid": "134925418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312993395", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 178492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 142456, "last_played": 1698811506}, "language": "english", "review": "The death of a once great game.

Today, I got one-shot killed 3 times in a row.  First shot I was thinking, okay, I got sniped in head with something big, like a .50 cal.  I respawn in, approach town at night from different direction and while in woods approaching town where first kill happened, I get one shot again while I was in bushes and lots of trees.\n\nOkay, maybe they saw me..  fine.  I respawn in same sector, am free falling in air with no parachute deployed.  It is night, I see a flash like an explosion in the woods while I am falling and I get instantly killed in the air...

If you are on the fence because the game is in Early Access all signs point to jumping over that fence and joining us on the island for some fun.\n\n1) Complex systems:  The systems developed in SCUM have been put through the ringer by the devs, contacts the devs have made for accuracy, and also the players that have already purchased the game.  These are not simple systems that were rushed through production, they are detailed.  When shooting an arrow the game takes into account arrow rotation, shows arrow bounce/bend, and several other factors.  The metabolism system is the most detailed that I've seen and you can make your character get fatter, thinner, etc. based off how well you \"play the metabolism game\".\n\nIf that sounds like it's too complex for you then no worries, you can mostly ignore the details once you have figured out(or looked up) the way to maintain or properly utilize the systems and just stick to a routine.  The devs have put a ton of love into the game so it can be enjoyed by all sorts of fans.\n\n2) Progress:  Progress has never stopped.  Sometimes it seems slow, sometimes you don't get the progress you want, but it is always constant.  This is not a game that the devs are going to abandon.  You can rest assured that the devs will give you some content updates periodically.\n\n3) Base Building:  The map and base building seems to compliment one another.  Resources respawn at a rate that allows you to maintain a small outpost that is well hidden or building a impenetrable fortress out in the open for all to know your might.  Oh, you can also reinforce buildings and make that your home if you like.\n\n4) Feedback:  The devs do listen.  Sometimes they listen to a group you disagree with but they do listen and their changes and updates are based off first the direction they want to go and second the groups that have been making the most noise recently.  The community has been clamoring for stability so that is what they have been working on the most with each update they release and things have been getting better.  The community has been consistent about wanting more single player content so the devs have been working on that as well.  Most recently a change the devs put in was widely disliked and they reversed it immediately.  As long as the desires of the community don't oppose the vision these devs have then its very likely they will try to work it in.\n\nThere's much I can say both positive and negative about this game but overall it is a worthwhile purchase.  If you're still on the fence after the above consider this(dated: 12/12/2019) after the winter sale on Steam the price will be increasing.  Now is the time to buy to get the best possible deal, the devs will keep adding more great content as they move closer to full release and the price will more than likely increase at least a couple times along the way.", "timestamp_created": 1577042956, "timestamp_updated": 1577042956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833780169486999512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1578996451, "developer_response": "Thank you for the very extensive review Alandauron!

Reasons why I say this:\n[list][*]They add a description and tags on the game's Store page for Single Player, Survival, and Co-Op.  None of these things have real content, either as in-game systems or valid gameplay modes (i.e. there's nothing to do in either SP or Co-Op beyond finding gear, killing AI 'puppets', or building a base which has no purpose).\n[*]Having watched their team since mid-2019, I've seen them repeatedly promise things like a working metabolism system.  \"It's being worked on, and will be here in a few months\".  That statement was in 2019, and we're well into 2021 now with no working metabolism in sight.\n[*]Single Player has zero goals or reasons to play it other than as a \"primer to figure the game out for when you play PvP later\".  It has 'puppets' (AI controlled zombies), that all use the same combat AI.  That's it, other than random animals and aim-bot Mechs (that aren't killable and don't add to gameplay).  No NPCs, no missions, no story, no goals of any kind.  Co-Op is exactly the same.  Beyond the first ~10-15 hours, there's nothing to do except explore or build (for no reason).\n[*]\"Fame points\" that you can use to help you out in the game are setup purely for PvP acquisition.  You can get some by raising your skills in SP, but after that you have to actually kill someone in PvP to get more.\n[*]They continually waste time adding in worthless items to the game.  Things like halloween masks, t-shirts, even socks for your willy (it's a guy thing)...  all manage to make it in before a core game mechanic like metabolism.[/list]\n\n\"Survival\" is a set of game systems working together to keep you on your toes and make sure your character lives.  It has nothing to do with combat or enemies, and those are the only things in SCUM that threaten you in any way.  For that reason, there is \"no survival in SCUM\".\n\nIf you read the game's patch notes (all the way from the original release), you'll note a distinct lack of additions for anything except PvP.  Even new items and areas are PvP-centric.  I played for many months on a Co-Op server, and there was jack-all to do.  Run around, collect some gear, kill a few animals, then sit on your arse waiting for the developers to give us non-PVP'ers something to do.  They of course, haven't, but make regular promises \"it's coming soon\".  They just added fishing, but of course metabolism still isn't working so there's little point to food of any kind.\n\nIf you want a fun game you can play with friends, there are plenty of others on Steam.  7DTD, Valheim, and so on.  If you want a competent development team, look elsewhere - Gamepires says one thing and does another.  And they love to ban people on their Steam forums who point out that the promises they make are going unfulfilled.\n\ntldr;  If all you want is battle-royale PvP, this might work for you.  If you want any game mode other than PvP, or a competent development team, definitely look at other games.  SCUM's store page is NOT an accurate description of the game [b]at all[/b], and the developers have been making promises and not living up to them for years now.  They've firmly taken the PvP-only route, leaving SP and Co-Op with virtually nothing to do.\n", "timestamp_created": 1617371622, "timestamp_updated": 1617371622, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 829, "votes_funny": 41, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830907166004180908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122766717": {"recommendationid": "122766717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041732572", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 16893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14773, "last_played": 1664841878}, "language": "english", "review": "The game itself isnt too bad, but if youre playing on any Official server then expect to have people cheat and literally walk through the walls of your base.

The issues I have with it are as follows:\n1. Getting randomly disconnected from servers.\n2. Basing and just hoarding loot (especially in clans. Literally seen them envelope whole towns with walls) people literally don't leave their bases as they can just hide and shoot people for gear when they go past... Nomad gameplay is dead as no one does it often at all.\n3. There is way too much loot even on vanilla and most of the time you don't need to even use the crafting system after the initial spawn. (Except mabye for a fire place)\n4. The game is not really a survival game anymore as the devs have just decided to create a rust like game. Honestly the fact that the traders are in the game now just means that instead of looting and scavenging for surplies to survive, you just sell and buy everything you need. What's the point of having a hunger bar and I thirst bar when you can literally never Starve or die of dehydration as it's so damn easy to keep them up. Food is everywhere ... Bushes, houses, on the floor, trader... Like damn it's more of a side thought at this point.\n5. You don't even need to boil water from rivers or springs as it's all the same \"fresh water\" even water found in bottles is always clean. \n6. This game is PVP based and has literally 0 PVE content in it. \n7. The game has a massive (like bigger than I have ever seen) identity crisis, as it's trying to take what made success for other games like rust, but just being a less polished and worsh version instead of sticking to the promises made on day 1. It's not hardcore survival as it's sold as, but a PVP gear fast and fight other players game with survival side elements in it.\n8. Raiding is a joke especially now with the traders. By far the easiest method of ruining someone's progress is to mass buy lock picks and screwdrivers and just walk through walls like nothing. Traders have made the game easy mode. Even rust is harder than this game now.\n9. The fame points should never have been used to respawn in map squares or randomly around the map, but as a currency to buy BASIC survival drops like in hunger games. Buy one and get random loot (mabye meds, or food, or a small tool/weapon.) But not to just teleport back into the map. If you die, then you should need to create a new character and randomly spawn back in like in day z. Nothing hardcore about infinite lives.\n10. Sound in genrleral is crazy bad. Like damn I heard a car driving around a town and then suddenly it went dead silent. It was like it had stopped around the corner or something. I showered the entire area and no car of player around. Sound desync is so bad I might cry \n11. The background noise of leaves rustling and wind blowing is on the same slider as player made sounds! If you want to hear footsteps, then be prepared for wind to ear \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f you. That's not even the worst part. The devs decided to make the background noises occasionally sound like a footstwp or sudden rustling of movement which just is the dumbest thing. It's so dam. Hard to tell what's another player or just the sound Scape messing with you. \n12. Hackers. They just a scum bags (pun intented) \n13. Again a hording issue. There are a limited amount of car spawns in the map and only the top clans have them. They can just visit every spawn point and just own them all. You can buy a car from the trader, but there is still a server cap for any amount that can exist at one time. Also f the trader system. Just makes every aspect of survival and self reliance pointless. Caters to the casual players and ruins it for the target audience.\nDecent game but just overall a shit show rn.

The fame system keeps everyone low and guns are too op compared to craftable stuff.  The only fun you can have is if you play on a server like noobland. This server tho is pay to win. \nMy major issues are as follows: \nBeds are expensive to spawn in, Why cant there just be a 300-500 second timer on beds. This will help encourage raid defense \nThe base building and raiding system is trash. Lock picking is incredibly easy now, and its just a matter of spamming and farming. Raiding with guns and explosive is just as bad. a wooden or metal wall with a window is 2-3k health, but a pallisade is 600-1k. if flags clip through a wall it can be destroyed. overtaking a flag for 24 hours after a raid is the stupidest idea ever. \nThe game supports Zergs. Skill points are there. U cant possibly have all good skills close to max. as a solo u need engineering maxed as well as survival, u cant even do that. there is no way u can do most features in the game without a group of 4. u need one driver, one builder, one sniper, one thief. and with those most players will have crappy camo and awarness and no gun skills.  \nThe new patches r trash. devs r just clickbaiting patches such as ghillies and rpks, but ghillies r hella rare, rpks r just aks. new ammo such as tracers r pointless. tire popping and batteries is a joke, although tire poppingis realistic, cars have alternators...PLEASE ADD NEW CONTENT, people want new zombies, new clothes, more custimization, more buildings.

But I will recommend it for some.\nI'll try and explain this briefly\nSo here's the thing, if you aren't into survival games, you probably wouldn't even be reading this review, but if you aren't familiar with survival games, you should probably go look into other games than this one not to scare you off, I recommend something easy to get to know like Rust. \nNow, to explain this to everyone else who don't know what the game is about, basically it's survival games taken to the \"extreme\" to be short. You have an excessive amount of options for maintaining your body and health. This includes vitamins, extensive cold/heat system and an very well done but also advanced weight system. I'll explain everything further in this review if this sounds interesting to you or if you're just bored. \nSo lets start off with the positive(these could also be seen as negatives, depending on how much you're into survival games)\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\nA very extensive health system. You have literally have 13 vitamin bars to see how many vitamins you have been ingesting through the food and drink you either find, hunt or grow yourself. Adding onto this, you also have 10 mineral bars to make sure you're getting all your minerals. This is just [b]SOME[/b] of the things you have to take care of about your own body. The whole games is almost built around the \"metabolism\" screen. You have to make sure you eat healthy, go for a run once in a while etc, otherwise you get fat and get the negative things that come with that. I really don't want to go into detail more about what this whole metabolism system is on about, you can go watch YouTube tutorials for that or try out the game. \n\nYou have a good variation in animals & enemies in my opinion. Boars, Cats, Wolfs, Bears, Sharks, Regular zombies, military zombies, suicide bomber zombies. Even robots! You can kill and eat basically any living thing in this game with the right tools, and regrets (looking at my cannibal homies)\n\nDetailed world. The map isn't randomized like many other survival games, and the devs made sure to fill this with detail. There is an abundance of things to discover. I personally haven't played the game that long, but from what I have seen, each small town feels different enough compared to the other ones to give you a fresh feeling. The big city was a huge game changer when me and my buddy had spent over 40 hours in the same area/areas, making a base and getting better and better gear etc. We went to the biggest city not expecting much, but darn were we surprised. The graphics are also really good for a survival game, I half expected something like Rust or Ark that has this sort of \"cartoonish\" style to it.\n\nIt's best with friends, and enemies. I only played a bit of co-op with my friend, and this was sort of boring since we never found any other players cause we played on an empty server. This wasn't the most fun experience, but, I feel like it was a good way to learn the game together with someone. If I had to learn these gameplay mechanics myself, I would most likely get frustrated. I can understand why the singleplayer mode is in this, and it is helpful for people who unfortunately don't have other friends to learn the gameplay mechanics with on a server. And it would most likely get frustrating going into a populated PVP server and ending up getting owned by seasoned players who take advantage of you not knowing the game. When all that is said, this game is perfect for PVP. As I will get into riiiight\n\nNow, gameplay. The shooting and weapon mechanics are extensive, not as extensive as in something like Tarkov, but it's very good. Bullet drop & travel, realistic ballistics (bullet penetration depending on material, weapon, ammo type etc), weapon degradation (I should state that basically everything in this game has degradation, bullets, food, scrap, clothing, everything). You might have a top notch condition shotgun all in perfect working order, but your weapon could still jam and f**k up your day if your bullets are in sh*t condition. This makes the game feel tense, cause anything could be the ruin of you at any time if you don't prepare extensively. Lemme tell you, having your rifle jam while there is a suicide zombie running towards you is [b]NOT[/b] something you want. And if you have a weapon that uses magazines then you will also have to manage their health. You'll have to reload magazines yourself before you can stick them in your weapon. Everything from aiming, weapon maintaining, running, weight carry etc all goes back to the previously mentioned metabolism system. Get your clothes wet? Well water weighs you down. That's straight up normal stuff you sometimes forget when playing survival games. Here, getting your backpack and all your clothes wet by going for a random or forced swim, or maybe an unlucky rain cloud hit you, this could all be the bane of your existence. You can only carry so much on your character, and it all depends on your metabolism, your strength, dexterity etc. So imagine you pack up as much as you can carry, you're already having a tough time just walking with all the stuff on you. And now a rain cloud comes, and you forgot your rain jacket. So now you just got maybe 30 kilograms of added water weight to your body. The main aspects this game wants you to remember is, prepare and maintain. This is why this game can be a really tough PVP game, cause everybody is on a struggle to keep themselves alive/in their best health. You can be a beast of a man, but you'll have the brain of a chicken. Or you can have a 900000IQ Reddit moderator brain, but you'll be as physically fit as a Reddit moderator. This all depends on how you choose to make your character to begin with, and how you choose to play. Intelligence affects a variety of things you'd expect, awareness, survival, engineering etc. Strength affects boxing, handguns, melee weapons etc. And then you also have dexterity and constitution. This can make this survival game almost RPG'ish. You can make a small shelter, and like in Rust, you can bury some storage chests if you have a shovel and want to live the rouge survivor style, where you have a small camp and stay in the forest hidden away. Or you can board up an existing house if you want to go that road. You can also, of course, build your own small - medium - big base of your own design. \n\nThis is where I'll end on the positives since this review is getting long enough as is. On to the cons.\n\n[h1] Cons/bugs [/h1]\n\nSome of these will vary in how much of a con they are depending on what you want from a survival game\nMedium to high learning curve. The whole metabolism part is just one of the things you'll need to learn to survive effectively in Scum. The PVP/PVE can get punishing as a result of the realism this game is trying to achieve.\nThere are of course bugs, first of all, the game is still in early access, so some things wont be working exactly as intended, I'll list a couple of bugs and issues I encountered in my as of writing this 58 hours of play time\n\n-Zombies and animals glitching through objects such as wall and surfaces. ( Had 2 Wolfs enter my base through the wall, as well as a bear. Also when we went to the main big city, we went to the sports hall and zombies started appearing up through the floor. The glitching through objects thing was varying in when and where it happened. I never saw zombies glitching through walls, and through the floor only happened to me in the sports hall )\n-A few things can feel unfinished, most likely due to the scope of this game. An example would be I had a very hard time finding a car battery that had any charge, and as far as I could find out there was no other way to charge a car battery without another car battery.\n\nThis is where I'll end my review as its already too long. But yea, pros pointed out in this review can also be seen as a con. Basically, it's DayZ.

It was advertised with complex metabolism mechanics that required you to eat many different things to survive and thrive, realistic ballistics system, realistic movement mechanics and a varied martial arts system. SCUM has instead been dev't to be a fort building PVP game with little emphasis on survival and now a game wide easy mode from a forgiving and casual NPC trader makes it even less about surviving as getting anything (gear, food, weapons, building supplies) is very easy. \n\nSo, another game with an identity crisis. The first year of SCUM was very problematic due to performance and lag issues, partly due to the devs choice to have only one locked server provider, known for its bad servers. During the 2nd year it started to be clear that the devs are adding more and more PVP focused features to the game. This was acceptable so there was some kind of basic gameplay loop that started to get a little bit more varied, but at the same time, it didnt really become varied. The devs added guns and vehicles in the game, followed with more complex basebuilding mechanics.\n\nThe base building mechanics seemed to take a big emphasis and following that most of the SCUM servers were very clearly PVP focused fort building gameplay style servers. To this day this is the majority of servers and its no wonder. Many players who looked for a survival game with a survival focused basic gameplay loop must have realised during the 2nd year how the direction for the game had changed. \n\nRecently SCUM had an update that added in-game NPC traders, airplanes and parachutes. The traders allow players to farm money with anything, like you can collect mushrooms and sell them to buy high-end weapons. This means that getting high-end gear and/or building supplies is easier than ever. It makes the game much more casual and PVP centered. Airplanes and parachutes are basically added for the basebuilder PVP style players as well, as those ones are the ones who will most probably access and keep a plane.\n\nI bought the game day one, it was promised to be the most complex HC survival game with emphasis on things like metabolism and martial arts. Both are extremely bare bones mechanics to exist in a survival game in its 4th year of dev't. SCUM has got updates in a semi-regular manner - the updates have just been focused  way too much on base building and PVP mechanics. Even the weapons added have mostly been military themed weapons.\n\nThe metabolism system is due to have some sort of revamp, but no information on when. I personally think its too late already, the players who want a RUST with a few more things to eat (without any real consequence) and few less things to build have got what they wanted and the survival gamers have been forgotten about. You can survive very easily and having deficits in some vitamins or minerals have very little consequence. The ability to survive without eating while burning ones own reserves is more realistic than in DayZ for example, but that coupled with very plentiful food makes surviving a tertiary goal. Surviving... a tertiary goal.. in a survival game? Its sad, as there was a lot of potential for SCUM being a true survival game, one of the best.\n\nThe medical system in the game is very much bare bones as well. You can have different sorts of bleeds and thats about it. You cant break a leg, you cant get an infected wound from using dirty rags to bandage your wounds, you cant get cholera from eating contaminated water. You just bleed. The actual damage modeling from weapons is mediocre to good, the most protecting plate carriers protect maybe a little bit too much. There are conditions like hyperthermia and hypothermia, which is a good thing, but in the end its not enough. Experienced players just leave the clothes out and have all the tactical gear on them with little to no problems with temperature.\n\nOn top of all the gameplay issues and underlying identity crisis, SCUM is also still very poorly optimized, it has huge lag and desync issues on highly populated servers, making them even unplayable at times and so on. Its not recommended for anyone who wants a survival game. Its not recommended for someone who wants a more fleshed out DayZ, for example. It is recommended for people who want RUST clone with more things to eat and less things to build + a little bit more mature playerbase. We'll see if the devs ever address the identity crisis, their mods seem to think that only overwhelming hate against sth is enough to warrant an answer - or a change.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1650463659, "timestamp_updated": 1650463659, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 233, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819090425968170166", "comment_count": 52, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44447504": {"recommendationid": "44447504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205886107", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 5893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5457, "last_played": 1654973892}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing the game as an alpha tester for some time now and I must say the best thing about this game are the developers.\nGamepires are really working hard to make their game as good as possible. \nIt's amazing for me to see how much progress was made during the last few months and the developers are very open for communication and are easily reached via twitter or discord. \nThey appreciate all feedback and keep asking for more!\n\nGAME:\nIt's important to note that this is EARLY ACCESS which means that it is not finished yet and is full of bugs and lacks content!!\n\nThe game consists of two parts, SURVIVAL and EVENTS.One thing that links them is FAME points.\n\n-Survival:\tYou can think of this as the main game while events being something that can help along the way.\n\t\tYou earn or lose fame points by doing certain actions like killing someone, hunting something or simply by crafting items.\n\t\tSurvival is pretty self explanatory but if you die you may revive using the fame points.\n\t\tThe map is 12x12km and takes well over 1 hour to run from one end to the other.\n\n-Events:\tTo join you need to have 10 Fame points.\n\t\tYou get teleported to the event, get geared up and enjoy some quick and fun gunplay!\n\n-Metabolism:\tSCUM went full realism mode on this one, there are tons of information about your character that you may not even understand.

They introduce items into the game that nobody asked for like pink vests or tease 'super mechs' when the mechs that have been in game have horrible AI, track/shoot you through walls, bugged out audio detection etc.\n\nIf you find the game on sale and can deal with frustrating bugs and bad UI, it is worth picking up.", "timestamp_created": 1611469236, "timestamp_updated": 1615052103, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 187, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818147718906402588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85685790": {"recommendationid": "85685790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022315818", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 75689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13172, "last_played": 1709058231}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the game that will eventually take over from Dayz. It had a rocky start when it first came out but has come leaps and bounds since then. The graphics look amazing, the crafting system is really well put together and you don't need a set group of items to craft something, cars work well, there is an ingame radio station that plays unsigned artists with all genres of music. The one thing i like about this is the devs allow server owners a lot of creative control and are not limited to \"the way the game is meant to be played\" You can disable the mechs, add more zombies, add less zombies change how strong or weak they are. A lot of people get put off by the metabolism screen as it can look like too much thrown at you all at once, but it really isnt that hard and you don't usually need to pay attention to 80% of it, and you also aren't required to fulfil every nutritional task either. Just ensure you are fed and watered and you arent injured, the rest makes sense later on.\n\nThe game also has an event generator built in as well, so anyone in the server can challenge you to a short pvp skirmish to earn fame points and you don't lose your gear or your survival character as anything that happens in the match stays in the match.

I have had scum for a while and have put some hours into it, myself and some friends revisited it a couple of days ago after a long break so thought I would put together a review.\n\nWe played for about 3 hours straight on a server with just under 50 players.  That time consisted of the same thing playing scum always does, running.  We all spawned in on opposite sides of the map because there is nothing more fun than starting a new game with 30 minutes of auto running.  We met up at the new (to us) city in the NW corner, after looting generic crap from the city we moved on to the Sanitarium as it was marked as high loot on the map we were using.  More generic crap loot.  So we went to a nearby bunker, snuck past the mechs who seem to be more broken than the last time we played but just a dull an uninteresting. \n\nWe looted up and found a few guns, no matching mags though.  We suffered a couple of deaths, one guy glitching off a ladder, another guy threw a ninja star at a wall and it bounced back and killed him (admitredly pretty funny).\n\nWe moved on to another bunker, snuck past the glitchy mechs, more generic loot etc. etc.\n\nAt which point people were bored it had been 3 hours and nothing had happened, we hadn't seen any people, no puppets, nothing.  I have recently checked out Deadside which is kind of a Scum lite game.  Whilst I feel that deadside may be a bit quick to garner long term enjoyment the pace of Scum is ridiculously slow.  3 hours of looting and not a single gunfight or action of any kind.\n\nThis \"game\" needs a lot of game adding to it if it wants to be fun.  It has puppets but they seem so rare that they might as well not be there.  The map is way too big for the 50 players supported on official (upto 100 players on other servers).  Based on the size of map you will have about 3 players per huge square which means the odds of running into people, even at POIs is slim.\n\nI think this game really needs more ai enemies, ideally human ones with guns not just puppets/zombies.  These ai would provide; something to do, more interesting looting than endless crate searching and a catalyst for action.  The AI in deadside for example are very basic, but relatively fun to shoot at.  More importantly though, when you get into a gun fight it makes noise, which can draw in players, which in turn brings in more players and before you know it you are in a multi team war.  This just doesn't happen in Scum, the player numbers, map size and infrequency of gun fights means it rarely gains momentum.\n\nThe base building is painful at best, the bulk of it is ok, not as satisfying as other games out there but not the worst I have seen.  The locking system though is dire.  Rather than making a lock from things you find you make it from fame points, which you earn from doing random activities within the game.  It is a deeply dissatisfying system which leads to you having to grind pointless stuff like crafting bone needles to get points.  These locks can also be picked using a skyrim esque lock pick mini game which once mastered makes (tbf its cancerous and painful to master)  the locks easy to get past.  Ultimately this feature turns the building into a painful and futile exercise and that's before you consider that there is not much point in building a base anyway.\n\nUltimately Scum is an incredible, intricate platform with advanced and detailed mechanics, but there is virtually no game play.\n\nCan I recommend it?  I don't know what there is to recommend so I guess that's a no.  Someday they may add in some mechanics to make the game fun but I am not holding my breath.\n", "timestamp_created": 1588336761, "timestamp_updated": 1588336761, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 164, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.817723512649536133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1588768990, "developer_response": "Thanks for the extensive review Timmy, I can see why you don't enjoy SCUM as much as some other games.

If you read their recent 3-month roadmap, they even say that they only have one or two people working on specific projects. Building a game is very difficult, especially when it's one developer  But they are working harder than EA to push out quality content for their users, and to fix the bugs that are in the game. They already have more content in early access than DayZ has in their 5-year \"official\" release. Unlike other gaming companies, especially the ones that got super popular in early-access(hint hint DayZ, PUBG to name a couple), they are still going strong with their game, and their community. Honestly, I can't emphasize how much they really care about their game and their community, despite the hype and money that surged into this game, unlike games like DayZ or PUBG that are horribly optimized, badly bugged, and just really not taken care of. Gamepires is amazing because of that.\n\nAs for the game itself, I have nothing but positive reviews for. The environment is stunningly beautiful, gameplay is super fun, especially if you have friends, and you have the freedom to do whatever you want in the game. If you don't want to immediately go find the best loot and hunt down other players, then don't! They have plenty of fun options like crafting, cooking, fortifying a building to make a home, hunting, etc etc. Even if you are playing the game solo, there is a single-player to enjoy the game yourself, with admin commands if you wish. You can also find pretty friendly people who you can end up fighting other teams with, which has happened to me. SCUM is everything that DayZ could only hope to achieve. Of course there are bugs, but come on, its an early access what did you expect? But the developers do work hard to fix them as well. The people who are complaining are the people who think SCUM and its developers are just like DayZ, which they are not, or are ones who want to be told what to do, with missions and objectives, when they just need to stop and enjoy the others options of the game. They are not pointless, it adds to what the game is supposed to be, a true zombie survival.\n\nMy message to the developers; Please don't give up! You guys are doing amazing work and you only continue to impress! You guys are on the road of something no one else has accomplished, a complete, up-to-date engine game with so many options to choose from like base-building, vehicles, hunting, PvP and PvE, cooking, crafting, furnishing, and all the other stuff that can fulfill the dreams of survival gamers such as myself, and I, for one, am dying for something like that. You guys are the only ones who show that potential, and I will support you guys every step of the way!

Went looking for someone to play a round of TDM with me but no one wanted to. It was on an official server with 64/64 players. \nGood that they made the map even bigger now! It's not like I am waiting for the metabolism overhaul for a year now. Seriously, fuxk this game! \n\n\n\nTo be fair: This game has extraordinarily good gunplay and gun sounds (the sound of the suppressors, omg! Finally someone does them right!). As someone who is constantly searching for exactly this, the game should make me happy. But it just doesn't. In fact, it makes me actually wondering why I am wasting my time on video games. Rarely any other game does give me that feeling.\n\nListen to me: I love DayZ for its atmosphere and although it is slow-paced you are always on edge. Even the sound of the trees moving in the wind make you scared. In Scum, however, nothing ever happens. The map is HUGE and there are far too few players and puppets (zombies) to fill it. This results in looting for 2 hours and getting some good stuff (official servers) or a lot of good stuff (custom servers) and then getting suddenly shot by a camper because after looting the 150th house you did let your guard down. \n\nIf you are not into base-building, if you are already bothered by walking around for 1 hour in DayZ, if you want a real zombie threat, if you want good, long-range PvP, then this game is not for you. \n\nIf you don't believe me, watch some un-edited Youtube videos. The most prominent streamer of this game regularly streams for 5 hours or more. You will then see that nothing ever happens. \n\n\nPs.: To somehow save the game for people like me, they should finally make the Singleplayer easily customizable (without tinkering with the .ini files, that is). So I can crank up the amount of the puppets (zombies), increase the amount of loot etc. etc. Then, and only then, Scum could be a much more realistic subsititue for games like 7 Days to Die.

SCUM is a rapidly changing Early-Access title, so any or all of the information in this review is subject to change.\n\nLet's get this part of the way first: Do I recommend SCUM to anyone expecting a finished product?  Absolutely not.  Many features of this game are bugged, missing, or clearly unfinished (several aspects of character creation, illnesses, and a good portion of the nutrition system, to name a few).\n\nWith that out of the way, I can say that Gamepires has already done more in a few months than the Day Z Standalone team did in four years.  Even in its barebones, unfinished state this game is a much more polished product than Day Z ever was.  However, a number of features do make this game distinct from Day Z and other similar games.  \n\nThe biggest difference is in the character customization.  SCUM uses an attribute and skill system similar to an RPG to determine both your character's overall physical build and what they're good at.  Though many skills have yet to be implemented properly, there is already some great potential in what's there.  Furthermore, the devs seem like great people and have been very diligent at providing regular hotfixes, dev diaries, and response to feedback.  As someone who has been turned off on early access titles in the past, this was a breath of fresh air that ultimately pushed me into giving the game a try.\n\nCombat is about what you'd expect from a game like this: conserve your ammunition, avoid combat with Puppets (the \"zombies\") whenever possible, and make sure to keep your wounds treated.  However, once you get the crafting system down, it becomes quite a bit more forgiving than other games.  Spend your scarce starting resources right and you can have a small backpack, bow, and stone axe within minutes without even leaving your spawn area.  \n\nOnce you find a gun, you can expect similar bullet physics to milsim games like ARMA.  Bullets have travel time and drop, and can punch through materials depending on caliber and distance.  Recoil and spread can be reduced by your strength stat and skill in that particular weapon type.\n\nGraphics and performance are both quite good in my overall experience, especially for such an early build.  My 1080 has not dropped below 60FPS on high settings.  There is occasional hitching when the game is loading new areas, but nothing game-breaking.  The graphics aren't revolutionary, but they're quite nice as well, with some excellent details here and there (my favorite so far is a very cool light-shaft effect from the bullet holes if you're getting shot at inside a building).\n\nOverall, if you don't like paying for an obviously unfinished product, hold off on SCUM for now.  However, if you're looking to scratch that survival game itch and want to support the development of a game with some serious potential, SCUM is worth a go.", "timestamp_created": 1546130570, "timestamp_updated": 1546135827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803734064102172852", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109918852": {"recommendationid": "109918852", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961300653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1679, "last_played": 1645282841}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want to play this PVE (as i do), i currently don't recommend it.\nThe puppets just randomly respawn after a short amount of time, even inside the same building/bunker you are currently looting.

I got a C2 injury and was slowly bleeding to death, for looking through stuff and if i hadnt stopped and bound wounds, it would have kept getting progressively worse and worse.   I waited, way too long.  for the injuries to heal so i could continue, and of course the healed injury started to come back, at which point my experiment in playing this ridiculous game came to an end this week.

its not realistic its just difficult for the sake of being difficult.\n-sometimes will just be launched great distances....better hope there is water behind/beneath you\n-items randomly disappearing\n-essentially 2 types of zombies and personally I don't find exploding zombies all that mechanically compelling outside of confined spaces like the vaults or navy base tunnels\n-pretty serious lack of pve content which will hopefully be added in time\n-zombies respawning in front of you/while you're raiding a vault....\n-killbox is stupid and not compelling mechanically\n-mechs are stupid and not compelling mechanically outside of a few areas where they play well off the denser more urban environment like the refinery near the middle air base\n-melee is not nearly as satisfying as it should be and sound design for melee is currently terrible\n-why there was ever a point where breast/penis size correlated with your intelligence stat is just beyond me\n-crafting menu is cryptic and uninformative\n-wish the biomes had more unique characteristics or that us mountain/snow lovers had a new/interesting location thrown our way\n-don't be near two waterfalls near eachother unless you wanna get ear r*****. \n-logged in and saw Scum on sale/free weekend, got excited for people to see/experience this game I care about and want to do well, then saw 20gb update with dev note saying \"small update!\" and saw that everyones game doesn't work because of something to do with anticheat and frankly I just couldn't even muster the faintest whiff of incredulity because this is just sort-of expected unfortunately\n\nAgain, I'm personally able to consistently have a blast in this sandbox but I wouldn't be able to recommend it to someone unless they're like me and are really good at making their own fun/just enjoy survivng against the elements an zombois.\n", "timestamp_created": 1630008125, "timestamp_updated": 1630008125, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 192, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.799939334392547607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104514230": {"recommendationid": "104514230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086121958", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 124585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79960, "last_played": 1705916853}, "language": "english", "review": "Getting better with every update.

Makes me feel that devs are trying to make it less better\n\n - DESYNC, LAG. Present from the first day. In the meanwhile we had map expansion (??!!). I mean, who needs bigger map than 12x12 kilometers (or something like that)  when the game is unplayable with more than 60 players. I constantly see people writing in the game chat that they are bored because they cant find any players. Big city which makes your FPS plummet is another great example of this...\n\nYet another example for this is driving, it is horrible experience when you are a passenger. But, instead of fixing it, we got new cars, motorcycles, bicycles and now planes...It's like devs are laughing at us masochists who still persist in playing the game.\n\nFor a year or so we had reload bug - you would reload a gun with animation and sound but the clip was not inserted in the gun. I died countless times because of it. All the time that this bug was not fixed devs introduced countless new additions and patches, for example, water collector (insignificant survival item) for which we had several bug fixes, but the reload bug was present all the time. I suppose after that long it was considered a feature xD\n\nGame takes pride in 3rd person view that doesn't render enemy players if you cant see it in first person. However, sideffect of this is that players inside houses who peek through windows are often not rendered. Died another countless times because of that. When enemy player opens the door of the room you are in, similar thing happens, enemy player is rendered with the delay and you die :)\n\nIn the 0.6 update (or some other, i really don't care anymore) devs introduced loading magazines one bullet at a time. Maybe realistic but extremely annoying. The point is, it was bugged from the day one. You put 30 bullets into a mag and each time a small random number of bullets is left in the inventory while mag appears as full. We have now 0.7 update, but the bug is still present..\n\nGun scope bug...when you respawn or relog, and take take some gun that has a scope, the scope is not present in the first person, you only see iron sight. Scope is visible in the inventory, you must remove it and put it back. I would dare to say that this bug is present more than 2 years. \n\nI could go on endlessly, but i see no point.
