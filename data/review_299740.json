You can do everything, like ride a bike, loot, build, kill (depending on servers), get parts for vehicles, etc. I was having fun running around with my baseball bat, motorcycle helmet and my one 1 bullet for my bolt action. killing the occasional mutant and lots of wolves (scary ass animals in this game), but I came across a guy who was chilling there in the woods with a huge fortress. Over the comm system he says, \"Hey come up here real fast\" and being an h1z1 and dayz player I was reluctant. But new game new life. SO i hoped up there, and next thing I knew he gave me all his gear, and said \"My time is come to start anew. This base and all the things in it are yours. Keep it safe. And last of all if you decide to leave the server, or start fresh or anything like that. Do the same thing I did. and pass it on like the guy before me.\" Then he left, naked and without weapons. screaming \"Let's GO MUTANTS I'LL FIGHT YOU BARE NAKED\"  never seen him again. So now I watch over his base, killing mutants, and raiders alike. And when I finally leave this server, I will pass down the legacy of this gorgous base and loot to another.

For me personally, the hardest game ever to review, because this game has huge potential and my ingame hours might tell that I enjoyed this game a lot for some time. At some stage I was a dev-tester for Entrada and the base I built can still be seen on Miscreateds store page (second screenshot). For the last year or so I had a positive review up here and as much as I hate it, I feel like it doesn't do the game justice anymore. But still - if you're into these kind of games it might be worth the money for you, but prepare to be let down once you get deeper into this game.\n\nSo I got this game pretty much just after its release late in 2014 and it was quite a rough start. Very small map, huge performance issues and not much to do. But right from the start this game and its devs were different. It looked pretty, the devs were (and still are) very active and patched this game frequently. They solved a lot of performance issues, added a lot of new content and kept talking to their quite small community. \n\nSometime in 2015 they released a freebuild-basebuilding system that alows you to create very unique bases, as every part can (and has to) be placed and adjusted individually, so no snaping baseparts like in Rust, H1Z1 or pretty much every other game in this genre. I loved this basebuilding feature so much, that I spent about 70 hours to build a single base, which even made it into their store page screenshots. The system had it's issues, but I thought to myself \"hey, this is early access, it'll improve over time, just like other stuff they fixed before\".\n\nThen a lot of sales started, it felt like half of the time in early 2016 the game was on sale for 9,99\u20ac, which finally got the devs what they wanted and of course every game needs - a large playerbase. And from this point, it all went down pretty fast and and this game got ruined.\nIt seemed and still seems like the majority of (young) players are only looking for one thing: Destroying the gaming experience you have and kill everything that moves. If you were not on a strictly PVE server, everyone in this community, which was back in the days so special and friendly, would just kill you on sight or betray you by pretending to be friendly and shoot you in the back. I know this is typical behaviour for a lot of people who play online, so why do I blame the devs for this? \n\nBecause they encourage this behaviour in any way they can! The last couple of patches have just been filled with guns, grenades and other PVP stuff, even though this game has so many guns already and desperatly needs survival content, which just isn't there. There is literally NO challenge in surviving in Miscreated. Mutants are no threat as they are stupid, most of the time slower than you and usually don't appear in a group, supplies are a joke (in over 800 hours I wasn't close to starvation or dehydration once!) and there isn't anything to do when it comes to survival (sicknesses, temperature, personal character development etc.). Why should I hunt a deer, collect it's meat and build a campfire to cook it? There is food around everywhere, why bother? This is not a survival game, this is a giant deathmatch arena.\n\nAnother example of how the developers encourage \"bad\" behaviour: To get into a base and destroy baseparts, you only need a melee weapon(!!), which you'll find in less than 2 minutes after spawning. You can only build wooden walls/gates and they are not strong at all. So even if a person needs to break down multiple walls to get to the storage box of someone else, it'll still be way faster to just do that and steal all of their stuff than actually going into the cities and scavange. So what's the solution 3 out of 4 players come up with to protect their stuff? They build floating bases. Cause once a base part is placed, you can remove the parts under it without the upper part falling down, so no gravity. By now about 85% of the bases on regular servers in Miscreated look like shit, because they are floating in mid-air or are abandoned because they've been looted and destroyed multiple times a day. Instead of fixing issues like that, basebuilding just sits in the game and is not focussed on at all.\n\nHalf of my steam-friendlist contains people I met in Miscreated, mainly from the earlier days. So many good people, such great adventures we had. This is all over now, I talked to a lot of these players and most of them have the exact same opinion. I guess that the problem these devs will have to face is, that once people get bored of their endless deathmatch-rounds they will move on, whatever that means for Miscreateds playerbase. And please don't get me wrong, I like intense PvP fights, it's part of a survival game. But it's supposed to be just a part, not the entire game and all there is to do.\n\nWhen I was a dev-tester I was connected to the dev-team through skype and of course I won't tell anything out of these conversations. But I want to say one thing: Most of them seem like really friendly, down to earth people. But whenever I mentioned these problems I didn't get an answer or they just didn't agree, which I can not understand as these issues concern core elements of a survival game. Of course I accept their opinion, it's their game and if they want to go that path I wish them all the luck in the world and I really mean it. \n\nBut my high hopes for an intense SURVIVAL game have turned into a huge disappointment from a plain deathmatch simulator with nothing but PVP elements.", "timestamp_created": 1482798265, "timestamp_updated": 1482798265, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 876, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.884772717952728271", "comment_count": 126, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21288946": {"recommendationid": "21288946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066690921", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 981, "last_played": 1500939392}, "language": "english", "review": "How is this Mixed when DayZ is Positive?\n\nHow could that even be possible?\n\n\nMore features than DayZ, runs smoother than DayZ, plays better than DayZ.

This is something pretty common in open world survival games. In these games, the human race is practically the enemy. If you feel that being KOS is such a big issue, you have the option of a PvE server. With a PvE server you are able to learn the map, game mechanics, guns, etc. and are able to meet new people to play with. One tip I would recommend would be to not enter PvP alone unless you are skilled.\n\n2) Taking too long to find loot. This is a game where you have to work to find your loot, it isn't just given to you. Personally, I have not found any problems with the loot system, it just shows that you have to value your arms and ammunition a lot more, and not just waste them on random mutants.\n\n3) Being too quick to judge the game. In my opinion you really shouldn't jump straight into a full PvP server and expect to have a fun time. There are people who have been giving bad reviews for the game and they have played for 6 hours or less (excluding bad reviews from people who have played at least 10 or more) . Personally you should probably find someone to play with and someone to teach you about the game when you start out, if PvE servers aren't your thing.\n\nThere are of course, the cons to the game.\n - Slow development times\n - Long loading times (even if it is a large map)\n - Glitches (I have not encountered that many bad ones, but you will notice them)\n - Vehicles despawning after 2 days of inactivity. (This is something that supposedly should have players play the game regularly so that people don't hog vehicles. Personally, I feel that it is a chore to be logging in every day to check on my car so it doesn't despawn. \n\nPersonally, I feel that these developers should allow modding for this game, so the community may be able to create new maps or game modes that may create a better environment for new players. \n\nIf you truly do not like this game, I fully respect that. I feel that I had to get this review out because I see that most of these reviews are from players that have had a rough start to the game, and/or are very in experienced with this genre of games. I would just recommend trying PvE servers to start out to eventually play on PvP servers.\n\nI wish current players, and future players the best of luck on their experience. You should buy this game not for what it is as of now, but what it will eventually be in the future.

This game has great potential. I would love to see it get popular. The thing that bugs me is people are giving it crap reviews when it\u2019s not at all a crap game. They see no others and say no thanks and it\u2019s going to make it less popular given the mixed reviews. So if you are reading this buy it if you realize its early access. There are 12 passionate devs at work here to make the game the best it can be, don't give it \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 reviews while they still building it.\n\nEDIT: \n\nMy god this game is fricken amazing, the devs are awesome too, I went and watched the stream and was able to actually chat with them and ask questions as to why glitches occur and how often they update, they told me they have a lot of stuff coming out! Exciting stuff.\n\nSo gameplay wise I am on three servers, US 77, 76, 75. All different experiences I must say. Here\u2019s what\u2019s up: \n\n75: I was wandering and saw a stripped down truck (they are brighter than other abandoned cars and can access their inventory to build again) so okay I start to go look for parts for it and I find a few, as I\u2019m wandering down the middle of the road like a dumbass I look to my left as I see some movement and there is two guys dressed in all black with rifles pointed at me in the bushes....MOTHER OF GOD. Thankfully they didn\u2019t want anything to do with me and slowly kept their guns on me and walked away while doing so. After that met another player who was fresh spawn and told him about my car, risky stuff because he could have murdered me and took it when I showed him where it was. We start scavenging parts together and come across another newbie while doing so and he has one the parts we need, he joins...awesome three can easy be super safe in a world of survival. We get all the pieces together and are driving the truck around its \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing amazing. We come across another player and ask him if he wants to join he is a little hesitant but hops on the back of the truck, then we met another guy and he joined. So I\u2019m rolling around the map with a badass truck and a team of 5 people and we own it. Server did crash and we lost some progress but hey its alpha and those 5 hours were \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing amazing. \n\n76: Play on this server with on buddy, we\u2019ve been to all four towns twice looking for cars as we both had been carrying max weight of parts for it and we were all set up. Two days of looking and we run into some other people....of course they say they don\u2019t want trouble and that they are friendly, they run down the street while we start raiding a grocery store. My buddy tells me that he hears footsteps, these mofos came back and are trying to murder us while we not paying attention. We get into a 15 minute fire and melee battle with these guys, I go down first and my friend kills another but then he dies. We start all over. = real survival game...I aint even mad. \n\n77: I play solo and record video on this server. Spawn next to river....four people on a boat show up and say they friendly and that they will give me ride to town, I take risk and hop in...BOOM HEADSHOT I die. Respawn and start looting houses turn around and there\u2019s a geared up guy looking straight at me in the hallway. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 My pants. He\u2019s nice and gives me a bat with nails and some food. Helps me find more gear and we kill some mutants together. He tells me we going to just stick together and anyone else we will murder and rob....sounds okay I\u2019ve had my fair share of being nice. We walking about and then there is another guy down the street who is mega hesitant to come to us we meet him in middle of street and my new partner is like \"we just want to kill zombies and survive we don\u2019t rob people\" guys is like sweet first nice people I\u2019ve met. My buddy starts punching him and then I guess us robbing this guy so I chase him with my bat. Enemy pulls out a revolver and two shots me...respawn stay 100% solo and started robbing people with a .22 rifle with no ammo (but they don\u2019t know that hehe). \n\nNeedless to say this game is intense, feels real, buy it, if you don\u2019t like it in 2 hours return it. But don\u2019t give it crappy reviews while it\u2019s in alpha. I doubt it will stop these passionate devs but they deserve all the positivity in the world.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t convinced yet and need video proof I do make YouTube videos of my adventures with friends in Miscreated.

Yet.\nThe game has the potential to be somthing spectacular. With over 500 Hours wasted playing \"Nether\", to see it die to hackers, glitches, bugs, a lazy dev team and exploters was something saddening. Miscreated has reignited the spark which I previously had for Nether.\n\nThe game, for starters, is stunning. The engine used gives us a large, expansive open world (ish, they've cut the size down for  Alpha testing), filled with beatuiful landscapes and detailed cities. One thing which grabbed me is that in the video I watched, I saw houses filled with furniture. Not empty, bland, blank rooms. You actually have to look for things. Items don't just jump out at you... Whilst at the moment, finding food and water is super easy. I'm not a fan of that. Loot does seem to come easy as long as you have your eye out for it.\n\nGuns and Weapons. They're limited in varaity but not in quantity... Unfortunately. But with it being in such an early Alpha, the fact that there is only 1 Gun and a small handfull of melee weapons kind of sucks. From what I've been reading is that there are plenty on the way. So far the gun play feels smooth and fluid. It CAN at times feel clunky. It depends on how you're playing.\n\nFirst and Third person. No no no no no no noooooooooooo... If they get rid of Third person then the game would be fantastic. At the moment, Third person is a little buggy. The camera doesn't exactly follow you well and it doesn't provide you with the view you may want at the time. Indoors the Third Person camera just shits itself and cowers up closer to the back of your head, making it difficult to see.\nCharacter models are sketchy at best. They may just be basic place holders but holy crap. The mutant does look very... Out dated. But it's alpha. Lots of changes can happen very suddenly.\n\nThe mutants themselves have very clunky AI. They run at you, lunge with their arms then just run into you. As long as you just AFK wheel backwards, they will NEVER swing for you. You just bash their heads with a hammer or something 5 or 6 times and they die... Not exactly scary or intense... Alpha be alpha.\n\nProviding the devs add reasonable items and changes then it should smooth out fine. In a matter of months I see this game looking in a stable spot to start bringing in a larger fan base.\nIf the devs start adding lots of useless things (Like Nether did), without fixing existing errors (Like Nether did), then the game will die. Very fast.\n\nI do believe also that people have been troubled when trying to join servers. I have NOT*** experienced any of these problems. Some bloke who shot me in-game told me the servers were fixed. I dunno, i've not had those problems.\n\nI recommend you buy the game and play one session. If you don't like it, come back to it after the new year. If you do like it, then keep your eye on the updates (which the devs roll out every week or so). \nI will update this every now and then, after big updates.\n\n[EDIT1] So after playing some more, it crossed my mind that the game is lacking a player-list. Even if it's something simple like \"There are 10 Survivors on this server\". I joined a low-pop (1 other player) to stream some gameplay to a friend when suddenly it became the high-pop.\n\nAlso, reloading. You have to go into your inventory and swap out the mag. In the heat of the moment going from bang-bang-bang to click-click-click makes my heart drop. It would be great even as a QoL change to add some form of reloading. It could load the magazine with the most amount of ammo in.\nSomething like that.\n\nThe devs have releaed a long statement today which only brightens the promise this game has. A new rifle, shotgun and more melee weapons. Fantastic. This game right now is headed in the right direction. If the devs ever read this review, then hats off to you guys. 2 Years in the making and you can really see how well their hardwork has paid off.\n\nThe bugs i have found so far are as follows: \n- Third Person screws up in closed areas\n- Some form of unknown action stops you from being able to switch weapons (I think it's swimming)\n- Some loot underneath small tables spawns out of reach (RIP 30+ Round Magazine for my Pistol)\n- Some houses are completely empty and have texture glitches (Could just be unfinished houses, not a big deal)\n- Sometimes when joining a server, you get kicked back to the lobby screen. ***I stated above that I haven't had these problems, but recently it's happened to me once or twice.\n\nI haven't come across anything else other than those...

I like the concept of the game, and from what I've been told it's a lot better than other games of the same style. But, in saying that I have a few opinions.\n\nI have been playing it for a while now and it's becoming monotonous. Go somewhere, stock up a bit of food, go somewhere else, stock up on more food, go to another place, etc..... I'm running out of things to do.\n\nPlayable area. The map is so small, with areas that are blocked off awaiting development. Yup, I know - it's early access, I'm not that stupid. But FFS, can you at least put some effort into developing the play area instead of wasting time on bringing in a new range of bike helmets? I need a bike helmet like I need a pair of Crocs.\nRecently you opened up the Hayward sewers. Yay, two kilometers of boredom. Places like this need to be rewarding and exciting, full of mutants and other nasties with rewarding items for your efforts. The bunkers are just as bad. Come on guys, get the map finished.\nThe last update stated that a new area East of Hayward opened up..... It's about the size of a parking lot void of any real reason to go there.\nI also hope more maps will become available in the future, but giddyup guys - it's taking way too long. Focus on the map and not artistic flourishes. I know, \"It's still in alpha\".\n\nBuilding and crafting. I feel that the building side of things need a little polishing. If you devs have a personal hatred toward snap points, then that's fine - each to their own, but please give us a key to select whether we want them or not. I have lost count of the amount of times I've placed something, only to pull it down and attempt to re-place it several times before I was satisfied with its position.\nWhy also can I not place an item on uneven terrain? An example would be a platform. Four posts, any of which could be buried in the ground upon placement or \"sawed off\" to suit the terrain. And if I were to place another right next to one, instead of it lining up to a flat surface the next one would end up much higher than the one originally placed. So if you were fortunate to be able to place say, four platforms it would somewhat resemble a BMX track with massive gaps between them. Good luck getting four sides of gap free walls on that mess.\n\nStorage. Oh storage. I understand that you want to grab a hold of our nuts and limit the amount of gear that we can posess to minimise the amount of alphas who could hold a monopoly on a server, but give us server owners the right to select an option for ourselves in the config file.\nOfficial servers are a different matter but we are paying a ridiculous amount of money to rent a server that we have no real say over what we can provide our players. I don't care about weather settings or the other inane and menial options, I want control over more important options.\n\nVehicles. Why TF is a vehicle disappearing after 48 hours of no login? I want to be able to spend a weekend with my family or go on holiday for more than two days without coming back to a base with no transport as it de-spawned. And while I'm on the subject, why limit the amount of vehicles on the server?\nThose with vehicles are smiling with their toes tapping, while others who come in once the vehicles are claimed have no transport whatsoever. If those holding vehicles crash and burn, their chances of finding a replacement are slim to none. Give us more vehicles to locate, or does the reasoning behind this come down to the storage strangle debate.\nThe main gripes I get are for lack of vehicles and storage, and these people stop playing the game altogether.\n\nPVP and PVE. I whitelisted my server as I had in the description no KOS or base raiding. Well, we had a bunch of !%@#s come in and start KOS and base raiding. It's impossible to scroll through and find the people responsible so I can place them on the ban list because the damage logs are ridiculously long.\nIf I state no KOS or base raiding then I should be able to configure my server in that manner. Cast your mind back to the paragraph on storage about more options, I should be able to flag this for no player or structure damage. Some people enjoy playing PVP, others do not and when they work for months to build something up on a PVE server, only to lose it while they sleep, on holiday or are are work is unacceptable.\n\nCarrying dynamics. Okay, let me get this right. I can place two wheels in the pockets of my T-shirt, but I can't place 20 rounds of .357 in the same spot?\nI have a bus that will hold X amount of people (unsure of the capacity), but I can't place more than ten pieces of paper (guides) in the inventory of the bus, but I can carry ?20 people.\nWhy can't a fully loaded backpack with, for example - ten cans of soda - be placed in the tray of a pickup? If I were to go camping I could place ten loaded backpacks, a tent, sleeping bags, and a whole bunch of other gear in the vehicle and have room to spare.\nHere it should again come down to the server configs of the renter, and again the storage strangle debate.\n\nGlitches. Too many to name but believe me whan I say they are numerous. Loot being half buried in whatever it's supposed to be sitting on (making half the loot next to impossible to find), mutants attacking and damaging through walls, vehicles flying into the air on a flat section of road, DC's, blank screens, black squares on screens where the rendering bugs out, Items dropped falling through the ground into a black hole of non-existance (dropping something for someone else to pick up is a hit and miss affair), falling under the terrain (My son was walking at the airfield and disappeared under the terrain, he literally swam to the ocean side under the land mass and popped up) the list goes on. Yeah, I know - \"It's still in alpha\".\n\nServers. Here's the kicker. Why do you have such a monopoly on who can provide the server? i3D are the only providers at present who we can rent off, and at the price that's being charged for a server that we can't configure to suit our preferences is nothing short of robbery. Oh yeah, I can go and shove it if I don't like it, go play another game, I also understand that. But this is why there is so much talk about there being kickbacks for exclusivity.\nIf I want to host this game on a personal server I can't, if I want to play this game by myself on my PC lone wolf style I can't, nor can I shop around for a better deal to save a bit of money on a game that just doesn't quite hit the mark at the present moment in time.\n\nIn conclusion, I like the game but I see it heading in a uncertain direction at the moment, and that's what's holding me back. I want to say it's a good game to play but the statements above lend weight to the descision that I've made that I will see the rental of the server until the next payment is due, then it's game over. I have seen many servers disappear over the time I've played which prompted me to rent one, but I understand why people give up and stop paying.\nI could just join the masses and play on another server but, will I be fortunate enough to find a vehicle? Will some griefer rob my base or KOS on a PVE server while I sleep? Will that server give up as a bad investment, just as I will be doing? Too many unanswerable questions that make me say that it's not worth playing the game.\nI was originally going to go to the official site and create a thread outlining everything above, but the moderators were slamming everyone with an opinion, banning people for an opinion, and defending the \"It's still in alpha\" statement. So here I am with a personal opinion at the point of sale of the game without fear of said opinion being banned.\nI get it - \"It's still in alpha\", but the direction and the lack of communication is just not apparent nor satifactory to me at this point in time.\n\nLet the hate begin...", "timestamp_created": 1495296004, "timestamp_updated": 1497683338, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 495, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860916733741760254", "comment_count": 62, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47669018": {"recommendationid": "47669018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137758576", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 16821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15836, "last_played": 1596316877}, "language": "english", "review": "Let this review be the quickest most straight to the point review that will help you decide to buy this or not\n\nPros:\n- They really nailed the post apoc atmosphere\n- The backpack / weight carrying system is implemented well\n- map layout is very well put together. Different towns and cities feel thoroughly thought through in their placement and design\n- This game has a certain pace / vibe that ive never seen before in a game. Its somewhere between rust and dayz but leaning dayz. Its lonely but not too lonely.\n- Wide variety of items\n- Good balancing in the rate at which you can find / scavenge items. Also rewards thorough searching.\n- Graphics are generally good.\n\nCons: \n- Crafting is a literal nightmare. Whoever designed the UI and its organization should be shot. It is so far from being intuitive its as if one of the devs sat back and said \"watch these poor bastards try and make sense of this lmao\"\n\n- Combat starts and ends quicker than your first fap after no fap november. Whoever sees the other one first is 99% more likely to win. Sounds good right? \"if im just observant ill be okay\" you say to yourself. Wrong, there is always someone camping in a decently populated server. \n\n- Base building is the most pointless endeavor known to man. Not only does it take God knows how long because of the material requirements and the crafting UI maze you must hurdle, but then its not even worth it. BECAUSE YOU CANT SPAWN IN THERE AND YOU CANT HOLD MORE THAN A FEW ITEMS DUE TO EXTREMELY STRICT STORAGE LIMITATIONS. imagine finally being able to kill another player and looting there body, only to find out you don't even have enough room to store everything on their body because the devs limited your storage so severely.\n\n- Glitches like you've never seen, many are lethal too so have fun running unarmed a few miles back to your body after clipping through a wall and it killing you. (laughs maniacally). Also the lag is pretty ridiculous.\n\n- Very poor performance, will eat up your cpu like a fat kid on an emotionally fueled eating binge\n\n- Devs do not listen to community.\n\n- Game has made and has continued to make turtle like progress in its development.  it wont be fixed.\n\n- Notice how in the trailer they make it look like you'll be fighting hordes of enemies onscreen? Yeah thats horse poop, you can literally kill every enemy in the town your in with a single pistol and fifteen rounds. Even that might be overkill if you're a decent shot. You will almost never (once in the butt crack of dawn) be killed by the zombies. You are more likely to step away from your computer to take a quick piss and come back to find a single zombie unluckily found you then to be killed in actual AI combat. It is so underwhelming. \n\n- want to play by yourself? Well unless you know all about port fowarding and server hosting. If you do, awesome! then maybe (and i mean maybe) you can get it to work because that too is (you guessed it) buggy as hell. Otherwise youll be stuck playing with other people who i guarantee will ass rape you into quitting. Your best bet honestly is to message a private server admin to see if theyll let you into their PVE server. But again, PVE is a freaking joke so whats the point of that to begin with.\n\nTheres more but i need to eat dinner and im done wasting my time with this game any longer. \n\nSummation: Some decent features but the horrendous negatives so far outweigh them that this game is not even close to be worth buying. If you do i guarantee youll be frustrated, underwhelmed, and generally disappointed. Its one of those games that look good but its not. Its like that chick who's pretty from fifty feet away but if you get closer you notice the unibrow and buckteeth.

Grabbed his gear and moved on.  Found another body with a cross... necklace... thing... I took it for good luck. After walking around for an hour trapped in the wilderness, checking out the graphics and immersity. I then stumbled upon a player, gave him a helmet and hammer. I never saw him again. I then found a bridge and found a fresh spawn, gave him gloves... Never saw him again. After continuious walking in circles in the wilderness I finally found civilisation. I looted the suberbs and found an empty gun. I then heard somebody in the house next to me. Curious, I stepped outside, and saw the dreaded Bushman waiting in the plants outside. I ran for my life, then circled into another house and found a clip of ammo. Confident I walked outside with my new weapon. Annnnd... the Bushman was waiting outside, he opened fire first, I returned fire.He had much more ammo, I eventually ran into a bush and waited for my demise.I then did not accept defeat, I rushed him with my hatchet.And then... I got capped in the head and fell over and died. Bushman will pay...\n\nDay 2:\nAfter dieing horribly, I respawned somewhere in the country side, I then saw a mutant.\nIt killed me very easily. I then respawned yet again and actually did some looting in sultan. I was then attacked by a Mutant, died horribly. Yet another respawn, I started to loot yet again, I then was attacked by ANOTHER mutant. I barely survived. After I healed up I went outside, I was then in the middle of a gun fight between 2 people. The Bushman and a guy with pink pants. Bushman ran away, but pink pants opened fire on me. I ran for my life, having no firearm at the time I always had to keep running away from basically everything. I thought going into the mall to look for bandages was a good idea... I then saw 4 people all standing in the corner. I was killed instantly...\n\nDay 3:\nAfter yet again being mowed down by a storm of bullets, I looted various houses around the countryside. I was lucky to find a gun and 1 clip of ammo... Seems familiar. I then walked, and walkeduntill I reached a bridge.I saw someone in the distance...It was... BUSHMAN! We starred at eachother, waiting for somebody to fire the first shot. He eventually gave in and opened fire. I fired back. I was the better aim, I thought I had the advantage. I then saw movement to my right, he had friends, 2 of them to be exact. I fired my last clip of ammo into them, then began to run into the forest.\nNot surprsingly I bled out in the forest... Time to start again... I respawned yet again, and walked all the way back to Sultan. I was pretty sure I wouldn't get my gear back, I would die trying. After getting myself a hatchet and gear, it was getting dark. I had just finished scavenging a house, I walked outside into the night then 2 people walked right on up. I said hi, they said hi, then they bashed me on the head. I briefly replied by slamming my hatchet into his shoulder. I fought with them toe to toe, dodging attacks and swinging my hatchet at them. But I was outnumbered, They had more firepower than me. I ran towards a bridge, with them on my tail. I knew they would follow me to the end of the earth. That gave me an Idea, so I said to them: \"You know kids, it's been real fun but I ain't giving you the pleasure\". So I dove off the bridge myself, I died instantly, but atleast they wouldn't have the pleasure of killing and looting me. I then heard to splashes in the river... They were that dumb to jump into the river and cause their deaths... They weren't the sharpest knives in the drawer.\n\nDay 4:\nI respawn back near Sultan again, and begin to loot. I get some Green Camo gear and a hatchet then went afk inside the church for a bit. On my return I see a man with a Black Helmet, Black jacket, Black boots and gloves... With no pants. He seemed hesitant, he kept peeking through the door. Then he struck, he sliced me with his own Hatchet, I soon retaliated. We decided to take this outside, then the battle began. It was intense, I landed the most hits, and he was wounded. Then I turned around and saw another man in the same Uniform as the other, but with a gun. I'll take you both on! I fought and fought, blood stained the floor, and hatchet man was weak, he retreated behind the church and ran for his life. Gun guy was still trying to shoot me. But I closed in and kept on slicing him up. He was getting weak as well. He retreated to the front of the church. I followed.Just as I thought I had him, We both turned the corner and... There were... 8 other people... All with Black helmets, jackets and boots... All with no pants... And all had a gun pointed at my head. I then thought to myself at this exact moment: \"Well crap, it's Attack of the Clones all over again\". I realised the error in my ways and tried to run. Obviously you know I never make it out alive.\nI then respawned, l proceeded to look through various houses trying to find something to protect myself with. I then walked into a small house with only 2 floors. As I walked upstairs I saw some blood on the wall, there was a dead body slouched on the floor under the blood stains... Fully geared. The clone army must've gotten to him. I grabbed his gear and ran outside. I then saw another man, we looked at eachother briefly and he walked off towards the petrol station. I turn around and see some scouts from the clone army run towards me... Hurray... I hid in some bushes and they walked right past me... Hiding is so easy. The only problem is, I think they just killed that man I met. Hopefully they thought it was me Just when I think I'm safe I walk out of my bush, And get shot by the clone army...\n\nDay 5:\nI began to loot Sultan yet again... I got a gun, some military gear, and was punched to death by a man in yellow. I respawned and found 2 dead bodies on the road, each with guns. A man I passed earlier also saw this, grabbed a gun from a body and shot me twice. Unluckly for him, I had a weapon as well. 6 shots hit his stomach. He fell to his knees looking at me, dropped his gun, fell down and died. I then met a man and showed mercy on him, he'd wandered into the fight. I pormised I'd protect him and I did. I got him gear and weapons, we then decided to go our seperate ways. I then found a jungle camo shirt and was shot in the very same house where I lost my other Military Gear. I respawned yet again and found a dead body near a gas station. I took his loot and walked down to Sultan, then gunshots ran out and 2 bullets landed next to me... It came from... A bush... At that moment I knew who he was and what he wanted. It was Bushman. I ran back towards the gas station and hid. I waited for awhile then moved up to the road. I looked for every possible angle he could've shot me from. I turned my head and saw a man running up another road. Bushman... I followed him in hot pursuit. I followed him through the bushes to avoid detection. I went down a dirt road and saw a dead body, he was definitly here. I then followed him throughout the countryside. I heard his footsteps now and again but never saw him. He was a master of stealth. I followed him to the trailer park and heard him rummaging through a fridge, I ran over the that direction when I took a shot. He was here alright, and he knew I was following him. I lost his trail eventually and headed back to Sultan were I got myself a hatchet and better clothing. As I was looting one house I heard gunshots ring out. I ran outside to see Bushman chasing a man down. I followed, as I turned the corner I saw Bushman standing over the body of the man he was chasing. He'd killed him. I snuck up behind him and struck, brining my hatchet down into his neck. He turned around and tried to hit me with his hammer, but it was no use. He was weak after his previous fight. Just as I was about to stike him down...

You have an outstanding game that is equivalent to DayZ Standalone. In my honest opinion, i would rather spend my day playing this game and dieing, than playing DayZ. Here's WHY.\n\nClean movement. The controls feel great, your characters animations are very fluid, and whats extremely important in a game of this genre, is the GUN PLAY. The gun play is very well done. Theres recoil, bulet drop, and holy shit, your character doesnt take 25 seconds total to finish the swapping gun animation. \n\nImmersive Environment. Theres bears, wolves, mutants, mutant spiders, roaches, and hulk like mutants. On top of that, the forest is full of crafting capabilities and can be survived in almost entirely without scavaging houses. YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY CRAFT GUNS BEFORE SOMEONE FINDS ONE. THIS IS MAJOR. Rust was the only other game I played personally, that allowed this feature. Everyone knows games like this are KOS. the ability to craft a rifle that is just as capable of killing as any other \"found\" gun is game changing. You get sick, you get hungry, thirsty and even cold. Makes surviving more of a necessity. \n\nACTUAL GAMEPLAY: You will absolutely spend hours. (On average about 3) to loot enough high quality loot spots before you get gear. THIS sucks. the loot spawns are fruitful when there are larger populations on servers but unfortunatley the servers are dead. The ones that are not dead are filled with non English speakers, meaning communication is broken and you will just fight everyone you meet. DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT PVE. This game provides a PvE experience ontop of a PVP game. That means, the game is cruel and unforgiving. You will lose your gear and waste plenty of time. Thats a feature of the game. Do not buy if you hate looting. Thats all this game is with a few small pvp moments. In my entire play time i have less than 20 actual shoot outs. mostly I play a hunter and murder unsuspecting players.\n\nMY FINAL VERDICT.\nDon't buy it. It's a great game, the developers have worked hard providing content and updates but they failed to do that in a manner that was rewarding for the already dwindling player base. Unfortunatley DayZ as crap as it is, has more players which makes this game genre work really well. Without players, you're just looting and surviving alone. I love this game and will continue to come back periodically. I have been able to continue playing but ALL of my friends hate this game because in the end it is sadly BORING. PLEASE ENTRADA INTERACTIVE, Start fresh. just clean the slate and build a new game. I want to enjoy this so bad but its so lonely. PLEASE. You can beat DayZ. You can be the best, you just gotta restart because you lost your window of oppurtunity. Zombie Survivals are dead without proper advertising.

Plenty to explore on a large-scale map with a number of civilization \"hotspots\" being a few medium sized towns to loot, with smaller hamlets, structures or camps spread throughout. \n    Gameplay is dynamic in the sense that you must look to find items hiding within the game world in order to take them (sometimes well hidden, or blending in with the look of the surround area) and not simply point at a bunch of cupboards and click to 'search'. \n    Basebuilding is similar in that there is (currently) no Snap-Too function, moving your character and your camera angles around you decide where to place different base parts freely, so long as the placeable template allows.\n    No Zombies - in keeping with the games background story; \"Mutants\" are your AI enemy, they are fast, they hit hard, but they're not indestructable if you own a gun - with ammunition.\n\n\nNegatives:\n\n  The server issues are definitely a pain, the Devs are working on various networking issues both for in-game item synchronisation and connectivity. However meanwhile, expect there to be various times your unable to connect to your desired server.\n\n  No storage currently. Although this is definitely planned for the future, they intend to stabilise the network before implementing this. Meaning your pockets and inventory slots are all you have to store items in, providing you don't exceed your carrying weight of 40Kg. There are rare cars throughout which can store items, if your able to obtain one and hide it.\n\nItem synch - as mentioned, there are some issues which can sometimes cause your loot to despawn should you attempt to drop it out of your bags temporarily, or pass it to another player.\n\n\nPositives:\n\n  The game looks and feels beautiful, with even further plans to update the realistic graphics on the next game engine's update.\n\n  The Devs are active, and open about their progress. Roughly each month they have an hour long stream or so revealing planned updates and explanations on progress thus far.\n\n  There is a background story, not much has been disclosed but there is evidence around, messages left, and the general feeling of what went on starts to build. This definitely makes the game feel it has more depth, and helps the world come alive.\n\n  Just generally the game is good fun. Mutants pose enough of a threat to be a cause for concern, PvP'ers the same when entering larger towns. Loot isn't too scarce depending on whether somebody's looted your area recently. There's a variety of clothes, melee weapons and guns to gear up. Crafting recipes are \"learnable\" if you can find them, and you don't lose any new guides you've learnt by dying.\n\n\nSummary:\n\n  I definitely would recommend this game to people who enjoy a similar genre. It seems this game is still slightly under the radar, but easily has the potential and direction of becoming a serious contender - both with gameplay and looks.\n\nP.S:  This is the first i've reviewed a game, so I hope it was helpful.

Yes, there are bugs and glitches that drive us all insane, however, you can't deny that it is beautiful.\n\nNow, here is where I think the game is seen negatively and why I believe the reviews here are mixed.\n\nI think the developers were trying to please two audiences by having PvP and PvE. I don't think PvP works with how this game is designed. I have read so many reviews on here where people are upset because they spawn in and immediately die. If you were in an apocalyptic world trying to survive why would you kill each other? I get it, PvP but does it work? You get a handful of players in PvP that want to team up and survive, but then you have those players who just want to kill everyone off and not even communicate with anyone on the server. This reminds me of The Division and why it flopped so soon. If you want to go shred through players and win a \u201cchicken dinner\u201d go play PUBG or H1Z1 those games are designed for this type of player. \n\nThe hours I have played in this game have been spent in a Whitelisted PvE server called 'The Sanctuary' The name is true to the experience. I fell in love with this game because of how the game is played on this server. You are in a world where you are trying to survive. There are rules in place to keep the game experience pleasant. The best part? No floating bases. A community that plays together and has built relationships with one another because they want to survive together. We help each other find loot we need, help build bases, teach new players how the game works, etc. Every single player matters. If you die, you better believe we send everyone out to help you get your loot back. That's what it's all about. \n\nOn whitelisted servers you can find a place that works for your play style. It\u2019s very difficult to find a server with an admin who stays on top of their game. One who doesn\u2019t play favorites, who has rules in play to make the game easy and comfortable, who boots people because they are breaking the rules, and who has trusting moderators. I\u2019m lucky to have found that place.\n\nI really wish everyone could experience this game that way because I believe that's how it is meant to be played. I love Miscreated so much and want to see it be successful. I hope those of you who read this found this helpful and if you didn\u2019t I understand, to each their own.

I cannot wait for the new item system and storage. As of right now this game is def worth a buy but please be aware that right now the game is mostly just exploring and PVP.\n\nThe first 50 hours or so, will be exploring the wonderful, pretty, immersive world that the Devs have created. After that, all you will be doing is walking the map ( or camping a certain spot of the map which is weak, but w/e) for people to shoot. Trust me, I have over 1k hours in the game, and I have been PVPing like crazy. One thing that blows me away in this game is the water Physics. When you shoot the water, you can see it tread, and you can see the bullet wiz through the water. Amazing Yoo. \n\nAs of right now, I have been laying low on Miscreated playing other survival games just waiting for the new content and storage system. I know for certain once they add storage, Miscreated will once again be my main and favorite game.\n\nOne thing people need to be aware of is that the game does take a lot to run. It is made off the Crytek engine which is obviously very graphic intensive and harsh on your PC. I mean my GPU which is a 770 OC gets up to 80 C on this game. I can run the game on low settings with 60 FPS (with Frame Drops in towns). Also this game is not very optimized with AMD cards. It will work, but you wont get the best experience out of it.\n\nAnyways like I mentioned earlier in my review, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes open world survival PVP games. This game feels like a much much, much more polished up DayZ in almost every way. Just buy it Yoo and support the wonderful, active Devs. This game is going to go a loooong way.\n\nUpdate: Still really enjoying this game with friends. Been waiting for the next patch. The only thing that is holding the game back right now is the various crashing. Very frusterating. Really hope this is addressed in the next patch. Biggest flaw of the game Imo. Looking forward to the future progress of the game :D\n\nUpdate: (7/2/16) Patch #36 has arrived with a bunch of new content and gameplay. With this patch released now, the game is blowing up. This means, all the servers are completely full. So far I am really enjoying this patch. Players can now finally store items they scavenge around the world. Although this patch was nearly perfect, it also introduced a major gameplay flaw. At this moment, Melee has recieved a major buff. This basically means, that players can now completely dominate in PVP with various melee weps. In addition, Headshots seem to be turned off right now. I am not sure if this is intended by the Devs, or just a bug. These 2 major flaws have affected PVP greatly, but I have faith the Devs will hopefully reconize the issues and fix them. With that being said let me talk about the big new city.\n\nThe big new city that was added in the recent patch is outstanding. I mean, it is done very well. I have played loads of survival games out there, and the main city in Miscreated is probably one of the best that I have seen. There is just so much to it and the devs will be unlocking more of it in the near future. The only thing that bothers me is that the city just feel way to big for the player cap on the server. Currently it's 36 slots per server, but I believe the Devs are looking to expand on this sometine in the future. Overall, even though the PVP has taken a big hit this patch, I still am going to reccomend picking this game up. I honestly feel, if the Devs keep this dedication up for the game, Miscreated might be the very few of the genre to move on out of Alpha stage of development.\n\nNow wouldn't that be amazing.\n\n+1\n\nUpdate: (4/9/2018) I am sad to say that this game has gone downhill since I last reviewed a while back. The game does not feel the same as it used to. The devs have added more dense bushes and foilage into the map, that were not there previously and this has really promoted camping. I have not touched this game in over a year due to this issue. Back in the days, we would have great fun having firefights in the street of Pinecrest, but now, because of the Dev's direction of the game, majority of folks sit in bushes in high traffic areas. They have focused way too much on Hayward, and the highway to hayward adding countless bushes at each military checkpoint and on the way. I might check back on the game in another year or two, but as of right now, I am not intrested.\n\nIn addition, they have increased the mutant spawn timer, and the total spawns of the mutants. Now you come across 2-3 mutants every few minutes even in random locations. This makes the game overlly challenging because you have to keep a melee weapon on you at all times, and even than, you will mostly likely get swarmed and die, or get very low HP which results in spending a good 10 minutes healing back up every so often.

I have been playing this game almost everyday for over 4 years now, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. I started out playing alone on different servers slowly learning the game. I remember how tense sneaking around towns was at first, trying to find gear, guns, and food without getting killed. I mean this game can make your heartbeat increase rapidly at times! Then I started meeting people in game and began playing together with some great people! Had a lot of group shootouts at the military base a while back that i'll never forget. I now mostly play on pve servers with my friends and love making different base designs, exploring new content when patches come out, and experimenting/goofing off type of stuff(you know, like blowing up fuel cans under vehicles and watching them fly ;). Sometimes i just like to go for a drive in vehicle and maybe hit some jumps or go searching for some metal base parts to drag around. The Devs for this game are great as well! They Listen to the community and take feedback seriously. It's also one of the only games that gets me excited when a new update is released! It has recently left early access alpha and gone into 1.0 beta! My favorite thing about Miscreated is how well it brought me together with the whole Miscreated community, and with my friends that I play with almost everyday.

If you immerse yourself in the community you will have an incredible realistic and unique experience. The memories I have made in this game will last a life time. It will make a diference in your gaming experience\n\nThe meat and potatoes:\n\nYou will start this game, and you will suck, badly. You will be lost, you will have a hard time finding things, and you will have a minor heart attack upon your first death. Be warned now, this game is not for the faint of heart. This game can turn on a dime. One minute youre enjoying the sounds of your feet running through the grass and the birds in the sky, and in the next moment your peaceful world is shattered by the sounds of gun fire. If youre lucky to survive you will sit behind cover with your heart racing and your hands shaking. If you manage to kill someone on your first life then youre off to a good start, but dont get too attached.\n\nThings are hard to find in this game, and thats what makes it all worth while. You will have to search every nook and cranney to find things, and if you do you will be rewarded. But thats easy compared to staying alive. While you search there will be someone lurking and they will hunt you. There is alot of overgrowth in the post apocalyptic world, plenty of cover for a hunter. Soon, the game will break you, and you will adopt a kill on sight mentality. Its kill or be killed in this game but there is a way to make companions. Most of the friends I have now I met during a standoff. Sometimes it helps to deescelate a situation by communicating (CAPS button - hold down or double tap) in game. If trust is mutal and earned then the reward is great. You will share items, experiences and your influence in the hostile world will grow.\n\nBefore you know it youre building a base with these people you almost didnt trust. Its a good feeling knowing that you earned these companions. Your base will suck and most likely be raided within a few days by more experienced players. Be prepared for that. And dont become too discouraged, instead use it as fuel to hunt and raid those who stole from you. \n\nSoon you and your teamates will become a clan and if youre on a populated server you can particpate in my favorite aspect of the game: clan rivalries. From the brazilians, to the polish, the mayor and his government goons; all of whom were characters in an epic struggle for server dominance. You will discover whose base belongs to who, and you will find out when they are online and you will hunt them. You will fight to have it all: the cars, the guns, tents, gear and an impenetrable base. The most exciting times I have ever had in the game is when I was raiding someone online or being raided while online. Its an incredible unique experience, considering how massivly difficult a base raid is to accomplish. And when youve proven yourself to be the baddest clan, people will recognize you by name. People will talk about you and its so funny to me when I hear about what other people say about me in game.\n\nAll in all I can say that miscreated has been one of the most rewarding and ABSOLUTLY BRUTAL games I have ever played.\n\nI saved the cons for last:\n-The physics are a serious issue in the game, from a development pov I feel as if this is the most dangerous things for the growth of the game.\n-The base building dynamics are a solid 6/10 and thats not a good thing.\n-The AI is currently a joke, however, recent models such as the bear are showing great improvment. Hordes are cool but they run at you in a straight line sometimes and that really kills the immersion.\n-To many weather changes can drain you\n-There needs to be a strong push from the miscreated marketing team, you cannot rely on streamers to make this game popular. it simply wont work because this game is not your typical streamer game. theres simply too much down time and will lose viewers intrests. This game is meant to be played not watched.\n\nBig shout out to APower Productions for providing quality content.\n\nThanks for reading my review, im happy to talk about the game in the comments below.

I realize the game came out in Early Access on Steam only a couple days ago. I will edit my \"review\" accordingly as updates inevitably come out.\n\nObviously heavily inspired by many survival games like it, Miscreated takes the current trend of Early Access multiplayer titles and makes sure to impress with what it can do with so little.\n\nFirst off, I don't care if it really isn't relevant, but the main menu music I absolutely love. Sad, but slightly haunting. It's a great track.\nYou probably know by now, this was made with the Cryengine, an amazing engine capable of gorgeous, but still well optimized visuals. This definetely has the key visuals of a game made with the Cryengine. Beautiful water effects and high res textures, pleasant lighting, and reflections. EVERYTHING has reflections. Water, puddles, oil leaks, oil barrels, picture frames, shower tiles. While they might not be very obvious, if you really pay attention, the detail is there. It's not very practical in any real way, but it looks nice most of the time.\n\nThis game immedietly packs a few weather effects, such as rain, clear skies, and heavy fog. It needs tweaking to look truly gorgeous.\nAlmost every building currently in the game is enterable, even this early in development. Most of them also are fully furnished, but a bit copy and paste. They get the job done for now, especially since the loot system relies on hiding items in cupboards, fridges, tables, cabinets, etc.\nSpeaking of loot, from what I've seen it's lacking as I type. I've searched the entire map twice (entire map being all the points of interest, rather than every inch of forest) and found a hatchet, a hammer, and three 9mm pistols. (EDIT 1/16/2015: There has been a recent patch that has added numerous weapons to the loot table. This include a shotgun, a .357, a .22 rifle, and a  .223 rifle, as well as several different melee weapons.) Other than that there are several different kinds of soda, a few various kinds of canned food, some rad meds, and bandages. There are also stone, nails, wood, and other small things to use in a vague crafting system. Finally, there are small various bits of clothing.\nYour loot may vary though. I'm not fully aware of how loot is spawned, or if it is based on how many players are in the server. Perhaps some more playtime will clear that up, but as of right now playing on a server of about 15 people for a few hours, I found very little of use other than food.\n\nCombat is basic, but functional. The pistol I found fires, but there's little impact or satisfaction from doing so. Melee weapons are a bit floaty as well. Combat isn't very inspiring, but it is functional.\nI emptied a full 10 bullet clip into my partner however for testing, and despite most shots seeming to hit his head, he didn't die. Either it was just buggy at that point, or the pistol is underpowered. \n\nPlayer interaction this early on is to be expected. I've come across mostly unequipped, cautious players just trying to get a feel for their surroundings in this new game. I only encountered one hostile player, who saw me in a house, 100% unarmed, motionless, and began to whack me with a hammer at which point I shortly died.\nPersonally, I rarely attack anyone, especially if they aren't obviously equipped. Last night while playing I ran into 5 players, none of which had any equipment, and one of them even followed my small group for awhile.\nAs for other enemies, there are very, very few scattered zombie like enemies. They aren't very threatening this early on, and mainly seem to serve as place holders. Their AI is weak, and there's only the one enemy at this point. I was able to outrun one and enter a house, at which point the zombie freaked out, ran around the entire house once, tried the door again, and then ran off nowhere to be found again.\n\nAs for content in general, there isn't that much. What it does have is much more promising than most other survival games I've seen. It has some decent bones. Only time will tell if the game will really unlock its full potential.\nMy suggestion, as well as many others, wait a few patches. Let them add more weapons, enemies, and bug fixes. \nThere are NO rebindable keys in game, which is stupid for any game on PC. Some of the default keybinds don't even make much sense.\nYou can't drown as far as I can tell. My partner and I decided to jump from a small bridge into the ocean for fun, at which point my partner exclaims in fear that he saw another person just floating in the water that wasn't me. Turns out it was a guy, just creepily chilling under the water for who knows how long. \n$25 just seems like just over the line for the value this game offers right now. It's not too outrageously priced, but you can buy other survival games with more content for equal or cheaper. Overall, I give this game a thumbs up, but only because it shows a lot of promise. It certainly needs work, and that's to be expected.\n\nPC performance:\nIt's alright. Again, it's a Cryengine game, which usually always perform well. It's very CPU intensive though. My aftermarket CPU fan really kicks on with this game, so much that I can slightly hear it through my headset.\nThere are a few framerate drops in towns, and even a few random ones that don't seem to make too much sense. I'm running an overclocked 780ti and overclocked AMD 8350 with 16 GB of RAM, and I get about 45-60 FPS in towns, and it dips all over the place when you spin the camera around.\nSometimes I'll randomly get drops to 30 FPS for ten seconds and then it will go back up above 60. Hopefully optimization is high up on the list of things to work on. No point in even trying the game if it runs terrible.\nEDIT 11/2/2014: They used puns in their patch notes. Best developer ever.

You can't make up your mind around them. You know what you want, but all of them has some flaws and most of them are in Early Access (some of them have been for ages) or just doesn't fit you right. Hope this review helps you to choose.\n\nSome of you might know a certain game called \"[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/226700/]Infestation: Survival Stories (a.k.a. WarZ)[/url]\", Me and my friends have been playing that game 7/24 back then. But the game has been abandoned for a long time, it was infested with hackers and in-game bugs, developers left the game and it's community to rot etc. You get the picture... Since then, we've been looking for a game like that. I've tried, DayZ and Rust before i find this beautiful game. DayZ was really complicated and wasn't really what i was looking for. About Rust, well, couldn't get used to it and didn't really met my expectations either.\n\nSo i've finally find Miscreated. The moment i launched the game, i knew that was it! I knew that's what me and my friends been looking for. I told them to buy it immediately (it was also on %50 sale, a week before this review). \n\nUntil they start, i've just explored and learned about the basics. Met some people in game, looted the towns and cities. It was good fun. But it even got better when my friends joined in. As you can expect from a post-apocalyptic survival game, they're way more fun with friends. \n\nMiscreated is an Open World, Survival game. You need to get food, drink and shelter in order to survive. There is also crafting system in the game, which means you'll need to build your own shelter. It'll be tense, scary, rewarding and sometimes funny and i promies that you'll get what you expect from a survival game.There are mutants in the game, instead of zombies, do not expect hordes of them though. It's like maximum 5-8 mutants in a city most of the time, sometimes none. The real challenge will be your communication skills with the other players in this game.\n\nLet's hit Pros & Cons:\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Decent Graphics\n[*]Mature Community\n[*]Filled Servers\n[*]Amazing Environment\n[*]Easy and Smooth Vehicle Controls\n[*]Solid Crafting System\n[*]Base Building\n[*]Active Developers (Streaming & Interacting with the Community)\n[/list]\n\nand more...\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Weak Graphics Optimization\n[*]Lack Of Allowed Storages\n[*]Rearely, Items Disappear On Drop  (when you try to give something to someone)\n[*]No In-game Map That Shows Your Location (There are maps in the game, but not really that helpfull)\n[/list]\n\n[b]Since it's still in Early Access, i can understand those flaws, but it's getting better with each update, and the developers are really active. So i have my hopes up about that it can get even better. If you're looking for a full post-apocalyptic survival experience, get it without having second thoughts. I'd even recommend it for it's full price. It's a beautiful game getting better each day.[/b]\n\n[i]Thank you, for reading my review about [b]Miscreated[/b].

I like the concept of the game, and from what I've been told it's a lot better than other games of the same style. But, in saying that I have a few opinions.\n\nI have been playing it for a while now and it's becoming monotonous. Go somewhere, stock up a bit of food, go somewhere else, stock up on more food, go to another place, etc..... I'm running out of things to do.\n\nPlayable area. The map is so small, with areas that are blocked off awaiting development. Yup, I know - it's early access, I'm not that stupid. But FFS, can you at least put some effort into developing the play area instead of wasting time on bringing in a new range of bike helmets? I  \nneed a bike helmet like I need a pair of Crocs.\nRecently you opened up the Hayward sewers. Yay, two kilometers of boredom. Places like this need to be rewarding and exciting, full of mutants and other nasties with rewarding items for your efforts. The bunkers are just as bad. Come on guys, get the map finished.\nThe last update stated that a new area East of Hayward opened up..... It's about the size of a parking lot void of any real reason to go there.\nI also hope more maps will become available in the future, but giddyup guys - it's taking way too long. Focus on the map and not artistic flourishes. I know, \"It's still in alpha\".\n\nBuilding and crafting. I feel that the building side of things need a little polishing. If you devs have a personal hatred toward snap points, then that's fine - each to their own, but please give us a key to select whether we want them or not. I have lost count of the amount of times I've placed something, only to pull it down and attempt to re-place it several times before I was satisfied with its position.\nWhy also can I not place an item on uneven terrain? An example would be a platform. Four posts, any of which could be buried in the ground upon placement or \"sawed off\" to suit the terrain. And if I were to place another right next to one, instead of it lining up to a flat surface the next one would end up much higher than the one originally placed. So if you were fortunate to be able to place say, four platforms it would somewhat resemble a BMX track with massive gaps between them. Good luck getting four sides of gap free walls on that mess.\n\nStorage. Oh storage. I understand that you want to grab a hold of our nuts and limit the amount of gear that we can posess to minimise the amount of alphas who could hold a monopoly on a server, but give us server owners the right to select an option for ourselves in the config file.\nOfficial servers are a different matter but we are paying a ridiculous amount of money to rent a server that we have no real say over what we can provide our players. I don't care about weather settings or the other inane and menial options, I want control over more important options.\n\nVehicles. Why TF is a vehicle disappearing after 48 hours of no login? I want to be able to spend a weekend with my family or go on holiday for more than two days without coming back to a base with no transport as it de-spawned. And while I'm on the subject, why limit the amount of vehicles on the server?\nThose with vehicles are smiling with their toes tapping, while others who come in once the vehicles are claimed have no transport whatsoever. If those holding vehicles crash and burn, their chances of finding a replacement are slim to none. Give us more vehicles to locate, or does the reasoning behind this come down to the storage strangle debate.\nThe main gripes I get are for lack of vehicles and storage, and these people stop playing the game altogether.\n\nPVP and PVE. I whitelisted my server as I had in the description no KOS or base raiding. Well, we had a bunch of !%@#s come in and start KOS and base raiding. It's impossible to scroll through and find the people responsible so I can place them on the ban list because the damage logs are ridiculously long.\nIf I state no KOS or base raiding then I should be able to configure my server in that manner. Cast your mind back to the paragraph on storage about more options, I should be able to flag this for no player or structure damage. Some people enjoy playing PVP, others do not and when they work for months to build something up on a PVE server, only to lose it while they sleep, on holiday or are are work is unacceptable.\n\nCarrying dynamics. Okay, let me get this right. I can place two wheels in the pockets of my T-shirt, but I can't place 20 rounds of .357 in the same spot?\nI have a bus that will hold X amount of people (unsure of the capacity), but I can't place more than ten pieces of paper (guides) in the inventory of the bus, but I can carry ?20 people.\nWhy can't a fully loaded backpack with, for example - ten cans of soda - be placed in the tray of a pickup? If I were to go camping I could place ten loaded backpacks, a tent, sleeping bags, and a whole bunch of other gear in the vehicle and have room to spare.\nHere it should again come down to the server configs of the renter, and again the storage strangle debate.\n\nGlitches. Too many to name but believe me whan I say they are numerous. Loot being half buried in whatever it's supposed to be sitting on (making half the loot next to impossible to find), mutants attacking and damaging through walls, vehicles flying into the air on a flat section of road, DC's, blank screens, black squares on screens where the rendering bugs out, Items dropped falling through the ground into a black hole of non-existance (dropping something for someone else to pick up is a hit and miss affair), falling under the terrain (My son was walking at the airfield and disappeared under the terrain, he literally swam to the ocean side under the land mass and popped up) the list goes on. Yeah, I know - \"It's still in alpha\".\n\nServers. Here's the kicker. Why do you have such a monopoly on who can provide the server? i3D are the only providers at present who we can rent off, and at the price that's being charged for a server that we can't configure to suit our preferences is nothing short of robbery. Oh yeah, I can go and shove it if I don't like it, go play another game, I also understand that. But this is why there is so much talk about there being kickbacks for exclusivity.\nIf I want to host this game on a personal server I can't, if I want to play this game by myself on my PC lone wolf style I can't, nor can I shop around for a better deal to save a bit of money on a game that just doesn't quite hit the mark at the present moment in time.\n\nIn conclusion, I like the game but I see it heading in a uncertain direction at the moment, and that's what's holding me back. I want to say it's a good game to play but the statements above lend weight to the descision that I've made that I will see the rental of the server until the next payment is due, then it's game over. I have seen many servers disappear over the time I've played which prompted me to rent one, but I understand why people give up and stop paying.\nI could just join the masses and play on another server but, will I be fortunate enough to find a vehicle? Will some griefer rob my base or KOS on a PVE server while I sleep? Will that server give up as a bad investment, just as I will be doing? Too many unanswerable questions that make me say that it's not worth playing the game.\nI was originally going to go to the official site and create a thread outlining everything above, but the moderators were slamming everyone with an opinion, banning people for an opinion, and defending the \"It's still in alpha\" statement. So here I am with a personal opinion at the point of sale of the game without fear of said opinion being banned.\nI get it - \"It's still in alpha\", but the direction and the lack of communication is just not apparent nor satifactory to me at this point in time.\n\nLet the hate begin...", "timestamp_created": 1498238841, "timestamp_updated": 1511427586, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 623, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.81179046630859375", "comment_count": 42, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25373720": {"recommendationid": "25373720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067386739", "num_games_owned": 1977, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 689, "last_played": 1475424488}, "language": "english", "review": "Been waiting for this game to officially release before making a review but as I have been summarily banned from the forums for speaking my mind I feel forced into posting now. \n\nHere is the post that got me banned.

Its their forums and they can ban whoever they want. But agressively banning and removing all sorts of criticism is a very big red flag and its a course of action habitually used by developer's to hide issues with the game.\n\nMiscreated has suffered from issues with its netcode and engine since it released. It has improved over time for sure and has gotten to be a decent game. This agressive censoring is troubling though as it shows a lack of professionalism from the team against criticism of their game.\n\nSanitizing comments about a game's problems is unprofessional. I was banned and my post removed as well. Did my comments hit too close to the truth or is this just a case of overzelous devs \"protecting\" their game's image?\n\nI leave it to you guys to consider.\n\n\nFirst edit: For a more comprehensive look at the issues with censoring and banning please look at the comments section. There is a whole conversation between myself and Jenilya (community manager) and Chrissprance (developer) on it that is quite informative for those wanting to have a wider view of the issue.\n\nSecond edit: The review was flagged as abusive by the developer's which Valve took into consideration and removed as unsubstantiated reasoning for it to be flagged at all.

I won't say it's BETTER than DayZ ,H1Z1,Rust or the myriad survival games out there, but it is the game I keep coming back to and am still having fun playing.\n\nOriginal Review Apr '15\n\nI'm a big fan of Miscreated and would recommend it even at this early stage of development. I've played and still play DayZ and played and had refunded H1Z1. I even log into Rust every now and again just to, you know, see what craziness is unfolding. \n\nWhat attracted me to Miscreated and I think it's biggest draw is the environment, it's beautiful in the truest sense of the word.  Obviously a game isn't and shouldn't just be about graphics, but in helping with immersion in a post apocalyptic world a rich full environment really helps with the game play. The towns feel overgrown like nature is reclaiming them, everything as a weight and substance about it. It's difficult to describe until you play it. \n\nCaveats : \n\nIt is most definitely an early access game (isn't everything these days). It's not perfect and the developers need to keep up the momentum of development to draw in new players and keep the old players interested and what I've seen they are giving it a good go live streaming, providing regular patches and updating the community. They'll be the first to admit they've had issues most recently network problems and I bought it as these problems were being solved as I saw the developers engaging and informing the community of their progress not just going silent.\n\nConclusion :\n\nThis isn't just a DayZ / H1Z1 clone and  I think it deserves to be played by more people.

You will probably see a lot of people in the same boat.   They have nothing either except some auto part you won't need for a long time.  You may spawn near a populated area but the mutants won't be you problem.  Some guys with 200+ hours will quickly kill you with machine guns.  The base building is bad too.  Years ago I suggested to the devs to utilize some of the crafting and base building of 7 Days To Die (great game for PVE and PVP.) but they would have none of that.  I asked if there are any official friendly or PVE servers.  Their response is no but here is a links to a lots of servers, some of which are friendly.  I never found any that let newcomers in or they were simply private.  Why not have official PVE servers?  PVE is how most learn games before they try PVP.

Why spend ages to loot houses when you can simply steal from your fellow man. The role of the bad guy is essential to this game as it gives the good \"team up\" guys somebody to fight as well as providing loot in a quick manner. \n\nThe bad element also makes meeting another player a tense scenario - Here is an example of one such meeting I had the other night. \nIts night, you are in a house searching for bullets to a gun you've found and you notice a flashlight searching a house across the road. Looking at the setup of the road its logical that the person is going to check this house next. You slow to a steady walk to reduce your footsteps in the house to avoid alerting the approaching stranger. Time to think about how this is going to play out - either they kill you or they simply say hello and move on. You know from previous rendezvous that its 70/30 that they will kill you for your loot. You have the upper hand with the dark and the opportunity of ambush, why take the risk? You watch them leave the house while turning off their torch and notice a back pack and a long barrelled weapon slung over the shoulder. Could be plenty of loot carried by this one.. You hear them enter the house and the tell-tale click of the torch, this means no weapon in-hand, another advantage. the mystery person searches the front room, kitchen and dining area and heads for the stairs... He stops as the light makes out a shape at the top of the stairs... We both sit there, me looking at the light of the torch, him looking at my shotgun pointed down the narrow staircase - no way he can dodge the blast at this range. A tentative voice comes over the in-game voice system \"Hey man\" I don't respond immediately... Now he's worried that death is seconds away, the last 30 - 40 minutes of him searching for loot could be wasted in this meeting in the dark. I know that if his flashlight switches off he has pulled a gun.. The moment is tense, I finally speak 'Got any ammo for the 1911 .45?'. He responds with a glimmer of hope 'Yeah sure, just don't shoot - I'll drop some at the bottom of the stairs on my way out' He back away still pointing the light my way until he reaches the hallway. His light then clicks off and he runs out the house, clearly not stopping to leave me any ammo. I realise then that I am still being to kind to these people and that I should have taken it in the stairway when I had the chance. Now he has the advantage, he knows I'm there he knows I have only one exit from the house. No point in searching the rest of this house now, not with the sense that I'm being watched. I wait for a minute to try to listen for footsteps - but nothing. I pull out a smoke grenade and slowly creep down the stairs so I can see the exit of the house, I toss the grenade so it will land just outside and let the smoke fill out before I run, out the door way and take an immediate right. Boom! a shotgun blast clips me and I'm bleeding. Can't stop now to attach a bandage, need to escape, I keep running, avoiding a straight path as much as possible weaving my way through gardens and round fences to avoid the killer behind me. I can hear the footsteps running to where he last saw me. I find a collection of bins and boxes next to a house and crouch to hide. I hear him come closer. He stops moving... tense again. I quickly apply a bandage and wait. Nothing, silence. He knows I've stopped and he is waiting for me to make the first move. I pull out my newly crafted pipe bomb and make a quick judgement on where I think he's stopped based on where I last heard him. I throw it. He realises what's happening and starts to run..., BOOM! Silence again, nothing, no sound. I wait for what feels like ages. I have to start moving now as I can't sit here all night. I equip my shotgun and approach his last know location.\u000b He's dead - I can see his prone body in the dark. I run up to it to search it for loot and BINGO! 1911 ammo :)\n\nThese are the types of scenarios that occur in this game everytime I play it, Sometimes I'm on the receiving end and lose all my loot that I have gathered for the past 30 - 40 mins but I know its give and take. Plus I should have done something different to avoid the death in the first place :)\n\nThere is alot yet to improve on in this game but they are making progress.

As I make my way past a small bridge dimly lit by yellow barricade, I see somthing scurry across the road in the distance. I figured it was the graphics poping up as I move, the game is still in alpha.\n\n I find two small military tents and proceed to loot them with my flickering flashlight for any gas or oil.

To an extent it is just that with many guns, character customisation and loot and PvP/PvE depending on which server you go on. \n\nAll of this is good but there are sadly a lot of little things that really drag this game down and I will list them. \n\n1. There is a chance that any time someone spawns they can die instantly through the map. This can happen while in play as well. \n2. This is not an optimised game by any means, frames at sub 30 at certain areas. \n3. This is by far my biggest gripe, base building, there is no snapping on objects so its all free form with no clipping either. This means mistakes are costly and any item that falls in your base will destroy items/cars/crates with it. Not to mention its very tedious to have to replace something several times just because it does not line up properly.  \n4. Limited carrying capacity via weight AND slot management, place go with just one or the other not both. \n5. Backpacks cannot be stored normally, they can only be safely stored in vehicles which can be accessed by anyone. \n6. You have limited storage space in a base, imagine if Rust only allowed you to make five storage boxes levels of small. \n\nThe Monsters in this game are a joke as you can outrun all of them aside from wolves and they often come in packs which are at the best of times annoying, at worst an instant death. \n\nOverall I want to really like this game, it has a lot of good qualities!

So, I will list some current pros and cons!\nLet's start with the pros!\n---Pros---\n~Frequent updates!\n~New content added often (some content-vehicles-were added faster than it took to add them in DayZ!)\n~Amazing graphics! (OFC, Cryengine)\n~Fluid animations.\n~Smooth gameplay mechanics.\n~The mutants (NPC enemies) are actually a pretty big threat, unlike in DayZ, and they look sick!\n~Map is pretty big (not HUGE, but big)\n~Lots of gear (cosmetics, weapons, etc)\n~The devs actually CARE and LISTEN (unlike DayZ, once again)\n~I haven't encountered a single hacker, and neither have any of my friends who play.\n~Server sync! If you have gear on one server, it transfers to all other servers!\n\n---Cons---\n~Performance. It runs fine (medium-low) on a mid range PC, but if you wanna max it out you'll need a pretty nice PC. (I max it out on a GTX 780 SC paired with an i7 4790k, also OC'd. I get a consistent 60 fps on ultra with SMAA, only an occasional drop to around 55 fps when entering a large area.\n~Lack of players. However, I have seen an increase players recently.\n~Price. In my opinion, it is worth $25. However, there are some performance issues for lower end PCs and the lack of players might veer you away for that price.\n~SOME lack of content. Crafting is a bit weird and you can't craft much ATM, but that's okay with me.\n---------------------\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game. It has a lot more going for it than against it, in my opinion.

Why not?\"[/i]\n\nI wasn't expecting much since I've been crawling through all sorts of survival games in the past and they all seem to revolve around the same idea:\n\t- Major catastrophic scenario / Post Apocalypse\n\t- Hunger, thirst, weapons\n\t- More PvP than PvE\n\t- Zombies / Mutants\n\nAnd Miscreated fits right in there. You are a survivor, scavenging for gear, food and crafting materials - trying to make the best out of a bad situation. You're surrounded by mutants and other players, also known as \"the bandits\". I know, I know. There are good guys there too. (until you give them a weapon and accidentally turn your back on them)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=814723346 \nHells, we've all seen this scenario by now. What makes this game different from that one certain zombie mod over a war simulation game or it's standalone offspring, is that Miscreated is actually built just for this. It's not a \"somewhat working\" adaptation of some other game and it feels damn good to play a zombie survival game that actually has a fluent inventory system, very nice graphics and great performance all around.\n\nThe world seems detailed, the ambient sounds, light and shadow effects etc. but as I'm writing this (December 2016) it's still missing the wildlife, weather system and the \"feel of danger\". The world feels huge and the current player cap of 36 players feels very low on such a big place. It almost feels like you need a drop of luck to even see another player, though I guess that makes to post apoc feel more like, well post apoc.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=816586578\nYour only actual threat at the moment are the other players - there's only a few squishy mutants walking around and you see them quite rarely. I did see some bigger tankish variations too but only once. I'm optimistic these things will get more attention in later development. \n\nThere's enough of different types of gear, clothing, vehicles and gunporn in game already which makes Miscreated in it's current state very much playable and enjoyable. Oh, and from what I've gathered you make a character into a server and it stays on [b]that[/b] server. [i]Take that fools![/i] There is no server hopping, moving into a good position, then switching on to another server to grind the same loot over and over again.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=815859553\n\n--\n\nOf course the game is nowhere near complete being in early access, but I do see a lot of potential in it already. From what I've seen and tested, many of the mechanics in game at the moment do work nicely and the vehicles & base building is a nice addition too. I'm eagerly waiting for more content to the game.\n\nIf you're a survival game fanatic like me and like to see the sights before the riffraff settles in, I think now is the perfect opportunity to give this game a spin - and for a wallet friendly -50% price!", "timestamp_created": 1481329558, "timestamp_updated": 1482935649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769345939159393311", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33714386": {"recommendationid": "33714386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039233511", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6091, "last_played": 1618004185}, "language": "english", "review": "Quick review to help the Mixed 62% reviews.\nSo you bought DayZ a couple years ago and was disapointed...

And seriously, you still haven't extended the draw distance for the trees? Holy crap that looks terrible. It allows you to see holes in the terrain where cave systems are, players can be seen because bushes don't draw and bases look like big boxed objects you can see despite the fact they could be hidden in trees. Its a joke.\n\nAnd people give DayZ such a hard time. The games have reversed and now Miscreated could only dream of being half the game DayZ is. Cryengine made this game look amazing and the fast smooth movement and combat made it super fun. The base building was my thing and i spent literally hundreds of hours making some incredible bases, it was the best base building system of any game. \n\nI'll share a little story that might highlight why it sucks to see this game die like it has.\n\nI loved this game so much back in the day i even hired my own server. It was a place i could build bases and do anything i wanted with my mates and never have to worry about anyone raiding or perhaps building bases in places we wanted to ourselves. It was great. Now i hired this server right when there was a huge almost game breaking bug that drove away a lot of the player base. This bug stopped headshots from working, so it didn't matter what gun you used, a headshot wouldn't kill anyone. The first thing i noticed on my server was headshots were actually working. So i contact the devs and let them know and.. nothing.  No reply, nothing. I think it was weeks, maybe even months before that bug was fixed and despite telling the devs about headshots working on my server and suggesting that maybe its got something to do with new servers, they couldnt fix it. Fast forward to the day they announce a fix and they say it turned out to be new server specific files / changes that their internal servers had, which weren't distributed to the public servers already running, or something similar. Yeah, no shit.\n\nAnother issue i came across that I shared with the devs but again this fell on deaf ears, was base building exploits. Despite enjoying the exclusiveness of having the biggest bases around, i told the devs that you could make bases twice as high by placing a plot sign, building a 3 meter high tower of stairs, build a fireplace on it, and then get a clan mate to disassemble the base while you stand on the fireplace. The fireplace would remain floating in the air, and you could place a new plot sign on it, allowing you to build bases twice as high as normal. I dont know how long it took them to fix this one, but i had moved on to DayZ by this point and never came back.\n\nI dont want to bad mouth the devs or the game because i know how hard it is to make games, but its really sad to see a game you loved go down hill so much.\n\nI just cant recommend this when there's games like DayZ which provides a much better survival experience.\n\nIf they can improve the draw distance, get rid of all the radiation crap and ridiculous screen effects, it might be fun, but i dont know if its enough.

Unlike other titles in the \u2018always alpha\u2019 open world survival genre, it appears to have a lot of genuine promise. It is because of this that I\u2019ve been bothered to write a load of words about it. The world is immersive, beautiful in parts and there are possibilities to build bases and fix up vehicles to drive around. It could be a great balance of challenge and exploration but it is held back by fundamental flaws in the gameplay that continue to be ignored by the developers. \n\nYou may find it encouraging seeing updates but these are just not addressing the major issues. I have had this view for a while and it has recently been echoed by the hosts of a decent server who could no longer justify its running cost. Their reason? \u201cWe are having too many issues with vehicles and items disappearing, and gameplay in general. The developers refuse to respond to our tickets\u201d. \n\nSimply put, there are so many recurring bugs and irritating features in the game that there is little incentive to invest time in your character. I will focus below on the main ones that bother me:\n\nDeath is a big problem and the punishment is dropping your inventory and possibly respawning on the other side of the map. It may take 10 minutes to run back to the spot where you died, while avoiding mutants and staving off hunger and thirst. Of course, it can be argued this is 'harsh but fair' and simply part of such a game. However, death can come through no fault of your own. When encountering a mutant, an inevitability while scavenging, the fight is almost always painfully glitchy. I have seen this on many different servers, so it is not a latency issue. The mutant could be facing the wrong way and still hit you, you could kill it in two direct hits or it\u2019ll fail to die in ten. It is a coin flip whether I die or not in such an encounter. From my experience, guns appear to do little more damage than a melee weapon but ammunition is so rare that I don\u2019t see the point in using them anyway. I regularly see mutants stuck on walls or bits of vegetation, being spooked by nothing, suddenly running off and then scampering back to attack. How this has not been sorted out by a competent team of developers is beyond me. \n\nCrafting in Miscreated should be a good feature in a game of this type. You can create unique weapons, like the sawblade baseball bat. Despite having both a baseball bat and saw blade in my inventory, I was sadly unable to craft this item for reasons unknown. Crafting goes further with the possibility of constructing your own base. You will first need an axe or hatchet (to chop wood for lumber) and a box of nails in order to create a sign to claim some land. Finding key items like an axe/hatchet and nails can sometimes take an hour of scavenging and then losing them upon death is a major setback. Building a base should be fun but it isn\u2019t. It requires endlessly swinging at trees and clearing your inventory as wood is too heavy. Dropping something is a risk as there's a 50:50 chance it will just disappear for good. Creating the numerous types of components out of lumber is a tedious exercise and could be easily simplified. Once you have made your section of wall or floor, you will likely find that placing it is no straightforward task. It is difficult to line up parts neatly and sometimes it is impossible to place due to a mischievous blade of grass, for example, in the way. Miscreated just needs to implement a simple yet creative building system and look to games like Rust or Conan for its basis.\n\nVehicles should\u2019ve been a great addition to the game and yet finding all the parts to get them running, along with oil and fuel, can take a lifetime. It is very satisfying once you get a vehicle working but this only lasts until you get stuck on a small rock or fail to reverse up a gentle slope to free yourself. Fuel and oil can mysteriously drain fast, so you\u2019re back to looking for heavy cans of gas in the surroundings. Botched vehicles can cause a lot of server issues, meaning more glitches and lag.\n\nThe hunger and thirst meters are fine to manage and the game is superior to similar survival titles, like Day Z, in most aspects. The graphics and the atmosphere created by the weather effects are great. This is what usually brings me back, along with the game being basically playable with a friend. However, the glitches and bugs, bizarre combat, harshness of death and mind-numbing crafting make this game impossible to recommend in its current state. The developers need to use their updates to fix the gameplay's fundamental problems. Sadly, I would not be surprised to re-read my comments in a year\u2019s time and find the game to be exactly the same aside from a few superficial changes. I do sincerely hope the people behind Miscreated listen to the critcism and act on it, as this game could really be so much more.", "timestamp_created": 1496147822, "timestamp_updated": 1496147822, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 215, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768050611019134521", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24510488": {"recommendationid": "24510488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021254015", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 20711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2300, "last_played": 1595432333}, "language": "english", "review": "Miscreated is just really and underrated game.

But having played around with it for ~4 hours already, I can tell that this is definitely one of the more polished, immersive, and focused, \"zombie\" (mutants) survival games. \n\nGraphically, the game is unmatched in the world of Early Access survival games. The Crytek engine has always been able to make games look great, but it's the art direction this game has, specifically, that makes it stand out. Referring to something like H1Z1, you'll notice that the world in that game simply does not look like it's been hit by a zombie virus. The world is clean and has a very bland, uninspired art design. Miscreated, thankfully, understands that just because you're in EA doesn't mean you can't look great at the same time. Scavenging through buildings feels creepy (particularly at night), and the world is both bright and beautiful, but dreary and destroyed. I would actually say it's closest counterpart- at least visually, would be Fallout 4's art style.\n\nGameplay-wise, if you've played other zombie survival games, you'll have a general idea of what to expect here. You roam an open map, searching through buildings and rubble looking for supplies to stay healthy and armed to defend yourself. The scavenging in the game is very immersive, and thankfully avoids throwing menu after menu at you while playing. Looking at games like H1Z1 or 7 Days To Die, they both have \"loot tables\", meaning you'll spend most of your scavenging time clicking on containers, waiting a couple seconds, and then seeing what the game spawned in the menu that pops up. Miscreated actually loads all its items in as physical objects in the world, so you spend very, very little time looking at menus and loot tables, and instead spend your time feeling directly connected to the world looking for loot in half-opened cupboards or on shelves, etc.\n\nThe only real issue I have, gameplay-wise, with the game right now, is that combat feels just as clunky as any other survival game that I have played. Melee attacks feel light and it can be hard to tell when you've even hit an enemy at all. This is something I hope to see addressed very soon by the devs, as the overall polish that this game has feels counter to the fairly lackluster combat.\n\nBut, overall, this is an excellent \"zombie\" survival game that looks and plays great, and most importantly, is being very actively developed. A quick look at the update logs for this game will show you that at most, around every 3 weeks, the devs will drop a large content patch to the community with pretty significant improvements. This is what hurts so many survival games in general. It's what has killed my interest in games such as H1Z1, Project Zomboid, etc. An Early Access game that feels like it is constantly evolving for the better is a rare find on Steam, and I would suggest not letting Miscreated be an EA game to pass you by if the premise of an immersive, open-world, survival game, sounds right for you.", "timestamp_created": 1455960045, "timestamp_updated": 1455960045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762713968753814697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117891282": {"recommendationid": "117891282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068550175", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 180352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169522, "last_played": 1711758053}, "language": "english", "review": "easily could've been one of the best survival games of all time.

The survival aspect is good, but not overwhelmingly awesome.  Currently, you have to loot for food or find alternatives growing in the wild.  There are rumors of farming, but not sure it will help due to raiding.  As of now, anyone with a few tires can somehow jump multiple layers of 10 and 12 meter fencing and steal all your stored gear.  That stinks because you have to leave some of your gear behind when going on a supplies run.  Also, as mentioned before, people are what ruin the game.  If you run into another person, 50% of the time, they shoot you on site, 40% of the time they feign surrender only to blow your face off, 9% of the time you actually pair up with someone and spend an hour looting together only to be blasted in the back of the head by that same person once you have something they want, and the remaining 1% run away. I've only played solo, so maybe if you had an actual friend watching your back, it would be OK.  If you go it alone, you will constantly be starting over, finding new gear, getting a gun and finally finding ammo for it only to be sniped by someone hiding in the bushes.  IMHO, you can't really enjoy the game as a strictly survival/crafting game.  If you like running around, shooting everyone you see and raiding, this one's for you.  I have over 120 hours in game and can't say I haven't had fun, but then again, I'm just not the type of person who can steal and kill when there are alternatives. So, it's a mixed review.  The game is pretty and, when finished, will have a ton of fun stuff.  If they fixed the problem where people can jump over impossibly tall walls just because they have a tire, maybe it wouldn't be so bad. As of this moment, I can't really reccomend due to my preferred playstyle.\n\nEdit in response to some comments:\n\nThe survival aspect, at least PVE, isn't hard, which helps make my point.  It doesn't have to be PU Battlegrounds, but everyone seems to think it needs to be.  I let everyone go that I see as long as they leave me alone.  You don't have to kill others to survive in the game, so that's where my comments stem from.  Do I want minecraft or roblox? No.  To compare them to Miscreated is about as dumb as you can get.  When I said \"IMHO, you can't really enjoy the game as a strictly survival/crafting game.\" , I mean just that.  You are forced to be a miscreant who kills and steals, instead of someone who wants to rebuild, and that seems to narrow the options of gameplay.  Before anyone says go play Fallout, I prefer the random nature of a large sandbox with no story line.  Perhaps I have too much faith in the human element of the game?  Also, reviews can be changed as time goes on.  If i could choose yes/no as a reccomendation, that's where I'd be.

The enviroment is so god damn good looking and well made, so detailed. The guns feel autentic, not arcade like in h1z1.

We can see that in the tiny details at every corner all around the map. Every house is different and that makes the loot more challenging and the play experience less boring and more immersive.

There are a lot of room for the game to grow. With more weapons and tools to craft, more caves to explore and better bases to build.
