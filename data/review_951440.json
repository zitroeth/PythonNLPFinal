And from the other reviews I take that it doesn't change these points.\n\n[b]1. Ressources, inventory handling and early grind[/b] require unnecessary manual effort and does not provide much user guidance. The overall UI needs a bit more love, be it menus, visual guidance, inventory management options or ressource logic - for example, why are insufficient resources not clearly greyed out or something similar? I haven't played too many survival crafting games, can't tell how it compares to the smaller games. But No Man's Sky made it much easier to start, e.g. with its color coding (which might not be a fair comparison this here being in early access, but if it is a key game mechanic I spend time with I would just expect it to be more refined from the start).\n[b]2. World in its current state seemed lifeless and generic.[/b] Nothing I saw made me want to dive into the lore (if there is any) or explore the world\n[b]3. Drillship mechanics.[/b] Sadly, there only are fixed locations on the map that allow you drill into the ground, go deeper, or explore a predefined cave. The entire point of a drillship from my POV would be to be able to move around freely because you can *literally* drill yourself a path. Ideally be able get out of the vehicle even below surface. Maybe even burst into a fortified enemy encampment (on the surface or underground) to make proper use of your fully upgraded \"drill tank\". With the current mechanics however, the drillship essentially is just an outpost you can fast travel to, with limited upgrade slots. On top of that, the \"fast travel\" is not fast at all at first. To move between these points you have to \"navigate\" on a map which looks like from a twenty year old flash game, essentially a mini game without any actual gameplay. Unlike the surface, the underworld levels do not seem to be a connected \"open world\", so there's no alternative. With the current mechanics, I fail to see the point of having a drillship in the first place (compared to base building mechanics any other crafting game).\n[b]4. Volcane eruptions.[/b] Other games spawn monsters during nightime, here you're forced to hide every 20 ish (?) minutes from the volcano eruption. How this adds fun to the game eludes me. Maybe it has to be there because of the game title?\n\n[h2]What I liked[/h2]\n1. Drill ships are a cool way to have a mobile base of operations that you can upgrade\n2. Fresh \"tesla punk\" / Jules Verne inspired style\n3. Combination of open world survival crafting with gunplay + robots\n\nI applaud the devs for daring greatly with the scenario and I hope they figure out ways to make more out of the cool basic premise.\n\n[h2]So what would I want?[/h2]\nIt\u2019s easy to say what I didn\u2019t like, but harder to put into words how the early game and game lookout could be different. So I\u2019ll try to think of some stuff which might motivate me to stick around. However, considering that many people like the game, it might just not be for me, so feel free to ignore this. But I wanted at least give a proper feedback.\n\nWhat is clear I shouldn't expect - As the devs currently a) don't plan on building a randomly generated world or adding much freedom to how the drillship can be used and b) this clearly won't become another enshrouded, I won\u2019t expect too much in terms of world exploration. And there clearly won't be actual base building either to make it worth the resource grind. Aside from managing expections a bit better, I wondered if some of the RTS / MOBA inspired mechanics that are already there could be enhanced further.\n\nE.g. navigate your ship on a proper 3D map, drill through the soil \"dungeon keeper style\" to progressively reveal secrets and points of interests (like cave entrances / tunnels to the surface). Maybe (co-op) mechanics to overcome underground obstacles.\n\nThe devs already added drones to scale the battle mechanics, which almost is reason enough for me to continue \u2013 if there was something interesting to conquer. The game and store page don\u2019t explain very well what I get to do later with my upgraded ship and my drones (aka why I should play it). I found out online that there are mission caves with mobile structures to destroy, which feels a bit like a deep rock galactic mission \u2013 which is nice, but it also looks more casual than epic. And I can\u2019t use the drillship as an actual tank or burst out of the soil amidst the enemy group. So why not commit to the MOBA approach. Maybe add production & deployment of your own attack drones? Add different / more \u00abepic\u00bb missions, e.g. siege like missions, with artillery from your drillship?

It was good fun, but surprisingly short. We were expecting a little bit more to be honest. The game is also highly repetitive in terms of technology upgrades/stages and story check points/objectives. Without any spoilers, you do destroy the same thing four times and win the game. It was disappointing that there were no increased challenges at these points.\n\nBy the end of the game your ship becomes highly automated and you rely a lot on bots, which reminded me of Factorio, in a good way. You can call bots and turrets to your location to fight for you, use mining drones, set your ship to automatically scrap, smelt, build, and dispense the items you want/need. I just wish that there was a little bit more to it after that.\n\nI know the game is in Early Access, so I hope that they continue to add to the game. Not just small things like this new teased tesla weapon, but maybe something you can do after the game is over? It just becomes a boring sandbox. Any sense of victory is dampened by the fact it was so easy and that you didn't really do anything new or different to win.\n\nIf the game releases in its current state (very buggy, laggy, missing textures, holes in the floor, massive spelling and grammar errors) with an increase in price? Don't bother. If the game adds in more content, and not just small stuff but actual game changing updates, and stays at around $30 bucks I think it is well worth getting.

I came in with bad expectations because of the \"survival\" part and because of the negative stuff mentioned in the negative comments. They were right about the \"eruption\" mechanic (\"There's no lava\"), but everything else makes me wonder how far they got or if their reviews are too old and outdated.\n\nNow onto my experience: The gunplay is weird, I swear I'd hit the enemy and my shot misses, but it's fine, I can kill most enemies the way I want to, unless they fly and I try to melee them, cuz they're too fast. There's a nice variety of guns and I'm not even that far into the game. A comment mentioned enemies being hitscan with aimbots, that doesn't seem to be the case (anymore?), their bullets were actual projectiles you can sidestep, though if you stand still anything without a shotgun will always hit you.\n\nThe drill portion is a lot of fun, and that's from the dude that dislikes the crafting hype. I'm playing with 1 friend and I have him make stuff look nice and worry about location of stuff, while I make sure we have all the necessary resources, our research is advancing, our turrets have ammo. It's a very nice synergy and I really like how progress works. Someone in a comment mentioned you can steal a better drill and skip the process. I didn't see an _easy_ way to do that because you need some improved modules to craft the thing needed to steal better drills. Basically your drill has to be closer to the tier you want to capture to even be able to do it. Capturing drills also seems like a major pain and we had to recapture our original drill once we realized how it worked.\n\nThe timer feels very weird but it makes a bit of sense, it helps reset overworld stuff like which \"type\" of enemy it is and some deposits for materials.\n\nEnemies: They come in 4 colors so far: blue, red and green which each specialize in their respective colored stuff (production, refinery and research). Then there's the black dudes that seem to love war cuz oh god my poor drill is always under attack when there's black around. On the bright side they are a good source of weapons/ammo/armor.\n\nArmor? Yeah, that was weird, a comment said there was no armor but we've found two tiers of armor so far.\n\nOverall I'm having a lot more fun than I expected, and a great update seems to have dropped recently so it was also just in time.

It doesn't feel like a survival game. (give another reason to go back to the surface (Food / Water))\n- Even on higher difficulty, never really felt pressured, had to set custom difficulty and it was still pretty easy to evade cogs\n- could have actual fortifications/fortresses that spawn COGS in lower levels instead of just drill ships that pop up and density of Cogs gets higher.\n- could use a better sound design (awooga gets annoying, turned off in game sound mid way through the play-through, the sounds can get grating and annoying to listen to in general.)\n- COGS should actively defend the last laser, (we chucked mortars at the last laser then got cutscene)\n- Once defeating last laser, there should be a last ditch attempt to kill you before they power down, I.E. Drillship defense\n- Possibly add an Ironman mode, so if you made mistake, it would stick for a while.\n- Cutscene after killing last laser was a bit akward and anticlimactic.\n- More endgame content (Possibly PVP, More decoration for drillship/steam punk furniture, Etc..)\n- Player customization\n- Combat tweaks (It was a rinse and repeat of hit and run tactics and there wasnt too much risk involved)\n- A.I.

However, I had some expectations that were crushed:\n[list]\n[*]Drillships are not used to destroy other drillship.\n[*]You have to go by foot to destroy one.\n[*]...Without any protections. Guns are implemented in the game but not body armor.\n[*]Lava is not your enemy here, the robots are.\n[*]Volcano eruptions are a mere annoyance. It's just a matter of reaching safety in time, regularly.\n[*]Enemies are using [i]hitscan[/i] weapons.\n[/list]\nBut nevertheless it was enjoyable.\n\nThe game revolves around upgrading your drillship (tier) to progress the game. The goal is to destroy all 3 laser... device [spoiler]plus another one, just heavily guarded by T4 drillships[/spoiler]. Sounds pretty simple, isn't it? All of the laser devices are gated behind each tier. In order to upgrade your drillship, you'll need to do research for the new module, deploy the new module in the drillship, and craft the upgrade using the new module.\n\nThe tutorial quests is just so go[noparse]dda[/noparse]mn robust, you can just rely your progress on them, all the way until the ending. The quest system will tell you not only what you'll have to do, but where to get all the materials for the crafting, what you have to do in order to craft, point at the nearest material source, and tells you if the material you're looking is already in the drillship storage. It's not perfect, but it's way better than what you see in other games. Wow.\n\nThe robots (known as COGs here) is the real killer. All of their weapons are [i]hitscan[/i], meaning that all it takes to plant the bullet in your body is to pull the trigger right when it points to your body. They don't even have to aim, they have aimbot (no joke, sometimes their aiming animation gets bugged and fails to show, but they fire anyway and you get hit). As a rule of thumb, green bots (almost) never misses (but deals low damage), red bots misses a lot (but deals high damage).\n\nNOTE: In the news, they'll be announcing for [i]projectile[/i] weapons, which actually simulates a bullet going through that can be dodged, unlike hitscan.\n\nReally, at the current stage, the game is more of an offensive play and less of a defensive play. On your own, the only tools you only have are weapons, pickaxe (you can use it as melee) and medkit to heal you (it takes 5 sec to use). No body armor or shields to reduce your damage. The only strategy is to kill the robots before they kill you.\n\nNOTE: They're announcing that they'll be adding body armor in the next update (and even \"power armor\" in the future), so expect this information to be obsolete.\n\nYou can continue playing after completing the game, but no robots will spawn, volcano will stop erupting (\"Volcano eruption in \u221e\") , and (presumably) no ores will spawn. It's actually boring after that, but who cares about the ending? Just forget that last quest and keep killing those clankers!\n\nDespite all the weaknesses, there is one good thing about it: no rush on winning the game. Volcano eruption sets a timer on how long you can work on the surface but never set how fast you have to progress through the game. You can find a lone spot in the underground caverns where you won't be attacked by bots. Resources respawn, so you won't be afraid on running out of them.

It is really fun,the way you develop your own drill or if you prefer,you can go and capture the robots drills,but for me personally,developing my own was way more fun and seeing all the improvements,the way it gets better,stronger and way larger than you'd believe initially,it was the thing that really got me to like the game. \n\nYou can farm resources all around the island,go underground and get different,rarer ones or just farm robots,which if you want,you can also raid their drills,but that's a bit harder and riskier. Weapons are great,fun,tho you will absolutely need explosives once you advance into T2 , the enemy tanks are a huge pain otherwise.\n\n Modifying your drill is easy,you just use a wrench,slap a furniture there,a chest here,maybe upgrade the tracks,add a turret or a refinery,everything is just smooth and easy to learn and get used to. A big plus is that you can automate most of the production and research,so you just use and expand the drills cargo space and you can then use drones to farm for you or fight alongside you while the workbenches do the work for you in the drill,as long as you are not underground,hiding from an eruption.\n\n Combat is nice,hitboxes are pretty good,some fights are harder than you'd initially thought (again,COG tanks),reinforcements can come from pretty much anywhere,so do plan a raid properly and grab some armor with you. The max tier is T3 right now,but who knows,maybe later on there will be even more added,but the game does end once the final mission is done,so if you want to enjoy the game more,save before going for the last mission so you can return to it and still farm/develop or have fun before.\n\n If playing online,there will be more robots and they will spawn faster,but they will still be manageable,no big deal. I played with a friend,it runs great,missions are shared,everything is shared,it was a fluid and very good experience. Had minor bugs,some loot was stuck in the ground and some mobs despawned before I could loot them,but that was all. \n\nOverall,Volcanoids is a great surviving explorer,that is awesome in singleplayer and very fun online. There are sales quite often on it,but i'd say it's current price is easily worth it for how fun it can be and i'm sure there will be more updates later on.\n\nIf you liked the review and want to find even more content,reviews or just support me,you can do it on my Patreon : patreon.com/SteveAnton97", "timestamp_created": 1681210139, "timestamp_updated": 1682510473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 242, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853337407112121582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66478301": {"recommendationid": "66478301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049338908", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1586602844}, "language": "english", "review": "It's hard to overstate the amount of potential this game has.

Will re-review as development progresses.\n\nUpdate: I can't stop tinkering with my Drillship. I'm holding off exploring more of the island to avoid spoilers, but even at this early stage, the game looks beautiful and runs really very fast and smooth at 1080p on my ageing rig (GTX 970). The degree of polish even in Early Access is evident: the animated intro is something I'd expect from a full release (lovely art style too). This is a project the developers *care* about. They've got a brilliant social media and public-facing presence too: you can read, vote and make suggestions on Nolt; there's a Discord; they're regularly active on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, and engage with their base in a way that puts most AAA productions to shame. I've already bought a copy for a friend, and I think a few more will find Volcanoids in their account this Christmas.\n\nI'm genuinely more excited for this game than for Cyberpunk 2077 (if I want to step into a corporate-controlled dystopia, I can just go outside).

(not be confused with UI) There are tons of quality of life things that are NEEDED to make this game actually playable instead of players just dealing with the faults. \n- Items sorting and ordering is almost random at times\n- categories are sometimes to broad and sometimes too refined. The research table is great but the sracpper? oh boy....\n- choices of icons and their color are very similar and easy to mix up which on top of the UX issue mentioned above makes navigating the menus a chore to say the least.\n\n> every 25 min in game the volcano erupts and you can to get back to your ship and go underground. that time is short as you end up spending a good 3-5 mins waiting for animations as you go in and out of the ground, you then spend 5 ish mins fighting off any cogs that spawns right where you came up at (even if you didn't move location) you spend between 5-10 mins traveling to locations or fighting off cogs as you travel, so every 25 mins you get about 10 or less mins of actual progress. After hours of gameplay i got better at this and could squeeze out more time by making it back with like 30 secs to spare but my progress was still a slow grind.\n\n> Combat: oh boy... So combat happens nearly all the time. As you get past the first tier area the cogs attack you every few minutes and since to progress you have to attack them and take parts from their ships and it's a constant struggle. Now on it's own it's like any good base battler which this game sorta is, but the problem comes in that unless you are playing with friends, you get out-gunned quickly. The armor you get isnt strong enough to hold, it takes several seconds to recharge your armor, and there is largely  no cover/bad cover around the ship spawns. So you need a lot of gear and a lot of time to slug through the cogs, get to the ship and destroy it, oh and did i mention you still only have the 25 mins mentioned earlier to do it? or like 10 mins really. ALSO if you dont disable their drill they can at ANY TIME just leave. pack up and go. you can prevent that by getting inside their ship but if you are inside the ship then you already broke their line and are somehow winning. Which also requires a lot of ammo and tools to do, which brings me to my next issue...\n\n> Inventory size, you do not have enough space in your inventory to carry all the gear you need AND loot the cogs, you end up leaving most of it behind and once again making little to no progress every 25 mins.\n\n> Glitches / Hit boxes : \n- Getting stuck in rocks\n- shots hitting the empty space around object instead of the cogs\n- Cogs become immune to shots after being stunned\n- Tanks being immune to damage after they kinda clip into the floor and get stuck\n- Cogs not taking hits when in the bends of the ship\n\nIs this collection of issues if why I cannot currently reccomend this game in it's current state.

It's kind of in the middle. Maybe one day steam will allow me to post a review with a neutral rating.  However, due to a bad design decision that is common in a lot of not-so-good games, I chose the thumbs down instead of thumbs up.\n\nWhat I liked:\nThe aesthetic of the game is wonderful.  I really like the steampunk look and feel.  \n\nI also like the idea of this mobile base that you take with you.  You can upgrade it to add better facilities and even make it into a very large ship.\n\nThe graphics, sound, and animation are good for what the game is.  Nothing earth shattering, but it certainly could be worse.\n\nLoad times are very quick.  I would normally not mention this, except for a few recent games I have played that are slow to load.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like:\nThere are two main activities you spend most of your time on.  Maybe 90% of your time.\n\nThe first one is on a 2d map, where you drive the icon of your ship around exploring an area and collecting resources like iron, copper, and coal.\n\nThe second activity is spending time in your drill ship while it's parked somewhere, watching crafting timers.  So you  have a research station that is doing research where you queue up and just watch a meter go.  Then a refinery to turn iron ore into iron ingots.  Then a crafting station to turn ingots into parts into whatever it is you want.  All this takes a lot of time and there isn\u2019t much to do.  \n\nYou might think you want to park your ship and go exploring while all this crafting is going on, but that isn't viable because the crafting queues are so small.  By the time you got anywhere, your factories would be done and you would need to return to your ship.  Also you can only walk in caves or the overworld.  The overworld only has basic resources which you do not need after the beginning of the game.  The caves only have a VERY limited number of nodes to mine as well so there isn\u2019t much to do there either.  So basically find a book to read or something while all this crafting is going on.\n\nThe basic game-play loop is to kill a drillship, get a foozle from it, then do the above loop until everything is upgraded to the next tier and then find another drillship to kill in order to get foozle level +1 and do the loop again.  That is almost the entire game-play.\n\nWhat I REALLY didn\u2019t like:\nCombat really sucks in this game.  You get torn up even with your best armor and best weapons.  Your one dude against an infinitely respawning army.  You weapons would need to be MUCH more powerful to deal the waves dues they throw at you near the end game.  Its not challenging, but absurd.\n\nFor example, there is a quest to kill a tier 4 drill ship.  This is a huge ship that has like 8 spawners for cogs.  Not just any cogs, but top tier cogs.  It took me like 10 attempts to take one out.  My strategy was to make a bunch of save games at certain points where I was doing well so I could restart from that point again when everything went to hell. \n\nAt one point I am in a corridor in the enemy drill ship with a gatling gun going full blast and there are so many cogs spawning that I can\u2019t make any headway.  So I just have to duck out and find the spawners and take them out one by one, all the while the timer to the next eruption is counting down.  But I beat it.  The ONE tier 4 drill ship.\n\nSo I make it to the final mission, which is to take a giant laser thingy which is supposedly making the volcano.  Well this baby is guarded by not one, not two, but THREE tier 4 ships cranking out the cogs.  Now if my weapons and armor didn\u2019t suck (I had the best the game offered as far as I can tell), then maybe I could have done it.  I tried for a while and gave up because it's just WTF insane.  This is on \u201cNormal\u201d difficulty BTW.  \n\nPart of the problem is that Armor isn\u2019t armor.  It doesn\u2019t reduce damage. Its just extra HP.  Now if titian armor gave you like 90% damage reduction rather than 4 bars of health (which can evaporate in seconds) then you might be able to do a lot better.  Also changing armor or using a health pack takes a very long time as far as combat is concerned.\n\nThe major design flaw that this game is guilty of (and they are NOT alone in making this error) as far as the end-game is that they do not have any real creative idea of what to do for the finally of their game.  So what do they do?  Just throw waves of dudes as you and call it a day.  So many games fail in their design this way.  You read reviews that say something like, it was a good game for the most part, but at the end it all fell apart.  All other mechanics go out the window and they throw a bunch of bad guys at you.  \n\nI have no idea where they can go with the design.  Maybe when it's done I'll check it out again.  Maybe they will have figured out what they want to do with the game by then.\n\nSome small suggestions in case the devs read this:\n Make production smart.  Let me pick the end product and have the manufacturing system make all the things in between.\nMake armor actual armor and not just some extra HP.\nImprove combat and the weapons to handle waves of bad guys.  Maybe if the gatling gun had explosive ammo that not only did more damage, but was an AoE, that would help a lot.\n\nSlightly bigger suggestion.  Let us build an army of our own cogs.  Maybe the end battle would not be so ridiculous as it is now.

Better than what most of the early access games give you in the genre, and has an ending already. Took around 10 hours to finish.\n\nThere are a few design choices that don't seem to make a whole lot of sense that I overlooked due to this being out as early access:\n- Stamina isn't used for anything (except sprinting), and there's an absurd amount of it. There are no upgrades that give you more stamina. It does run out eventually, but overall it feels like it was added without much thought put into why it exists, and sprint could easily just be replaced with an infinite sprint without breaking game balance in any way.\n- At times it felt like the game is punishing you for playing it, as there is nothing you can build to the drillship to adequately defend it from AI attack waves. There didn't seem to be any way to automate repairs, so you end up having to run around your ship repairing things if you don't want anything to break, given how little health all the modules (even later tier ones) have. In other words, it feels like the game is punishing you for even thinking about leaving the ship, unattended, but camping it with repairs is not what I'd imagine to be the intended experience here. We actually ended up skipping the last ship length expansion because it seemed unmanageable, running around three compartments already took long enough.\n- Making it so you need lower tier resources to craft higher tier modules (at least when advancing tiers the first time) seems like a gimmick that forces you to spend a lot of time traveling around different tier zones, feels like I'm playing Albion online again (which had it by design). Making lower tier resources available via some means in higher tier areas, or shortcuts between zones (T3 to T1 directly without passing T2 for example) would make this better.\n\nThe ship defense in particular seems like an area that could be made a lot more engaging, as it was, we ended up using remote control to send it underground when we left the ship to move around as the constant AI sieges against it would slowly destroy it regardless of what defenses were set up. So we ended up avoiding the ship defense fights almost entirely near the end game as it just made no sense.\n\nAll in all, not great, not terrible, definitely a lot better than some other early access titles of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1646621866, "timestamp_updated": 1646622063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761338114738464355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84753573": {"recommendationid": "84753573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012551368", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1610752441}, "language": "english", "review": "Soooo I read some of the poor reviews and decided I was going to buy it anyways :D \n\n#1 This games tutorial is easy to follow.

Judging by the earlier reviews, might never be.\nVolcanoids has a nice visual style and most of the right elements... in all the wrong places, packaged with annoying UI/UX. Many things could have been fixed in a very short time, it doesn't seem to be happening any time soon. May be fun right now for 10-20 hours you can squeeze of it, if you can overlook the resource management tedium, but don't expect anything more. I will be watching for updates, though.\n\nLet's explore the problems in detail...\nThe game is open world only in the most technical sense. Zone progression is very clear and linear. Technical progression is clunky, but, again, linear. Exploration is limited, you only need to find several fixed points (mines and ammo resource spawn points) in your first playthrough, then... the map is fixed in its entirety. The quest system basically walks you through the entirety of the game, decomposing every task into step-by-step tutorial, then marking every subtask location on your map (a hard mode without quests exists, but is locked behind the first victory, and what's the point?).\n\nThe progression is a mess. There is an extreme tendency towards spiking, with you first having to do a quest after a quest without actual rewards, then accessing a bunch of stuff all at once. Combined with quest & zone progression, it means that you arrive in a new zone, get pwned for a while, having to do storm the enemy drillships with outdated weaponry and regularly falling back to your turrets, then get the updates that make you overpowered, retrofit your ship and move on. Basically, every zone is backloaded.\n\nThe resource system is a mess, too. Every zone - a third of the island - has its specific set of ores (geology has left the chat). You can't easily return to an earlier zone, and if you do, it's going to be very, very boring. You continue to need earlier resources, though, with the main offender being black powder, used for much of the late-game ammo in a massive quantities. Good thing that there are exploits that allow resource conversion (from crystal via SMG turret ammo, from copper via lights - chemistry has left the chat, too), but it shouldn't really work this way.\n\nThen, you have a resource overload via secondaries and chains (the longest one being ore/scrap to metal to bullet casings to ammo to turret ammo, all from almost the start). It's very annoying to manage by hand. Good thing that there is automation via resource hubs (on infinite/threshold mode), bad thing that it is a massive resource hog, my setup spent almost a half of its energy on standby (most of the time they simply wait till I bring in some loot to disassemble/take some consumables to replace).\n\nThe inventory is a mess, too: you're limited by a slot count, every weapon takes up a slot, every consumable - a slot (grenades in the midgame tend to take many more, the first L2 drillship raids took us tens of grenades), every kind of a loot - at least, a slot: every resource has its own limits on how much one slot can contain. No ammo standardization between guns, lots of consumables, lots of resources results in slot juggling a little two often. It extends to the ship storage, too: it is also limited by a slot count, the slots are just hidden via grouping, took me a while to notice that all my inventory was eaten by the unsmelted iron ore (10 per slot as ore, 40 as an ingot).\n\nInventory and resource management is horribly plagued by UI/UX issues. UI is heavily modal, meaning that you normally see one specialized screen. You need to reference several screens at once, mainly production (sometimes several tabs)/scrap (several tabs)/ship storage (long scrolling), rarer research. Why? One place to see how much stuff you need, another to order it, one back to take it out, similar for every use case. Production and scrap are on different devices, no quick access for you. Then, structuring within tabs is simply bad, with player ammo being grouped with turret ammo (you basically never need to have it on hand) and not getting grouped with other consumables, and consumables being grouped with weapons, because they are all 'tools'. Also, sorting within the 'devices' tab (intra-ship buildings, basically) is insane. Ship storage sorting is insane, too, and filtering by type is somewhat unwieldy. Functions like \"reload all weapons\" (to fill the magazines) are missing, \"fill the slot to max\", too, wasting my time regularly in a very annoying manner. And don't even get me started on how long it took to set up automation (and find out how I can avoid returning to the beginning for the black powder).\n\nThe inventory/storage is used for things it shouldn't: schematics and upgrades. Would it be too hard to have an upgrade button that can be pressed once, autoinstall stuff after it gets researched/produced (I seem to have seen it on the last upgrades!), then disappears forever? I actually created extra schematics - that can't even be scrapped - several times by mistake. Of course, it would mean that you can't create stuff for other ships, but you control just one, and it's the best one you can have, ever. As an aside, the fact that research, upgrades and modules is not well explained in game, is very, very unhelpful, too.\n\nThe building system is similarly unwieldy, with possibly the same culprit: everything goes through storage, so you first look how much stuff (and where) you need, then run to your production station to order it, take it out (good luck remembering if you had to switch contexts in between), then return to place it. No planning mode, obviously. Then there are issues with device sizes (not really standardized, and, say, hubs are too honking big), too coarse a grid (symmetry breaks and clipping are common and painful), not enough wall slots. Also, there is an imbalance between short and long sections: the short ones tend to be where action happens, and they are tight, the long ones are annoyingly empty: simply not enough stuff to place inside. Also, the decision to disable some products for normal productions stations and allow them only for hubs is freaking evil, cost me a bunch of time running around: couldn't fit all the needed stuff into my cabin. ]:( Also, the inventory limit strikes again. Same with modules, minus positioning, plus 'fun' times moving doors (disassemble one, get four slots in inventory) and storages when close to the cap. By the way, why can't we disassemble the window module from the start? It was the most annoying trophy in existence.\n\nSome more UI stuff: where is my minimap? I can open the large map at will anyway, and it's freaking unwieldy. Why distance limit for teammate markers? Backpacks? Why extreme zoom-in on pilot map (again, I can open the large map at will, and have to do so all the time)? The default control scheme is insane (WTF scroll to change ammo?), fixable, though.\n\nThe combat system is actually decent: apparently, messing up FPS is hard. Absence of recoil is boring (WTF handheld gatling?), but it's not actually mandatory. The bullet ballistics was surprising, to say at least - bullets feel more like arrows - but it's something I can live with (tracer bullets would be nice, though). There seem to be only one major balance issue: freaking teslas are everywhere and they heavily spoil the fun, shooting down grenades/mines (how am I supposed to anti-tank?) and semi-stun you.\n\nThere are standard optimization issues: the game seems incapable of getting over 60 FPS even on high-end hardware. Interestingly, it fails to utilize all available resources, both CPU and GPU.\n\nWhy the rant?\nBasically, I've got at least ten unfun hours where I could have ten fun hours or, at least, no hours, with little expenditures from the developer. I mean, three quarters of the list could be fixed in a month, some of it even by a game designer working alone.

I feel this limitation greatly limits the potential of the game.  If your ship could move around on the overworld and park anywhere, you could end up with drilling ship vs drilling ship battles and far more feeling that the ship is a SHIP and not just a base that can be positioned in one of ~15 areas.\n\nSecond, even with a great deal of turrets, bots can do incredible damage to your ship and easily blow up storage units on the inside of your ship even when your wall is still at 90% health.

I am updating my review based on my experience after writing my previous review. \n\nWhen I first saw Volcanoids on the front page of Steam, I was very interested. From what I saw in the reviews at the time, there was a lot of praise, so I decided to buy a copy and play for myself. After beating the game, however, I would recommend buyers to be wary about purchasing a copy at this time.\n\nVolcanoids is very much centered around the drill you acquire in the beginning of the game. The drill's menu's are hard to pick up at first, and easy to navigate within the first hour or two. Your drill itself is unable to collect resources, so you must collect them manually. Your drill will be the refinery for those resources, as well as the hub for production to upgrade your drill and craft new items. It is also your research hub for upgrades, as well as your storage. Basically, whatever you can't do yourself, your drill will be doing the rest of.\n\nThat is my biggest issue at the moment. The game in its current state is too focused on this drill. There is manual resource gathering, you will use your starter pickaxe to gather most of the resources you'll need, and you never have to upgrade it. Your starter shotgun, one of the only two weapons you receive currently and is not upgradeable save for the bullets it uses, is used to kill enemies along with grenades, which by themselves aren't useful except for destroying enemy systems.\n\nThese systems are barebones compared to the drill, which the missions system, research, and most of production is focused around. Most of your game time will be sat in the drill, waiting for resources or parts to be made, or waiting for research to be completed, or designing an indoor portion of your drill with the small amount of design options that are available currently. When you run out of resources, you will have to go outside and collect them with your pickaxe, or by raiding an enemies storage crate in their drill, something that currently isn't worth the risk and resources for such a paltry reward.\n \nWhile your drill cannot harvest ores by itself, it can take you to any of the 35 points in the map to collect resources from. You cannot control the drill except to move to these points, or to go underground about every 15 minutes to avoid a punctual volcano explosion that will instantly kill you if you or your drill are not underground when it goes boom. \n\nThere are about 3 sections of the map. The drill will be unable to move through Sections 2 and 3 without the proper upgrades, which takes time to research and deploy. To continue, you will have to destroy lava drills in each underground sector of the map, which is easy enough as long as you have enough grenades and med packs. That will be your only difficulty, because enemy units in this game are very easy to kill, while their drill spawn points are unkillable, making them a constant nuisance. Two shots with your shotgun should kill just about any enemy very easily. Enemy drills cannot be destroyed, only looted.\n\nMy other main gripes are that there is no in-game music other than in the main menu, which makes the experience feel even emptier than it is. Also, that the missions system only focuses on defeating lava drills and upgrading your own drill, there is no unique mission other than in the beginning to take your drill. \n\nAll in all, I cannot recommend players purchase the game at this time, because of the lack of content in most aspects of the game. I think that, hopefully in a few months time, there will be enough content that I can change my review, but at this stage the game is much to grindy and barebones.\n\nTL;DR: The game is barebones except for the drill, gameplay is grindy and boring, wait a few months to check back in.", "timestamp_created": 1549265966, "timestamp_updated": 1549733351, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725829720497131348", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156853325": {"recommendationid": "156853325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003013082", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1050, "last_played": 1706261847}, "language": "english", "review": "I've finished playing through the whole game, and I don't regret it.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't exactly recommend this to others, even at a discounted price.

As it turns out there's something much more sinister, much more mechanical going on under the surface of the island's volcano than just a simple act of Mother Nature. \n\nFrom the rusty scraps of your starter drill its up to the player to gather the necessary elements from the harsh environments of the volcanic island to craft their way up through the necessary tools of survival, allowing exploration deeper and deeper into the mysterious core.\n\n[h1]Crafting, Refining, and Other Tasks[/h1]\n \nStations are built for the usual crafting tasks and the number of options feels at first daunting and convoluted, but its more-or-less a fancy way to separate and organize your storage and building queue. The real challenge comes from balancing the required Energy needed to power each of the Stations, as the more you build the more power you sap up.\n\nStorage stations are compartments that store your important materials and receive your finished crafted components up to a certain limit, Refinery stations turn raw mined materials into craftable metals, and the Production stations are where the player puts them all together for new items, weapons, tools, ship components and upgrades. Where you build each of these stations is up to you, as is how you decide to power and use them. The only thing that's for certain is you [b]will[/b] run out of space as you need more tasks performed, and expansions onto your growing Drill vehicle will eventually be needed.\n\n[h1]Setting and Exploration[/h1]\n\nThe post-apocalyptic little volcanic tropical island villages actually have a lot to see for its quaint size, tons of resources to gather throughout threatening caves of magma, and a lot of robots to blast between it all. Luckily with the drill-like nature of the steam-engine players can quickly burrow into the ground and traverse to different parts of the map, making full exploration and excavation of the bountiful island much quicker and easier.\n\nNot only does this drilling process look pretty cool, its hotspot-hopping island traversal mechanic is particularly useful for cutting down on traveling time between important landmarks and necessary gathering sweetspots. As you venture out further you'll come across more and more points for your drill to embark on, allowing you to quickly traverse the natural island and especially comes in handy when needing to escape the trajectory of a massive volcanic eruption.\n\nThe entire idea of surviving on a periodically exploding island of volcanic death, scrambling to steam-powered behemoths for cover and escaping the clutches of 50's scifi movie style robots makes this a standout title in an otherwise saturated demographic of crafting sandboxes.\n \nA real \"steampunk\" survival title is something that was really missing from the genre, and Volcanoids serves it up more than well with all of the creative steam powered vehicles and dystopic bells and whistles you'd want. The most monotonous aspect of survival sandbox titles is the gathering, but with such a fleshed out and imaginative world and an interesting twist of steampunk robotic forces to come across I was always excited to get back out and explore again.\n\n[h1]Shooting; Overly Simple but Still Engaging[/h1]\n\nThe shooting is rather simple but its effective, as the player can blast away the hordes of robotic mobs away with a simple click of their classic pelletgun. This helps clear the way while hunting those much needed resources that hordes of enemies tend to gather around. The deeper you excavate the closer you get to the mechanical source of the tremors rocking the island, and the more diabolical the enemies and their designs become within their home of magma and rock.\n\n[h1]FInal Thought[/h1]\n\nVolcanoids is full of some incredibly grand ideas and in execution they're all pretty cool, but in its early access stage they do feel a bit limited. The setting, the enemies, the periodic destruction and transformation of the landscape are some of the most engaging prospects in the survival genre, but some of the features such as combat feel like more of an afterthought to the setting. \n\nThe combat is fun and supplements the exciting exploration well but it feels all-too simplistic,  and the current travelling features for the drill feel more like a glorified teleportation system than any real kind of vehicular interaction which may dissapoint some. Having some more control over our Drill or the weapons/turrets we install would add to that awesome interactivity and in turn the deeper connection players feel with their hard-earned constructions.\n\nAll in all, Volcanoids is an ambitious new vision for the sandbox survival genre with more than enough room to grow. The core mechanics are in place and though some of the action may be a bit lackluster at the moment, the game has an incredible backdrop and setting with tons of potential lore to explore for the developers to build around. Very excited to see where Volcanoids is headed.\n\n[i]This review made possible through the consideration and contribution of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11739878-ReviewExperts/]Review Experts(REXnetwork)[/url] and the developer/publisher.

Volcanoids has some charm, that's for sure, and there's an interesting gameplay loop - though arguably, the game is definitely unbalanced and unfinished.\n\nUpon arriving to an island in the middle of nowhere, you're tasked by a nondescript sea captain to do some heinous crimes against robot-kind.  Screw diplomacy, am I right?  Your first real task is to steal a Drillship, which the entire game will focus around (and actually is the coolest but also most frustrating part of the game).\n\nThe Drillship is an upgradeable ship that can burrow into the ground, move around, and resurface at other (specified) locations.  It is your only mode of travel (other than your legs) and you defend it with your life.  Upgrading your Drillship is satisfying, adding new modules and defensive turrets on it to make it look bigger and cooler.  The latest Volcanoids update allows you to decorate it with paints, which, sounds pretty neat but the UI is insanely cumbersome and not for the feint of heart or easily frustrated.  Unfortunately, as cool as the Drillship is (and again, the core focus of the entire game), defending it is super obnoxious.  You can have as many turrets as space, energy, core CPU and ammunition allow - which depending on where you are in the game, can be quite a lot.  But your turrets are always overwhelmed by the robot ARMY, because it really is an army.  On standard difficulty, expect in mid to late game to have cohorts of metallic bastards storm your base as 30+ in number.  Your turrets cannot handle this, and sometimes, neither can you.  An effective strategy is to burrow your Drillship while you run around the overworld, but this causes a limitation: now it can no longer produce resources or equipment.  Modules only function when above ground and powered.  It's risk/reward.\n\nIn addition to defending your own Drillship, you obtain new upgrade components by destroying enemy Drillships.  This is another... gripe, for lack of a better word, because again: robot army.  I should mention that I played this game Single Player, and perhaps the added hands could have made the game easier (and potentially more fun), but the game should surely be balanced for Single Player experiences too.  Once you get the attention of a drill ship, prepare to be assaulted by dozens of mean robots vying for your blood.  Oh and their turrets.  Did I mention you, as a lone soldier, have to fight an entire Drillship's staff and their defenses...?  Did I also mention they [i]print new friends[/i]?!  Yea, they do.  Just after you murder a few dozen blocky foes, more and more flood out from their doorways, turning Drillship assaults into a game of attrition: their overwhelming force versus your armour and ammunition (and mental wherewithal).\n\nAdmittedly, I think the Drillship is the best part of the game but also the most unbalanced.  The game strongly plays as if it were meant to be multiplayer, because it tends to feel like there is too much for your single person to handle, whether it be offense or defense.\n\nWhere the game is lacking is its content.  Partway through the game you come to experience a very obvious path of progression: get zone 1 materials, upgrade Drillship with level 2 parts.  Get zone 2 materials, upgrade Drillship with level 3 parts.  Get zone 3 materials, upgrade Drillship with level 4 parts.  Destroy baddies mixed in there.  The Drillship leads the impression of customization, but in reality its very much a required path with no room for deviation or creativity.  Your ship [i]must[/i] have the next level piece to do X, and another level to do Y, etc.  Volcanoids could benefit from some deviating paths there, which can add longevity to the game.  An example: instead of constantly adding next level tracks to the ship (which increase the speed of the Drillship), maybe a Drillship could have claw legs (which could negatively impact speed, but add the ability to melee robots when they get too close) or rockets for mobility (which could require upgraded hull due to increased heat, also require burning more coal to use, but make you go a hell of a lot faster underground).  This is just a single example I can think of off hand, just to add some variety to the game, instead of forcing the player down an absolute, unchanging and narrow path the game walks you down.  One could argue that there is customization in the modules you build, but let's get real, there isn't.  You need better modules to do better stuff.  Your pistol turrets are going to do nothing against level 3 robot baddies, and you're kissing your ship goodbye if you use that for defense.  You're absolutely forced to build better stuff if you want to actually win the game.\n\nOne interesting gameplay mechanic (though might get old depending on your personality) is the volcanic eruption.  Every x number of minutes, based on difficulty or new game customization, the volcano in the middle of the island erupts.  Let's not discuss the fact that all the fauna survive the volcano ash every time, and that it clears up in a few minutes... science doesn't belong in video games, people.  Let's instead focus on the fact that: if you're above ground when the volcano erupts, you simply die.  This means if you're not near your Drillship at the timer countdown, you're screwed.  This can make for some funny or frustrating moments.  I laughed when I trapped myself in an enemy Drillship, because they can open the doors and I cannot, and the timer reached 0.  Oops.  As you progress in the game and need to spend more time assaulting enemy Drillships, this timer becomes more and more annoying than fun.\n\n[b]Gameplay Spoilers Ahead[/b]:\nOn the topic of unbalance, once you obtain the [spoiler]hand cannon and its explosive ammunition[/spoiler], the rest of the game becomes laughably easy.  As you play, Volcanoids storyline [spoiler]requests you to destroy underground lasers, that are aggravating the magma, causing the volcanic eruptions[/spoiler].  Using the [spoiler]hand cannon[/spoiler], I was able to [spoiler]destroy the last two laser drills with absolute ease, accelerating the end of the game, because the destruction of the final drill is the game win condition[/spoiler].  Knowing how difficult it is to storm high level Drillships, the end game conditions felt... lazy and empty in comparison.  No real challenge, which is unfortunate.  I am also surprised that [spoiler]each drill you destroy doesn't increase the time between the eruption timer, which could help with my criticism above, where higher level Drillships require more time to assault.  I'm surprised it did nothing at all until you blew them all up, really.  Feels weird[/spoiler].\n\nNevertheless, I provide a positive recommendation.  The game may tout itself as \"Open World\" when it isn't, and may have a very specific progression path from start to finish, but that doesn't make the game bad; it just makes is... less than it could be.  Volcanoids, with enough love, could turn itself into an amazing game with lots of replayability.  For now, it's a one-trick pony that takes about 15 hours to complete from start to finish.  I reiterate that there is some innovative gameplay here, especially when it revolves around the Drillship and its expansion - though I caution that its defense is annoying, and you may become frustrated with its defense or the assault of enemy drillships, as often times both events feel unfair even on standard difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1625938193, "timestamp_updated": 1625939169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722084105014801025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119880451": {"recommendationid": "119880451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137784613", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2180, "last_played": 1660574796}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished hard mode to post this review. TLDR: worth on sale, an ok buy for its base price.\nA pretty good game. The movement feels smooth, the aesthetics for base building is nice with alot of buttons, dials and gauges that really give that steampunk vibe while having some functionality, and gameplay is pretty fun. It lacks replay-ability though so its pretty much a one and done outside of speed or achievement runs.\n\nGame does have some glaring issues though mainly around crafting, progression, and fake difficulty. Majority of your items equipment and buildings alike, become obsolete as soon as you move to the next tier. Guns especially and while they get upgraded bullets they're more for the enemy so they hit harder and less about you which is the next issue. There's nothing different with tier1 and tier3 or normal and hard mode, the only difference is literally numbers both for the player and the enemies its all just take more hits and punch harder. There's no difference between enemies, one takes alot more hits, one shoots faster with a different weapon but ultimately they're all the same. There's so much redundant things and inventory bloat that it makes it hard to keep track what you have although at the very least the central storage system minimizes interaction with your stash. \n\nOn the deeper gameplay topics, alot of the gameplay aspects are either useless or can be ignored all together. Turrets are pretty useless because not only do they have piss poor accuracy they aggro mobs that aren't even targeting you and higher tier mobs can snipe them with mortars that just one shot all your modules, its better to just not have any turrets at all and leave your drill underground and if you need to process materials there's safe zones underground where enemies don't spawn. There's no reason to go beyond the tier 2 drill body upgrade outside aesthetics, it can house all the t3 modules you need and you can't even put much on the 4th body because you're limited by core slots. One can argue its because you can turn modules on and off depending on your needs but unless you like mining for hours just for the sake of mining, you'll always be gated by resources making faster production pointless. The rewards you get from raiding drills is also lack luster compared to just farming or finding it underground, the only reason you'd want to attack another drill is to get the drill parts everything else you can get quicker going around underground. This becomes especially prevalent in the higher tiers where its literally just bullet hell against bullet sponges it ends up becoming a net loss. One thing that really bothers me is the fact that you have to go all the way back to lower tier areas just to get a specific resource, and there's no fast travel in this game so you're just forced to maneuver around underground to go back just to get a few bits and pieces of lower tier materials.", "timestamp_created": 1659359369, "timestamp_updated": 1659359369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720869541168212891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130891394": {"recommendationid": "130891394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034889035", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 2165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 779, "last_played": 1703460078}, "language": "english", "review": "It starts out slow, but in my opinion no game does a better job of making you feel in command of a hulking mechanical *thing* than this.

I am aware that this game is developed by an indie team, but that doesn't excuse how the game just barely manages to run. I usually do not care about whether or not a game runs at 60+ FPS as long as it is PLAYABLE, but my FPS CONSISTENTLY drops below 3 any time I am raiding a ship (the main task given to the player in the game).\n\nI will say that I do not play on the most powerful PC ever. My CPU is a 4 core i3-8100, I have 16GB of RAM and I play on a GTX 1060. However, I have played more visually and mechanically impressive games than this at an acceptable (and stable) FPS, somewhere between 40-60 in most \"higher-tier\" cases. As a result I can only assume that the optimization of the game's systems is to blame.\n(If you want CPU and Memory consumption details: Volcanoids eats up ~40% of my CPU and over 5GB of memory.)\n\nAgain, I am trying to give this game another chance as a solo player. However, when the lag that I previously assumed was a multiplayer issue follows me to such a severe extent into my 2nd playthrough, it is hard to get any further than I did the first time simply because the game makes itself nearly unplayable.\n\n\nUltimately, I really want to love this game past the 2nd area but really cannot recommend it to any person that actually wants to fully finish it simply because, as a game, it becomes broken in terms of both gameplay and performance.\n\nEdit 2:\n2 important updates:\n1)\nWe did, in fact, get a Tesla patch. Good stuff. Sorry if I seemed a bit dick-ish in the initial review, but nonetheless I'm glad we reached a solution that addressed the problems that significantly hampered the (usually very fun) gameplay of Volcanoids. Here's to more updates that are yet to come.\n\n2)\nThis review seems to be getting some backlash in regards to my complaints about the game's performance, which is understandable- no two people have an identical build and various aspects (other applications, stored items, etc) can affect a computer's performance while gaming. However, I still feel that it's important to note that my complaints about performance are not exclusive to my own review- other people with significantly more impressive builds (such as Capt. Newbiez if you check this review's comments) note the same performance issues.\nI don't feel like the need to optimize the game should be downplayed simply because a very wide-spread opinion came from a single debatably-qualified individual (myself lmao).\nI will say that optimizing a game is arduous and quite painstaking in a lot of cases, so I understand if the game's performance only gets slightly better with each coming patch / update. I am not the one making the game, and so it's certainly not right to demand a perfect game from the get-go.

The biggest reason I love open world survival is the feeling of progression. This game only meets that requirement in name alone. Instead it goes for a more combat focused experience, and an extremely repetitive one at that. \n\nI feel I should start with a few positives with the game:\n-I do love the idea of your base is a vehicle that moves, it's a nice fresh start and gives you plenty of options to do exploitative game play\n- You get some great automation tools to build a self sufficient system with great customisation \n-the mods are very well supported and they introduced things that should honestly be in the game default\n-the aesthetic can be quite nice and you have decent amounts of customisation for your base to make it truly your own\n-There is a wide selection of weapons and turrets to defend yourself against the cog menace\n-The tutorial is quite good and you can follow it as much as you want or ignore it all together\n-Taking down an enemy drill is very satisfying\n\n\nThe loop essentially boils down to: \n-go to 'new' area \n-mine the 2 resources the area has\n-build a block on your ship that allows you to build better blocks for your ship\n-fight the enemy drill for their better drill\n-make the process even more tedious\n-go back to step one\n\nThe game also increases it's 'difficulty' by just making the whole loop more tedious as you progress. One of the only interesting significant upgrades you get in the game is 3/4 through where you can get a drone to go do the mining part for you. However the most tedious part is actually the combat, the whole element they focused hard on. The big thing I love about this genre is gaining so many new abilities and the logistics behind using them and building a more efficient base. This you barely touch on as the most you get is the ability to automate making things.\n\nEvery section you have to fight stronger ships, but what does that entail? All it means is that the enemy drills will just have more robot spawners and more turrets for you to deal with which just draws out the battles longer and longer. This also means your using more and more ammo every time to get through it. Which leads to more waiting for your mining drones to get the resources to make the bullets, or going out yourself to get those resources. This all just leads to an endless loop of grinding.\n\nYou grind the ores to get more bullets, you get the bullets to raid the ships to get more ore and the tiniest bit of 'progression' (getting a drill that gets you to the next area). Rinse repeat never end.\n\nThe end of the game was the most grindy section of all and not sure I'll finish it (at least without just cheesing it). [spoiler] Basically to beat the game you have to destroy these drills which are just big health sinks you shoot at. The last one has 3 flagships surrounding it, and each one is just pain to fight solo. Not cause it's hard but it takes forever to do. from what I saw they spawn waves of about 10-15 cogs every minute or so (not to mention the numerous tanks) as well as having a lot of turrets. So you kill the soldiers then take the 30 seconds you have before the next wave to shoot a turret or two. That is if you even take them down. It's really not worth it as by the time your moving on to the next one, the first one respawned. Meaning you literally have done nothing. Just take a sniper and shoot the drill, ignore all the enemies.[/spoiler] \n\nOne extra note on the latest tesla stuff. Cool idea, love the drones, but like come on. You make projectiles the best way to destroy ships then completely negate it with anti projectile turrets that is built IN the ships?\n\nTl;dr\nGame is grindy in a bad way. The main focus of the game is fighting endless enemy drills and cogs which becomes pretty tedious.

intact.\n\nthe player can fight off the enemy group with a SMG and a sniper rifle without any problem, even with the revolver, but the HUGE top tier turrets with full armor are unable to defend the ship from enemies.\n\nthis is really BAD balancing, it annoys SO hard.\n\n\nsuch a big ship needs to withstand attacks, but not in this game, you can add turrets and upgrades like you want, enemy will still destroy module after module within few seconds. its a bad joke.\nin case the enemy reaches the ship before you notice it, you always have to repair or build new modules because it only takes the enemy SECONDS to wreak havoc on the ship.\n\nthe ship needs AT LEAST 10, if not 20 times more hitpoints AND stronger armor, even a car could withstand more bullets than this huge paper drillship. you cannot just wait inside until the turrets fight off the enemy, because enemy WILL destroy modules if you do so.\nthis design flaw breaks the game and enrages you as player.\n\nthe only thing you can do to avoid destroyed modules is to run out as soon as you see a enemy coming and kill it with your hand guns because the avatar can withstand way more hits than any module on the ship.\nbut in case the enemy comes from behind the ship, it takes you longer reaching the enemy than it takes the enemy to destroy modules on the ship.\n\nits really sad, because this balancing failure kills all the fun the game WOULD make with better balancing.\nhow is it possible for the devs to make the ship so weak?\nits weaker than the player so all the armor and upgrades are almost useless.\n\nwhy not make the ship stronger (more armor and hitpoints)? \nthe dmg of the turres already is low, it takes 4 turrets more time to kill ONE SINGLE enemy than the enemy needs to destroy a module. very unrealistic.\nits not fun to see all your work getting destroyed within SECONDS and load the last save because the devs failed to do proper balancing...\n\neven before the turret/weapons update of the game the balancing was better. there was only one type of turret but this turret type was better than all the new types together:\n\nall the new turret types got flaws, none of them is balanced well. in combination with the \"paper armor\" of the ship, you better go out and fight the enemy by handguns because otherwise you spend more time repairing and replacing modules than anything else.",

They came from underground in drillships and tapped into the power of the island's volcano, making it erupt. The people of the island left, then they sent out an expedition in a submarine with a captain and your player character to drive out the COGs. That's when the game begins.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is very basic, yet conceptually interesting. I started out in the submarine with the captain (who will give you quests to the end of the game). The first task was to mine copper and coal and produce some items using the submarine's modules. My first experience of crafting was pleasantly surprised. While crafting recipes do not seem balanced at all, they are VERY cheap which I liked. I generally only had to go mining once for any given resource until the end of the game. It was very little grind which I really liked, as mining is in my view a tedious and uninteresting task.\n\nThere are three map zones and each has one common resource (copper, iron, titanium) and one rare resource spawning close to lava (sulfur, crystal, diamond) and coal. The only resources for which I had to go on more than one mining run were copper, sulfur and coal.\n\nAfter that, I got sent to claim a damaged COG drillship which was the core of the game. One other important feature of the game was volcanic eruptions. At the top of the screen was a timer and when it ran out the volcano exploded, killing you if you're outside and destroying a drillship if it's not underground, and also respawning resource nodes. This was particularly relevant as I had to fix it and upgrade it a bit. The eruptions were annoying at times, but hardly ever proved a problem.\n\nHere's a quick explanation of how drillships work: they have a number of side wall hull spaces, ceiling hull spaces, core slots and energy. The hull spaces can install various modules and they can get damaged and destroyed, core slots is a cap on how many modules, energy is used to operate most modules. There are also drillship upgrades which come in three categories: core (core, engines), movement (hull, drill, tracks) and tech (research). Core improves stats and allows extra drillship segments, movement allow the ship to go to the other areas on the map, tech unlock new recipes.\n\nEDIT: Drillships move on the map via a network of numbered landing sites. You select a number in the helm and hit the travel lever then wait until you reach the destination. It's somewhat disappointing, as you do not get to actually control the drillship.\n\nThe drillship modules are: storage, crafting, refinery, powerplant, turret, research. All provide fairly obvious functionality. Although I will note here that the way storage modules work is pretty nice. Active storage modules provide a ship-wide storage inventory which is compressed in the UI. Rather than having a bajillion item slots, there's only one item per slot with no limit on the number, although stacks are still used in the storage system with each module providing a number of stacks. And it can be accessed from anywhere in the ship. Pretty handy.\n\nThe modular drillship basebuilding is actually pretty good. It reminds me of Subnautica somewhat, although it runs from a problem the entire game suffers: a lack of content. More on that later.\n\nMy next task after building up the drillship was to attack a lava source and disable it. Lava sources are basically the game's end goal. There's three lava sources in one lava cave in each map zone of 3 and one lava source in the volcano proper. Destroy all of them and the COGs are defeated and you win.\n\nBefore I go on, I should go into the combat. The combat in this game is... extremely minimalist. Enemy COGs march at you in a strength line while slowly firing single shots at you. There's different types of COGs but their only difference is in how much HP they have. The player has only two weapons. A double-barrel shotgun with upgradeable ammo and grenades, nothing else. Not even armor. The shotgun is decent, but needs a reload after every 2 shots which can be problematic sometimes. The grenades are effective, but hard to use on COGs. Their real importance is in destroying structures, like enemy drillships and the lava source cranes.\n\nThe lava sources each have three cranes holding up some kind of laser beam device which need to be destroyed. Destroying them is the main objective. There is also an enemy drillship in each lava source cave continuously bringing in enemy COGs and there's enemy turrets which require you to take cover and destroy with grenades.\n\nFinishing each lava source was a fairly easy affair. All I needed to do was make sure my drillship's defenses were up to snuff, keep a distance from the enemy COGs, shoot them (or grenade them if they are in mobs), take cover from turrets, grenade them, then grenade the cranes. Done. Attacking the enemy drillship is not necessary and didn't work out when I tried. You have to destroy every bit of hull and I couldn't find a good way to destroy the ceiling hull parts. Grenades hit me as well, shotgun is not good against structures, pickaxe can't reach. So I ignored them.\n\nOne issue should be clear though. The combat lacks any kind of depth or tactics. It is very rudimentary, which is a pattern with this game.\n\nAfter the lava source mission, I was sent to upgrade my tech. The way research works is simple. Marked on the map are spawn locations for tech parts, which you mine with your pickaxe, take back to the ship and research with your research modules. Then add the researched upgrade to the ship core. Very simple, but it takes a lot of time. Research is quite slow.\n\nThere's three tech tiers. The first you start with, second is gained in zone 1, third in zone 2. There is also a fourth tier for movement modules which will allow you to enter the volcano.\n\nOne major problem I had with tech tiers was that while they unlocked \"better\" modules, they never felt like a real improvement. Higher tier modules use up more space and they only allow you to utilize the higher tier. Let's take a refinery module for example. A tier 1 uses 1 hull space, 10 core slots, 2 energy and provides 1 refining power. A tier 2 uses 2 hull spaces, 20 core slots, 4 energy and provides 2 refining power. It's basically... the same as 2 tier 1 refineries. It only lets you refine tier 2 materials.\n\nAt this point, all game elements have been revealed. There will be nothing new for the rest of the game. I went to area 2, got the new materials there, the new research, upgraded the drillship, destroyed the lava source and proceeded to area 3 where I did the same thing (although there was no research there). Then I went to the volcano, destroyed the lava source there and won the game, getting an ending dialog with some story about how the COGs are defeated and statistics like my playtime and energy produced\n\nPS: I didn't experienced any bugs :)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1674553427, "timestamp_updated": 1674553427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699190974235534668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127343540": {"recommendationid": "127343540", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973307364", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 1220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1186, "last_played": 1669631609}, "language": "english", "review": "Good concept, but fails in the \"content\" side. \n\nSurprisingly, it's kind of similar to Subnautica - you explore and scavenge for not-to-grindy materials to upgrade and expand to new depths.

Lots of stuff feels really janky, though that's something I could look past if the rest was really good.\n\nFor some reason you can unlock and craft some weapons before you can even get close to crafting ammo for them??? Specifically the machine gun, but probably more. I STILL don't have the ability to craft machine gun ammo of ANY tier.\n\nGunplay feels bad with the precise weapons, and it's basically a 70:30 on whether your shot will actually land even if you have your sight right on a bot. One time I literally saw the trail of my rifle shot go THROUGH a bot's head, but it did no damage and got no hitmarker. The shotgun feels... fine, I guess. [i]No idea what the machine gun that I crafted and that features prominently in trailers feels like, I wonder why...[/i] Only weapon that really felt great to shoot was the rocket launcher, but of course it takes 3 millennia to reload and only holds 1 shot. Oh, and the reload animation looks like it's done a solid second before it finishes its [b]seven second reload animation[/b]. If you switch weapons or stow it, thinking it's finished reloading, it restarts the entire reload. And for the cherry on top, you move like you're crawling through molasses while it's in your hand.\n\nCore gameplay loop and progression is just an endless string of fetch quests. They're \"tutorial\" quests that handhold you and pester you and ring a fuckin phone dial at you until you do them, just to lead directly into 4 more quests of the exact same shit: Go find X material at this waypoint, put it in Y machine at that waypoint. Sometimes X material is inside a bot drillship, so that makes it a tad less dull when that happens. Plus, they don't make you go recraft things for an objective if you've already managed to craft them separately. Still not exactly engaging.\n\nDrillship building is surprisingly limited for being a core mechanic. It feels more like an arbitrary resource sink for the fetch quests rather than me customizing my own personal vessel. Very few of the modules actually let you pick and choose what you wanna build for, except maybe the turrets. Even then, though, each turret you get is pretty much just a more expensive but better option than whatever you had previously. There's no real reason to use pistol turrets once you have shotgun turrets. Shotgun turrets to smg turrets isn't as bad, but smgs fill the same niche. Mortars at least have a trade-off since they take two spaces and are explosive-based rather than bullet-based, but they're still overall a better damage dealer even before splash damage is taken into account.\n\nEnemies in later areas get quite bullet spongy. There's better ammo, but even though I'm finding the TIER 3 ammo for the revolver on bots, I'm stuck with the tier 1 ammo for the rifle. And yes, I know there's higher tier sniper ammo, cause I found tier 2 sniper ammo on a bot. Still can't craft it. [i]Hmmm, wasn't there another ammo type like that...? I could swear there was, it's on the tip of my tongue...[/i]\n\nWorst saved for last: I have a [i]quite[/i] powerful machine, and for whatever reason this game is so unoptimized it just constantly hitches. It's only gotten worse the longer I've played. Right at the start it would only hitch like, at most once a minute? Now it's more like once every 5 seconds unless I'm in my drillship underground, where it levels out to about once every 30 seconds. Also hitches pretty bad when it autosaves. Got the game on an SSD. 32 GB of 3000 Mhz ram, Ryzen 9 5900x, RTX 3060. Sure, my rig's not quite top of the line per se, but this game shouldn't need top of the line either. I can't imagine what this game runs like on their \"recommended\" specs.\n\n\nAll in all, there's some really cool ideas in here but basically nothing is executed particularly well. It's not one of those games where there's just one big flaw and if that was fixed it could be great; there's just a hundred smaller flaws with this game that pile up higher than one big flaw could. Who knows. Maybe this game would feel amazing if I played it co-op. Co-op play does seem to be their primary intention based on the trailers. For singleplayer though?

If you have friends you can play with, it's a lot of fun customising the drill.\n - The sounds, especially when shooting the various guns is fantastic. \n - Gathering the resources was pretty quick which I like in these game where you craft,\n - The mechanic of the volcano constantly erupting, and having to dig underground to escape is an interesting game feature.  It sets a limit to how long you have to gather resources and puts excitement to the overall game play. \n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n - This game is janky as hell.  You get stuck on weird corners and ledges.  Shooting with the gun and using the reticle felt like it wasn't hitting or damaging the enemy.  That happened a couple of months ago when I played the game so I am hoping it was fixed.\n - The volcano constantly erupting while neat, got tiring real quick.  After a while I just like going up there to explore and artificially forcing the player to stop got on my nerves after a while.\n - I lost my items when I didn't make a bed, and quit the game.  That was annoying and I don't know if they fixed that in a patch as it's been a while since I last played. \n - Fighting robots isn't satisfying.  Just something about the combat feels bland.\n - It feels as if the drill gets damaged way too easily and you're stuck to constantly repairing it which is annoying.\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]\n\nI don't think this game is really for me.
