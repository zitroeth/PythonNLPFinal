You start with a small base and a landing pad where you can access a mission log. Most of these missions will guide you in the right direction, providing clear goals to work towards, which is quite nice. While there are a few missions I disliked purely because I found them a bit boring or tedious, most of them are enjoyable to complete. Coupled with the exploration of seven randomly generated planets, each offering a plethora of different flora and resources, it makes for a great experience that remains enjoyable even on a second playthrough.\n\nOf course, there are a couple of issues I have with this game. One of them is how glitchy it can be at times. For instance, I have been launched into the sky by hitting a pebble while inside a hamster ball more times than I can count. While it's funny at first, it quickly becomes quite annoying when you realise that once you've been launched, you'll never get anything back from your inventory. This isn't a massive issue since the hamster ball is purely for there to mess around with, but the real problem lies with the achievements. I'm not entirely sure if this is related to playing in a multiplayer world, but sometimes I wouldn't receive achievements or any unlocks when completing a mission, which is frustrating after investing time into completing a series of missions to obtain a specific outfit or color palette.\n\nOverall, despite these few issues, the game is absolutely worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1713168909, "timestamp_updated": 1713187475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785903453826904297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161969924": {"recommendationid": "161969924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357865691", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 13652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13607, "last_played": 1712465876}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like shooting alien's whilst building a military base this game isn't it \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1711996838, "timestamp_updated": 1711996838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768218815326690674", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163038232": {"recommendationid": "163038232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081040656", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 4210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4210, "playtime_at_review": 818, "last_played": 1713799473}, "language": "english", "review": "I have autism and this pleases me greatly", "timestamp_created": 1713351904, "timestamp_updated": 1713351904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.7658882737159729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159816207": {"recommendationid": "159816207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198973519650", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 2654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2442, "last_played": 1711223457}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a cozy and cute game :3", "timestamp_created": 1709517939, "timestamp_updated": 1709517939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754143655300140381", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157289038": {"recommendationid": "157289038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089693705", "num_games_owned": 771, "num_reviews": 170, "playtime_forever": 2837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2837, "last_played": 1706740977}, "language": "english", "review": "Astroneer is an open-world crafting game where you play as an astroneer (astronaut + engineer) who explores various planets in an attempt to research, discover, and find out all the secrets that each planet and moon hold. \n\nTo start, there isn't really any story to the game. There are things called \"curiosities\" and other items that hold pieces of lore, but they are something that you can ignore entirely. The main appeal to this game is its gameplay, not the tiny bit of lore that can be found here and there.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's pretty good. However, one major issue I need to talk about before I gush about the gameplay is that the start of your first playthrough is absolutely miserable for the first hour or two. The game has a horrible way of explaining what to do, how to control certain things, and more. The controls feel absolutely clunky, and you will struggle to do a lot of basic tasks. My friend and I genuinely disliked the game at first due to its inability to show the player how to properly do things, so you pretty much need to discover most of what the game has to offer via trial and error or just looking it up (which we did for a lot of things). There is also a mission system present in the game, but that didn't really help us much, either. There is just so much going on in the game that it acts as information overload.\n\nThankfully, once you get over that learning curve, the game starts to become really enjoyable. There are plenty of things to build, discover, and experiment with. The availability of resources makes it so you need to explore pretty much every planet and moon, allowing you to experience all the different planets that Astroneer has to offer. While some may think this leads to an exhausting grind, I feel like this allows for you to enjoy what a planet has to offer, and then once a planet/moon starts getting boring, you're able to go to the next planet/moon for a whole new environment. I also like how building automatic machines isn't a necessity. This isn't an automation game, but it certainly has the functions to turn it into one if you would like to. \n\nAlso, while playing this game in single-player could certainly be enjoyable, I believe the best way to play this game is in multiplayer. Things like dividing tasks and exploring different areas make the game significantly less grindy and more enjoyable, as doing things with a good friend is always nice. \n\nThe graphics are also very attractive, as the poly-style graphics are fully embraced and are an aspect of basically everything in the game. The sound design is also wonderful, as sounds like placing items onto storage platforms are very crisp. The background music doesn't really stand out much, but it adds a nice touch to the atmosphere, especially deep within cave layers. \n\nAll in all, Astroneer is a rough gem that is clunky in some areas, but overall, it is a pleasure to play. While I wouldn't really want to play this by myself, I found the game to be quite enjoyable with my friend, and I recommend giving this game a try :)", "timestamp_created": 1706740989, "timestamp_updated": 1706740989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738882303237915039", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161848488": {"recommendationid": "161848488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078393840", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 2371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2020, "last_played": 1712532617}, "language": "english", "review": "not many games make me miss the fact that the \"5 more minutes\" i said i'd play was in fact 3 hours. this one has done it multiple times.\r\n\r\n10/10 - one of the most relaxing, easiest to pick up and overall enjoyable exploration-focused space sandbox you can play. plus, it has trains!", "timestamp_created": 1711850098, "timestamp_updated": 1711850098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725732088088989258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158670251": {"recommendationid": "158670251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012212042", "num_games_owned": 413, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 1954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1949, "last_played": 1708382896}, "language": "english", "review": "I really would like to review this positively, however the big issue with the game is lack of a driving force.

Pretty much every unique thing we found, ended up being just research or something to throw in the shredder. The game sort of dabbles in automation with its grabbers and trains, but for what reason, there is none. Its pretty sad that such a good foundation of a game, can be stuffed with the same stuff, and end up feeling so empty, for example, if you travel down into caves, such as the mantle, you have 9999 capsules for event drops, why... its so littered with them that its hard to navigate through the caves.

I spent an hour getting everything set up to get my atmospheric condenser set up on Glacio, and the condenser disappeared before I could place it.

The loop is very simple, so I find myself wondering why I'm gathering more resin for the 100th time, to make stuff that could potentially just disappear.

I don't usually leave reviews but I've gotten so angry at this game.....\n\nI haven't played single player but playing multiplayer, as we progressed the game got more and more buggy to the point of being unplayable. The first glitch that happened was one of our large storages clipping through the ground while we were away from it. We never found it. Next, occasionally when drilling, if I release the mouse button it just keeps digging for several seconds, making it impossible to reliably dig in a tight spot. Next, I'd jump and then freeze in mid-air. After a few seconds I would slam back down to the ground and die from fall damage. Next I couldn't walk at all (even after relogging) and had to wait for my friend to get past the oxygen tethers i was near so i could disconnect them and force a death (because I didn't want to respawn at the home world). The rover frequently gets stuck and you have to get out and dig under it to get it going again - this makes sense in some situations but most of the time it's just sitting on flat ground.

Not just in a fanboy type of sense, this game manages to be a very solid survival game with a pretty unique gameplay loop and lots of variety when it comes to playstyles and environments. Sure, the grind can be a bit much at times, though it's quite a bit more forgiving than many other games, a short break is all you really need to be back to having fun in-game. The game in my opinion is best played with friends as you will all progress much faster, though if you don't have any to play with you can still enjoy it if you play in short bursts. The continued dev support 3 years after the 1.0 release has also been great as they've been adding more content to the game at a consistent pace, with each update adding new ways to enjoy the game as well as some story and free cosmetics. The inclusion of microtransactions for some cosmetics (which are not cheap in the slightest) is a bit sad to see, though if that is what's necessary to keep getting quality updates years after release it's worth it, and well there's nothing really forcing you to spend money on it since the base game gives a pretty wide array of options to begin with, so you can easily just ignore it. \nPROS\n-Nice visuals\n-Pleasant artstyle\n-Varied planets\n-Fun exploration\n-Fairly challenging\n-Lots of content\n-Unique soundtrack\n-Super atmospheric sound design\n-Great replay value\n-Still receiving significant content updates \n-Intruiging story threads\nCONS\n-Frame drop during takeoff and landing with spacecraft, teleporting and when using vehicles (might just be me)\n-Limited backpack storage can lead force you to make several round trips which can get tedious quickly\n-Fast travel system can be a pain to use (though the new trains can fix this pretty easily)\n-Some annoying bugs surrounding gravity, terrain and one questline\n-Some of the additions in the recent updates can make the game significantly easier (this is a problem for those who were already dissatisfied with the changes in hazards when the game left early access)\nEDIT 1: So as I mentioned that my pc is not very good and that the performance may be an issue, but I managed to recently fix the problem by looking in the game files, so the game runs without any problems\nHere's a video I found with instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe2MMQjMrmA\nEDIT 2: So after a recent update, the devs added a graphical options menu, that helped improve the performance so you don't need to go into the engine.\nEDIT 3: Just some changes to the pros and cons since the game has come out of Early Access\nEDIT 4: Updated the full review once again to reflect the current state of the game as of 2022\nOverall pretty fun game, thats still getting better -

There are no instructions nor any tutorial messages - I am completely confused. In this regard it is reminiscent of my first play through of The Long Dark. \n\nI puzzle out the extractor tool and resources, and somehow manage to create two Research Centers and some tethers. Feeling confident I decide to try and reach a mountain in the distant haze. The first storm hits and shortly thereafter the brief foray towards the mountain ends. While fleeing before the storm my Astroneer is struck down by a block to the back of the helmet.\n\nRespawn. Inserting what seems like dozens of gathered items into the Research Centers I learn to make a container and discover the wonder that is additive terraforming. The next twenty minutes is spent building a perfect wall around the meagre base - it includes a horizontal lip at the top of the wall to prevent blocks rolling over. I turn my Astroneer's attention to base expansion and build a smelter and mineral extractor. Delving underground I discover that both copper and aluminium minerals can be found and smelted, allowing the creation of small solar panels which untether research from the tyranny of organic powered generators.\n\nThe second storm hits, I retreat to my walled base to wait out the storm. A block from the sky caves in my Astroneer's face.\n\nRespawn. Spend a further thirty minutes building a roof over the now larger base with extended tunnel entrances to prevent the ingress of errant blocks. It is a master piece of engineering that has blocked out the sun, preventing my solar panels from functioning. I take a moment to admire the sunlight mechanic and in a flurry of resin expand my base outside the cave to reach the glorious sun. I appreciate that a moon or planet orbits directly over my base, as does the sun.\n\nFurther expeditions are made underground and research items are found leading to further discoveries, including the fact that standing too close to a 'plant' while digging it up leads to instant death. \n\nRespawn. A hundred tethers are expended, and research items are laboriously leap frogged back to the ever churning Research Centers, though the number of bytes obtained is distressingly slender. A crisis of faith occurs after hours of effort to grind bytes - I start to feel the grind is not worthwhile. To change it up I decide to work towards an alternate to the endless conversion of hand-mined soil to resources for research. Samples of resources are gathered and stored.\n\nI log off for the night.\n\nA trade post is researched and constructed. The merchant princes of the space station become rich off of the fruits of my Astroneer's labour as Aluminium is exchanged for samples of Malachite, Titanium, and Lithium to allow the now dual Mineral Extractors to churn out all possible resources. Medium Solar Panels and Small Wind Turbines now power the Research Centers. More soil is collected by hand and extracted into resources to fuel the ever-present hunger for bytes, leading to the eventual discovery of both the Medium Rover and 1-Seat. The final back breaking toil leads to the discovery of the Crane, Drill Head, and Medium Storage.\n\nA two Rover mining wagon greatly increases mining output, storms are no longer a pressing threat following the construction of a fully enclosed vehicle bay and the ever-present beacon that point to home.\n\nA chance discovery of two ~6000 byte research items leads to a golden age of technology. Amongst the bounty of research are The Large Rover and Large Storage. A three Rover wagon train is constucted which will facilitate a new level of strip mining and over-land foraging operation. The first wagon is equipped with a medium solar panel that charges the three Rover batteries during the day, allowing for 24 x 7 movement, a large storage for securing research items, and a 1-Seat for wagon train control. Securely behind the lead wagon is the storage wagon, carrying a pair of Large Storage with a mix of Medium Storage and Containers. Finally, there is a Crane/Drill Head car with independent 1-Seat and Medium Storage allowing for both coupled and uncoupled mining. Hungry for bytes I direct the wagon train towards the horizon seeking to plunder downed space craft, mineral deposits, and plant borne research items. \n\nDisaster strikes. A storm materialises in the valley between the wagon train and base. I do what any sane wagon pilot would do - I panic and flee randomly before the storm and plunge into a canyon. The storm passes and at this time I realise that Beacon research would have been a clever idea. I can no longer see the beacon for my base, and am stuck in a deep canyon.\n\nI resolve to exit the canyon and re-locate the base beacon - I can survive indefinitely thanks to the ample batteries of my wagon train and the Medium Solar Panel and if I can avoid being killed by a storm I should eventually be able to locate my base. Exiting the canyon takes three days of digging and driving, but eventually I exit into a mountainous region. I realise I am hopelessly lost and that I may as well plunder as many space craft as I can find while I search for my base. \n\nFive game days have passed and I am now adept at avoiding or flanking the storm, but am no closer to finding my base. Though I am now rich with Titanium, Lithium, and have a full load of research items, I decide to surrender to my fate and walk into the storm to respawn anew. While I await the storm I recall that what I decided was a moon orbits directly over my base. Reasoning that if I drive to and follow its orbit I should eventually locate the dome and vehicle hangar I drive with renewed purpose.\n\nI have travelled for a further two days and am now following the orbit of the moon but can go no further as my path is blocked by a deep canyon sided by two steep mountains. I will have to go back... Unless... I build a bridge. Building the bridge takes half a day, it is barely wide enough for the wagon train but I hope that it is enough as I start to edge the first of the Rovers onto the bridge. Luck is with me and I make it across and renew my journey. \n\nFinally I see the beacon of my base and return triumphant with the spoils of my journey and load up the Research Centers to garner enough bytes to learn how to make Beacons...[/quote]\n\nI initially thought there would not be enough content for me to enjoy solo however it's been eighteen hours already and I haven't even started researching space craft or any of the associated technology.  It was a really fun experience getting lost and deciding to try to find my way back, and I really appreciate that the developers went to the trouble to include non-technology related mechanics that allowed me to find my way back to my base.\n\nThe terraforming is magnificent. The only thing I would change is I would improve the flattening tool such that it brings all ground around it level to the ground in the centre of the selector. As it stands I find it relatively confusing/useless.\n\nThe under ground experience, while initially fun becomes a tedious game of run-tether-run-tether. I experimented with driving a wagon train of two Small Rovers under ground with a bunch of small batteries and a generator but it was made arduous by power management, holes to lower caverns, and object clearing so I abandoned that effort. The above ground experience is much more enjoyable and I love the vehicle train mechanic.\n\nOnce you understand it the inventory mechanic in this game is great. I really enjoy the Medium Storage mechanics on large base structures.\n\nI find the friction in this game a little off for my tastes: Ground vehicles behave as if the tires are clad in teflon and are extremely light weight, and walking down slops can be a little absurd at times. \n\nAnd now I'm at the end of the review word limit!", "timestamp_created": 1514548440, "timestamp_updated": 1543015308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 150, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.92210620641708374", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28474309": {"recommendationid": "28474309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021543753", "num_games_owned": 788, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 3140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1412, "last_played": 1561114648}, "language": "english", "review": "Astroneer is a planet and space exploration game with a mixture of crafting and survival elements on procedurally generated planets. It was finally released in Steam's Eearly Access in 16th December and I have been anxiously waiting for this game for a long time. When I saw the first pictures and trailers, it instantly gave me the sense of freedom and exploration on a grand scale that I have been craving. And of course, I have been very excited these past days when we all can finally set out to seek our destiny in this curious universum.\n\nAs I'm writing this review the game is still in very early development stage and weird bugs and nasty surprises are bound to happen. I was fully aware of this and knew the current annoyances would not keep me from having fun!\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nSo, it all starts with you selecting your hero and landing down to an unexplored planet. Game briefly gives you couple tips how to do things and after that you're on your own. When I got the game, it wasn't even released yet and I enjoyed very much the fact that there were no guides around or too much hand holding within the game. You had to figure stuff out yourself and the system on the background is quite unique and requires at least some focusing for it to be mastered.\n\nYour tasks in the game vary between material collecting for crafting, base building and expanding, researching new types of tech and building more complex stuff. At first you jog around like a humble space peasant, dropping down lifesaving tether lines that lead into resource sites and tunnels. Then you start driving around in small rovers, then bigger trucks and you can even hook these into each other to make trailer combinations. Soon your tether worries are over and your vehicles own life support is enough to keep your lungs well oxygenized!\n\nAll the vehicles and the various gizmos you can install into them require power of course and you can juice them up with solar panels, wind turbines and extra batteries to keep going on. You can scoop up some energy nodes from ground too - or use a bio fueled generator on your vehicle to give it a boost of energy.\n\nWhat I like especially in Astroneer is how your vehicles have certain type of equipment slots and the possibilities of you micro managing them. You can play around with them whenever you like, tear your cargo and items down and change everythings' places on a whim. \n\nI had this scenario dozen times, where my truck was full of supplies, miles deep in the underground tunnels and heading back home. The vehicles store up only so much energy, so eventually I ran out of juice. I tear down a fully loaded cargo module, drop it on the ground while I grab a generator from my suit's shoulder, slam it in the truck's side and give it some time to recharge batteries. Once I'm good to go, I snap the cargo module back on and keep on truckin. Later on, I of course fine tuned my truck with solar panels, a wind turbine and a generator with enough biofuel to go with it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=820419404\n\n[h1]The World[/h1]\nThe graphic style, animations and visual effects are all very appealing. I love the edgy, simplified and clean style of the game and it all ties well together with the soundtrack. The soundtrack is there, but it's not really stealing away your attention from the game itself - and yet after hours and hours of listening to it you still don't get annoyed by it. \n\nI visited all the seven planets the game currently has and they all have their own biome and special weather effects and dangers. The terrain on a barren planet is dusty, sandy and well\u2026 Barren, with little vegetation. Arctic planet has a chilly and very rough terrain, where moving around in vehicle is pretty much impossible. And all this time when you adventure on various planets, you can see the other planets in midst of starts when you look up into the night sky.\n\nIt took me 24 hours in 3 different days to rummage through most of the current content and to figure out all the bells and whistles. I would have done it probably sooner too, but I had to start a fresh game 3 times due to one savegame file not loading up anymore and on the second savegame my character was stuck inside a building. (Can't destroy buildings or anything you build at least for now) Again, nasty early access symptoms but nothing major to worry about. System Era has been pushing out solid patches on daily bases and they DO listen to your troubles as long you report the bugs on a proper channel: their own forums.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=820434992\n\n[h1]Crafting & Building[/h1]\nCrafting in Astroneer in pretty simple and straight forward. You build various kinds of workstations and they all serve their own purpose. Smelter smelts ores, Printer \"prints\" various modules and items on resource materials, Vehicle Bay allows you to build Rovers, Trucks, Shuttles and even Spaceships that can punch through starting planets' orbit to expand your colony into other planets. Research station unlocks new technologies like new vehicles, gear, modules etc. \n\nLike vehicles, these workstations require energy too - and of course resources depending on what you're about to build. You can fine tune your bases energy needs with solar panels, wind turbines and extra energy bank. Solar panels don't generate energy at night, wind turbines won't spin if there's no wind. Yeah, duh. But I like the attention to these details. And these are all detachable, movable items so you can switch their places depending on your base needs and they fit in vehicles too.\n\nThe starting planet's surface has more than plenty of basic materials available. The harder metals are underground and there's tunnel entrances almost everywhere to be found. The rarest materials can only be found via researching various strange items found in the world. They can be in a form of giant seeds, roots, crates, glowy rocks etc. Once you get off the starting planet, these rare materials can also be found on planet's surface areas and they require more advanced drilling mechanisms for you to collect them.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=821109136\n\n\n-- \n\nAt the moment - once you have unlocked all the tech and built most things, there's really no \"need\" to leave the starting planet. Not much will change in the game - the planets all have the same materials so the only valid reason at the moment is to see the sights and explore new areas. I have no idea about the game's future plans, but I do see it brightly lit. Astroneer is one of those 'good vibe games', where you can truly relax, have fun by yourself or with friends and family. Game has no violence: you don't shoot or smack or kill anything in it - though the nature and elements on planets vary and they can kill you if you're not cautious enough. Luckily death is no permanent, so just jog back to the unlucky previous You and you can save your precious items and continue your adventures. \n\nI am eagerly waiting for some minor bug fixes that gave grey hairs to my cute Astronaut and of course more content - any and all kinds of!

From that pod you can connect a dozen or so stations that you use to create your space base.  3d printers, fuel condensers, vehicle manufacturing, research station and much more.  Of course you will have to gather resources to build and create, but rest assured, on the first planet there are plenty of things to gather.\n\nFirst planet?  Oh yes, there are multiple planets in this solar system.  All of which are unique, have unique drop rates, and some special found items.  Every world has multiple biomes, and massive, extensive cave systems.\n\nresearch is pretty easy, you scrounge around looking for items you can plop in the research bay, activate them, and stand back hoping to get a slot machine win.  Once researched you can gain pretty cool capabilitys.\n\nThere are cars, two sizes, space ships, 2 sizes, solar panels, generators, wind turbines, and a ridiculous mount of other things.\n\nWhen digging into the ground you can hold ctrl and create a perfect tunnel at just the right slope to dig hundreds of feet into the earth to find materials, exotic organic research items, rocky research items, space ship debris research items, poisonous plants, plants that attack, and both energy and oxygen bearing crystals.\n\nAll the while you are building your base you carefully manage resources, power, oxygen and your umbilicle tether which connects you and keeps you alive.\n\nFrom MASSIVE caves, hundreds and hundreds of feet deep covering the entire planet, to great plains, exotic jungles, barren moons, radioactive worlds, sandstorns that beat you to death with boulders, and even ice planets, there is an unending array of land to build on, and items to create and collect.\n\nYour digging tool can also build!

In astroneer, you're really just gathering resources to colonize a series of planets and moons (Sylva, Desolo, Vesania, Novus, Calidor, Glacio, and Atrox). large story spoiler ahead [spoiler] you then find that there is something supernatural about these planets, you find the gateways. The gateways, once activated, will teleport you to the center of the planet, where you can activate it. once you activate every planet, and place a \"Triptych\" in every slot on the cosmic bright node (weird alien satelite above the star) the ending plays out, i will not say what happens [/spoiler]\n\nAlright, now gameplay, astroneers transport is mainly based around land vehicles, and/or transport by foot. When on foot, tethers are placed down to give you oxygen to explore out and around the planet. you will go into caves to find resources and dig them with your terrain tool, and using these resources, you can create a base. you also find research items all around the planet, and by researching those in a research chamber, you get bytes to unlock new items to make. the one thing i don't like about the game is that the camera is a little buggy at times, and will stick on your cursor without right-clicking sometimes, but other than that, great gameplay\n\nOverall review (TL;DR): Astroneer is an amazing survival game that's perfect for a good time with friends. 9/10\n\nThanks for reading!", "timestamp_created": 1586283048, "timestamp_updated": 1586641296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 147, "votes_funny": 39, "weighted_vote_score": "0.904256761074066162", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128192559": {"recommendationid": "128192559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136188692", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1551, "last_played": 1670193272}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought the game to play with friend.\nDuring that time we:\n-purposely broke tethers on each other\n-danced\n-dug straight down (I might have died once or twice)\n-built a roadway to space\n-enslaved little creatures in jars for our amusement\n-ruined ecosystems\n-partook in many other fun activities.\n\nvery enjoyable 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1670543319, "timestamp_updated": 1670543319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 141, "votes_funny": 62, "weighted_vote_score": "0.903983831405639648", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117938862": {"recommendationid": "117938862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237444042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 4633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4045, "last_played": 1679117018}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Gameplay}---\n\u2611\ufe0f Try not to get addicted\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Nothing special\n\u2610 Ehh\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Just dont\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2611\ufe0f Too much grind\n\u2610 Insanity\n\n---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 You forget reality\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\u2611\ufe0f Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Will do\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Awful\n\u2610 Pixel art\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611\ufe0f Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n---{Audience}---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens\n\u2610 Adults\n\u2611\ufe0f Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611\ufe0f Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n\u2610 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611\ufe0f Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Not so easy\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Game Time}---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611\ufe0f Depends on you\n\u2610 Endless\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 Just buy it\n\u2611\ufe0f Worth the price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 Dont throw money into a rubbish bin\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2610 Never had any\n\u2611\ufe0f Minor bugs\n\u2610 Few bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 Ruining the game\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611\ufe0f 9\n\u2610 10", "timestamp_created": 1656607098, "timestamp_updated": 1656607098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 761, "votes_funny": 43, "weighted_vote_score": "0.902767360210418701", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28486980": {"recommendationid": "28486980", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995853643", "num_games_owned": 1593, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1482242047}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little survival on alien world/s early access game. Collect resources, build your base up, perform research and explore the surface and underground caverns (and then other planets/moons). Game is very much in alpha, but able to be enjoyed in single player currently, recognising that you will have some crashes and glitches. If you expect your games to be optimised, with polished controls and relatively bug free, then wait until release. \n\nMultiplayer is enabled but I wouldn't recommend doing more than just taking a look. Sync issues are rampant and there appears to be no mechanism to routinely resync. When driving, lag can result in the non-host players getting ahead of landscape detail being rendered, causing physics issues when things pop in underneath or inside you. Falling through the terrain is a regular occurrence. Some messages e.g. research outcomes are only displayed to the host. Basically, the multiplayer allows others to jump into the hosts game and help them out. They don't have separate bases of their own and can't save their own progress - it simply saves to the host and non-host players rejoin from scratch, hoping to locate and raid their previous backpack (corpse). Potential to be an enjoyable co-op experience once the dev's get around to working on the multiplayer.

Also, please note that some of the pros and cons in here apply to both, just one of them more than the other.\n\nPros (Singleplayer):\n-Great graphics. Even before 1.0 this game looked good, but with 1.0 released, it looks even better.\n-Each planet has different things to explore, like Sylva having large underground caves, or Atrox having large cuts through the land to hide from the dangerous flora.\n-Easy to play, to an extent. Some things take longer than others (I'm looking at you, nanocarbon alloy), but you can play at any pace you want.\n\nCons (Singleplayer):\n-Low FPS. With good graphics comes low FPS, especially with some worse computers. Luckily, it isn't too bad, and there are ways around it.\n-Repetitive gameplay. Go ahead and tell me making your umpteenth RTG is gonna be fun.\n-Questionable physics, such as the player apparently being affected by gravity significantly more than medium rovers when to outer space. Not recommended, unless you like losing rovers.\n-Why use a rocket when flipping your rover sends you higher?\n\nNow that that's out of the way, it's time for Multiplayer.\n\nPros (Multiplayer):\n-Play with friends! Well, if you have any.\n-Safer exploration. Plummet to your doom in an extremely deep chasm? Have a friend run down there and retrieve your belongings! Just don't be surprised when they do the same.\n-Wheee! 2 players means one of them follows behind your rocket in a rover to be sent to space.\n\nCons (Multiplayer):\n-Low FPS at longer distances. Hey, at least your internet connection is stable... Oh. You've disconnected.\n-Bugs! Things like objects slipping through the ground and into a nearby cave, or your dig tool magically becoming a large piece of whatever material that was on the back of it.\n\nTL;DR: Single player and Multiplayer have their pros and cons. Though mostly pros.\nSingle player 9/10 Recommended for people who want a relaxing sandbox game to play in their free time.\nMultiplayer 8/10.

You'll plop down on the easiest one with nothing but a shelter, and you'll mine, build platforms and research stations, learn new tech, mine some more, and make a surprisingly easy trip to another planet where you'll do the same things again.  You'll do this repeatedly until you have the ability to drill to the core of the planet in five minutes and unlock the \"story\".   And then go back and do it on all the other planets.\n\nThere are no aliens, apart from the hostile flora occasionally one-shotting you.  The biggest risks are falling through the honeycomb-structured caves underneath the surface of every planet, or running out of air, neither of which are concerns with enough tech.\n\nDespite the visual differences between the planets, the structure is the same.  There's a surface with junk, mining and research objects, and then truly massive cave systems with more of the same all the way down to the core of the planet.  Navigation is an absolute b*tch.  You can travel to another world within seconds, but creating a radar system so you can find your way home when you drive too far out is simply beyond you.  Beacons are awful and disappear over the horizon quickly.\n\nA relatively simply game shouldn't have this many bugs.  Objects sometimes disappear beneath the ground.  Some stations (especially the soil centrifuge) randomly stop working.  Solar panels on vehicles occasionally derp out.  A few death-backpacks were unrecoverable, with others occasionally eating all the fuel I had on me.  If you slap a few rockets onto a car and launch yourself into the lower atmosphere, you're not coming back, no matter how much fuel you burn while aimed directly at the planet.  I had a piece of phantom graphite stuck to my backpack that turned off my ability to craft anything until I died.  Geographical hitboxes are occasionally nonsense, be prepared to flip your giant rover because it passed within two feet of a tiny cave spike.  \n\nAstroneer's netcode is garbage.  There is no text chat.  Although not enough to ruin a multiplayer experience, disconnections are frequent and annoying.  If it starts happening, don't carry objects around in the \"immersive\" way (with your actual hands), because as soon as you disconnect it'll blink out of existence with you.  I couldn't even use the winch on the back of the truck because it twitched like it was possessed by a space demon, but the host could.  When driving vehicles, whoever's behind the wheel will determine the ACTUALITY of the terrain.   If you're driving down a fast slope into the caves, but it's not loading fast enough for you, it's going to look to everyone else like you just fell through the road into the abyss.  \n\nThere is no endgame.  There are no buildings to be built, no farming, no hostiles, no colonists, no weather, nothing.  The first 10 hours will be almost exactly like the last 10 hours that you play, just with more toys.  You'll finish the tech tree long before you drill to the core of each world.  There's nothing wrong with most of what's in this game, it's just a good setup to something that never happens - the second half.", "timestamp_created": 1611536772, "timestamp_updated": 1611536772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 148, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881844997406005859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38442401": {"recommendationid": "38442401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030371324", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 32198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6897, "last_played": 1704167437}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been playing Astroneer since launch Dec 2016, but haven't reviewed it until now, a full year later. I can honestly say that the game is now at a point where I would recommend buying it. \n\nAstroneer has, since launch, had a relaxing and fun space-sandbox feel to it.\nDeforming the terrain feels unique, and the exploration is top notch. It plays great both single player and multiplayer, and you can play for hours without even realizing it.\n\nIt took the first year to get us to Alpha, with the foundation laid this game should get regular updates. Astroneer has changed quite a bit, initially it was more of a proof of concept, and didn't seem realistic. However, the last two big updates have fixed that.

There are several things that set it apart from other survival/resource/craft games, and oddly enough some of the things that make it so enjoyable for me are the same things I've read others complaining about.

That has been played out in so many other titles and simply doesn't fit the atmosphere and mood of this game.\n-No map. THIS is huge. I sincerely enjoy having to keep track of my compass bearing, leaving a breadcrumb trail of beacons, or approaching a cave intersection and pondering which direction you came from. There is no hand holding here, you get lost, you must find your way back! No popping open a radar mini-map and glancing at it for a few seconds to solve all problems, or blandly following a ping on your HUD. Its great and makes navigation feel very rewarding. \n-This is obviously a very active dev team who are working tirelessly to improve the game post-launch. Those complaining about performance and technical issues strike me as a bit spoiled and reliant on top-tier gaming rigs. I play on a potato, it runs, and I enjoy the heck out of the experience. \n-In all, this is a gorgeous game with solid mechanics and very fun to play with friends.

It scratches the same \"itch\" that games like Minecraft & Factorio aim for. Start with basically nothing, and work your way up into a big base of operations through mining resources and exploration. The wonderful twist that Astroneer brings to the table is that you can fly to another planet. When you arrive at this planet, assuming you don't know what you're doing, you basically get to start all over again but with a new set of minerals available to you. You can then fly back to your original planet and drop of the new stuff, or start working on an entirely new base set on this new planet. \n\nThere's plenty of stuff to do on your home planet as well. With the addition of vehicles, and road-construction equipment (pavers) you can make a planet-wide highway and connect special points of interest to it. You can get into automation and have robo-arms pick up and place resources in specific slots for you. Being able to watch your base \"live\" by itself is something I imagine a successful parent feels every day.\n\nObviously, this game becomes much better with friends. But I hate saying that, as ANYTHING is better with friends. Like taxes. So take this point with a grain of salt. There are pilot seats that hold up to 3 people. There's a crane that your buddy can operate separately from the driver. You can place resources in someone else's backpack. It's clear the developers made this game and kept in mind that more than one person might be playing at the same time. Multiplayer isn't required, it's optional. Having friends is good, if you have the chance, get your friends into this game.\n\nI look forward to seeing this game stay relevant and get more updates in the future.

concept and world. really addicting at the start, However a lot of wasted potential\n\nAllow me to give you the TLDR first before diving into the overview:\nThe game is very beautiful, relaxing and chill to play. There is good progression in the first 20h of the game. After this point it becomes just more of the same. Collect materials, explore build more advanced things or build them easier. After this point in the game there is nothing new or different you can do. Also due to each planet having specific resources and nothing else really, for me personally I don't see a reason to replay the game as the gameplay will be pretty much identical to the first time.\n\n\nThe Long(er) review:\nI purchased Astroneer when it was released and I was really into it from the start. I really liked the beautiful plants, the color pallet, the fact that everything is visible, nothing hides in a menu or in your pocket (or menu), If you have it. You see it. Also the art style of the game I personally really love!\n\nThe Game is great at the beginning, with great atmosphere, graphics, very chil vibe. \nAlso the progression is good with constant upgrades and new things you can build, that would allow you to craft more and better tools.\n\nHowever the Devs don't seem to have any further goals/ideas for expanding this game. \n\nLet me explain this one: Directly after full release they added a cosmetic shop for real money, each space suit (sometimes just a different color) cost 1/3 of the prices of the game itself. with visors being separate and other parts and trinkets. I'm not against there being a cash shop. \n\nHowever they continued to just fix broken game elements. Without adding anything of value. They add little things here and there, just some natural progression items or things you expect to be there from the start. Other than that they focus on hosting timed events that you have to play during a couple of weeks period in order to earn new cosmetics or fancy items. Otherwise the cash shop is your only option. Until today nothing really game changing or evolving has been added. No new planets, game changing items, mechanics, biomes, missions, NPCs, random events, etc.\nThis for me is really disappointing as the devs could have made the game so much more than what it is right now.\n\nThey could have possibly added new planets with new resources to expand on the game, Or a whole new solar system you can visit with possibly even focus on some combat or discovery. \nInstead they add things like chess pieces, or gates to allow you to spend hours creating a track to race on, while the driving experience is arguably one of the weakest parts of the game. Again for me it really seems what is in the game was all the devs really had in mind. And I find this very unfortunate as the game could have had soooo many new things and mechanics added to it to really push the game to a new level in terms of gameplay and mechanics.\n\nAs it currently stands: after gathering all of the resources and building all of the advanced items. There is really no reason to keep playing or get to the ending as there is nothing new or different you will experience or do other than what you have already done to get to this point.\nThat's why for me there is little to no replay value due to the very linear progression and exploration path set out for you.\nSince release the game still has only the same set of planets to visit, with mostly the same stuff on them.\n\nI also really dislike that they seem to mostly focus on timed events, always accompanied by new paid cosmetics for the game shop. Instead of providing players a reason to actually return and replay or keep on playing the game and possibly buy cosmetics for fun or to support the game and it's devs. For me personally there is no such incentive when cosmetic items seem to be the core focus.\n\nUltimately I really enjoyed myself with the game and I played most of it during the first year of the game's release. I kept on checking in when updates drop to see what's new and what is cooking, Unfortunately the updates rarely made me feel like there is anything worth jumping back in for. \nAdding to this that there are games that offer so much more in terms of world, content, exploration, replay-ability and diversity in things you do. For less money.\n\nThe dev team has been acquired by a game publisher recently and they say that they have a new roadmap for 2024.

I have put lots of hours into it already at its current stage. \n\nI played Space Engineers for a while, and when I came back a couple years later it was cumbersome, complex, required relearning lots of keyboard shortcuts to play properly. I was not interested in spending the time learning how to play again, I just wanted to play. Astroneers takes all of the complexities out of that style of gameplay, and in a much more peaceful environment. \n\nI still die all the time, though. No Oxygen, No Power (if you're trapped), Falling from Heights, Radiated Worms, Falling in Craters... will all kill you. \n\nThe only negatives I can mention all relate to it being in the Alpha stage: occassional graphics abnormalities, falling through the ground, awkward inventory management across the base. The content so far is pretty basic, but definitely enough to keep me playing. \n\nIf you like Space, Building, Strategy, Exploring... this game is such a YES for the price. Active developers looking for feedback, fun multiplayer, future content planned... as long as they keep it up it will be one I come back to frequently to unwind after a long day!\n\nEdit: (From a reply I made to another post)\n\nI run this on a laptop. Its decent, but in no way a gaming PC. I've noticed FPS issues during multiplayer (upon joining and especially if someone other than host is driving a vehicle) as well as some of my first maps that now have multiple bases on each planet. Still playable by far, definitely not game breaking. Some people have had issues with framerates, but devs in general will not devote a lot of time to an issue that only affects a few people.

Yes. While these appear to be the next trend, I have to say Astroneer is a very strong candidate in the category to become something amazing and excel. I'd rate it higher than I did Osiris: New Dawn, which I really enjoy as well. Upon starting your first game, you are welcomed to a beautiful landscape of a foreign alien planet. Honestly, beautiful doesn't even describe how the game looks and feels. The colors, the weather, the ambiance, all come together perfectly and really immerses you in this game. It feels like a trip and you're suddenly peaking, wanting to experience this vibrant and vast world. Just watching the stars and planets rise on the horizon will keep you entertained by just how well done it looks. \n\nSo aside from the graphics, what sets this game apart from the plethora of other early access space sandbox games? The actual sandbox. You are able to shape and mold the landscape to your will in almost any way you want. The terraform tool is something that puts Minecraft to shame, it left me awestruck multiple times with how good it feels to dig just a simple hole. The cave generation is absolutely stunning. You will travel for miles in caves, and thankfully with the tether system, you will always have a line to get back home. You will lose hours without realizing it playing this. The survival is not a constant nag, expect for oxygen which you will lose rather quick without the tether system. Honestly though, the tether system is a great thing and takes the concept of putting torches down in Minecraft to mark your way back, and just amplifies that by ten. \n\nAstroneer has a very unusual tranquil feeling to it, at least for me, even with the constant danger of sandstorms hurling huge rocks that instantly kill you and oxygen demands, I never felt pressured. Playing this felt the same as Minecraft back in Indev before anyone knew about the game and talked about all the secrets. Just a beautiful serene experience, and it's almost impossible to think the developers think this is a pre-alpha.

Its clear from the sleek design and visuals, to the intu\u00eftive gameplay that the creators know what they're doing. \n\nWhat drew me to Atroneer in the first place though, was simply the art style. Nowadays there are lot of sci fi games, a lot of survival games, and even more sci-fi/survival games. And whilst most of them try to stick with a (semi) realistic style, Astroneer seperates itself from the competition by presenting you with a beautifully rendered stylized alien planet. \n\nThe game looks simple, but the creators have found a way to present very interesting and varying vista's with the use of procedural generation. Now eversince the No Man's Sky fiasco the word \"procedural generation\" has left a bit of a bad taste in people's mouths, and for good reason. \n\nHowever I believe that even in early acces, Astroneer manages to make its enviroments look more interesting than No Man's Sky has been able to do so far. \n\nBe advised though! This game is NOT like No Man's Sky. Right now the gameplay focusses on mining and base building. And eventhough the creators have said they want to expand and eventually include spaceflight in the game. This will never be anything like No Man's Sky in my opinion. \n\nIts a bit more simplistic, but its not boring. Its a lot of fun already to simply hop around and look for secrets and interesting spots. And mine for new recources to expand your base. And like I said, the game plays very intu\u00eftive. \n\nIs it worth $20? Well that depends. If you take the game at face value, eventhough it already offers a couple of hours of fun gameplay, $20 dollars might be a bit of a steep entry price. Especially if you are not sure if you would like the game. Perhaps wait for a Steam sale.\n\nHowever I'm a fan of this sort of game, I love the art style, and I think it has a lot of potential so I supported the developers by buying the $25 dollar soundtrack edition. At the end of the day these things always include a bit of a leap of faith, but I believe, given the chance this game can turn out great.", "timestamp_created": 1482357441, "timestamp_updated": 1482408026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 131, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853955566883087158", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110669364": {"recommendationid": "110669364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211699015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1089, "last_played": 1590451912}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2611 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2611 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

It's fine. It's not [i]bad[/i], per say, but I don't think it's very [i]good[/i], either.\nIt's just kinda... okay. It exists, it might be fun for some people, but in my opinion, there's just too much... mediocrity.\n\n--The game gives you a minor tutorial on how to do the most basic tasks. It's not too well done, and it wasn't until I actually played with friends that I understood the concepts that the tutorial tried to teach you.-- This was removed.\n\nAfter that, you're shot down onto a randomly generated - but very same-looking - planet, and not given any direction at all. What you *have* to do is get a researching table up and running, along with basic power. Once this is done, you research a way off the planet to get to other planets with different resources, so you can research better things quicker and build bigger, \"better\" things.\n\nIn premise, that's fine.\n\nIn practice, it's kinda boring. You [b]need[/b] to get the same essential base set up on every single planet, over - and over - and over again. And spoiler alert: It isn't much more fun the 5th or 6th time you have do it. A jetpack doesn't make building a Soil Centrifuge and watching it grind to a halt for 20 minutes 'coz you have no power in your batteries any less infuriating.\n\nIn theory, the teleportation methods you unlock at the core of every planet would make this easier - if you didn't have to get to the core of every single planet (a task that could take you hours on the bigger planets) - meaning you still need to set up that basic little base - and if you could teleport more than just yourself and the measely 8 things you can carry on your back.\n\nI'll draw a weird parallel here with Minecraft. In Minecraft, you go from making a Pickaxe, to making a better pickaxe, to finding ways other than mining to gather resources (like Villager Trading and Witch, Pigman, or Iron Golem Farms), at which point it opens up to a true sandbox-style adventure. Resources stop being your main limiting factor and you are free to build what you want, go where you want, do what you want, having experienced mechanics that try to inspire you to have goals to strive for, and irritants that could be easier. You start off Surviving, and by the end game you [i]thrive[/i]. The same could be said of a few other \"survival\" games. Like Don't Starve, or Rimworld.\n\nAstroneer just... never seems to get that far. There is no point where [i]\"Thriving\"[/i] happens. You survive until you can leave the planet, then you leave the planet to try to survive somewhere else, ad-infinium. Even the end-game \"best\" gear item - a Portable Oxygen Generator you can carry anywhere - feels limiting, as it needs power to run, which is in short supply since your mining tool will likely use a lot of power by then. It's arguably worse than the basic Tethers you can make from day 1.\n\nMaybe that point of \"not just surviving, but thriving\" comes when you get to the core of every planet and unlock the gateway. I don't know. But according to the Steam Statistics, [b]Less than 2% of players even get that far.[/b] 98 out of 100 people will simply stop playing before they get to the \"end game\".\n\nAnd that's not mentioning the questionable marketing - like how there's [b]Premium Currency[/b] in this $30 game, or how if you want a dedicated server that allows you to earn achievements - and the cosmetics linked to those achievements - you have to pay some third-party hosting company. If there's modding in the future, I don't doubt that they would pull a Bethesda and make you pay for that, too.\n\nI want to like this game. I really do. But every time I play it, it just drains me. I get bored, tired, and physically exhausted within the day. Astroneer - to me - seems like it's trying to be more than it is, and failing to meet those expectations. It's a one-trick pony that keep promising to be different and never is.\n\nIs it fun? Initially, yes.\nDoes it have potential? Yes. And I would love to see the devs act on it, instead of having pointless Seasonal Events every three months.\n\nWould I recommend it?\n\nEh? Not without telling someone to prepare for it to eventually gather dust on the shelf.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nE: Shrinkshooter and Krzeszny both bring up good points, and I'll paraphrase them here so they don't get lost in the comments.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, you are urged to keep going solely by the mystery of discovery. What is at the core of the planet? What is on the next planet? And the one after that? What happens when you open the Gateway? These questions give you the motivation to keep pressing on. However, once you get to the end game, that question just doesn't exist anymore. When that happens, you are left with only 5 things to do.\n\n1: Unlock every recipe (which usually can be done in an hour or two on the \"high research\" planets)\n\n2: Collect all the little collectible things. Plants, Zebra Balls, Materials... This honestly doesn't take [i]too[/i] long to do, so for those who want to do it, it's not much.\n\n3: Mess around with Logic Gates (Which [i]definitely[/i] will not be fun for a lot of people, as this isn't a logistics-focused game.)\n\n4: Do Seasonal Events (which... are seasonal. They aren't always an option, and they usually don't offer much content.)\n\n5: Start over and do it again, perhaps with someone else.\n\nSo, once that urge of discovery wears off... you really have to enjoy a [i]very specific[/i] style of gameplay to keep enjoying the game. That playstyle simply will not appeal to everyone. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it will not appeal to most players.", "timestamp_created": 1595807616, "timestamp_updated": 1644587147, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 736, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851760447025299072", "comment_count": 33, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28402930": {"recommendationid": "28402930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127283640", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1669230323}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes Mans Sky", "timestamp_created": 1481886885, "timestamp_updated": 1481886885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 523, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851229488849639893", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91840073": {"recommendationid": "91840073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271827307", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1621637636}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game for the family!\n\nI left my wife on a deserted planet, then she left me in a deserted house\n\n10/10 would leave her on Aatrox again!", "timestamp_created": 1620764302, "timestamp_updated": 1620764302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 102, "votes_funny": 184, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850388765335083008", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48848288": {"recommendationid": "48848288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150024629", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3848, "last_played": 1555159937}, "language": "english", "review": "It pains me to leave a negative review for this game... but... \n\nI've been playing this game since early access, maybe late 2017 time.

Astroneer is a relaxing very grindy base building, survival, resource gathering and exploration game, and a very good one at that. It has a simple and addicting gameplay loop around resource gathering and researching new items, but as expected new resources require going further from base and exploring the planet/planets surface, caves and mountains for these rarer resources. Pretty soon this will mean visiting the 6 planets (technically 2 of them are moons) for new ores and later on, gases. Be warned though, Astroneer is quite grindy so if that's not your thing at all, maybe Astroneer is not the game for you :)\n\nAstroneer has 3 potential causes of death, fall damage and suffocation. Fall damage works exactly like it does in every other game, but oxygen is a lot more interesting. Near the base or a vehicle, the player is given oxygen, and when venturing more than a few metres away, the players oxygen tank will start decreasing, eventually resulting in death. The player can craft tethers to provide a hose of oxygen so that they can explore free of oxygen risks, or they can use air filters to provide a 1 time use boost to their oxygen for a bit. Tethers also provide a useful trail to lead the player back home to base. Later on vehicles can be used to explore completely free of oxygen risks. the third risk is plants that can blow up you or shoot stuff at you or inject poison into you with giant needles. When you die, a grave icon appears above your grave and you can retrieve all your stuff. Astroneer's survival elements are fairly minimal and easy, but this keeps the gameplay relaxing. But don't be fooled, you can run into some tricky survival situations if you're not careful, and if you can't find you grave because it was to far from base or you were deep in a maze-like cave system away from tethers, you may never get your stuff back. All in all, the survival elements of Astroneer add some great depth and enjoyment in gameplay, while not feeling to difficult or frustrating in order to keep the relaxing experience of Astroneer. \n\nNavigation is another key part of Astroneer. The player is given a compass (hover over your character to see the compass), tethers, beacons and the stars to navigate around the planet. Smart players can avoid getting lost even when leaving their tethers by setting up beacons to follow back home or by using the compass well, but even so every player gets lost sometimes. Finding out how to use the stars for navigation (which I won't reveal here) is a very satisfying and useful way for navigation, but you could even go so far as to get a friend to guide you back home from a space shuttle orbiting the planet!\n\nWhich brings us to the next topic, multiplayer. Astroneer has 4 player co op (soon to be 8 players in a few months with the introduction of dedicated servers) that simply works with one player hosting a game and the other players joining. It's simple and works really well. Multiplayer greatly increases the fun in Astroneer, speeds up progression and just makes the game better. Astroneer is best with friends, simple as that.\n\nVehicles are another key part of Astroneer, providing oxygen, faster exploration, storage and increased mining potential. The vehicles range from small exploration buggy's, to massive rovers that could even be changed together to form mobile bases. Vehicles greatly increase the fun of the game, exploration potential, and mobile bases are EPIC.\n\nBase building is really satisfying. You can enhance your base with terrain creations, but it is not required. The power system in bases is also handled really well. Not a whole lot to say here, but base building is really good!\n\nAstroneer also features a toggleable creative mode. You can activate and turn on creative mode in existing survial saves, but this will not allow you to get achievments in that save. Creative mode is fabulous for customising your experience, going crazy with base building and creating epic structures from terrain, or just mucking about and attempting to blow a planet up with dynamtite (it has been done before ;). Personnally I don't use creative mode heaps, although its great for setting up survival challenges, but I have seen some players do some absolutely crazy things with creative mode and built some insane creations.\n\nTheres also a mysterious story if thats your thing btw. The ending is pretty epic ;)\n\nTo summarise, Astroneer is superbly designed game that's really relaxing, addictive, and can be a blast to play with or without friends. Survival elements are fairly easy but fit the games atmosphere and style really well, getting a perfect balance between difficulty and relaxing gameplay. The mystery story is also pretty cool.  Be warned though the game is quite grindy, so if you really hate mining, it may not be the game for you.\n\nPow\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1586866926, "timestamp_updated": 1586866926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.845593273639678955", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98881741": {"recommendationid": "98881741", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092707072", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2792, "last_played": 1693578890}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2611 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2611 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2610 10\n\n[hr][/hr]\nGrab this review template [url=https://vojtastruhar.github.io/steam-review-template/] here [/url].\n", "timestamp_created": 1630932740, "timestamp_updated": 1630932740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 269, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.845483660697937012", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82676741": {"recommendationid": "82676741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025236198", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1686200538}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fairly open exploration game about searching planets for resources, and finding hidden secrets.

Now they've added automation, so there's even more to do, if exploring isn't all you burn for.

When you have completed the game for the first time, you inevitably analyze what you did right, and what you did that was comically inefficient. And on the next replay, you find how easy it can be, to the point of eventually speed-running the whole thing. (I relate this initial struggle and ultimate cake walk to the first time I played Subnautica LOL. In Subnautica, I was afraid of my own shadow the moment it became dark my first time out, and insanely cautious. But with a couple of runs I could complete the entire game in a very short time). Well, there is nothing scary in ASTRONEER (aside from occasionally aggressive flora), and it is easy to master & enjoy.\n\nI whole-heartedly Recommend ASTRONEER, whether playing Solo or Co-op - You will have a great time.... over and over.

It\u2019s broad to cover many circumstances that could be problematic and require forthrightness, especially since the passing of stronger privacy law in the EU. Astroneer does not contain any advertisements, and collects only telemetry required to enable in-game achievements and monitor game stability.\n\nIf anyone wishes not to play Astroneer because of the content of the EULA, we understand and respect your decision. The EULA is what it is to enable us to make all the games we might wish to make, in all regions, abiding by all applicable law.\n\nFeel free to reach out to me directly if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for System Era. My email is adam@systemera.net\n\nEDIT: Thanks again for your feedback!
