However, I'd like to stress that this doesn't really matter. In my 50 hours of playing I never once even felt like anything from the shop would be remotely useful, let alone wanted it. Anything from the shop can be obtained with ease in the game in more quantity than you could want. Honestly, having read a lot of the other reviews, they're pretty misleading in regard to any of the shop items available actually being important or necessary. \n\n[h3] Recipes [/h3]\n\nAs you progress, you will have available to you more technology and items to craft. You need to unlock these with recipes to be able to have the ability to craft these items. There are many ways to get recipes in-game for free, including opening chests, and offering dust that you get literally everywhere via \"sanctifying\" to the goddess statue. I was conservative with my recipes and unlocked things as needed, but after being finished playing, I had nearly 200 spare recipes without ever having spent a single dollar on the game.\n\n[h3] Time Lock [/h3]\n\nYep, it's true. You need to purchase an item to sustain your world every month if it's a co-op world. [i] However, [/i] I do mean [i] sustain. [/i] Even if you choose to make a co-op world, you can play for 30 days without paying anything, and without any info on file. Plug and play. And honestly, there isn't any reason to play this game for more than a week or so. No one should really be hitting that 30 day mark.\n\n[h3] Earthly Pyroxene [/h3]\n\nThis is something you need for creating certain time-gated items required to fight bosses additional times if you need more of their drops for upgrading gear. I'll get into time-gated items later since it's a MAJOR downside in the game. There are a few ways to get Earthly Pyroxene in-game for free including dailies, and a few others that don't come to mind. Be conservative with this resource. \n\n[h1] Time-gating [/h1]\n\nOh boy, the big one. The biggest reason I am done with this game coupled with the TERRIBLE bug that sprung up in the most recent update which I will cover in the final section. After the second boss, the items you need to fight the later bosses start requiring [i] multiple [/i] time-gated items that each player may only craft once until the time has elapsed. First 2 hours, then 8, then 24. I stopped once I saw I needed seven 24-hour crafts to fight the next boss. There is one more biome after the zone I was on, and I can only assume it's even longer. Throw in the fact that growing cotton to make cloth and thread for almost all of the gear takes 8 hours per plant growing? Time-gating is the biggest nail in the coffin for this game. Perhaps the only one, even (except that new bug, oh my lord), but it's far too egregious for me.\n\n[h1] Should I play Dawnlands? [/h1]\n\nBefore I can answer this question, I have to say that the most recent update introduced a terrible bug. All of the enemies in the game have had their aggro completely broken and will start charging you from across the map with tons and tons of spawns and no leash-range to speak of. It's [i] bad [/i]. 20+ mobs swarming you in some zones is currently the norm. I can confidently say this didn't used to be the case before the most current update. \n\nMoving on, I have had way more fun with this game than I ever expected to. I expected to just open it, and close it because it was laughably-unplayable. I was shocked at how wrong I was. If you're just looking for something to play for a few days that won't cost you any money (and the bug is fixed!), I strongly recommend giving it a chance.

So I'm gonna make my own review based on my own experience. I'm only through the 2nd boss, so my review might change after, but these are the thoughts I have so far.\n\nThis game feels like a mix of Genshin, Breath of the Wild, and Valheim. Primarily, it's quite similar to Valheim, down to its mechanics, bosses, and some of the enemies (especially at the start). It takes some of the gacha and UI elements from Genshin/Hoyoverse games, and Breath of the Wild-esque combat, simplified.\n\n[h1]Addressing common complaints[/h1]\n\nNow, the game is F2P with in-game transactions and gacha, BUT. These are very, very highly optional. The gacha system is specifically only for cosmetic recipes, so fancy chairs, tables, decorations, all fall under that gacha system, meaning that you DON'T need to bother with it at all, even if you're a seasoned builder. There is also a battle pass and \"welkin moon\" system, though those are highly optional, and only unlock a couple of extra backpack slots (which isn't super necessary when you can just teleport back to your house and store the items).\n\nOne of the most popular complaints here seem to be that you can \"buy power\" and OP equipment; while yes, you can buy some elemental equipment, they're not nearly as strong as people are making it out to be. You'd quickly learn to craft stronger weapons than you can buy once you get your base going. In terms of the grind to get these items, I'd say they're actually easier than Valheim, simply because you can just teleport to places very easily.\n\nTo unlock recipes, you need to use \"recipe pages\". People seem to be complaining that it's predatory to lock a core part of the game (recipe unlocking) behind a P2W wall. That's absolutely not true. You get a lot of recipe pages as it is while exploring the world and finishing puzzles. You can literally only buy a max of 10 recipe pages daily anyway, which in the grand scheme of things, is not much.\n\nThe game honestly lacks the polish needed for mouse and keyboard, and is clearly a port of mobile. Some controls feel floaty, some optional features (camera and blueprint mode) straight up don't work on PC. BUT. With enough love and care from the devs, this game has a potential to be a decently fun F2P open world survival crafter kind of game. If you enjoyed Valheim, you'll definitely find some joy from this game.

I saw a lot of negative reviews... lol JUST let me tell you the truth. All those people whining and complaining have never played a hardcore survival game. This is a really laid back and casual game. Very good crafting and you have to unlock recipes but its really easy to do that. You just have to explore, craft, hunt, Actually play the game and you won't have a problem getting pages to unlock recipes. \n\nThis game feels similar to other games I have played. The graphics are beautiful! The monsters are diverse and have their own limitations and challenges. I recommend getting used to using a bow and a sword. Switch between them to make hunting and battle easier. \n\nThe survival aspect is cool. You can build just like in Ark. YOu can die and you drop your bag upon death. You can tame. As far as I can tell so far its just for now a horse, but may be more later. \n\nEdit: So After spending awhile playing this, I still have so many more pros than cons. There are levels to everything! Mining, Logging, cooking, running, jumping, 1 handed wepons, 2 handed weapons, spear, etc. There are levels for them all. Which means the better you are the easier it is to take things out. \n\nThe dungeons are awesome! Beautiful and colorful. Finding chests is a big thing! If you need pages find chests! Its awesome to play this and explore. There are also fast travels spots. So like if you discover a dungeon it allows you to travel to it without using a pot to do so. SO travel becomes so much easier. \n\nI saw someone talking about how cooking was slow. Well, here's an idea. Be creative set up 10 and by the time you come back around you'll have charcol. To simply cook setup 3 in a triangle around a spot you can stand in and you simply just roast one move to the next and by the time you get back to the first it'll be ready to eat! \n\nIt does take time to smelt an ingot or to cook food, but I generally will let it be and go explore or hunt or you know, play the game so I am not wasting time. lol xD Then I'll come back and everything will be ready. \n\nVery chill game. Casusal and just fun. Feel of game is good. Some animations are a lil unrefined but honestly just being newly released I expected that. If you are looking for a good fun game for friends or family then this is definitely the game for you, BUT if you are expecting a hardcore game that'll piss you off more than enjoying it well sorry this aint the game for you!\n\nHonestly, if you don't give this game a true shot you are missing out!", "timestamp_created": 1692045380, "timestamp_updated": 1692490243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.719395458698272705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156103635": {"recommendationid": "156103635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174181633", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1705611195}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well built game.

It's frustrating in many aspects and there's Gacha/Battlepass. Try it if you're really interested or wait for the reviews to become positive and Co-op has a \"subscription\" fee so it's not really free.\n\nDawnlands is a weird game that will remind you of many other game that do things better because it's in a very rough stage. It has potential but it would require a lot of polish and QoL features.\nThere's too much clutter everywhere in the biomes except where it would matter like the shelter that are awfully empty, the house are just exterior with nothing inside, NPC simply sit on the ground during the night and get back up during the day, unmoving, glued to their spot. Don't try to clean it up, it'll respawn because the devs loves having too many things on the ground not letting the biome breath and offer nice vista to see. You see a nice tree, tree is surrounded by branch, rocks, mushroom and the like making it hard to enjoy the view.\nCan't take 3 steps in the wild without being harassed by 2 slimes, 4 goblins and 6 boars because there's just too many things that aggro you every step you take, they're not hard to kill just similar to having a gang of mosquito buzzing in your ears when you're trying to collect materials. Also any creature \"startled\" by your presence trigger the combat music which imply that you hear the combat music more often than the biome's one because any creature in the game get startled when they see you.\nThe music is not good, the type that get tiring very very quickly from hearing it for more than 20 minutes.\nCombat is ok but movement are clunky not very fluid, controlling your mount is pain, the stamina get used too fast.\nFollowers are useless, their only use is to kill the mosquitoes buzzing in your ears when they actually can without being ganged up and incapacitated. That and being an extra storage, can't even step in building, get stuck on rocks, aren't sneaky when you are... feels like having follower from Skyrim all over again.\nI want to know who thought that making the codex completion require the horrible camera mode. That is just infuriating when trying to have a monster be accounted for by the camera without being mauled by the entire fauna of the biome  while the camera focus on the flora that is 20 meters away from what you have in focus.\nBattle Pass/Gacha are never a good idea, no excuses tolerated. There are other ways to monetize stuff that don't require taking players for pidgeon.\nYou can't repair weapons/tools, i repeat YOU CAN'T REPAIR WEAPONS/TOOLS, you just let them get destroyed, got a nice thunder spear while exploring ? Tough luck buddy.\nThe premise of the story was good, the execution was bad, dialogue boxes are pain, Paim- I mean Hedi will spam you the same dialogue box everytime you defeat certain bosses. Progress goes like this : Go to village, talk to villager A, do a random exploration quest, go back to villager A, get material for boss seal, go defeat boss seal, go back to villager A, you're done, move on to the next village, rince and repeat pretty much. If you're getting flashback from early 2000-2010 F2P MMORPG it's perfectly normal.\nThe recipe system is meh, it's not great but it's not that bad. You'll have to be careful what you prioritize when unlocking recipes because you'll need to do a lot of exploration to unlock more recipe token.\nThe world is kindda nice but some part of the map are very much unfinished, square edges, flat cliffs, floating trees and more... Graphically there's not much to say, it's a style that has become more and more popular and has its charms, the character creator is good, the armors/costumes are alright, the animation for the most part is fluid apart for movement clunkyness.\nThe housing system is well made, could use a bit of polishing but it work, it blend well with the world compared to some other games where the players houses stood out too hard compared to the in games buildings.\nI've encounter very little to no bugs while playing.", "timestamp_created": 1696669752, "timestamp_updated": 1696669845, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689135193824768066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149766474": {"recommendationid": "149766474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031525151", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3160, "last_played": 1701124394}, "language": "english", "review": "Dawnlands is a survival/crafting game that draws inspiration from well-known titles like Craftopia, Valheim, Palia, and others in the genre.

So far the dialogue hasn't been toooo egregious, I have yet to run into any quests that are just 3-4 hours of text, but I'm warning you in advance that dialogue =/ content so don't try making your game seem like it has more content that it does just because you're making people watch full-length movies to progress their account. I highly, HIGHLY recommend adding a skip dialogue button, so everyone can be happy. Right now the review is positive, but the first time I'm forced to watch more than a few minutes of cutscene/dialogue I will not hesitate to change it to negative.\n\nedit: I don't want to imply that this game is in a better state than it is, it's definitely rough and in nowhere near a state to be a \"main\" game. This would be a prime candidate for a neutral recommendation, if it were an option. Right now I sincerely don't think the game is bad enough to warrant a negative review, but positive definitely feels like it's pushing it. Apparently these are the same devs that did Snowbreak, and that game had a rough launch that got better quickly, so it feels like a fairly safe assumption that they will respond to the issues with this game quickly, too.", "timestamp_created": 1691621721, "timestamp_updated": 1691625712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623079776763916016", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156558447": {"recommendationid": "156558447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198952895953", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1490, "last_played": 1708954559}, "language": "english", "review": "Is it a perfect game?\nNo.\nDo I enjoy playing it?\nYes, very much so.", "timestamp_created": 1705938966, "timestamp_updated": 1705938966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615203678607940674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156012488": {"recommendationid": "156012488", "author": {"steamid": "76561199260545237", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 576, "last_played": 1705341082}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty fun little adventure rpg game but i just like punching everyone and thing", "timestamp_created": 1705290103, "timestamp_updated": 1705290103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610997617244720459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144344328": {"recommendationid": "144344328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063135480", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1692200434}, "language": "english", "review": "Just not that great, its an interesting premise, but the executions a bit bad.\nYou need recipe sheets to unlock everything for building, with like 15 recipes per roof per style, recipe sheets for weapons, armor, everything.

I'm a dungeon junky)\nIt's fun and engaging. There is a grind but the teleport beacons make travelling easier to reach area for materials. You can also tame a horse if you want to farm monsters or for travelling across the terrain. Crafting is decent with it's durability system, although weapons cannot be repaired but for some reason upgraded? This is a minor turn off if i spend time upgrading a weapon only for it to break to forever be lost.\nThe skills based system is very fun and innovative and pushes you to train certain skills based on what build you want. Litterally anything you do can become a skill. I love the bosses in this game and look forward to seeing more. The random enemy camp encounters are a nice touch but dungeons leave a bit to be desired.\nThe night danger system is very interesting as there a some materials you can only get at night, however night itself is forces you to switch up your playstyle as the stronger monsters can 100-0 you in no time(Archer skeletons WILL mess you up). Worse yet if you get a blood moon event >-<. Building feels a bit clunky at times but i love the physics aesthetic(Need flat ground or foundations or your house WILL collapse).\n\nCombat-8/10 (Would love to see a luring and trapping mechanic included)\nArchery: So far my go to combat style since i always seem to have an excess of wood to make arrows. Animations are verrrry smooth and the focus fire toggle is the chef's kiss. A tip, level your sprint and jump skill with archery and you basically dance around enemies making them into a pin cushion. Alot of ammunition options which make every enemy encounter a little bit different based on their weakness.\n\nMelee: So far, i've tried the spear combat and lord have mercy is it fun. Being able to lunge, stab and combo at close range and throw your spear at them for long range? Nice. Swords and maces have very fast combos for high DPS but you can use a shield as well for defence. You can also go around bareknuckle if you're brave enough. One thing it lacks though are 2h Melee weapons, would love to see a greatsword, greataxe or even a Hammer in the future.\n\nMagic: By far the most underwhelming. It feels more like a utility skill than a combat skill. It doesnt have the focus fire feature like archery but instead locks on to the nearest enemy. This makes 1v1 fights easy but in cases where there are alot of enemies(ie: the second boss), You can easily get swarmed. There is also a severe lack of spells as you can only cast fire magic with a staff. If they add a more variety of spells and tweak the magic combat and enemy targeting, then it'll be just right.\n\nDifficulty: I've had experience with RPG games so this one is a bit easier for me. Although, some enemies made me reconsider and learn new this. What to look out for?\nStamina: WATCH. YOUR. STAMINA.\nHunger: Yes, it has hunger and you can die from not eating. If you can't cook food yet the raw meat and bores are your best friend.\nNight Time: The skeletons are like skeletons from Elder Scrolls Oblivion. They aint no joke and will expedite your trip to your last resurrection point.\nBlood Moon: It randomly happens, got mine on my second night. Monsters go into a frenzy and get stronger, spawn more and are hard to kill. Just hide and wait the night out or fight if you have balls of steel.\nEnvironmental hazards: Fire, Thorns and Freezing to death. You'll know when you get to the third biome.\nYour surroundings: Enemies can easily swarm you if you're not careful\nSpecial monster attacks: Some monsters have special attack indicators, look out for them. Goblin brutes and giants ESPECIALLY. \nDon't fight or light fire near your house. Goblin brutes can destroy terrain, as in pick up trees to wack you or jump onto and crush your house. Fire..well..it does what fire does.\n\nGraphics- 8/10\nIt is very visually appealing with warm bright colors, but not too bright. Think Genshin Impact with a mix off Breath of the Wild. There are a few graphical bugs here and there that need to be ironed out but nothing gamebreaking so far. Animations are smoother than what i expected and it's a nice breath of fresh air. The UI is pretty sleek and out of the way, no popups either which is good.\n\nMicrotransactions: They exist offcourse. As it is a free game, the devs gotta make money to support the game. But the way they are setup function as sort of an extra or temporary boost. As you progress you can make stronger gear than what's in the shop. There are few cosmetics but looking for to seeing more.\n\nAll in all, for a mobile port. It has some work to do but it's moving in the right direction.

I normally have a really fun time playing bad games, ripping on it and sharing with my friends. But this one just felt icky bad. \n\nI only got to the town before deciding it wasn't worth playing any further, here are some notes I took while playing. Some are bigger points than others, this is just the order I ran into them.\n\n[list]\n[*]The character keeps moving a half second after releasing a directional key\n[*]When I push take all from a chest, there is no reason for the chest window to remain open unless there is still stuff inside.\n[*]Tries to do the Breath of the Wild Opening, but they clearly don't have LOD models for distant trees, so the view is kinda crud.\n[*]The player character knows more than I do? I'm here to sanctify some evil? How do I know this?\n[*]The shield surfing is really bad, there is dust particles before hitting the ground, and there is no acceleration going downhill, its just a static speed.\n[*]That poor deer in the water looked to me for help then poofed ;A;\n[*]Why do the goblins drop resin. resin is a tree product.\n[*]Why do I have to sanctify this chest, all its making me do is push the open button twice\n[/list]\n\nAll this (not including the deer thing) really makes it feel like its more of a cash grab while copying a lot of the aesthetics from games that did it much better such as genshin impact and breath of the wild. Straight up this feels like a knockoff of Craftopia, which isn't a great game by no means but is certainly functional and half as janky. Its worth noting I didn't have any issues with lag or anything but I have a fairly high end computer, though many people complain about it, and if my assumption about LOD models is correct, that would likely account for it. \n\nI don't know how they intend for this to run on phones, unless the people complaining are just using very low end computers. The free to play nature of games tends to draw in some very low spec computers for sure but Im sure they would be better than a phone right?\n\nOn my whole list of complaints the part that really drives me off the most is the movement. The delay is only there after moving for a little bit first, so just tapping the movement key doesn't do it, but the whole delay thing makes me feel like I'm struggling against some grid the game assigns me to like its an RPG maker game in 3d. I really don't know why it does it. at first I thought it was just trying to sync up animations or something but that's certainly not it, there's no slow down to stop animation, I cant imagine its latency because I should be playing locally with maybe just items pinging server side, even if it was I'm under 80ms so there's no way that's the issue either. The most outlandish thing I can think of is that its trying to simulate phone controls using keybinds and that is causing some kind of delay. straight up the most speculative thing in this whole review, no fact there just wild assumptions. But I really don't know why it would behave like this.\n\n[h3]In Summary[/h3]\nI play a lot of janky low quality games for fun, often they have a unique charm to them that makes it interesting. This is the first game that its poor quality has drove me off before finding any charm to it. The visuals are there for sure, they've done a really good job of making something that looks like it \"cant be that bad\" but it really is. That said, when you're copying games like genshin and zelda for art design, its pretty hard to mess up.\n\nI'm going to give it a little longer to see if there's any reason to play this other than \"its free.\"\n\n[h3]Edit:[/h3] I gave it a couple more hours, as a big fan of Valheim, I find the near identical rip off of the music almost insulting. it tries to copy a lot of the progression from Valheim, but you don't need any of it, the only thing stopping you from taking the first weapon you get and conquering everything is durability. It then tries to copy the combat challenges of Genshin, but the combat is just not nearly engaging enough to care. Genshin's combat is fast, fluid, and inspires creativity. This game you have 3 buttons; Attack, Special Attack, and Cooldown Attack. these change based on the weapon you're using but changing weapons isn't fluid like Genshin can be and there is no reason to change weapons either other than durability. \nI've mentioned durability a few times now, its worth mentioning you CAN buy weapons from the cash shop. Its about 50 gems per 1 usd excluding specials and bulk cost, and the weapons cost 180 gems, so at minimum you need to spend 4 usd, with 20 leftover, or the 5 usd bundle for 120 leftover. The more I played, the more it felt like these are EX Genshin impact UI designers and artists that probably saw how much \"free to play\" can earn and thought they could do it too. Its worth saying that out of all the free to play games out there Genshin has some of the most work and effort put into it, trying to copy that without programmers who are up to the task is silly.\n\nAlso there are LOD models, but they load in really janky and stuttery, I think the lag problems come when the game tries to load in chunks of harvestable resources, which includes the ground.

Like, while the splash are characters LOOK interesting the rest of the games start leaves a lot to be desired. \n\nThe base set up for character creation has potential I guess, if more options were available. The world layout has some potential if more original though was put into it as you interact with the world via the 3 game I mentioned up top. You dig around in the ground like Valheim's system, there are mini puzzles haphazardly scattered every few meters like it's trying to be Genshin, and you ride horses around like BoTW - somewhat similar tame mechanics and movement feel. \n\nReally tries to push micro transactions. Menu is set up just like Genshin's. Building and cooking is like Valheim's...\n\nIt's just a damn mess. Visually, I thought it would be decent cause of the art - It's only \"saving\" factor imo.

It's pretty obvious that many of them haven't actually gotten into the game proper. Yes, the initial room and little dungeon area you spawn in gives the impression of a fairly poorly built game, but once you are outside, especially after you come to the town that the main quest leads you to, things really begin to come together.\n\nEven the graphics begin to flow better after the first little bit. They are not AAA graphics for certain, but they are also far from the worst I have seen, and they do have a fairly cohesive feel to them. It doesn't feel like a poorly matched handful of Unity stock just tossed together.\n\nI keep seeing it compared to a empty, unfinished, and buggy version of Valheim. Perhaps I'm lucky, but I haven't had any technical issues at all. The world is FAR from empty, there are many different things going on. From a tallish hills I can usually see a half-dozen or more different things to do in an area, things like enemy camps with chests and elements that need to be sanctified, small buildings with enemies and chests, mini-boss mobs, statues that trigger one of several different type of puzzles, mini-games, floating balloons carrying chests and crates that you can shoot down, smaller single areas that need to be sanctified, buried treasure, and other things that I know I have not encountered yet, because I have recipes available to be unlocked from them. The world is dotted with things to do.\n\nHow finished is it? I've yet to see, but the rough intro mini-dungeon is probably the one that I like the least, and that feels like it needs the most work.\n\nThe gameplay is less like Valheim, and more like a BOTW survival game hybrid. The UI is a little clunky in some ways, but even that has begun to make sense to me as I realize there are reasons for some of the ways it's built. Swapping weapons can be clunky for sure, though. I actually find combat surprisingly enjoyable once I started fighting some of the boss-like mobs. Suddenly, sprinting and leaping to dodge, flanking your opponent, and in general keeping moving and active can play a significant role in combat success.\n\nThe idea that it's just a microtransaction game is easy to understand as you are immediately presented with store screens, and there is a lot of things there. However, when you begin to get into the crafting system, it begins to become clear that a lot of this is fluff, or shortcuts to other things that are attainable through regular play. I haven't yet felt like I need, or want, to buy anything from the store, except perhaps a companion, but I don't actually feel like I need one, I just like to have them in many games. There may be ones you can pick up later, but I have yet to meet any.\n\nOnce you begin to understand how new crafting patterns are acquired, and that you really need access to a workstation before the bulk of the crafting opens up, there is actually a lot more available. Mounts, different types of weaponry, tools, items, and building pieces all become available fairly quickly. There are other recipes that you cannot see initially that begin to open up, as well, as you play. There is a whole Trinket class of gear that becomes much more interesting and involved once you have the Tinker's Table, as well.\n\nI have not upgraded my Workbench, yet, so I don't know what that will bring, but much of the gear is able to be enhanced and upgraded just with the first one, and there is a quite a bit I have yet to unlock, gear-wise, as well.\n\nWith regards to building, there is actually a fair bit of things available. I am still only working mainly with Thatch, though, and Thatch is... well, thatch. There are different crafting stations and interactive pieces of furniture, including ones that give an area buff or bonus, like Warmth from a fire, and the Comfort from a statue, making your house safer an more restful. I still have only dabbled in the building so far.\n\nAll in all, I am glad that I stuck out the initial rough patches, because I have found the game to be fairly enjoyable after that. It is, however, getting very late, and I hope this all makes sense!", "timestamp_created": 1691678831, "timestamp_updated": 1691678831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144359638": {"recommendationid": "144359638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080173983", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1697578517}, "language": "english", "review": "your game is laggy even in low graphics ....cant play like that ,but I like the gameplay its decent for a free game ,if you fix that it will be ok", "timestamp_created": 1692216883, "timestamp_updated": 1692216883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145118848": {"recommendationid": "145118848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153976420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 41269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1347, "playtime_at_review": 3498, "last_played": 1713720950}, "language": "english", "review": "New release so of course there is much to work on, fix and code.
