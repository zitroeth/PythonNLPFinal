Life's real simple on the ocean world. \n\n...also it's a great exploration survival game with a satisfying tech tree as you build up your ability to go farther and deeper to gather more unique resources to build your next upgrade, as you work your way not towards infinite growth or any sort of material wealth, but simply to make a way back home. Every new area you reach is fascinating and fun to explore, every new plant animal or mineral you see is well designed and fits well in an interconnected ecosystem, and the various smaller mysteries and optional discoveries spread around the planet are compelling and make for great replay content.\n\nYou should play Subnautica.

Look no further than Subnautica. I like the fact that you are never explicitly told by the game to \"go here, do this\" to fulfil quest objectives unlike most open-world games. It just drops hints here and there and it's up to you to follow up on the main story. You are also subtly discouraged from staying in the same area due to the need to scavenge for food and resources, forcing you to explore. Despite being open-world and never having a hard limit to areas, the game cleverly blocks off access to those areas in the early stage by requiring you to craft items first. There is no hard boundary of the map either - the spooky atmosphere at the soft boundary of the map is enough to force you to return. Every little detail in the game design is so subtle and well thought out.\n\nIn any game, film and book, the first thing I look for is atmosphere. I cannot praise the atmosphere in this game enough. On an alien planet without a map, every step you take is full of danger. The feeling of isolation, powerlessness and fear of the unknown, make this game the scariest game that's not actually designed to be a horror game.\n\nI have high standards and this is one of the few games that I am hard-pressed to find faults in...

I mean, it's a world where everything is trying to eat you, crush you or electrocute you, and the best you've got for a lot of it is a knife?!? Even later on when you get torpedoes, the stasis rifle and so on, they're not actually much use or much fun.\r\n\r\n... and so on.

Nowadays with the exploration of the oceans, we know that even with its dangers there is no colossal being lurking, but what would happen if this certainty was thrown away, when diving into the waters of an alien ocean, full of unknown wonders and dangers. ^^\n\nThis is what the protagonist of our story will discover in the most brutal way and without warning possible, a simple employee of the Aurora transport ship on another day like any other at work. Until the moment that without any warning the ship is hit by something that causes the entire crew to be evacuated, with our protagonist escaping alone in one of the escape capsules, after a \"slight\" head injury, he leaves the capsule and observes who stands alone, with only the ocean of an unknown planet stretching everywhere he looks. ^^\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+ A survival game with an extensive map, full of different environments, each with its own resources and creatures to explore and discover.\n+ The game has an entire ecosystem, with animals and plants that inhabit certain environments and depths, and can be analyzed to discover more about them.\n+ Wide variety of resources that can be collected for production, from the simplest equipment to the most advanced and futuristic.\n+ Option to build a base, not only to be a safe place, but also useful during the journey.\n+ A very interesting story with some twists, which progresses according to the player's exploration pace.\n+ For those who wish, in addition to the classic option, there is an option without having to worry about hunger and thirst, and a creative option.\n+ Beautiful graphics, it really seems to be a world under the waters of an alien ocean.\n+ Excellent soundtrack and sound work in creating the vocalization of all the creatures.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- If you don't have Thalassophobia, the fear of the ocean, be prepared to feel the sensation a little as the creatures will give you a lot of scares during your first encounters.\n- Some very rare bugs, like one time I saw a large creature enter the ground and never come out, and another time I took damage when touching a peaceful one.\n\n[h1] Game mechanics[/h1]\nAfter the \"soft\" start of escaping from the burning ship, our exploration begins, deciding where to swim in search of resources, if the objective is just to stay alive, the clear waters close to the surface are fully capable of supplying everything necessary, but If you want to go beyond survival and escape from this planet you will need to go deep, very deep in search of new resources that will release new equipment, however some are too advanced but fortunately Aurora had several useful equipment for underwater exploration, which first need to be analyzed as they became just fragments with the explosion, analyzed by undoubtedly one of the most useful tools of all, the scanner that allows not only to analyze the fragments, but also the ores and life forms on the planet. ^^\n\nThis is a very important point, as it will be an exploration without the presence of any other human being, with the only company being the varied and colorful life forms native to the planet, forms that have evolved to live perfectly beneath the waves, some peaceful. who won't care about the player, others will attack but only to defend their territory, and some are carnivores and will love to try the taste of the flesh of the only human on the planet. But as we explore the depths, we discover that not everything is in perfect balance on this planet, and that something is disturbing the ecosystem and will try to put the player on its endless list of victims. ^^\n\n[h1] Art and sound[/h1]\nProduced by the Unknown Worlds Entertainment studio, I only have praise for the graphics, they did very well in creating each unique biome, each creature adapted to living in the conditions of the depth in which it lives and the notion for the player of how the depth increases as the waters become more and more darker and sinister. The soundtrack part was also impeccable, the songs are great, matching each biome and the great work in creating the sounds of the various creatures, especially underwater the sound reaches much further than the light, so there are several moments that we hear the creatures before we even see them. ^^\n\n[h1] Conclusion[/h1]\nSubnautica was a curious case for me because I never really liked the idea of exploring deep, dark waters, even in games, and yet for some reason I bought this game when it was still in the early stages of Early Access. And so over the years I started the game, but I stopped when I started to have to go deeper, until finally at the beginning of this year I stopped messing around and finally finished this great game, which now I can say that even despite the scares and despite a little stress sometimes not finding the right resource or fragment, this is a very fun game, and I recommend it to everyone who likes a good exploration game and a good story. ^^\n", "timestamp_created": 1713471833, "timestamp_updated": 1713471833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635286271572113037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163138550": {"recommendationid": "163138550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001344618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3225, "last_played": 1642475799}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the coolest games I've ever played.

Only it doesn't, there are actually a couple of land masses *right there*, you just can't see them because of the draw distance. Because when a game has more imagination than budget it has to hide things from you-- a genre epitomized by Subnautica. It's not bad, it's even great up until the point where you inevitably notice the smoke and mirrors, but all the \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" reviews should be tempered by a few critical ones. I didn't finish this game, because it's empty and repetitive and it stopped being fun.\n\nSubnautica can be distilled down to \"there's no map.\" There desperately needs to be a map, but there isn't, because if there were you'd know where to go, and the absolute bulk of the gameplay is derived from not knowing where to go. The bulk of the gameplay is stumbling across things and then trying to find them again later, searching half-remembered areas for caves and accidentally going 1km in the wrong direction and being lost-- being lost is what this game IS. And that's fine, that's an experience, I often LOVE that experience in a game, but not in this one, because you also have to collect resources and everything you need is in specific places and a map would sure help but there isn't one. If there were a map it would be a short, repetitive game with a map. As it is, it's a long, repetitive game with no map. And I get it, to fill a huge game and an ocean with Things takes a huge budget, but not everyone who can imagine a huge game will have the budget for one and so you get this genre of game where it looks big and feels big but isn't big. It's not fair, but it's how it is. And eventually people will start using AI to fill that emptiness their games instead of just limiting their focus and it will be bad in a different way.\n\nSubnautica is, eventually, bad because, like similar limited-budget open-world games, if you strip out the text and audio logs then all you have is the same set of art assets arranged in slightly different ways across a large area. How many unique areas or objects are in this game? I can think of... five? Six? And the rest is just the same section of crashed ship with the same wreckage strewn about and the same kind of items and the same underwater caves and the same hazards and the same rewards, and the world is great, it's impressive, it's the right world to create when you have limitations because all fish are the same, but you need gameplay that's more than collecting the same resources from the same places to build things that let you do that same thing but slightly faster. With no map. Strip out the text and audio logs and you get a game that desperately needs text and audio logs to carry the narrative. And the text and audio is good, and Tom Jubert should write more games instead of other writers because he's better than most other writers, but aside from some very limited environmental storytelling his work is not *part* of the world, it's added-in on top of it. \n\nI got sick of collecting minerals from the same unmapped areas and eating the same fish and so I used the text and audio logs to draw my own meaning out of this game. So much of that text and audio is just human interpersonal BS and inanity and materialism that is contrasted so heavily by the beautiful natural environment you've become a part of-- I mean there you are at sea in the sun listening to Some Jerk distractedly mention rescue information while he talks to someone else about his sandwich order, and you're just thinking... \"THIS is what I want to go back to?\" Why would anyone want to be \"rescued\" from this planet, empty as it is, when the alternative is being plugged back into Human Society.

[/url][/b][/code]\n\n[hr][/hr]\nSubnautica is a fantastic game that does a really good job at maintaining the perfect atmosphere at all parts of the game. It makes you truly feel the wonder of exploring a beautiful new location, or the terror and dread of navigating a dangerous area. Being open-world, the game will rarely force you to follow the main story, but the story arc is compelling enough that you will want to complete it, and you will be almost sorry when it's all over. This is one of the best survival / exploration games of all time, and an absolute must-play.\n\nAs for the achievements, all but one of them are story-related. Though they can technically be missed before you end the game, it would be rather difficult to miss them on a blind playthrough, as they correspond to each of the locations that the game suggests you to head towards next. For the last achievement, \"Hatch and release a Cuddlefish\", there is a guide to help you find one of five Cuddlefish egg locations in the map.", "timestamp_created": 1709481203, "timestamp_updated": 1709491407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528178215026855469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163183255": {"recommendationid": "163183255", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973057859", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3391, "playtime_at_review": 1902, "last_played": 1713776271}, "language": "english", "review": "Perhaps the best survival game ever made", "timestamp_created": 1713551477, "timestamp_updated": 1713551477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160947795": {"recommendationid": "160947795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198929845009", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1209, "last_played": 1710292088}, "language": "english", "review": "Subnautica is for sure one of my top 5 favorite games.

Exploring the deep sea not knowing what to expect and being shit scared reaching the deeper areas was definitely a  memorable experience. I could spent whole day playing it and not getting enough of it. \r\nThis game offers a variety of new blueprints that unlocks new base parts, new equipment, new vehicles that are very fun to use and other stuff. There is always something to look for so you wont get bored plus the mechanic of starving and dehydration makes you looking for food and water all the time so it adds to the survival experience because Subnautica is a mix of survival, exploring, horror and even building. But in my opinion the machanic of running out of oxygen (because we are 90% of the time in the water) is something that adds to the gameplay and makes it more challenging, you need to watch out for it because if you are very deep under water and you are running out of it the only option is to swim to the surface or hop on your vehicle and I need to admit I have many situatiuons that I died because I couldn't find a way out of a cave or I wasn't fast enough to get to the surface.\r\nSpeaking of caves Subnautica has a very large map with a lot of biome variety in it, which some of them are really creepy like that one biome that has that white kelps and a bloody oil growing on it. I also really like how Subnatica made a map boarder that is actually diffrent and unique, its like a void where the only thing you  will find Is a big glowing creatures.... I even one entered it didn't nowing that its a void and there is nothing to looking for in it and that makes it so unique.\r\nWhen it comes to exploring the underwaters we have vehicles like:seaglide that you can fit in your inventory and helps you swim faster, seamoth that is a small vehicle that enables you to use modifications like:solar, torpeds and electrical pulse which deters some predators away and you can shoot torpeds out of it, PRAWN suit that anables you to mine ores, has arms that are good in dealing damage , enables fast travel when you have modification which makes your are shote a kind of a rope, and a biggest vehicle on this list:Cyclops that is a full blown titanic-like underwater ship its very satisfactional to unlock its blueprint and finally make it.\r\nI still didn't tell about a big variety of fishes and the BIG fishes that you can meet upon your journey. The categories for the fishes are:the small fishes that are usually harmless, medium fishes and most of them(maybe not most but) are predators like that teleporting one or the long fast one. The last category is leviathans, some of them are not hostile to the player and some will just want to eat you and destroy your vehicle. Usually the more friendly ones are near the capsule area when you first \"spawn\" in and the more dangerous one are in the deeper areas which is pretty logical and obvious.\r\nI finally wanna talk about a story of Subnautica that can be really deep. The story comes in found PDA's across the map and in massages that you hear from the radio that are transmitted beetwen a certain time periods, you cal always read this massages later like PDA's once you hear them/found them.\r\nAlso tip: when you scan objects you can get a lot of useful info so I advise you to scan evetything you can.\r\nIn conclusion I think Subnautica is a game that is really worth recommending and giving it a try, this game isn't even very expensive to buy so it is a big plus and it is worth buying right away without waiting for a discount (of course you can wait because this game gets discout very often but I just wanted to say it is very worth its price).\r\nFinal rating:10/10", "timestamp_created": 1713634935, "timestamp_updated": 1713634935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163246104": {"recommendationid": "163246104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359596290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 362, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1713755235}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game!

However, after a friend gifted it to me I knew I'd have to set aside my fears and give it a try. As it turns out, I had quite a lot of fun -- but also a few [i]very[/i] tense moments with particularly dangerous situations and limited visibility.\r\n\r\nBy and large, if you can stay within sight of the sea floor or cliff sides it can help with feeling anxious or \"lost\". The lifeboat you start in is also very close to the center of the map and it's icon can help tremendously as a general waypoint. The surface of the world is pretty much water, but the Aurora in the distance can help a [i]lot[/i] with finding your bearings, as well, when you come up for air. Although I'll be honest that getting anywhere near it often fills me with a sense of dread, but that's probably related to the agoraphobia so who knows. :D\r\n\r\nThe plethora of sea life and various plants are breathtaking and also something neat to scan if you get the chance, there's tons of stuff to catalogue as you play and the descriptions range from amusing to thoughtful. Most of the things you can craft are learned by scanning objects found in wrecks, so always be on the lookout for something unfamiliar. [i]Also[/i] make sure you check every data cache for possible new constructs or tools, like a new kind of wetsuit or an augment for your vehicles!\r\n\r\nIf I had to knock the game for anything it would probably be the [i]over[/i] aggression of certain creatures. Some are attracted to the very lights your vehicle uses to keep you from being basically blind, as some areas are far too dark for their own good. Fumbling in the dark isn't as fun when you have 360 move space and limited air or battery life. It can be super disappointing to leave your Seamoth for a moment to grab or investigate, turn around and a monster has taken it or destroyed it and left you stranded and likely dead in the water as a result.\r\n\r\nThe other main issue is inventory space. Most tools take a single spot, but others like the stungun and seaglide take large sections. You can also find dufflebags which.. you [i]can not[/i] pick up if they have stuff in them?? Makes them effectively useless. I also found having to go back and forth so often due to space limitations on the frustrating side as the game went on and I would need more and more things.

I'm an avid scuba diver and I must say, they got so many underwater elements correct when it comes to the lighting, the sounds, the clarity and/or particulates in the water, the immersion - it just feels like you're there.  Slap on some headphones and play in the dark... give it a try - hope you don't startle easily.  I mean, you are much more nimble in the water than anyone every should/could be, but hey, can't be fully realistic and that's not the goal.  This isn't a diving simulator.\n\nI originally didn't play this game as it was labelled as \"survival horror\".  I like neither of those categories - I don't like survival games and I don't play horror games.  This game squarely falls in neither of these categories, but has some overlapping elements.  This is the right blend and mix for what I find is basically a world and story exploration game with survival and \"scary\" and \"intimidating\" elements.\n\nWhat was not expected with this game was how compelling it is to continue to play and explore.  It's literally so addictive I can hardly think of anything else when I start getting into it.  I completely lose myself in this game.  This is what I want in a gaming experience...\n\nThe progression is exemplary.  Just when you think you've crafted or found something that will take you to a new opportunity or to the \"next level\", you're immediately slapped back into your place of being out of place in this huge and vast alien nautical world.  Just when I feel slighly more capable, more brave, and more willing to venture into further darkness and unknown, the overwhelming feeling of not being prepared enough or underskilled/powered to be where I've ended up becomes apparent.  There's always some story element causing you some stress and pressure to continue to keep going - without it there wouldn't have been nearly the atmosphere and feeling of necessity and purpose as it's constantly undermined by your need to survive.  What a great blend of priorities amalgamated together.\n\nI'm not the greatest or most coherent review writer, but I will also say that the music in this game really is top notch and adds to the experience.  It comes and goes away in almost a scripted fashion with what you're experiencing, and it's so well matched and themed to this game I just can't say enough about how this improves the experience.\n\nAnd last but not least, the graphics.  I'm playing this 5-6 years after release, with max settings on a beast gaming PC.  It looks phenomenal.  Not exactly lifelike/realistic, but in it's style, it sure feels like it.  I've tried the game in VR, and that is truly the immersive experience, but the controls are still a bit hard to use, and any misclick or time wasted while crafting/building, or when you're in a panic and about to drown or being attacked by some unknown creature, not a good experience.  But if you want immersion and a more realistic experience, I highly recommend at least trying (I used the Index with the index controller/hands mod) it, and I fully intend to just do some exploring in VR and not bother with technical elements like the big crafting component.  I didn't find the crafting onerous in this game, it was actually a lot of fun exploring and trying to find new materials and fabrications to make the next best thing.

I need to preface my review by saying that I bought this game in the earliest of access, back in 2014. Despite of this, it took me 10 years to write a review. Honestly, I feel shame that I have been this lazy... \n\nWith that out of the way: Get this game. It is probably my favorite game to replay, as the world Unknown Worlds has created here is just absolutely amazing. Not only that, but it's not a cheap horror game. Nope, this game feeds on your fear, kinda like a terror game. Basically, you are always feeling vulnerable, and unless you do not dodge the... Larger creatures, you are pretty much always \"safe\". Of course, there are other dangers, like radiation early-mid game, small piranha-like fish and leech-like worms to name a few. But that feeling of not being safe you get when you dive into it, even when you take your small sub (Seamoth) for a ride, or even the larger Cyclops is just... Amazing. Now of course, if you have thalassophobia, you might wanna rethink getting this game, as 97% of the game occurs in the vast ocean world of 4546B. Although, maybe you can conquer said fear if you get the game...?\n\nUknown Worlds are great developers. The game runs amazingly, I am getting 142 FPS on high with my PC (Ryzen 7 7700X and RX 7800XT). Optimization like this is awesome to see, and I imagine it must have been hard as your PC has to render so many fish swimming around, and a plethora of different biomes etc. Even on a weaker PC, expect to play on medium-ish graphics with at least 60 FPS, if not higher. \n\nThe story is amazing. It ties in to Unknown Worlds' other games, Natural Selection. I won't spoil anything major, but there is strong evidence that this game takes place in the same universe as the aforementioned game. The only thing I will spoil is that the ship you are on is shot down from orbit around the beautiful planet 4546B, and you get into the escape pod just in time. What happens next is up to you. The feeling of helplessness as you dive into the game on your first playthrough will stick with you forever. Beautifully crafted. \n\nI have written enough to make my case, at least I think so myself. There is a lot to the game, and I very much urge everyone reading this to get the game. It is worth every penny, and it is not the most expensive game.

Literally nothing like it. The game is perfectly terrifying in every good way, the exploration and progression are amazing. You are only limited by how willing you are to go outside of your comfort zone. Creatures and world are full of beautiful scenes and terrifying sea monsters. \n\nProgression/Gameplay Loop 9/10 (can seem repetitive to some who are unfazed by the giant mf creatures) \n\nWorld 10/10 (tons of lore and story to be uncovered and pieced together but you will have to pay attention)\n\nexploration 100000/10 (had to give it it's own section because it's the most notable part and game defining) \n\ngraphics 10/10 (while it may lack in pure fidelity, the art style and beautiful scenes act in tandem to create some of the most colourful wondrous and mysterious areas i have seen in a game again it is truly unique and genuinely stunning \n\nis it buggy 8/10 (i did encounter some bugs but it was more to do with the physics of the game and how different things interact which i kinda expected considering 95% of the game is underwater, overall generally not that buggy) \n\nuser friendly 8.5/10 (the game does a great job of telling you what to do and where to go if you want that. It also however rewards your own little self controlled expeditions to go out find resources and stray from the safe shallows, the reason i put it at an 8.5 is simply because i am a massive p**sy when it comes to this game and found myself not wanting to progress because i was too scared to venture out. which tbh might render it a higher score rather than a lower one but some people may just straight up give up with the game as whole because they don't want to continue) \n\nSound design 11/10 (this game and it's squeal Below Zero hit the nail on the head with it's music and SFX. The smaller creatures feel mysterious yet friendly in a way but still alien, where as the large dangerous Leviathans feel imposing and terrifying, Side note I genuinely almost pissed myself when i heard the roar of the first reaper leviathan you bump in to and saw a giant red and grey snake with mandibles charging at me. anyways, the music is spot on and is likely my favourite soundtrack from any game or franchise for that matter ever, it makes the world feel filled to the brim with wonder, terror, mystery, calm and ultimately lived in by all the flora and fauna you encounter. \n\noverall rating 10/10 (if you're looking for a unique survival/kind of horror/exploration game that will bring you things you have never experienced before in all of your time gaming and that i can guarantee, then just play it. It's stunning and beautiful, Mysterious and Terrifying.

Developed by Unknown Worlds Entertainment, this survival-adventure game offers an unparalleled experience that seamlessly blends exploration, crafting, and storytelling.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking aspects of Subnautica is its breathtakingly beautiful underwater environment. From vibrant coral reefs to eerie deep-sea trenches, every corner of the ocean is meticulously crafted with stunning detail. The dynamic lighting effects and realistic water physics further enhance the sense of immersion, making every dive feel like a voyage into the unknown.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay mechanics of Subnautica are equally impressive. As the lone survivor of a crashed spaceship on an alien planet covered mostly by water, players must scavenge resources, build bases, and fend off hostile creatures to survive. The crafting system is intuitive yet deep, allowing players to construct a variety of tools, vehicles, and structures to aid in their exploration. Whether it's constructing a submarine to explore the depths or crafting a high-tech diving suit to withstand extreme pressures, the sense of progression and accomplishment is immensely satisfying.\r\n\r\nHowever, what truly sets Subnautica apart is its masterful storytelling. Through environmental storytelling, audio logs, and cryptic messages scattered throughout the ocean floor, players gradually uncover the secrets of the planet and the fate of its previous inhabitants. The sense of mystery and discovery is palpable, driving players to delve deeper into the abyss in search of answers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Subnautica excels in creating a sense of tension and fear. The vastness of the ocean, coupled with the unknown dangers lurking in its depths, instills a constant sense of unease and anticipation. Whether it's the spine-chilling roar of a leviathan or the eerie darkness of an unexplored cave system, every moment is fraught with suspense, keeping players on the edge of their seats.\r\n\r\nBeyond its captivating gameplay and storytelling, Subnautica also boasts exceptional attention to detail. From the intricate creature designs to the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, every aspect of the game is crafted with care and precision. The developers' passion for their creation shines through in every aspect, creating an experience that is truly unforgettable.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Subnautica is a triumph of game design that sets a new standard for the survival-adventure genre. With its stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and immersive storytelling, it offers an unforgettable journey into the depths of the ocean. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or a newcomer to the genre, Subnautica is an absolute must-play that will leave you breathless in more ways than one.

An experienced player will ignore them, though, or at most circle and poke them with a knife to make them go away, while at the same time stealing all of their scrap. It helps to have upgraded swim fins, upgraded O2, and other advantages, but if you took upgraded fins and O2 tanks away from experienced players, they still wouldn't have any issues with Stalkers.\n\nThere's a lot to find and a lot to do in this game. The need to unravel the game's central mysteries and to obtain blueprint fragments, salvage, and rare materials from wrecks, grottoes, and strange installations will force you to leave your comfort zone time and again. First you'll crawl out of the Safe Shallows, then you'll creep further and deeper, then you'll swim further still until one day you'll be amazed at how far away from Lifepod 5 you've gone, at the readout on your depth meter, and you'll wonder how you ever thought that the seaweed areas just outside of the Safe Shallows were in any way scary.\n\nSustenance is a challenge at first, and you'll scramble to get enough food and water, but later on they become a matter of management and planning ahead. If you're going on a long expedition, you'll want enough supplies to last for the duration, but not so many that you can't haul a goodly amount of salvage back to base.\n\nAs for fiddly stuff, you can spend hours building and customizing your underwater habitat, customize the look and module loadout of the various vehicles you can build (once you've got the complete blueprints and necessary materials), and have a lot of fun with the wide array of gadgets and Portal/Half-Life-style \"techno-guns\" the game has to offer. There's a lot of meat there, but the true meal lies in exploration.\n\nEven at the very end of the game, though, armed with all the technology you've spent hours pulling out of wrecks and scanning (typically while watching your O2 meter like a hawk and listening nervously to that angry predator thrashing around outside), you'll never feel completely safe or at ease.

Some clipping and such, but it never really bothered me much.\n\nIt's very fluid (no pun intended) to get into it. I agree with most other reviews that recommend no using guides and such and just jump into the deep water (pun intended) and learn to swim on your own. It's a very friendly interface that gives just enough explanation to make you feel like you can do it on your own, but not enough to make it boring.\n\nEdit: I forgot the most important part (to me at least.) The metabolism for food in this game is very nice. In plenty of other games like this you have to eat every two minutes or face death from starvation. In this game, keeping hydrated is the issue. While this is rather ironic while being surrounded by water, it makes a lot more sense. I get away with eating once every day or two depending on my activity. Dehydration keeps me drinking daily, but not constantly. Considering dehydration kills you faster than starvation, I feel this is the most realistic representation I have seen in one of these games thus far. \n\nHere is what any new player needs to know:\n\nExpect it will hurt you until you prove to yourself that it can't. \nExplore.

It's important to specify that I'm playing in survival mode where you have to constantly worry about food and water.  The game will be very different depending on which mode you play, because in the sandbox mode you can freely build and explore without ever having to stop what you're doing to gather nourishment.  In hardcore, you have to be extra careful, because once you die you have to start over.  At this point, I'm glad I did not pick hardcore, because there are ways you can die that just aren't forseeable.  There also occasional bug in the game which results in your death, like the all too common diving reel malfunctions.\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nThis game is amazing.  That can be, and is, said about many games.  But there is nothing like Subnautica.  I had been waiting for 19 years, ever since playing the crap out of the incredibly immersive, fun, but ultimately flawed Sub Culture.  Finally, we have a game that surpasses Sub Culture in every aspect except the storyline.  With that said, Subnautica has flaws.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nIn all it's glory, there are a few nags, some of which make the game increasingly difficult as you get further into the game.  First, I'm going to get it out of the way that there is a startup bug that made me almost request a refund even before getting into the game. Subnautica doesn't always start, because the game menu screen frequently refuses to fully load.  This is probably some sort of GPU initialization issue that prevents the graphics from displaying properly.  In any event, I have to exit out of the game and restart it in Window mode to get the game to finish loading at all.\n\nAlso, The learning curve is very steep.  There are no instructions for anything, and the information given on any device in the crafting menus tell you nothing worthwhile about what stuff does.  There are some basic descriptions, but they're very poor.  For example the current generator says it generates current.  When I started playing I had no idea what I would want to create a current for.\n\n\nThe third thing is the max depth of the in game vehicles.  There is much debate about the actual depth of the game.  Some say it goes on forever.  Others have quoted that the game crashes out at 60,000 meters.  Some have said 20,000 meters.  Others have said there is a secret world in the greatest depths, which sounds pretty epic.  In any event.  The ocean goes deeper than I feel comfortable thinking about.  The problem here lies in the fact that the vehicles seem to have a max depth of 200 meters.  (I've since found the Cyclops can go to approximately 900 meters at the expense of power efficiency.  I believe the Seamoth can also go to a comparable depth.)\n\nFourth, the hunger and thirst meters drop far too quickly.  This seems nitpicky when you consider I did pick the survival mode, but the problem with this system is that you have to spend hunger and thirst to find food that becomes increasily more difficult to find as the game goes on.  As a result, you might find yourself spending almost half your time gathering food and supplies to make water.  Which leads me to the next problem in the game.\n\nFifth, scarcity of food and supplies for making water.  At first, everything is plentiful and readily available.  Salt, while a challenge to find when you don't know what you're looking for, seems to respawn readily and limitlessly.  Coral, while seemingly limitless at first, begins to disappear rapidly after many hours of gameplay.  Moreover, I have seen no indication that it respawns.  \n\nFood, which pretty much comes from the natural fish stocks, can disappear amazingly fast from an area.  After 41 hours of gaming, I have effectively cleared all of the initial shallows of the ocean, plus the surrounding depths of fish.  It's amazing how fast they diminish.  The only solution seems to be to put respawning, or faster reproduction, of the fish in the game.  I have not seen any indication that the fish respawn at all, which seems clear by some of the dead zones I have in my current save.  There are some pretty heated debates about this in the discussion groups.  Naysayers claim the supplies are unlimited, and all you have to do is look further.  My answer to that is that you begin to spend a lot more thirst and food meter, energy, and other resources to find food.  \n\nBecause of this there is a rapidly diminishing return on the value of food and water in the game.  The devs claim it causes people to explore more.  I'm not satisfied with that response, because the reality is this:  if people have no motivation to explore.  If they just stick to the shallows and eat and drink, they aren't going to have the attention span to stick with the game for the long term anyway. Apparently, a fix is being tested in the experimental mode, but it's coming all too slow to a stable build.\n\nSixth, and my final gripe, and this is definitely as glaring as the fifth, scarcity of resources.  Copper, Quartz, Acid Mushrooms are plentiful at first, but become ridiculously difficult to come by as the game goes on.  Quartz is practically used in everything, because you need it for glass and rubber, which you need for building and making Power Cells to power your vehicles.  Each Power Cell takes a vast amount of resources, which would not be as much of a problem if they didn't deplete so rapidly.  Even with the power efficiency mod only a small expedition can use 6 power cells and leave you scrambling for resources.  Many users have defaulted to the same argument they have given to the food shortage problem, that there's plenty in the depths.  The problem is that it takes more and more energy, food, and water to farm this stuff.  You end up trapped in a cycle of more and more rapidly diminishing marginal utility on all of your resources.  This really needs to be fixed or users will basically be driven out of their own game by scarcity. \n\nBoth of the last two problems have people vehemently defending the current scarcity, with the argument that resources are scarce in real life.  I would like to point out, however, that one person alone in a wilderness does not leave vast expanses of land void of any life.  Certainly these rich biomes should be able to support just one person.  Also, if the player were able to hunt for shellfish and crustaceans in the game, diversity of foods might help lower depletion rates.  The player should be able to find oysters and dig for clams.  \n\nThe Good:\n\nBased on my criticisms, some might get the idea that I don't like the game.  That couldn't be more wrong.  Subnautica is, hands down, simply the best underwater game ever made.  There's no competition.  The environment is rich, full of wonder, and among the most immersive games I've ever played.  The world is packed full of fascinating creatures, beautiful vegetation, and unparalleled undersea effects.  The graphics are complimented by some of the most incredible sound you could possibly imagine.  All of it adds up to a game that makes you feel like you're living rather than playing.\n\nIt's one of those games that comes along and really changes things forever, at least among those who have played it.  In my opinion, the game hasn't gotten nearly the recognition it deserves.  The amount of stuff you can do in this game, and the painstaking attention to detail are mindblowing.  Those are things I hope never change with Subnautica.  Many early access games are dumbed down in later iterations.  Unknown Worlds Entertainment seems to have a good attitude about adding new features instead of taking them out, like some other developers of early access releases have done in the past.  I just hope they maintain the trend.\n\nSubnautica is an oustanding game, worth its price about three times over.  It comes with my highest recommendation. In it's current state, I would give Subnautica a 9/10.\n\nAdded 11/23/17: The game has been hugely updated since this review.", "timestamp_created": 1455866029, "timestamp_updated": 1532581828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 723, "votes_funny": 42, "weighted_vote_score": "0.962564706802368164", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41064222": {"recommendationid": "41064222", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993295672", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 6526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3957, "last_played": 1609246518}, "language": "english", "review": "***DO NOT***\n\nUnder any circumstances, read any guides for this game.

It's not merely about base building; exploration and the evolving story are what keep you engaged.

New resources enable you to explore even further. This cycle of discovery and adaptation is relentless.\nBut you're always a stranger in these depths.\nThis game offers a unique sense of exploration and uncertainty unlike any other.\nMy own adventure spanned 50 hours, filled with countless moments of awe. The world's atmosphere, diverse wildlife, and vast landscapes are stunning.

OHFUKMAN GET AWAY FROM ME\"\n\"GET OFF MY ARM YOU SQUID WORM LEECH LOOKING THING\"\n\"WHY IS EVERYTHING TRYING TO KILL ME??\"\n\"This looks like a safe place... HOLY SH*T WHERE DID YOU COME FROM???\"\n\nThis game takes all of your fears of the deep dark ocean and puts them on steroids, every time that little thought crosses your mind that your survival chance can't get any worse, it can and it will. It's almost like this game runs on your \"I hope this doesn't happen\" thoughts. \n\nSTORY:\nThe whole plot of the game is one of the biggest area's still being worked on, it's more focused on gameplay and mechanics at the moment. I have to say though, the general background and lore of the game is very interesting and i'm excited to play through it when it's finished.\n\nPERFORMACE:\nFirst off, when you read all the reviews about the crashing and \"needing a beast computer to play\" isn't true at all. I have never had a crash, none of my friends have ever crashed, and if you really can't run this game at a playable FPS then you probably need to stop trying to use a baked potato for a graphics card. This game is put together far better than most fully released games i've seen. Yes, my framerate isn't pushing 80-120fps BUT considering my laptop is about 3 years old and I still manage 30-50fps on a gorgeous game like this is amazing.There really aren't any serious bugs, the most you really run into is like a light glitch or maybe a fish getting stuck in the ground, nothing game breaking. The mechanics and actual gameplay are FANTASTIC, I have to give the dev's credits for a real original survival game (since almost every one of them now-a-days are about the same with either zombies, cannibals, or just nature; but underwater alien horror survival? That's new). \n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game and if you actually read this shitty review, i'm sorry I suck at this.

I have a decent collection and there are more than a few I recommend to friends, but I've never bothered to take the time to sit down and describe exactly why I love or hate a game. I have very specific taste and telling people about all my little nitpicky problems always feels self-righteous at best and masturbatory at worst. \n\nSo, when I tell you to drop whatever you're doing, block off a week from any and all social interaction, buy Subnautica and dive headfirst into it, I want you to understand my full meaning. \n\nSubnautica is a joy. It's what all survival games should aspire towards, and now that I'm on my third playthrough I can actually articulate what exactly it does right. And it does SO much right. From minute one, every action you take to further your survival gives you an actual, organic feeling of progression. Every piece of equipment you fabricate, every square meter you explore, every new thing you scan expands your capabilites and brings new opportunities and new challenges to light. Want to build that heat-resistant dive suit? You'll need benezine, for which you'll need to explore, for which you'll need a submersible, for which you need a power cell, on and on. Got the dive suit? Great, now you can build thermal plants to reliably charge your power cells. It's magnificent.\n\nThe survival mechanics aren't even the most interesting part. They're a framework upon which the rest of the game is built. The deeper you go, the more questions about the planet and its history arise. I won't spoil anything, but there's a number of truly great \"oh shit\" moments of the story that ask yet more questions and push you yet further and further into the deep. \n\nAnd it's presented beautifully. Small graphical issues aside, the look of the world is something like an underwater James Cameron wet dream (pun intended) and with each new biome you discover somewhere else to fall in love with. The soundtrack mixes perfectly with the world to underscore and enhance the game's wry humor, touching tragedy and genuine, pants-shitting terror. \n\nOh yeah, it's scary too. The stakes feel absolutely real, and you'd better be prepared if you want to reach the end. Because there is an end. [i]They[/i] didn't reach it, but maybe you will.\n\nBuy Subnautica.

I bought Subnautica and we stayed up later than normal playing it together. Of course it doesn't have multiplayer, but we both took turns gathering and making stuff. We were each cheering as we found resources, and we both were anxious to get away from the predators. It was fun, and I am looking forward for this game to help us come together and spend time together like last night.\n\n**Update** We are now more than 20 hours into Subnautica. We are having a blast inside the game and outside the game. I have found a way to connect with my son, and I am enjoying every minute of it. When his dad is home, he gets so confused by what our son is saying, and I happily fill him in on the details. In the game, we have a base with a multipurpose room, the submarine vehicle, and we're now getting the laser cutter. He loves taking screen shots of our progress.

Early on, you will need to think your way around hostile creatures.  Sure, a knife can ward things off for a moment, but you need to have a back up plan such as fleeing, or driving the creature away with subsequent attacks.  Note that it is possible to kill stuff, but it isn't really necessary.  I wouldn't be surpised if you can go the whole game without killing anything, really; even food.  Aside, later on you can consider grappling on with your Prawn, and using your mining arm attachment to \"drill\" a hostile creature.  Underwater rodeo!\n[/spoiler]\n\nOn being prepared\n[spoiler]Always bring an extra bottle or two of water.  Don't know what it is about this game, but you get thirsty pretty fast.  Later on, farming Melons is a great way to manage hunger and thirst in one convenient food.  You can even have a farm on the Cyclops!\n[/spoiler]\n\nOn navigation...\n[spoiler]If you want as few spoilers as possible for mapping, or you just like to explore at your own pace, you should consider creating your own navigational buoys/beacons.  In addition to really important locations, I personally created three solely for triangulation.  One near your life pod.  One precisely 1000m to the north at the surface.  And one precisely 1000m to the west.  Then, swimming at the surface above every interesting landmark/resource/point of interest, I would record the distance to each beacon with a pencil/notepad.  Now, if you wanted to make your own map, you would open up a graphic editor app such as SketchUp, and draw your center beacon, followed by your north and your west beacons.  (all 1000m apart, remember?)  Now here is the magic part.  Draw a circle from each corresponding buoy with a radius equal to the distance you wrote down.  three circles; one from each beacon; radius = range in meters.  See that intersection?  Congratz, you just triangulated the position of that point of interest, relative to your navigation beacons!\n[/spoiler]\n\nOn virtual reality...\n[spoiler]If you have an Oculus Rift or a Vive, then, you really do owe it to yourself to give this game a shot.  Darting through coral reefs, looking around corners, catching a glimpse of creatures that could eat you in a single bite... These are the experiences that literally take our breath away!  You will not be disappointed.  It should be noted that some may consider this a moderate-to-extreme VR experience.  If you need to blow the dust off your headset then you might want to work up your tolerance again about an hour or two per day for a week to get back in the saddle.  Some dry-eye, too.  Probably a \"VR comfort\" experience comparable to The Solus Project (another game that I highly recommend).\n[/spoiler]\n\nOn Base location...\n[spoiler]You cannot go wrong with base placement, really.  Just pick the place with the nicest view.  I chose the Kelp forest because I could sit there and stare at my monitor for minutes at a time (literally, yes I have no life! ha) watching the kelp wave in the current, with the glitter of the surface wave, above, and little schools of fish playing amongst the various flora and crevices.  Peaceful.\nOn another note of utility, I also created two type of other bases:  recon and outpost.  Recon bases would be small, self-sustained two room setups in remote locations consisting of some food/water supplies such as a melon farm as noted above, and a sonar room.  This would be used to filter/search for specific resources such as copper and magnetite that would link with my HUD and add waypoints to help me find them.\nSecondly, the outposts would be remote locations with rechargers for batteries and power cells, and farms.  Some crafting station and storage, too.  Just a way of resupplying when away from home.\n[/spoiler]\n\nOn resource scarcity / respawn...\n[spoiler]There is NOOOOO need to worry about a lack of resources or respawn.  Seriously.  I see this question pop up enough, but the game world is filled TO THE BRIM with more resources than any sane person should need.  I even think some, like titanium, spawn ocassionally in the form of debris from the Aurora wreckage.  You will not run out of anything.  It might be a little burdensome to actually get out and explore to find more stuff, but you will find it.  Just go with the flow, and push those boundaries!  The game's beauty is worth pushing past your comfort zones.  And don't worry so much about getting eaten alive.  Save often, and take risks!  That's part of the fun :)  The deep, dark, noisy depths of this game aren't nearly as terrifying as your mind will make it out to be.  Sure there are some dangers, but you learn really quickly what you can get away with, and when to keep looking over your shoulder. (blubablubablub)  Hint: The ocean is usually a noisy place; it's when it gets really quiet that you need to.... SWIM!! :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nObligatory word on Early Access:  despite being EA, the game is basically complete as far as I'm concerned.  I have completed the game 99%, or just short of [spoiler] the final step of leaving the planet [/spoiler] with no show-stopper technical issues.  Basically bug-free with some minor glitches that can be avoided as long as you save often: a sensible mantra for any gamer these days.  I could be wrong, or plans may change, but I believe they are planning 1.0 release in the first month or two of 2018, so at this point, as far as I'm concerned, they focusing on optimization and polish, and YES, they are still VERY active in the community.  I'm looking forward to supporting their next project.\n\nSo, there you have it.  The game is worth the ~$25US that they are asking for it.  The game is worth your time, too.  Having completed 99% of the game as noted above, I feel like my sense of adventure has been satisfied for a great while, and I plan to come back for a speed run or two after official release.  125 hours, so far.  You can't get that kind of utility from going to the movies, or going to the bar.

Developers created a huge, beautiful and very realistic world. Subnautica is mainly focused on exploration and it is extremely good. In fact, I think that there are no enemies in this game; at least, I could not perceive any creature as enemy. They are not monsters but just local fauna that live their life, in fact they are not even aliens, they are at home and you were not invited. There is only one alien on whole planet and this alien is you. Once you learn behaviour of animals you will very rarely encounter any aggression. If for some reason you want to fight... well, you may find a prey, but bloodshed is absolutely senseless and unnecessary.\n\nGame is quite peaceful but it does not mean that there are no dangers in ocean. Pressure, lack of oxygen, cramped caves, limited light... deeper and deeper you went, more and more awe you feel. When your submarine hangs over the abyss and you can see nothing but endless cliff and depth... it is scary... well, I hardly can remember another game that gave me such intense emotions.\n\nWorld in Subnautica is opened for exploration, from the very start you can travel... well, everywhere. Still, amount of accessable locations is cleverly limited by available technologies. You can try to explore deep caves immediately after planetfall but without supply of oxygen you will just drown. So game softly push player to explore safe shallows first.\n\nThere is storyline and in my opinion it is very good. I do not want to spoil anything - just want to say that storyline is simple but intense, yet not intrusive in same time. Bit by bit you will visit all locations and learn all mysteries. Final scene gave me very complex and positive emotions - it is beautiful and full of hope with light sadness. It was worth all long way down.\n\nGameplay can be divided into two stages. During first stage you salvage technologies, gather resources and craft equipment. There is some grind but I can not say it is boring or tedious... you just explore surroundings and study local life, gathering useful items by the way. And second stage is travelling - when you gathered enough resources and crafted basic vehicle - Seamoth - you can explore almost everywhere. There are only three vehicles in game - not too much, but they are widely customisable. You can install different modules - extra armor, torpedo launchers, defensive electric field and so on, also it is available to change appearance of vehicle, such as colour and, finally, you can even give your vehicle a name.\n\nYou can construct your base that will serve as center of operations. Constructing is simple and effective, it is very easy to learn and comfortable to use. There are lot of different modules you can combine and create your awesome station. Even more importantly, game offers a lot of different furniture and decorations to customise your base and turn it to... well, not just \"a base\" but your home. I really got attached to my tiny but comfortable underwater apartments and my tamed cuddlefish. I really hope that my pets will survive without me... wait, it is just a game... *sigh*.\n\nOf course, I must mention the stunning beauty of Subnautica. Blazing sunsets, dense kelp forests, impenetrable darkness with sparkles of luminescente flora and fauna... almost every scene literally craves for screenshot. As for sounds and music - they are excellent, such quality is really impressive. For example, I humbly advise you to search for \"Tropical Eden\" melody, it creates amazing magical atmosphere I was truly enchanted with.\n\nGame is not perfect, there are some bugs. Several times I seen fish swimming in my base. Once, during exploration of Aurora wreck, I got stuck in textures and then suddenly fell out of the world. Well... all this tiny confusing troubles seems insignificant for me.\n\nProbably the best advice I can give - do not watch videos and do not read guides. Explore by yourself! Believe me, pleasure from discovering new things is worth the time. If you love adventure games with main focus on exploration - Subnautica is a sure bet. Honestly, I do not know any games that can compete with Subnautica in this niche. \n\nYou do not want to miss this game.", "timestamp_created": 1540749619, "timestamp_updated": 1542979847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 318, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.943743526935577393", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14295642": {"recommendationid": "14295642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048087396", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 495, "last_played": 1584268926}, "language": "english", "review": "As a marine biologist, I think the creators of this game should get an award only for their beautiful ideas of marine xenobiotic life.

The second day was a free day for me and I ended up playing for 12 hours in one sitting. The last time I had played a single game for 12 hours straight was maybe three years ago!\n\n\nI actually don't enjoy Survival games that much. Base building and meaningless crafting isn't really a selling point for me, however Subnautica isn't a simple survival game, it's an [b]exploration game with horror[/b]. Yes, you're gathering materials and crafting stuff, but it's all being used to progress the game; To make better tools and equipment to let you dive deeper into the ocean's void and reach that distress signal at the ocean floor.\n\nYes you can make a fully fledged base that houses everything you could ever need, but you could also just make 2 rooms to house all the tools and storage you need. It will still be sufficient. So you're free to decide how much base building you want to do.\n\n\nDuring exploration you'll first be scared to take a 90m dive inside the hole in the ground you just found. You don't know what's down there, or if you'll even make it out of the hole itself.\nAs time goes on you'll find yourself making it to 150, 200, 300 and further depths, but the catch is that [b]you never stop being afraid[/b]!\n\n\nThat's the thing about this game, you always need to go deeper. The secrets of the world aren't just scattered across the surface for you to find. You need to head for the depths and that's where it gets scary. The deeper you go, the further you are from the surface. The world won't be the sunny shallows where all the cute fish are anymore, no. You're now in the depths. You're either in an underwater labyrinth of tunnels, far away from a straight swim to the surface, or you're in the middle of dark open waters where anything can come for you from any direction.\n\n\nIn this game, no matter how much you progress, you'll always feel scared. It's f*cking terrifying, but also addictive! You're scared $hitless at the depth you are, but you can't wait to improve your equipment so that you can go even deeper than what you just dared. To meet whatever else lies in the void.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics are beautiful. You'd think the cartoonish looks would take away from the experience, but they don't. It's beautiful when it wants to be and terrifying when it needs to. It also has amazing and almost photo-realistic lighting in water which really captures that feeling of being underwater. So yeah, you know those underwater videos of people swimming in open waters where every direction they look, the water slowly fades to an opaque darkness where you have no idea if something's in the water with them? You're gonna be seeing that here and you WILL be diving in it. If you didn't already have thalassophobia, [b]you will[/b] after this game.\n\n\n\nThe setting of the game makes for a unique gameplay, but it doesn't end there. The designers didn't just think that the setting alone would make up for a good game. No, they knew they had to put in work and they did. They created an experience that you [b]cannot get anywhere else[/b]. They also knew how to design their greatest weapon: The atmosphere.\n\nTruly the game's atmosphere is it's best feature and you will only beg for more while sitting in your soiled pants.\n\n\nTo be honest I can't fully describe the amazing atmosphere this game creates. I can't compare it to anything else. Maybe [b]Iron Lung[/b] but that only covers a fraction of what this has to offer. All I can say is that it's immersive and terrifying. For people like myself who don't enjoy having a character who talks BS every minute, I'm glad to inform you that your character doesn't talk, which greatly helps immerse you in the game, although you will still hear his screams of agony when being eaten alive at 500m depth.\n\n\n\nThe Story is told through Logs found in wrecks and events happening in front of you. Some logs contain Text while others have recorded Voice. Voice acting is good, doesn't get cringy and doesn't try to be over dramatic when there is no reason to. It feels real.\n\nYour only \"companion\" is your PDA's onboard AI which does drop in to give you information from time to time, but not at all close to being an annoying voice in your head. Never. In fact, since it is just an AI, it talks like a machine rather than a human and at times the information it gives you is information you'd rather not know.\nHow? Let's give an example for real life: You're in a pitch black jungle and can't see $hit. Well, you can probably go to sleep and wait out the night until morning, right? But what if you are then notified that you're not alone? That in fact, you are being watched right now? How would that make you feel?\n\n\n\nA very fun system is the Time Capsules. When players finish the game, they can leave a Time Capsule behind with a few items inside (with limitations), along with a message and photo. Other players can find these capsules in their world and use the contents. These can be very fun to find. For example, two of the crucial tools I needed, I happened to find just at the right time in a capsule. Truly a lucky find, especially since other players instead had to complete the blueprints to make it.\n\n\n\n[h1]Alright, time to stop kissing a*s[/h1]\nWhat are the negatives? No game is perfect right?\n\nWell if you didn't have thalassophobia, you do now! :))\n\n\nOkay jokes aside, here are the issues you [u]might[/u] face:\n\nThis is an exploration game. Most things are not marked on the UI for you to follow. You need to actually explore to find most things. Blueprints are one of these.\n\nYou don't know how to craft everything from the start. You need to search through wrecks for  blueprints to learn how to craft the item. It's a good system, but because of the exploration needed, one player might find a blueprint on their first try while others spend hours searching for the same fragment.\n\nOf course you can build a Scanner Room which helps you find what you're looking for in that area, but I personally didn't bother to make it before I was 80% done with the game. I also didn't unlock two blueprints even after finishing the game.  You can always check the Wiki to get what you want but this is what playing Vanilla will be like.\n\n\nStory Locations: \nMuch like the Blueprint Fragments, you need to explore the ocean and find some of these locations yourself which means the same problem can occur where you might have a hard time finding the desired location. For me this went smoothly and I don't think it's as troublesome as the Blueprints.\n\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nYes, I absolutely recommend this game. I'm not one who is easily impressed (you can check my other reviews and see for yourself) but this game is one of the few that I not only recommend but will regard as one of the best and unique experiences I had!\n\nThis game brings fresh new things for you to experience that you just can't find anywhere else. The amount of positive reviews given for this game are well-earned.\n\nIf you want to know how many hours of gameplay you're gonna get out of this, I can tell you how long it took me to finish it:\nBy building a major base and two small outposts, exploring [b]most of the map[/b] (not every bit and cranny), using [b]little[/b] help from Wiki here and there, and doing everything I found fun, it took me around 49 hours to finish the game. Of course you could use the Wiki or just be REALLY LUCKY and finish quicker, or you can f*ck around even more than I did and end up with an even longer playtime!\n\nWhatever the case, for me, it was well worth the money.", "timestamp_created": 1658177361, "timestamp_updated": 1695270581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 238, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.935738623142242432", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101785151": {"recommendationid": "101785151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027853812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2153, "last_played": 1696039242}, "language": "english", "review": "See beautiful fish, follow fish, get lost, panic, repeat", "timestamp_created": 1635467740, "timestamp_updated": 1635467740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 210, "votes_funny": 117, "weighted_vote_score": "0.935646533966064453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86226815": {"recommendationid": "86226815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311977101", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 6595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6520, "last_played": 1612819868}, "language": "english", "review": "Subnautica is absolutely amazing, it is singlehandedly the scariest and most relaxing survival game I\u2019ve ever played...\n\nI really wish that I could erase my gaming memory and experience it all over again.\n\nStrongly Recommended.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1612816554, "timestamp_updated": 1680225049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 237, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.934658348560333252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122973239": {"recommendationid": "122973239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869333049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3878, "last_played": 1684347072}, "language": "english", "review": "the three stages of players:\nStage 1: scared\nStage 2: scared\nStage 3: still scared but you know where everything is", "timestamp_created": 1664387208, "timestamp_updated": 1664387208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 187, "votes_funny": 90, "weighted_vote_score": "0.934368550777435303", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140507202": {"recommendationid": "140507202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149600994", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1490664949}, "language": "english", "review": "do not play this game with a logitech G F710 wireless gamepad, worst mistake of my life", "timestamp_created": 1687454285, "timestamp_updated": 1687454285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1981, "votes_funny": 1774, "weighted_vote_score": "0.933632075786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21860875": {"recommendationid": "21860875", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999053076", "num_games_owned": 862, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 25021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3926, "last_played": 1576116026}, "language": "english", "review": "After being interested in what I saw on steam, I followed this up with some gamer reviews on Youtube.\nSeveral notable game reviewers and let's play's later I was hooked.\n\nRight off the bat, most basic functions were intuitive.\nMovement was the standard WASD, I quicly figured out TAB opened my PDA, etc...\nOff I went.  Nearly drowning myself within a minute.\nA few minutes later I got too close to something that didn't agree with my presence.\nA few minutes after that I realised I needed some food.\nAnd so my adventures in survival began.\n\nSince then I made several mistakes in base design or venturing too far.\nI still remember the time I stranded myself in my seamoth(minisub) at about 600 meters, at night and my sub ran out of power.  I wont repeat the word I said.\nBut that is the sort of situation which captivates and maintains my enjoyment.  You trully are responsible for your survival.  Once you get a hang for how things go, you can quickly get a base going within 10 minutes.  Have a minisub in less than an hour.  But it is not a race.  It is a sandbox experience to enjoy in all its beauty and depth.  (pun)\n\nAs the game progresses you must venture away from the safety of shallow waters for materials.\nThe revamped Day/Night cycle and newer water graphics are breathtaking.  Nighttime is both visually beautiful and terrifying.  Daytime can be deceptively safe by comparison.\n\nI eagerly await each major update and new content the developers add.

It has had some amazing upgrades since the beginning of its early access, demonstrating that the devs are invested in the completion of this game. \n\nNot sure if you want to buy it?\n\n- When you start Subnautica you begin in a futuristic survival dingy. The graphics are somewhat cartoony, but in a way that's easy on the eyes. This is tempered toward a more serious tone. The water effects are amazing. If you've ever gone scubadiving or serious snorling this game's going to bring some strong nostalgia. \n- The main objectives of the game are not here yet. 2015. Updates are frequent though. Several a month or just one big one per month. \n- Right now, the things you'll be doing are gathering resources and building things. \n1\nThis is far from the boredom of most survival games. The things you can build are truly unique. There's also a lot of advantage to building a base besides storage. The devs listen to what we've asked for and a lot of module components to be bases have been given that are purely to allow you more aesthetic and functionality options that look incredible. No grunge here. This game gives you sleek, clean, and beautiful everything.\n2\nModules. This is a big part of Subnautica. As you advance in your understanding of resource gathering and building various architecture you'll find yourself coming upon \" fragments \". These things are debris from your crashed ship that can be analyzed using a specialized device. After the analysis is complete you'll be able to build more advanced bases, submaurines, and components to your everything. \n3\nWild life. Recently a bunch of new wild life has been added to the game that are rather awesome. The wildlife was already awesome, but now as you explore you're much more conscious of just where you are. \n4\nConscious of your environment. This game is the first to make me very conscious of the different environments I'm in. Lighting changes dramatically depending on a number of circumstances, but altogether the effects are such that you begin to realize you must develop a strong presence of mind. Sometimes it is oxygen that is a real challenge. Sometimes electricity is the greater struggle. \n\nIn short, if you're into survival games and you aren't playing this you're smoking the wrong stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1451009996, "timestamp_updated": 1451009996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 198, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932210147380828857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39355615": {"recommendationid": "39355615", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970685729", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 10697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5823, "last_played": 1694233827}, "language": "english", "review": "With Subnautica about to come out of Early Access, it is practically feature complete. \n\nAnd by the gods, let me tell you, this game is nothing short of amazing. From the first few moments of playing Subnautica, you are bombarded with alien beauty. The seafloor, the flora and the fauna, Subnautica really feels like an alien world, while bringing the familiar terror of home along. I for one have had a bit of a sensitive nerve when it comes to the deep blue, one too many JAWS movies perhaps, and Subnautica does nothing to help it. The depths are dark, dangerous and damn well terrifying. But they are also beautiful, every zone feels like its a completely different world, and the slow fade in of your line of sight makes for some pretty nerve wrecking exploration.\n\nFor a non-combat focused game, everything is trying to kill you in one way or another. From the little fish that are too fast for you to catch and cause you to starve to death or die of thirst, to the monsters of the deep. Even the ocean you are in is trying to kill you, as you are always pushing the boundries of how much air you have in your tank. \n\nSubnautica has a very intelligent and easy to use base building mechanic, amongst some of the best i have seen. You have many options available to you for practicality and for personalising. The vehicles are amazing too. \n\nI can not praise Subnautica enough, its beauty is only matched by its sense of dread. \nGo ahead and take the plunge.", "timestamp_created": 1515987284, "timestamp_updated": 1515987284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 757, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.931877613067626953", "comment_count": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28238110": {"recommendationid": "28238110", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991160211", "num_games_owned": 1111, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 25648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18684, "last_played": 1673571494}, "language": "english", "review": "So this is what happens when good devs make a single player survival game.

There isn't a huge amount to do at the moment, collect resources, build the mini-sub, and larger submarine, build a base (though without much to put in it yet), considering this only came out on steam 4 months ago though, it's coming along at break neck speeds, and is astoundingly polished already.\n\n\nI was worried I'd spend 2 hours and experience everything and be done with it, now I'm having to pull myself away less I spend another 5 hours today swimming around petting carnivorous fish. \n", "timestamp_created": 1427056014, "timestamp_updated": 1427056014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 202, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.930993497371673584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71176311": {"recommendationid": "71176311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062066904", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2434, "last_played": 1621299789}, "language": "english", "review": "I get lost for hours in Subanutica's world.

Also I'm not a native english speaker:\n\n- It's open world aspect is not limited to the usual horizontal movement, but the vertical movement aswell. This not only enhances the world to discover by a huge amount, but it also gives the player a lot more to discover and at times sense of getting lost, which might not appeal to everyone, but in this game it just adds to the exploration, because you won't get bored by the stunning visuals.\n- The oxygen system and the need to get some air every now and then adds a lot of tension and makes the game just more interesting.\n- Sound. The sound in this game is absolutely stunning and benefits the atmosphere of the game by a lot. Imagine being in a dark cave underwater, with a ceiling about 500m below the surface. All you have is your submarine. You can not see really far and you don't hear anything, expect for your breathing and a deep, vibrating moan in the distance. Or maybe you suddenly hear a close gurgle nearby and see some fucked up tentacle monster trying to kill you, which brings me to my next point.\n- Horror. Obviously this game is an open world explorer kind of game, but with the giant roaming things underwater and the aspect of you being below a giant mass of water, sometimes in complete darkness, sometimes inside a cave adds suptile horroraspect to this game.\n- No violation? What's most interesting about this game is that it has hardly any violence or weapons to kill something, which is acutally not even as bad as it sounds, because in all my playtime I have never really noticed it. It's not about killing those terrifying leaviathans or those sneaky stalkers, it's about living in co-existence and avoiding them, or even exploiting them.\n- It actually has a nice storyline already, which I won't spoil, but there is a lot of free space in it, to let you put in your own fantasy, which I really enjoy, because finding some note books of a captain, who is talking about his own ironical death, found inside a wreck of a space ship, is really cool.\n- Research system. You don't have everything from the start, and sometimes it takes a while to find a particular item you need, or rather it's blueprint. This adds to the exploration, but can sometimes get frustrating.\n- Variety.

Space. Big empty rooms at night. Deep water. That last one's important when talking about Subnautica, a game where dry land is as rare as diamonds in oldschool Minecraft. From the word \"go\", things are quite literally sink or swim, as the player character is forced to evacuate their vessel after it's shot down during a flyby of an alien world. Who did it and why are part of the story that won't be touched on, but everything has its reasons... Anyway, let's move on.\n\nSubnautica, first and foremost, is a survival game, and it makes no attempt to hide it. Every step taken needs to have a purpose behind it, as you need to get off the planet you're stranded on before you succumb to one of the many ways to die (note, however that in most modes, death is either somewhat trivial or annoying at worst, so I mean this from a story point of view). Crafting chains are in full force, with almost everything you pick up being useful in one way or another, and almost Metroid-like in its progression. For instance, on one's first jaunt back into the ship they left before the game started, it's likely that not all the tools needed to explore it thoroughly will be in your possession, forcing you to come back later. This sense of tangible progression works very well, especially if you're like me and started out scared witless when it got dark. By the end of the game, if you haven't gone from paranoid fear to admiring the exotic and natural beauty of your surroundings, there might be something wrong with you.\n\nDon't get me wrong, though. I wasn't kidding when I said there were a lot of ways to die. From annoying little sharks to suicidal clownfish to giant monstrosities that dwarf nuclear subs, there are a lot of things that will make you watch where you're swimming. Being set almost entirely underwater, air is a vital and precious resource, and a key part of the early game is getting ways to extend your exploration range so you can dive deeper, longer, and farther. You can also choose to play with a food and water meter, requiring you to keep supplies on hand to stay hardy. Most creatures will listen to reason and force, with a few even being slayable should you need them gone badly enough, but some... Well, when you see them, it's best to just run. There are ways to counter them, but this is definitely not a game where you will feel like a badass. There will be constant reminders that you're an intruder in a foreign ecosystem, a stranger in an even stranger land.\n\nThere are a few flaws with this game, though. For one, while things can look downright beautiful, there is often a thick \"fog\" around everything higher up in the biomes (not unrealistic, because you're spending the whole game underwater, but a bit annoying) and it's very easy to make the framerate tank in some places. There are also a few hilariously laughable instances of pop-in (watch the islands from above the waves when you're trying to get close to them, for instance), but this isn't really a giant black mark unless it takes you out of your immersion. Another issue I found is that sometimes it's not clear what exactly to do next, and while the game's lack of a map system and potential reliance on player-made deployable waypoint beacons helps add to the atmosphere, it can get very annoying when you're trying to remember, say, where the entrance to Lost River is, or finding it for the first time at all. Despite how open the game is, towards about the middle it becomes a bit clearer that there's a pretty linear path the story is trying to guide you down, and while this helps provide structure and a clear reason for progression, it somewhat robs the game of replayability to me, as there's little incentive to play again due to how things are set up (at least to me).\n\nWhen I started up Subnautica, I really didn't expect it to grab me like it did. I've never really been one for survival games, but something about the setting, presentation, and story just pulled me in. It was also interesting to me how my own playstyle evolved in tandem with the progression, going from being scared to dive too deep because I might not be able to get back up for air to leaping into crevices with reckless abandon, secure in the knowledge of where I'd end up and finding new things to surprise me all the same. It might just help to face your fears and dive in (okay, last bad pun, I promise).", "timestamp_created": 1545754633, "timestamp_updated": 1545754633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 179, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.922781109809875488", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44343937": {"recommendationid": "44343937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001605268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 5934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5147, "last_played": 1535345359}, "language": "english", "review": "Subnautica is a masterpiece.

I eagerly await this feature to be implemented further.\n\n>Some downright incredible creature designs. Scary sharks on crack, big octopi with translucent heads. MAKE MORE SPOOKY CREATURES! The person(s) who designed the sea creatures and monsters deserves a pat on the back and an expensive chocolate cake for their work.\n\n>Surprisingly easy inventory management. I was not a fan of the inventory system at first, but got used to it pretty quickly. Instead of dragging items from one screen to another, the game does it for you and puts each item together. It saves you the trouble of looking through bogged down chests, dropping and dragging items. \n\n>Simple crafting. As long as it's in your inventory you can craft it. The crafting system is simple yet effective. Open up the fabricator, select what you want to craft and it'll do it for you. At this present time there really isn't really anything technical that you can craft. Craftable items like the Cyclops just require a healthy quantity of expensive crafting items. I hope they add more technical crafting in the future.\n\n\nCons:\n\n>A rather unintuitive base building mechanic, similar in some ways to the old Rust or Unturned where you have to move your character around until the base part snaps into position. It can be frustrating, especially with parts like the Scanner Room. \n\n>Unrefined combat makes it difficult for you to actually hit any vile sea-demon that's following you. Generally you'll get hit first and manage to land a single hit on their body as they swim away. Without the stasis rifle it's really not that great.\n\n>Nothing to do. Once you build the Cyclops, go on the Aurora and explore the deepest dankest depths you're basically done. I know the Devs have some glorious things planned and I really hope they implement them soon. Furthermore, it sucks to admit that Subnautica (in its present state) doesn't have much replay value. I will admit that my first playthrough took me roughly 10 hours to complete (That's getting all the blueprints, building the Cyclops, going on the Aurora etc.) After that, I really was not compelled to start again. \n\nOverall, Subnautica is a game with massive potential. It's come a long way yet it has an even longer way to go. I really can't wait to see what the developers have in store for Subnautica, and what the final game will look like.  In its present state it earns an easy 7/10. A lack of content and some bugs and glitches here and there bring's the game's score down, but some grease can easily bring this to a 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1469354800, "timestamp_updated": 1470003412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 225, "votes_funny": 75, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920491933822631836", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140434958": {"recommendationid": "140434958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069034473", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 923, "last_played": 1681568140}, "language": "english", "review": "Billionaire tax dodger simulator.", "timestamp_created": 1687344672, "timestamp_updated": 1687344672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1166, "votes_funny": 829, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920320332050323486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139820920": {"recommendationid": "139820920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216339609", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6507, "last_played": 1698047247}, "language": "english", "review": "ocean scary :(", "timestamp_created": 1686379595, "timestamp_updated": 1686379595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 473, "votes_funny": 153, "weighted_vote_score": "0.918367207050323486", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51107850": {"recommendationid": "51107850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305001442", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2409, "last_played": 1587835987}, "language": "english", "review": "From the moment you drop into the ocean you know this game is something special.", "timestamp_created": 1559952103, "timestamp_updated": 1559952103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 161, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.917908608913421631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133961675": {"recommendationid": "133961675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230948888", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3943, "last_played": 1678668219}, "language": "english", "review": "The worst part about this game is that it ends.

The soundscape is very well done and adds so much to the experience.\n\nThe darkness of the ocean, leviathans and other freaky creatures, the feeling of being vulnerable under water.

One of the best games I've played in a long time. If you like exploration/survival/adventure games - just buy it.\n\n[h1]The short....[/h1]\n\n[b]+[/b] Absolutely gorgeous game world\n[b]+[/b] All the vehicles are just so much fun in their own way and customisable!\n[b]+[/b] The UIs. Immersive, clear, everything they should be.  \n[b]+[/b] Sounds and music are outstanding  \n[b]+[/b] So many small details and things to discover that aren't necessary to the game but are simply awesome. [spoiler] CUDDLEFISH!!! [/spoiler]\n[b]+[/b] The way the story is told, how you add bits and pieces of information through exploration and investigation\n[b]+[/b] Base building is the greatest\n\n[b]o[/b] Probably to make the game playable on computers that aren't absolute beasts, more detailed textures and structures appear only when you get close to something.  \n[b]o[/b] There is no option to make even a rudimentary map. There are other options to help with navigation but in such a vast world it would have been such a QoL improvement to be able to at least map out the different biomes\n\n[b]-[/b] Things, including you, fall through the floor or glitch through walls occasionally. This can kill you and can cost you hours if you didn't save recently because there's\n[b]-[/b] No autosave\n[b]-[/b] Never go swimming in the ocean again, ever\n\n\n[h1]And the long of it[/h1]\n\n[b]Story & Game play[/b]\n\nYou are stranded on a planet after a crash-landing. Your immediate objectives are to survive and hopefully find other survivors. To help with that you have a scanner that allows you to analyse everything, from flora & fauna to materials and even yourself for information that is stored in your databank, which is your most important resource. Through scanning your environment you receive hints and clues on how to survive and to proceed, new blueprints, and lots and lots of background information. \nAnd maybe there's even a chance to get home somehow...\n\nThere is no handholding whatsoever in this game. If you don't venture out and explore thoroughly you will miss important things that you'll need to progress. But that makes exploration so rewarding. You'll almost always find something that will help you to take the next step.\n\nSomething that is exceptionally well done is the base building. You'll find all kind of different room types and things to put in there, there're different options on how to generate energy and food (eventually) and you are absolutely free to add it all together in any way you like. You don't loose materials if you deconstruct something, so you can experiment to your heart's desire. There's no grinding for materials required, either, mostly you'll find everything closeby anyways. It absolutely encourages you to build large sprawling bases and it is a real joy to do. \nIt also allows you to avoid venturing out again too soon because you're still traumatised from your last near-death experience.\n\nBecause - let's face it - this game can be terrifying at times. If you've never heard about thalassophopia, it is the feeling that you'll feel in this game. The deeper you go, the darker and more dangerous it gets. There's always the risk of running out of energy or air, of getting lost in a cave system, of dying of thirst or starvation; and then there are the predators. \nThere are no real weapons in this game. You can distract or annoy some enemies so that they leave you alone long enough to give you time to escape but it is very, very hard to actually kill anything that is bigger than you. \n[i]And there are things lurking that are *much* bigger than you.[/i]\n\n\n[b]Sounds & Music[/b]\n\nI've said it already in my summary but it needs saying again: The sounds and music in this game are outstanding. Everything has its own sound and they are all so very satisfying. Whether it is your steps while walking in your base, closing the door of your sub, the different sounds the animals make, all the ambient noises - it is all fantastic. Subnautica is very immersive and the sounds are a big part of that.\nThe soundtrack is sometimes haunting, sometimes soothing, and sometimes full of tension; it is so well-fitted to the game, it is nothing short of amazing. If there were such a thing as an Oscar for sound design in a video game, Subnautica would deserve it.\n\n\n[b]Glitches and other flaws[/b]\n\nIt has to be said: This game has its fair share of glitches. I've gotten stuck in wrecks under water and suffocated because I glitched through a wall and couldn't get out. I've dropped things and they fell through the ground never to be seen again. I've dropped through the floor myself on a couple of occasions so that I had to quit without saving, losing a lot of progress because there is no autosave and I hadn't saved for a while. \nThere is an option to transmit energy over larger distances that I used at my main base and every time I started the game in a different location and returned to my base I had to destruct and rebuild the energy transmitter so that it would connect correctly. \nOnce, my base was flooded for no reason whatsoever (it's fixable, but still).\nAt one point, a few items in my inventory got duplicated.\nThis game is out of early access, these glitches should have been fixed by now. \nI coped by saving frequently and just lived with the quirks but the game could've been even better if some of these things had been addressed. \n\nI've also mentioned the way that more detailed textures and structures appear out of nowhere when you approach. This is less of a flaw and more of a feature; it makes it possible to play this game on computers that aren't top of the line. But it would've been nice if there had been an option to make the cone of visibility a bit bigger in the graphics options for PCs that can handle it.\n\nAll in all, the game was very well balanced in regard to how costly it was to build items, vehicles, upgrades, etc. The challenge was not to find a lot of one ingredient but to discover where to find a certain ingredient in the first place. Most materials could be found almost everywhere but some could be found only in certain biomes. That makes it important to know where the different biomes are. \nIn a game that plays mostly underwater and where you don't have any landmarks, navigation is difficult. You have a compass and you can deploy buoys that show up on your screen. But, at least for me, that wasn't enough to get a mental map of my surroundings. I spent way too long just driving around because I couldn't find the biome again that I needed. \nIn my opinion, it really would've improved this aspect of the game if there had been the option to make some kind of map. Just a very basic one that shows a top-down view of the position of the buoys would've helped. \n\n\n[b]A couple of tips[/b]\n\n- Scan everything and read your databank entries\n- Build a base as soon as possible. You can dismantle it and rebuild it elsewhere whenever you've decided on a more permanent location\n- No risk, no reward...\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nDespite its flaws, this is a game that you shouldn't miss. For the price it is an absolute steal. If you're unsure if you'll like it, try it out and ask for a refund if it is not for you. But if you like exploration and survival games at all then you will love it for sure.\n\n[b][i]I recommend this game wholeheartedly to the two people who made it this far.[/i][/b]\n\n\nBtw, there is a sequel: Subnautica - Below Zero.

Even though it is still in early access, the developers have done a very nice job with what is available as of yet. The fact that the game constantly encourages you to report bugs (which so far are pretty rare, surprisingly) allows me to trust that this game is only going to get better. Not only that, but some of the features/creatures that are planned for future updates (check out the Subnautica Wikia to see what I mean), have got me absolutely giddy.\n\nThe good:\n-I love survival games, and while I would probably enjoy most of the popular survival games available on Steam, Subnautica managed to really stick out for me. Subnautica takes place (98% of the time) submerged underwater, which is really a brilliantly fresh approach to a survival game.\n\n-Subnautica takes place on an alien planet, full of fascinating life forms. This really appeals to me, probably because I've always been a huge fan of games such as Pikmin (Gamecube), that are stocked full of unfamiliar biologies. The creatures in Subnautica aren't too cheesy though, esspecially the larger ones... The larger one's are either stunningly magnificent and/or terrifying.\n\n-The environment is beautiful, and yet equally eerie. There are multiple biomes that make up the planet of Subnautica, and each biome has a unique ecosystem for the player to discover. Some of these biomes are cut-off from early game becuase of how deep they are, meaning that you have to craft things such as a spare oxygen tank or even a submarine to reach.\n\n-Instead of being able to eventually upgrade your character to fight off the larger-scale hostile creature(s), Subnautica currently has a bit of realism to it. Of course you're not going to try and fight off a giant angry serpent with claws pertruding from it's face. Any normal human is going to NOPE the fuck out, which brings a bit of a horror-feel to it. (Currently there is really only one creature that is like this, but the developers are working on animating new creatures that are way larger, and/or waaay more terrifying)\n\n-With the above said, the player is able to fight off most hostile creatures as they are smaller and more practically killable. Still, even these creatures tend to attack out of no-where which gives a nice element of surprise.\n\n-There is plenty to craft and it's not exceedingly annoying to do so, either. Instead of being stranded with just the clothes on your back, the player is left with some advanced technologies left over from the ship-wreck that allow you to craft complex things (such as a battery or high-tech machineries) out of basic materials found in the ocean.\n\n-Also, underwater bases. Currently the bases you can make are pretty simple. On the exterior, they are basically just tubes with the option of adding windows, but I've seen pictures of bases some people have made in the Experimental Mode that look amazing, so it's appearant that bases with much more complexity will be brought in soon.\n\nThe bad:\n-Not much to be said here honestly. I guess one thing I would like to see is a better indication of a hostile creature losing health. Maybe not a health-bar, but something. I find myself having to continuosly knife things that may have been dead a while ago. I mean, I know they aren't going to drop to the ground because they are underwater, but it would be nice if there were some sort of death animation.\n\n-Also, another thing that bothered me during one of my playthroughs is the radiation. The ship that you ejected yourself from before the start of the game explodes pretty early in the game which causes a huge radiation leakage in the surrounding waters. A few of my playthroughs this wasn't a problem, and you can craft a radiation suit and even stop the radiation leakage altogether with the proper equipment, but in one particular playthrough the radiation instantly surrounded my escape-pod before I even had a means to craft a radiation suit or build a new base. I'm not sure if this was intended, as it seemed to be a one-time occurence for me.\n\nOther than that this game has been great thus far. I even feel as though this is going to be one of those games that I will obsess about. If you like survival games, but are bored of fending off wolves or zombies, this is a great alternative and I would recommend it to anybody.\n\nCan't wait for the final product. :)", "timestamp_created": 1437651112, "timestamp_updated": 1437651112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 158, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.909466862678527832", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114077925": {"recommendationid": "114077925", "author": {"steamid": "76561199262785810", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 839, "last_played": 1651155688}, "language": "english", "review": "its a horror game", "timestamp_created": 1650309383, "timestamp_updated": 1650309383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 357, "votes_funny": 94, "weighted_vote_score": "0.908896744251251221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39601614": {"recommendationid": "39601614", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972854082", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2928, "last_played": 1543736655}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say, this game should be an example of Early Access done right.

As dangerous as 4546B is, you will find a unique beauty here too.

Is it strange that I will miss my time here on this planet? That I even considered not leaving at all? And thought about coming back at some time, just so I can see my old diving grounds again?

What an incredible game.\n\nSubnautica\u2026 Adventure, lore, Look at AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\u2026\u2026. WHAT IS THAT?!?!\n\nThe ocean scares the hell out of me. This game simulates that feeling unlike any other. I love it. If you're the type of person to be phased by the terror of underwater things, it's as horrifying as it is exciting.\n\nOne minute you're chilling at 10m deep. Next thing you know you're dropping 500m down into some pitch black hole and you jump because a tiny fish hit your submarine.\n\nThe story blends exceptionally well into the survival elements, and is a good story, neither of which I\u2019ve ever seen in another survival game. It just feels... Different than other survival games. The story is amazing in a way that makes you want to constantly find out what happens next but at the same time it doesn't force you to do anything. Simply amazing. Did I say you can build a submarine, that you can park, inside your other submarine? Best invention since sliced bread!\n\nI love the fact that Subnautica is a game you can just tell someone to enjoy without any addendums. For most other games, even some of the best ones I've seen, if someone expresses interest in playing it I usually end up replying with something like \"make sure you do X, then it should be great\" or \"avoid Y until Z, it'll make the experience better\".\n\nFor Subnautica, there is nothing I feel I need to say to others. There's no advice to give. I don't have to say something like \"hey, if you like base-building make sure you go get the X tool in Y location\". If there is such a thing and it's worth getting, you will find it and doing so will be its own adventure with its own revelation.\n\nThe game is set up to make this happen. All the good stuff will naturally occur to you. The most tangible 'advice' I could give is to just go at your own pace and do what seems fun to you.\n\nIn essence, it's a masterclass in how to do story hooks and player progression in a game with an open world.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1669212743, "timestamp_updated": 1669212743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 262, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.903912603855133057", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127797661": {"recommendationid": "127797661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153077993", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1812, "last_played": 1670023880}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend this game and a new pair of pants.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nScary: 10/10\nStory: 10/10\nOcean: 10/10\nOverall: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1670024123, "timestamp_updated": 1670024123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 225, "votes_funny": 51, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90384143590927124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19322332": {"recommendationid": "19322332", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970314107", "num_games_owned": 2306, "num_reviews": 917, "playtime_forever": 3528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3528, "last_played": 1519543982}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the concept of survival games, but very rarely appreciate them in practice. The reason is simple: survival is a lot of work, and the more realistically a game tries to capture the survival experience, the more it feels like work. I love the idea of exploring and foraging to build my own home and goods, but too often that idea gets smothered by tedium. What makes Subnautica so remarkable is that, more than any other survival game, it turns the struggle into actual fun. Every aspect of the game encourages you to discover and build at your pace, without ever forcing you into a cycle of drudgery.\n\nYou are the lone survivor of the Aurora, a deep-space vessel which crash-landed on a vast, unexplored alien world. Your new home also happens to be an ocean planet, forcing you to find ways to explore and survive beneath the waves. Starting from your humble lifepod in the pleasant shallows, you\u2019ll descend into kelp forests, fungal caverns, ominous chasms, and stranger places still in search of resources to help you get by. As you piece together parts from the Aurora to make new equipment and shelter, you\u2019ll discover an ancient secret lurking in the depths of the planet. Getting back to civilization will prove to be more complicated than it appears, and your quest will reveal much about the fantastic world you\u2019re stranded on.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to discover about the game, and that much will be apparent from the moment you first dive from your lifepod. The environments of the ocean are vibrant and detailed, rich with strange fishes and exotic plants. Your first encounters in the shallows set the stage for the rest of the game, educating you in what fish are edible, where fresh water comes from, what minerals are useful, and what danger looks like. One of the first tools you can make is a scanner which provides helpful lore about every plant, animal, device, structure, and system you can point it at. You can also just poke at things pretty freely, filling your inventory with all sorts of rocks and eggs and junk that will all eventually have some value to you.\n\nCrafting is the key to progression here, but unlike most survival games most of the tedium has been cut from the system. Your lifepod contains a fabricator pre-loaded with recipes for food, water, tools, vehicles, and the refined materials to make them all. Getting to work requires blessedly little hunting and pecking, as most requirements are an X and a Y where both are perfectly common materials. They tend to appear in logical places as well, at least once you learn how the alien ecology is arranged. More complex gear requires you to scan fragments scattered across the world by the Aurora crash, and hunting down these bits rewards you with new vehicles like a personal submarine and a mech suit, weapons like a gravity gun, and important pieces for your seabase.\n\nBase building is one area where Subnautica shines the brightest. The developers seem to have realized that the number one thing anyone wants to do in the ocean is build things underwater, so they made that aspect of the game both rewarding and easy. Base hallways and chambers are made from small amounts of the most basic minerals on the planet, enabling you to build a sprawling complex within the first hour of the game. More complex rooms like a moonpool for docking your submarine and a scanner room for revealing nearby resources require more complex materials, but they\u2019re never items that take more than a few minutes to pull together. And there\u2019s plenty of furniture to decorate with as well, once you find and scan it from the wreckage scattered about.\n\nThere is one hangup in the base building though, and it\u2019s one that gets echoed throughout the game. You have access to hallways for your bases from the start but not the big multipurpose rooms that comprise most of the workable space, and I\u2019m not sure why that is. You have to find and scan one before you can build proper bases, and depending on how quickly you follow the storyline that could take an hour or several hours to do. Subnautica does an effective job for most of its runtime of signposting where you need to go next with distress signals and conspicuous datalog clues, but actually finding things in the vast ocean can still be a pain. Certain features essential to progression are a little too hidden, without any indication you should be searching in their vicinity. I played this game extensively in Early Access but still missed two key locations near the end that I had to look up once I seemingly hit a roadblock.\n\nYou\u2019ll run into a few other little annoyances like some wonky vehicle physics and the wildlife occasionally clipping into places it really shouldn\u2019t, but I only mention these issues now so I can stress how much they pale in comparison to the rest of the game. Any frustration I suffered from losing my way or getting my sub stuck on a reef melted away when I descended into a terrifyingly alien cavern for the first time, or build a brand new hundred-foot-long submarine. Subnautica absolutely nails the awe and wonder of surviving in a strange new place, both in the pleasure of discovery and the joy of creation. Finding a new landscape or crevice holds the promise of fantastic creatures to learn about and new building blocks to play with, pushing you ever onward to dive deeper and build better gear.\n\nThis magical journey is pinned together by an expert story told entirely through logs and the environment, unraveling the twisted history of the planet and beyond. Once you realize that survival and escape are not your only priorities, you\u2019ll be following two major plot and progression threads to your ultimate goal. One is firmly set in the crafting and collecting that forms the backbone of the game, while the other challenges you to follow a trail of secrets into the very depths of the world. I\u2019ll warn you now that some of these secrets are guarded by absolutely terrifying denizens of the deep, nightmare creatures sprung from minds acutely aware of how horrifying the open waters can be. No matter how big a ship you build, there will always be something bigger for you to encounter, and the sequences at the end of the game are absolutely masterful in how they exploit this discomfort.\n\nIf you harbor fears of the ocean this will be a tough one to deal with, but I implore you to challenge yourself because no other game has pulled off the formula this well. Compare it to any other survival game you want to, and you\u2019ll see that the graphics are brighter and more detailed, the sound is richer and more immersive, the story is more gripping, the crafting is more engaging, and the exploration is second to none. Subnautica has set the bar for survival games, turning the work of surviving into such fun that I could hardly wait to scrounge up my next piece of crystal or fragment scan. It\u2019s such an intense joy that even after escaping the planet after 20 full hours, I\u2019m itching to return someday.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?
