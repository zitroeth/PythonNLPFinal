Each one is massive, everything on the surface can be visited, there are many buildings/caves/waterbodies/ore patches/treasures/npcs....\nExploring comes down to finding very similiar planets over and over again made out of perhaps 10 different possible biomes. Only little things may vary. Additionally the things to find on each planet are also quite the same. Very soon, it becomes boring to search for and open some treasure chest, just to find some stuff, that can easily be bought elsewhere or crafted. There is no special loot to find, with the exception to a few certain ships.\nEverything that can be equipped/piloted can do roughly the same things/has too similar stats, even though there are four grades of ships/equipment.\nWhich one of which rarity the player uses, doesn't really make that much of a difference gameplay-wise.\nThe biggest change is often only the way they look.\nMost star systems also feel the same: 1 space station, 4 or so planets.\nOnce docked, space stations themself have little to offer: Roughly the same layout, very small, standard stuff to buy, same npcs...\nThere are very big ships, warping in in space in a cool looking way, but after that they will just hang around without any movement.\n\nSpace fights are kind of semi automatic. Your ship will always fly automatically, you can't stay standing still and stuff like that, even after getting some free-flight equipment/changing the setup.\nAdditionaly you can have a big fleet, but that's only for some point and klick missions.\nJust hanging in space like the other ships, they cannot really fight or fly.\nSince equipment/grade doesn't really make that big of a difference, aside from inventoy space, there is not much reason to find and buy better things.\n\nThere are many ways to trade: Facilities on planets/stations and npcs.\nThere might be some ways to make money by buying, then selling at a different place, for a higher price, but it feels like the stock at each trading opportunity is way to low to allow for big profit. I got the impression that profits are way higher by just selling some mined, planted or crafted things, or doing certain missions.\nI found no exotic, trade exclusive goods to explore/search for on trade terminals. Everything is just stuff, that was offered so many different times before.\n\nThe main story/ies seemed to be kind of interesting, but that was not enough to make me continue the game.\n\nBase building seems to offer many different parts with different forms, colors and patterns.\nTo me, it seemed like here lay one main point of focus of the developers.\nWhere cosmetic aspects are concerned, this seems to allow for many, very diverse base designs.\nSuch structures can also employ some gameplay tasks.\nFor example they can be teleported to and from, allowing for fast travel even across many star systems.\nAdditionaly automated mining and cultivating of important crops can be done within the operation limit of bases.\nThose materials could then be sold, or refined into different resources, leading to many different recipes for crafting/refining.\nSince refiners cannot be automated, and have very limited inventory space, the player would always need to come back personally, in order to input new materials and take out the refined products. \nNo production chains are possible, no autocrafting, no automated bringing of materials from and to storage.\n\nThis leads to some of the MOST ANNOYING aspects of the game: HORRIBLE UI design choices \n\n-New materials to use for refining have to be taken from a little inventory screen that can NOT be sorted, NOT be filtered, NOT be searched for specific things. One would HAVE to always scroll though that little inventory. ''Surprisingly'' this will become very annoying, very fast. \nThe more materials you hold, the bigger the annoyance.\n-The number of items to craft/trade would have to be manually increased one by one.\n-Ships/multitools you do own, cannot be sold, if they are not your current selected one.\n-You cannot see the details of the ship/tool you are selling, so the wrong one may be sold.\n-Switching out and moving around modules of a ship/multitool seems to be needlessly complicated.\n-Many ever-present tasks can only be done by browsing sub-menus, such as accepting communication signals, ...\n\nI do not understand why those things have not been fixed for more than seven years, or why they where even done like that to begin with!\nI am sure this could have been done better, even for a gaming console focused game!\n\nSo at the end, to me, No Man's Sky is a game that tries to offer many things, but fails to give most of them sufficient depth, paired with some reaaaaally annoying design choices and bugs.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1710626251, "timestamp_updated": 1711303062, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 250, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61156994104385376", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162898389": {"recommendationid": "162898389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294286476", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2273, "playtime_at_review": 1807, "last_played": 1713656576}, "language": "english", "review": "\"we are countless, my friend, walking these worlds, yearning for friendship. no-one wants to be alone, not truly. but the closer you get to others, the more you risk hurting yourself, hurting them.\n\ngo to the stars, traveller. your friends wait for you.\"", "timestamp_created": 1713134054, "timestamp_updated": 1713134106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599056601524353027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159300846": {"recommendationid": "159300846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041712769", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3263, "last_played": 1708892043}, "language": "english", "review": "I have logged only 54 hours into the Game Thus far in the last two weeks, Thats not bad for a Title released in 2016?\n-- The Good --\nThis games good, it has everything one would want in a Space setting SCIFI, A Ship you can upgrade and buy more of, Fleet you can send out on mission for passive income a good resource and base building system.

Unfortunately, the core gameplay loop has not changed and remains highly repetitive and tedious. \n\nAlmost every single objective is to  go from point A to point B, perform some action, then return. This would be fine if the journey actually involved some challenge or intrigue, but for normal game modes, this is mind-numbingly dull. All obstacles, either planet side or in space can be trivially overcome. Ship out of fuel? Blast some comets that always spawns 20 metres away. Life support low? Oh how convenient there's the same oxygen rich planet that grows on Every. Single. One. of the 18 quintillion planets.\n\nWhat's worse is that content updates have now become focused on \"expeditions\", which is basically the process described above but for TIME LIMITED rewards. That's right. You better grind away otherwise you're never seeing that content again. Sure there is multiplayer but any kind of meaningful interaction rarely occurs because everyone is trying to walk/fly/swim to the next marker point slightly faster than everybody else, since that's the only challenge this game poses. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe this game is targeted to a somewhat niche group of people who enjoys very slow paced game play. I applaud Hello Games' effort to improve this game over time. However, for me and many others who are looking for a meaningful space sim and exploration experience, No Man's Sky fits the bill very poorly.\n\nEdit: Admittedly I wrote this review out of frustration because I wanted to get all the portal glyphs so I could visit a really cool base I saw online, but it was taking hours longer than expected. However, it really is impossible to stay mad at this game and once again my hat's off to Hello Games for releasing another amazing update. I still think the core gameplay loop is genuinely flawed but I think I might give this game another go.", "timestamp_created": 1707629140, "timestamp_updated": 1711598260, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588741421699523926", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159015089": {"recommendationid": "159015089", "author": {"steamid": "76561199153972855", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1677300858}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfortunately, this game DOES NOT run on average laptops.\n\nMost of my playtime is on other consoles, such as Xbox and Playstation.\n\nI've heard people complain that things feel repetitive, and to be fair, it kind of is, but the thing is, everything is just distinct enough to still give a feeling of wonder. Especially when you find an anomalous planet, there are various types, and even when you come across a variant you've seen before, you still think \"huh, neat.\" and appreciate the rare find.\n\nThe thing that mostly sells this game to me though is base building. I played Subnautica much more than I have NMS, and loved the building system, but I always felt restricted with my base building being pretty much restricted to just underwater. NMS scratched that itch by letting me build similar structures AND MORE in all kinds of different environments. Whether it be underwater research bases like I made in Subnautica, a sci-fi village on a desert world like that one from Star Wars, and even building space cities with the FUCKING AWESOME freighter building system. You want to build a custom cyber city? With a little practice and a freighter, just enter creative mode and watch your dreams come true! I sometimes spend a week hyperfixating on one base, then spend the next week just gawking at it and having self roleplays as I interact with the random NPCs walking around, making up a story. Great times.\n\nThe ONLY real complaint I have about this game:\n\nLegacy cosmetics.\n\nUnfortunately, this game DOES use a FOMO (fear of missing out) system with it's events, most of which I missed sadly. Some of them are really cool too, and I hope they bring them back in some way. I just have an awful schedule with the intervals I play the game at. I take a break from it for a few weeks, come back and find out I missed an event or the event ends really really soon. I've just made a deal with myself to just not participate in events to avoid getting envious about it.\n\nAside from that small tragedy, this game is really fun, has a neat story that's pretty much optional, especially in creative, and I can't see myself permanently putting it down for a long time from now.\n\nAnd don't worry, for you bloodthirsty players, there is an outlaw faction, and epic space battles not too disimilar to Star Wars. You fly through ship trenches and blow shit up, pull maneuvers on bogeys and obliterate them when you get the upper hand, and watch as the cowards warp away as you go and collect the rather valuable drops from broken ships.\n\nI personally don't have much experience with the outlaw faction, but sometimes I will make a save just for the purpose of being a lone pirate, cracking freighters open, assaulting random ships, there's something for everyone.\n\n9/10 game, been around since the start.

When it was first released, the game received a lot of backlash for not living up to its promises and for being repetitive and lacking in content. However, with the release of multiple updates, the game has transformed into a much more immersive and enjoyable experience.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements is the addition of a story mode. In the past, the game felt aimless as players were just exploring random planets without any real purpose. But now, with the addition of a story, there is a sense of direction and purpose to the gameplay. The story itself is interesting and keeps me engaged, making me want to continue playing to see how it unfolds.\n\nAnother major update that I appreciate is the improved graphics and visuals. The environments and the creatures now look more diverse and realistic. The addition of new biomes and weather effects also adds to the immersive experience of exploring different planets. It's truly amazing to see such a vast and beautiful universe within the game.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics have also been significantly improved. The addition of base building and the ability to own and command a freighter have added more depth to the gameplay. The crafting system has been expanded, allowing players to create a variety of items and upgrades. It's great to see that there are now more things to do besides just exploring.\n\nThe community aspect of the game has also been enhanced with the inclusion of multiplayer. It's exciting to team up with friends and explore the universe together, or compete against each other in races and battles. Multiplayer definitely adds a whole new dimension to the game and makes it more enjoyable.\n\nOf course, there are still some areas that could use improvement, such as the variety of missions and NPCs. But overall, I am very happy with the updates and improvements that have been made to No Man's Sky. It has become a much more engaging and fulfilling game, and I find myself spending hours playing without getting bored.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend giving No Man's Sky another chance if you were disappointed with its initial release. The updates have transformed it into a truly unique and enjoyable game that offers endless possibilities.

The game received an astounding amount of love from the developer, something that they should be praised for; however, this review is about the product, not how awesome Hello Games is. The studio, in my eyes, deserves a 10/10 rating.\r\n\r\nFirst, the pros of the game:\r\n\r\n- Exploration: This is its major strength. There are so many worlds in the whole game, it's amazing, and they all look beautiful.\r\n- Building: You can have a ship, an outpost, your own base, etc., and there is a lot of customization.\r\n- Space simulation: This is another great point. You can not only own a spaceship but also a capital ship and a fleet.\r\n- Numerous races: You get to learn languages to even communicate, and there are some interesting people to meet, at least at first sight.\r\n- Mysterious and ethereal: There is some overarching story which makes one think deeply.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n- Boring: Simply said, yeah, you can do all the above, but after getting this perfect base, this perfect fleet of ships, and an outpost, you just continue mining for the same resources (or automated so all you do is collect), and then there is just nothing else to do. Sure, a new world will have nice visuals and randomly placed points of interest that you can find on the 99th or 181st planet you see.\r\n- Uninteresting NPCs: Calling them NPCs is actually too much. You can have hires in your spaceship or in your base or outpost... but they really feel like biological interfaces that you can use to get another fetch quest or some service.\r\n- Nothing happens in the universe: No factions that would change diplomacy against each other, all space stations are filled with NPCs that don't really do anything.\r\n- End goal: I will avoid spoilers, but the end goal is pretty uninteresting...\r\n- No female characters: Seriously, WHY? I had numerous friends who refused to play this game with me due to feeling excluded. They can't immerse themselves playing a character with a rough male model.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThis game is definitely good for people who do not demand more from games in terms of narrative and depth, just sit and tinker a bit. Pretty much people who like to play with Lego would definitely enjoy doing the same things over and over. Its a perfect sandbox sci-fi game and this is both where the strengths and weaknesses are.\r\n\r\nIf you are, however, a player who wants engaging NPCs, the world reacting to what you do, or even doing things outside of your own influence to try to engage you on its own, then no, this won't be interesting enough for you. It will just become boring with time, and no amount of building/mining or fetch questing will keep you interested. As I am in the latter group of people, hence I cannot with clear conscience recommend this game to others. If this featured some sort of procedural generated NPC's that I could actually communicate with, like my crew going to mess hall in my capital ship to eat or someone searching for me for help or even an NPC I hired with name having some sort of past they would share with me based on some sort of relationship points with them, then it wouldn't leave this hollow feeling I have gotten after 132 hours in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1711583172, "timestamp_updated": 1711583172, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555506527423858643", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162036467": {"recommendationid": "162036467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157262407", "num_games_owned": 1352, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 6961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6961, "last_played": 1711913853}, "language": "english", "review": "+++++\nbig updates\nbeautiful\ncomfortable\ntechnologically advanced\nmodifiable\n\n-----\ngenerated quests are weak\ncombat on planets is boring\nplant assets are poorly varied", "timestamp_created": 1712072985, "timestamp_updated": 1712072985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555054187774658203", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160400981": {"recommendationid": "160400981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009468296", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 18866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18839, "last_played": 1712571870}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest comebacks from a Developer the gaming industry has ever witnessed.\nIt continues to grow, and get better.

It looks great. Cool atmosphere. But playing it through this sluggish slow UI and having to watch the same damaged machinery animation thousands of times when I'm exploring, or having to fumble through the various inventories, or the fact that every NPC tells you their entire life's story every time you just want to buy a wiring loom. The game is supposed to be relaxing, but I am nearing carpel tunnel from mashing left click through dialog and animations.\n\nI would understand if it came out like this, but it has been 8 years, they have remade the game like 3 times, but the UI is unloved.\n\nHeres a detailed list of my struggles with the UI, in a vague hope that a dev will read it:\n1) Damaged machinery. I don't know you can get the idea of opening a loot chest wrong, but hold E, grab goo, put it in exosuit, exit the UI, wait 1 second for the interaction button to appear, hold E again, get the loot you actually want. why? just have it give me the goo and loot by holding E once. Same with the green cargo boxes. The yellow and red ones work just fine.\n2) Have 2 buttons when you see an NPC. one for \"talk\" and one for \"actions\". When I'm checking my inventory and comparing stuff in a shop, since you don't have a side by side view, I have to mash through the same line of dialog from the shop NPC 5 or more times.\n3) When repairing something, and I dont have a ready carbon nanotube, which I never will just have laying around, let me hold E on the grayed out carbon nanotube to craft one and use it in one action. Instead of making me exit that UI, go into my exosuit, craft the item, and go back into the UI.\n4) Setting actions to \"always instant\" instead of \"hold\" applies to only about 50% of the game, and I can never tell if an action is hold or click. \n5) Right click to go back is extremely inconsistent. Sometimes it leaves a UI entirely, other times it goes back to the previous menu. It forces me to repeatedly open the same NPC UI, mashing through the text again, if I want to do multiple actions in that UI. For example unlocking multiple items in the anomaly tech trees.\n6) The overly dramatic achievement achievement popups that BLOCK all input until you dismiss it, constantly. This denial of service attack on my gaming experience is THE MOST annoying UI element of this game. Would a notification at the bottom right like all the other notifications not work? Do I have to watch a full screen achievement movie every 10k units I walk?\n7) Changing camera view for both player and ship is tucked away in a nested menu instead of being a hotkey\n8) The \"x\" menu is horizontal, while a mouse scroll wheel is vertical. There is no brain association between up/down and left/right.\n9) What is up with owning several spaceships? They seem to appear and disappear around me like they are ghosts haunting my game. Why is there no spaceship or multitool menu like the fleet menu? The only way to select a primary ship is to go sit in it. Why are these 2 actions tied? Why do this 1000 IQ system where ships secretly appear in my freighter instead of giving me a menu to manage them?\n10) Items in the discoveries menu lists fade into existence at a rate of one per second. I just want to see if I have unuploaded discoveries, not watch a list slowly fade in dramatically. Wrong place to put atmospheric animations.\n11) Finally the UI in general is terribly fitted for use with a mouse and keyboard. Compare playing No Man's Sky with any MMORPG from the last 20 years, they all have much better user interfaces for mouse and keyboard without losing immersion or atmosphere for not having fancy animations on every action. I get that maintaining 2 concurrent UI systems is harder than maintaining one, but are you really ok with this?\n\nHonorary non-UI complaints:\n1) Lights don't actually light anything up at night time. If you have a building full of lights, only the lights glow, there is no light being cast, everything is still pitch dark.\n2) Some sounds in the game are way too loud, like creatures fussing around and freighter hangar shutters opening/closing\n3) No option to disable the horrendous scan line effect on the screen that hurts my eyes without modding the game.\n4) Different missions will often lead the player to the same building on the same planet repeatedly\n\nJust feels overall like no one play tests this game. Did none of the devs do a run in their own game? Do they all only play on console?\n\nI hope I can change this review to a \"Yes\" in a future update", "timestamp_created": 1713218597, "timestamp_updated": 1713218597, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551262259483337402", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158573547": {"recommendationid": "158573547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017505801", "num_games_owned": 977, "num_reviews": 278, "playtime_forever": 1706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 823, "last_played": 1708354282}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game", "timestamp_created": 1708211458, "timestamp_updated": 1708211458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550352692604064941", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162138989": {"recommendationid": "162138989", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999170372", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7991, "last_played": 1617251473}, "language": "english", "review": "After enjoying the game pretty thoroughly right out of the gate, years later it was suddenly one of the best VR experiences out there, as a free add-on.

I still play it now and then, but it never leaves me feeling satisfied. I normally don't have strong feelings about this, but this time they've set me off.\n\nThis newest update they put out, they finally implemented ship customization, after [b]eight years[/b] of the only way to get a nice looking ship being to hope you randomly get one you like. This is a big glowing headlining feature they're really proud of and have plastered everywhere.\n[b]Except it sucks.[/b]\nThe way you \"customize\" a ship is to first find or buy ships and salvage them, which lets you make a new ship out of the parts they were made of. That sounds agreeable enough, except that in literally any other game I've ever seen or played that has done something like this, those parts are permanently granted to you in a list you can freely choose from.\nNot so here. Each salvaged ship's parts - which you can only pick [b]one[/b] of (wings, cockpit, or engines) [b]per craft[/b] - are physically granted to you in your inventory, which must be brought to the ship terminal and manually used [b]and consumed[/b] to build the new ship, plus a core purchased for nanites to determine its class. It also can only be used on [b]three of the eight[/b] ship types, which excludes all the useful ones. And again, since the parts are all consumed on use, if you got a bad roll on ship stats within that class, well, tough luck. \"oh well if they weren't consumed you could rebuild them infinitely until you got optimal stats\" They are consumed so they should give optimal stats anyway, give me a break. And if they weren't consumed, they could simply, I don't know... make the process [i]cost money[/i] instead? There's a thought.\nIt's complete nonsense. I don't understand at all why they would go out of their way to make a worse system than the industry standard and act like they're finally giving the fans what they want.

I'm not at all into online games. Always prefered playing single-player, so I was hesitant to try it. But, the game realy is what you make it, including allowing you to play single-player without any online players and without any limitations. And it seems to be the perfect blend of gameplay and art design for me. Hits the spot absolutely perfectly. It can also get as relaxing and easy-going or as exciting and action-filled as you want it it to be. Endless, seamless exploration, rich and satisfying resource management and base building, and a bit of mystery and unexpected surprises thrown in the mix too. The game oozes creativity and enthusiasm of its authors and from the 30+ hours I put into it, I see why this is one of the greatest redemption stories in gaming. The game plays incredibly well. You can just let it take you into its own universe and you can forget all about the real one. Hats off to the creators.

I can't think of a single better redemption arc then Hello Games; they have gone above and beyond to fix their screw up and should be held as an example to what other companies especially triple A ones should be doing. \nNow the game play is pretty solid, most of the glitching has been fixed except a few outliers. The game could be better optimized my computer is much newer then this game so should not be running into any issues but the space stations can get a bit busy and lag dropping the fps significantly especially in multiplayer. The planets can get pretty repetitive and base building can be a chore as environment often comes back clipping into buildings. \nThat negativity aside, it is fun to explore, customize your gear and now ships. There are many mechanics of the game that are fun to explore; like being a merchant, crashing markets, leaving the inhabitants of that galaxy with an economy reflecting Earth's current one. Or you can be a smuggler, getting contraband past space robot cops to make the suppressed entities happy and your wallet fat like a Santa that gets paid. Not only can you have a command ship and customize the inside to your liking, but you can purchase ships to make a fleet.

Then, one day, something made me decide to try it again. So I gave it a go, and fell in love. Not much had actually changed from release when I decided to try it again for the portion of the story that I was playing. My perspective changed of what the game had to offer. I was looking at it wrong - I had an entire galaxy at my fingertips, and many galaxies beyond that which I could explore, quite literally, until I die of old age.\r\n\r\nThey pair you with just the right amount of tools, there's always the resources available to get you off the planet or heal yourself. There's rarely thirsting for resources, and the development seems to never end.

It will be probably be hard to say what hasn't already been said about this game. But I'll try to make it a short and direct review of the game.\n\nFor older gamers that grew up in the older PC era and you're familiar with the Elite games (Elite, Frontier: Elite II, Frontier: First Encounters), I think this is THE game you are looking for. This game expands on all of the greatest concepts that Elite introduced, plus adding absolutely tons of ideas to that.\n\nOn top of that, the game does a fantastic job NOT overwhelming the player with all of its many features all at once. It slowly introduces you to everything in the game with good pacing.\n\nThe developers have taken great care in honing all of the different systems in the game and making everything intuitive. For example, base building. Base building is easy to do, intuitive and works really well.  Or space combat, it has great control and is challenging and fun at the same time. It seems like they really took every single system in the game, and took care to focus on each one with thought and care.  \n\nPlay the game at our own pace, work on making some money, or follow story missions, or do side quests, or do government missions, or research new technology for your ship, or go hunt random pirates for cash, or build new vehicles to roam the planet and mine for resources, etc. You get the idea!\n\nAnd this is maybe a small thing to point out, but having the travel methods so open really does give the player a sense of freedom within the game. For example...Standing at ground level at your base and looking up in the sky, and seeing a planet, then being able to hop in your ship and fly to the planet in real-time, then look back and see the planet you just came from, is a very cool sense of freedom. The same  goes for when you're entering a planet's atmoshere. The fact that you were flying the ship yourself as you enter, not just pressing a button and waiting for the planet to load up, is really huge part of what makes the game so much fun.\n\nTalk about a feature rich game with endless amounts of things to do. This is a must-have game for anyone who likes large space combat/exploration/trading.

There are plenty of \"space jobs\" you can do, fulfilling different fantasies. You can be an exo-biologist, just going from planet to planet searching for and scanning lifeforms for money. You can be a miner, manually digging mineral deposits across a planet, or you can prospect for large mineral deposits, found a base and build mineral extractors. You can be a merchant, going system to system, buying locally produced goods and taking them where they are in demand. You can be a smuggler, buying contraband in Outlaw systems and selling them in lawful systems. You can be a pirate, raiding capital ships, or you can hunt pirates yourself. You can hunt Sentinels (i.e. mysterious synthetic space police), both on the ground and in space. You can scavenge derelict freighters, or you can command a fleet from your own capital ship. You can even become mayor of a town.\nEach of these \"space jobs\" has different levels of fun, which of course is subjective, and of profitability. Yet they are all very shallow. They can be enjoyable, but you really need to immerse yourself in the world, because it is easy to rip through the paper thin facade and realize that you are playing a game and that everything is pointless.

I had heard of this game for years, since release, but never really fought too hard to get it, as gamers always seemed a little torn on good/bad. I can say, without a doubt, that it is a pretty fun game at the current phase of update/release (again, known as Omega).\n\nThe starting sequence was fairly well laid out, with tutorials to get you moving in the right direction. Could more information be given during the tutorial? Yes! Is part of the game discovering things yourself and figuring out how to use them, survive, explore, etc? You bet! I realized about a day into the game that I wasn't doing the \"visor\" thing right to discover and catalog plants, animals, etc. Once I figured that out, I felt A) dumb for not seeing it earlier and B) awesome for finally figuring out how to find resources easier - targeting is dang genius!\n\nThe exploration, music, storage system, and options to advance your character seem a bit daunting at first, but then once you get a hang of it, things get a lot easier, but still remain fun and challenging. While I only got to sample the Omega Expedition that was currently underway, the ability to move your real character to an expedition and collect new stuff while it runs, returning to where you left off in the regular game, is pretty unique and fun. So many recipes, aircraft, building styles (check out Youtube for some of the most creative things people have built in this game), languages, and play styles available to you.\n\nWhile my time in the game was short lived, I do have to say I enjoyed it. I may be picking up a copy one day, as it is now at least on my radar. Granted, at over 500 games, plenty of other things to do to occupy my time.

The different Nebulae, the planets, the suns and overall visuals are superb. Really gives the exploring/immersion feeling a good boost. \n- Diversity is where the game truly shines. Sure, the pool from which the procedural generation picks is limited, but the combinations and overall spread of the different things you can find and catalog is superb. Collect ships, companions, freighters and invest hundreds of hours to fit and max them, fly them in adventures and see the galaxy.\n- Good exploration sim.\n- A lot of stuff to do with a scope in mind and completion goals. \n- Superb base designs. \n- Huge game, you will find places to call \"home\" and they will be beautiful.\n- Music or should I say atmosphere is awesome. One of the best parts for me. \n- Great content with pirate dreads and alien like derelict explorations. Good immersion and feeling. \n- More ship slots! More freighters needed! I want to own a space armada please!\n\nCons: (this will hurt but every point here felt like a slap over the head when I played).\n- The name of the game is Grind. Not because you have to slave away to have anything, but because you have to do the same thing tens/hundreds of times to reach the wanted result.\n- The Click Hell! Want to skip over the same conversation 300th time? Click 20 times to fast force every sentence that slowly displays in the convo window. Alternatively, you will be taken out of vendor menu's so you have to reclick everything to get back, even thou you weren't finished! Click click click to skip everything, EXCEPT the entire conversation. Open again a lore journal by mistake? Start clicking to skip each sentence again. 30 clicks, done..Oh...another journal over there! Why the Hell are you being taken out of npc convo menus after each option you chose!?\n- The difficulty is trivial. Even in the endgame content, there is no real danger. You get awesome ships armed to the teeth, a personal fleet, full rack of weapons, and you blast through derelict freighters with only an upgraded mining beam. \n- Horrible mechanic for scanning everlasting energy/resource nodes. In order to get the S-tier ones, you have to drive like a cretin in the same direction and scan. Hours upon hours of samey landscape where you just push a button to see if any RNG generated S-tier nodes are around you. WRONG! You have to spice up this torment by dismounting your vehicle hundreds of times because you cannot use the scanner while driving! It makes no sense! Why can't you use the scanner while flying/driving? \n- You can't change ship on station, you can't change the order of the ship you are being given after a scrap/sale. So get ready to teleport/fly around no one knows how many times because you are just not allowed on stations where you actually need to. \n- Map Cancer. The map is simply cancer. You want to set a waypoint? Hah! You see the road map only on locked view. Want to plan a trip? Get out in space, is the only place you can access the map! Besides this, the 3d map is so bad. Background colors change, systems overlap, you can't plot a course to a system you haven't visited, filter is simplistic, and you can't spin a 3d map. Good luck trying to pinpoint a system if you don't aim it perfectly with the center of your screen. Good luck trying to get anything to display unless you center it perfectly while flying.\n- The Bugs. OMG, it's been 8 years already and still annoying bugs. \n  - terrain regrowing over your base.\n  - falling through terrain and map\n  - base registering screws the snap on base modules. All you can do is erase the entire base to make the modules snap and register the location on the same spot again, otherwise the game will not see your base as actually there, hence things won't snap anymore.\n  - missions not registering progression. \n  - missions that ask impossible to achieve requirements (scan 12 flowers on a planet with no flowers)\n  - things that display for me, do not display for my friends in multiplayer\n  - resetting encounters with invisible enemies, etc\nMy gf quit on the game when all her inventory vanished during a Nexus mission losing rare items and tens of hours of progress getting them. \n- Multiplayer is NOT multiplayer. Sure, you can do missions with a friend, and battle sentinels or be a pirate (if you are lucky to see the same things on screen), but the multiplayer part (the reason why I bought the game with my gf) is not really there. Missions are trivial even on single player, so another person in your team just makes the ordeal go faster. Unless the game bugs and you get different requirements for the same mission :)) You can't use the same base unless the owner is online and ON SITE. You can't share the storage, you can't trade ships and \"unboxed\" modules (why???), You can't even build a shared base in the same spot. And while this is great for PVE and getting rid of thieves/griefers, it kills the coop game play and I feel scammed. \n- PVP is trivial and basically non existent. The NMS community is a hippie commune. The game itself is risk averse. There is no risk, no sweat, little skill involved and no punishment for failure on Normal. Hell, you only get tricked into pvp if you don't un-check a box. Even the predatory animals are slow! \n- I didn't care for the writing or the story. It's allover the place and the quests are 99% fetch quests. The mission UI is a mess also. Deselecting your missions when you enter ship, not giving clear checkpoints and making you resort to the messy galaxy map (accessible only while in space). But it's not why I played the game to begin with. The worst part is even if there is a large diversity of missions, their only goal is grind. Progressions IS GRIND. And they are RANDOM. You can't even grind what you need as a dedicated goal. Maybe this game session no missions with the rewards you need will spawn! Progression is therefore locked behind RNG, and that's a middle finger if you value your time. So get ready to check reddit for fastest ways to get through that grind faster! \n- the bases looks beautiful, and I've seen some incredible builds. Really jaw dropping material. The bad part, is that more than 50% of all the modules you can build in your base, are cosmetic only. There's no point going the extra mile. Some basic rooms/greenhouses/utilities and you are set for the rest of the game and fully outfitted. \n- The goal of many venues of game play mechanics is to give you money. Top tier farms for top tier minerals, rare plantations and expeditions providing with the rarest items, all have one utility - money. You can build entire bases by buying the materials off market, and it will barely make a dent in your wallet. And once you have everything you need and enough money, there's almost nothing to do in the game except grind for stuff you can't mine/build/buy. \n- cannot enjoy past expeditions and rewards given before I started :( \n- you can name everything, from systems to rocks...but they won't really show for you or others in space. The game forgets mapped planets and named systems. \n\nThe game is extensive, but repetitive to braindead levels. The sandbox element is the saving grace. There are some incredible devs that managed to turn around a global scam and a global laughing stock of a game, and some designers/writers that should never touch a game again. The level of wasted potential in this game is staggering. It could have been one of the best games of the decade with all the things you could have done in it, instead, it's just a grindy \"what could have been\" with 0 replay value after a thorough game play. Respect for free dlc's, but the multiplayer aspect killed the main selling point for me.

The only difference between the planets are the types of elements on them for you to mine, and the colors. Once the giddy and awe wears off after exploring your first planet, there's not really much to be excited about.\n\nNone of the procedurally generated flora and fauna are interesting. There's very few unique structures or just things to do on planets. There's no reason to dig down and explore any more than just the surface. Gameplay loop is going to a planet, collecting the resources, selling them off at a space station, then jumping to another planet. Find a cool looking planet? You drop down, build a base, take screenshots, then leave. There is no change in the gameplay.

Then as years have gone on its gotten worse. In spite of all that they have taken this absolute train wreck of a game i was sure they would sell and run off with the money, and turned it into something great. Many of my friends have told me they would never forgive Hello Games, I was of the same opinion not too long ago, But i decided to give them a chance after they appeared to be really trying to make things right. And they have in a lot of ways. Free dlc, constant updates, bug fixes, and even recently a rework to stations. While the game may not grip me in ways Tf2 has with my 14k hours over both my accounts. My 57 hours in No Man's Sky has actually been nothing but pleasant fun. Its not gonna knock my socks off with action, or blow me away with amazing space battles like i saw in the trailers. I have grown to see the game as a chill relaxing evening, Go check on my settlement, deal with the same guy complaining about his ownership of an item for the 30th time while chuckling. (I call him Charles at this point) going and getting some more fuel for my weekend space time with some friends preped, admiring my collection of ships ive acquired, and just vibing overall. Hello Games hasn't made up for what they did in my opinion, they have surpassed it and are still going.

For reference, in that span of time I have: graduated high school, graduated college, worked four different jobs, had several relationships (some long-term), and much more. And guess what? They're still updating this game.\n\nI plan on playing this game for years to come, and I'm sure Hello Games will be hard at work on this game in those coming years.  Honestly, if they keep up at this rate, I'm excited to see the future state of the game.\n\nI didn't buy this game at launch, but the launch fiasco for this game will go down in gaming history as a mere blemish in comparison to what the game has become.  It really is the greatest comeback in gaming, and it sets a great precedent to come for the gaming industry.

It\u2019s indeed a never-ending, limitless entertainment, especially for people like me who love open worlds with lots of stuff to find or build. \nI also find it really cool to see the regular free DLCs being added.\n\nThe only complaint I have is on how the naming planets/star systems work. Initially you\u2019re very excited that you get to give a name to so much stuff and you believe all other players are going to find it, seeing your names on their galaxy maps. Turns out they get to see the unique names only if they click on specific star system for example. They won\u2019t see any unique names right after opening the galaxy map, they will only see the default names. You\u2019ll also see only the default names yourself unless you actually click on the star system you\u2019ve named. This isn\u2019t a huge deal as the game is so vast you quickly forget to care about this. Nevertheless in any multiplayer game which encourages to discover and name things I\u2019d expect it to capture them and consequently update the view for all online players, including myself. So I don\u2019t fully understand why I don\u2019t get to see my own names on galaxy map\u2026\n\nI still recommend the game very much though.

While I've always enjoyed playing it on a monitor, the transition to VR, specifically using the Varjo Aero headset and Valve Index Controllers, has transformed my gameplay experience profoundly.\n\nIn this brief review, I want to focus not on the technical aspects, but on the unique emotional journey VR offers. This became particularly apparent in the shift in my playstyle, which I noticed was not a conscious decision.\n\nImmersed in VR, my exploration of the game's universe has slowed down significantly.

You want to get the game, but you're simply held back by the \"wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle\" over-used trope aren't you? I'll tell you right now you should forget about it. This applies perfectly to something like Elite Dangerous, where all planets are basically empty balls of dust, but that's clearly not the case with No Man's Sky.\n\nSo, I don't want to write an objective review of the game with objective pros and cons. I simply want to tell you what I like and don't like about the game.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Very beautiful and atmospheric\n- A variety of planets with various compositions (minerals and flora to farm, depending what you need). Planets also have various dynamic effects such as fire storms, acidic rains, blizzards, and chemical storms, for which you require additional protection. You get additional minerals and rare substances like storm crystals, if you venture out during these storms.\n- An amazing variety of ships of different classes, looks, and roles\n- An astounding variety of gun systems and upgrades for them. Including illegal ones which you can purchase in Outlaw systems\n- You can develop good terms with one faction, several, all, or go full pirate and f**k everything up\n- Dynamic events. Pulse driving into a distant system can throw you into the middle of a pirate dreadnought attacking a civilian freighter. You can destroy the dreadnought (which will take time, is very dangerous, and requires a good ship), disable it, dock, and make it yours, or simply ignore it if it's too much for you\n- You can build bases on whatever planet you choose and build them the way you like them. I've built mine on a planet with chemical storms, because I can farm storm crystals during the storms.\n- You can travel through wormholes millions of lightyears into another corner of the universe to discover planets and systems that will carry your name from that point on\n- The entire universe is lively and populated, which I didn't like at first, but I actually love now because there's always something to do\n- You can find derelict freighters overwhelmed by some parasitic alien species living in some type of cocoons. You can enter them to collect high-value loot, but watch your steps. Moving too fast risks bursting the cocoons. \n- You can summon the Anomaly to join more difficult expeditions for greater loot, or take missions that other players can join in\n\nCons:\n\n- The sentinels are a bit annoying.

No man\u2019s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It\u2019s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography\u2026\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we\u2019ve gotten. If No Man\u2019s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man\u2019s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was.

When this launched it was, as one commentator put it, \"wide as an ocean, but shallow as a puddle.\" But Hello Games did something remarkable: instead of devolving into pay-to-win bullsh*t like we have seen time and time again, they sat back down, got to work, and have spent nearly five years releasing free update after free update, transforming the game in such a way it makes the launch build look like an early access beta.\n\nWant to be an explorer and just find as many planets as possible? Go for it. Want to be a space pirate and just steal all the stuff you need instead? Go ahead. Want to stick to just a few planets and build a mega industrial complex that prints more money than 1920's Germany, then realise that you're way in over your head and need to build a money farm just to build your money farm? Have fun. And if any of this is too boring alone, toss down a portal and invite your friends to play. \n\nIf you bought this back at launch and felt like it was boring or shallow, I say to you, give it another go.

The lore is incredible. \n\n\nThis is the game i always dreamed of, and i imagine the game sean and the team originally thought up in their caffeine fueled manic state. \n\nAnd, they are constantly updating it with major content additions. \n\nFor free.\n\nNo loot boxes\n\nNo dlc\n\nFree. \n\nFor anyone asking \"should i give NMS another chance?\" The answer is hell yes, DO IT NOW. \n\nFor anyone seeing this game for the first time, prepare for something very, very special.", "timestamp_created": 1622314246, "timestamp_updated": 1622314246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2223, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.976017534732818604", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102788952": {"recommendationid": "102788952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285929662", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2506, "last_played": 1709687074}, "language": "english", "review": "the best gaming redemption arc I have ever witnessed.", "timestamp_created": 1636918028, "timestamp_updated": 1636918028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1444, "votes_funny": 85, "weighted_vote_score": "0.975493848323822021", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80426061": {"recommendationid": "80426061", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980542440", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1060, "last_played": 1690669951}, "language": "english", "review": "- Game is complete trash at launch\n- People leave bad reviews and leave game\n- Despite this, the devs stick with the game and keep putting out updates\n- Game is now much better than they ever advertised before launch\n\nWorth a buy\n", "timestamp_created": 1606418628, "timestamp_updated": 1606418628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2094, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.975439667701721191", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134320927": {"recommendationid": "134320927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881308135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 25916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6629, "last_played": 1680836291}, "language": "english", "review": "\nI can't believe they kept working on it after launch.\nI can't believe they didn't just take the money and run.\nI can't believe they righted their wrongs.\nI can't believe they delivered on their promises.\nI can't believe they unsunk the sinking ship.\nI can't believe this game is finally worth the money.", "timestamp_created": 1678316224, "timestamp_updated": 1678316224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2476, "votes_funny": 77, "weighted_vote_score": "0.975274205207824707", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60545967": {"recommendationid": "60545967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032100627", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 29926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23285, "last_played": 1665355462}, "language": "english", "review": "A game with real heart from a team who never ever gave up.

I got the controls down before I took off from where my last save was at. Went to a space station, tried to deter myself from using the teleporter to my home planet but inevitably I was drawn to seeing our Paradise Islands again and if it'd changed over the updates at all. When I arrived home, I went outside to check out the surroundings, jetpacked on top of the facility we built and all I see is a massive rainbow spanning from one side of the horizon to the other.

I wasn't outraged, as so many were, but it seemed like a great example of over-promising and under-delivering. I played enough to get bored with the mechanics, marveled a bit at the color and scope of the worlds while being frustrated with the mechanics, and blundered around without a very well-defined tutorial path. Then I went on to other things instead.\n\nFour years later, all of the good things about NMS have been retained and improved, all of the bad things have been resolved, and features I never even hoped for have been added. The dev team has been responsive, engaged and imaginative. It would have been understandable for Hello Games to fold up, after an Icarus story so painfully acted out, but instead they doubled down on their commitments and have turned No Man's Sky into a genuinely wonderful gaming experience.\n\nI honestly cannot say enough positive things about it. It is a shining example of how game development can work when driven by a team that wants to do the absolute best they can for their audience, delivering content-filled updates regularly without asking a penny more than the original cost of the game.

You can do that. I have spent hours just looking for the best crashed ships that I can nab for free. It is like a galactic treasure hunt to find (and then upgrade) the most beautiful rides until you have a collection that Jay Leno would be envious of.  \n\nOr maybe you dream of building the most luxurious, extensive, elaborate and just plain kick-ass base (or twenty of them) that anyone in this reality has ever seen? You can do that. In fact, you can build one that reaches into the sky, is underground, is under the oceans, on top of a mountain with a gorgeous view. And if you build more than one, you can travel to all of your vast real estate holdings in the blink of an eye thanks to the magic of portals. \n\nOr maybe ships and bases aren't your thing and you just want to become a tycoon with the most extensive collection of mining operations in the galaxies? You can do that too. Or maybe you just want to become a trader who becomes a billionaire by travelling between the different systems buying low and selling high. You can do that. Or maybe you want to become a billionaire but are also a bit of a treasure hunter? You can locate and sell historic artifacts, old bones, ancient tech. \n\nThere is just so much to do in this big, beautiful game that you can just follow your whim and do what you want.

Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side.

Now repeat that over and over again.\n\nWorse yet, if you're like me and die in the water (yes, the pirates will even kill you while you're deep under water), you have to swim out to get your stuff again. Now, while you're on your way to or from your gravestone, grabbing your lost equipment, there just might be (probably will be) another group of pirates who come and kill you again. \n\nIt's relentless, and each time you're killed, something in your inventory gets damaged, so you have to worry about that now, too.\n\nNot a fun thing. It might be more fun if the frequency were dialed down a bit.\n\nThis game had a disastrous launch.

The developers being absolute chads is reason enough for me. let me give you the timeline of updates so you can make your own opinion though.\n\nThe Foundation Update - November 2016\nNow you can build a base on planets and farm resources from them as well as a plethera of other things you can use to make a base that really fits your needs and looks good while you're at it. \n\nThe Pathfinder Update - March 2017\nNow you can build underground garages in those bases and drive a whole fleet of vehicles around the planet for easy access to places starships can't get to. And it also looks bad-ass.\n\nThe Atlas Rises Update - August 2017\nNow instead of aimlessly wandering around the galaxy you can follow a storyline that will simultaneously show you the intricacies of the game, and peak your curiosity. 8/10 story overall for me.\n\nNo Mans Sky Next Update - July 2018\nPossibly the biggest update the game ever received. This update turned the lonesome singleplayer experience into a full co-op. The greatest thing? It's all optional. When in-game, simply go to settings and find the Network section, there you can toggle all multiplayer actions, and you can even disable the multiplayer entirely. Just watch out for endgame players suddenly giving you overpowered items, or trolls giving you trash items for fun. There isn't a way to toggle other players \"gifting\" you things yet, but we hope this will be a feature soon.\n\nThe Abyss Update - October 2018\nOne of my personal favorites. This update adds entire oceans to the game, and even some planets that are one big ocean. This also added a whole plethera of marine plants and animals, and underwater ruins sometimes filled with, ahem, ABYSSAL HORRORS. The game calls them that, and I fully agree. \n\nThe Visions Update - November 2018\nThis update added a huge variety to the planets of the galaxy. It added new trees, plants and flowers, new minerals, and rock formations, new animals to roam those new lands, and rainbows and exotic trophies to hunt down inside these new environments. It also added ancient bones you could dig up and buried scrap you could salvage. As well as new community missions that helped people earn rewards as a group.\n\nNo Mans Sky Beyond - August 2019\nThis update worked to expand the variety in the settlements and space stations, as well as improving the Nexus Hub (The social hub for players to interact). This update also added VR support to the game. While it does take a beefy pc to run VR well, and there is still no left-handed support, the experience of a space battle in VR, exploring a planet in VR, and talking with other people in VR is quite the unique experience.\n\nThe Synthesis Update - November 2019\nThis was another quality of life update, improving upon many different aspects of the game. To list the major things, an improved Star Map on your spaceship, ways to upgrade your starship, ways to scrap uneeded starships, improvements to the Terrain Manipulator (The tool used for digging and moving the ground), and a way to save outfits for character customization. As well as many other smaller improvements,\n\nThe Living Ship Update - February 2020\nAs the name might suggest, this update added a freaking M E A T S H I P. You get it by doing a questline in which you hatch a mysterious egg. And yeah, it's a little gross to look around the inside of the cockpit. This update also added many new space encounters (One of my favorite parts of the game). Now you can find weird space creatures, destroyed starships, and even trader ships or another pilot who needs some help. \n\nThe Exo Mech Update - April 2020\nA pretty small update really. It added a new vehicle to walk around planets in: the Exo Mech. The Exo Mech is pretty cool and very useful for a lot of different things. It also improved the system of other Exocraft vehicles, and added a Orbital Exocraft Materializer, which allows you to take your Exocraft with you on your giant spaceship.\n\nThe Crossplay Update - June 2020\nAnother smaller update. This update added crossplay, a new in-game text chat, and a friending system to easily meet with your friends. Besides some other small tweaks nothing else was added.\n\n(You can kinda tell that 2020 hit the Devs hard because of how much smaller the updates got. Don't worry though, they didn't give up on the game.)\n\nThe DESOLATION Update - July 2020\nAnother one of my personal favorites. Did you ever wonder if No Mans Sky could be a horror game? Well, now you can find giant derelict freighters that are filled with gross flesh bugs that will shoot E Y E L A S E R S. Oh, and your life support and hazard protection are dropping fast so you have to collect little packets along the way and huddle next to heaters to not freeze to death. This update also added numerous lighting improvements and added ways to customize and upgrade your Freighter.\n\nThe No Mans Sky Origins Update - September 2020\nNo, I don't know why some updates have NMS in the name and some don't, ask the devs. Anyways, this update overhauled planets again, adding new biomes, hazards, buildings settlements, and some pretty major bug fixes  too. Just a nice little variety update.\n\nThe Halloween 2020 Update - December 2023... No, obviously it's October 2020. (Idiot)\nThis update is another creepy one. It improved the derelict Freighters you could find, and it added Tainted Metal. Tainted Metal is a rare resource found during derelict Freighter excursions, you can use Tainted Metal to buy all sorts of spooky cosmetics and decorations for your base. You can even get your hands on a M E A T H E L M E T. nice.\n\nThe Next Generation Update - Also October 2020\nThis update focused on improving the game for console players. (Masterace Forever). It gave the game much better performance on consoles and also increased the max group size of multiplayer to 32. Don't expect it to load very fast though.\n\nThe Companions Update - February 2021\nThis update is yet another of my personal favorites. This update added the ability to tame and train creatures. You could tame a wild animal of your liking, and generation after generation manipulate the eggs to improve and alter your creatures. Now people can walk around with their 50th Generation Mr. Bubbles the space tiger and ride them at 100000000 mph. A very wholesome little update :)\n\nThe Expeditions Update - March 2021\nThis was a very unique update. Not only did it include many important improvements and tweaks, this update also gave rise to the Expeditions. Expeditions are limited time voyages a player can complete for permanent cosmetic rewards. The First expeditions final reward, for example, was the spaceship Golden Vector. An S-tier ship made of solid gold, and a pretty sleek design. Once you were awarded a cosmetic or even useful reward, you could visit a Quicksilver Merchant in the Nexus Hub to collect the reward on all other saves on your account. new and old. Many updates afterward featured unique Expeditions to showcase the new content.\n\nThe Prisms Update - June 2021\nThis update is pretty simple. They improved the visuals of the game. Space is pretty.\n\nThe Frontiers Update - September 2021\nThis is a pretty big update. they added new settlements that you could manage and build up. Not like your puny little base, these are big towns with citizens and everything. Now you can settle disputes between your colonists, approve and oversee construction of new buildings, and improve the infrastructure of your colony so you can start making credits by the millions.\nThe update also came with many improvements to your own base building capabilities, and some quality of life changes, including more save slots.\n \nWelp, I've hit the cap for reviews.

I grinded out most everything. I have fully explored several planets, maxed out inventories and travelled accross countless star systems. I spent hours simply building up language database. Do you know what i have to show for it? Nothing. it was a waste of time.\n\nTo be clear, this is a beautiful looking game, with lot's of hope and wonder, that leads to absolutely nothing. I spent hours building up resources and inventories and amassing fortunes. With nothing to do with it. All that time spent learning languages, and there was no point. Anything important story-wise, is in common language. I had much hope, waiting for something to happen. It didn't. You build random items and fuels, but that's it. You can only move from one place to another, and very little changes. Buildings are virtually identical and evenly distributed on EVERY planet. You can spot them and know exactly what they are, and what they will contain. They are unbelieveably generic. Every NPC is the same. I spent hours learning languages of a particular race. 20+ building oup relations of 1 of the 3 races, so much so i was able to decipher almost the entire language in every dialogue. Do you know what I discovered? That it didn't matter. As soon as I discovered the 2nd race, it didn't matter that I didn't know a single word. They were identical. Sure they looked different a little, but every interaction was identical. There is no point to any of the languages, they amount to nothing at all. By the time you get enough to start deciphering the exact words, what they have to say is entirely useless anyway. Did you like that outpost you were at? Too bad, you'll never find it again because navigation is terrible. But don't worry, it doesn't matter because there is another outpost that is identical, just jump in your ship and fly in any direction for less than a minute and you'll find the same damn place with a different name.\n\nThis game was like the ending of the TV Show \"Lost\", lots of buildup for a complete let down. Accumulate for no reason, talk for no reason, explore for no reason. I like a grind, but you don't even have anything to show for it. You'll never go back to wherever you were, and you'll never be able to share what you find with another human being. Cool, on this planet I'm going to name everything after memes. cool. What's the point? I'll never see that planet again when i leave for the next one. I gave this game far too much of a chance, and too much of my time. Go play minecraft, at least here you can build something. Play an MMO, at least there you can talk to someone. Go play a game with any form of campaign, at least you'll get a story. NMS is like all those games, without the things that make them great. No story, no meaningful building, no social. This feels entirely like an MMO that is empty.

There's a lot to enjoy now, but there are some things I feel I need to mention to gamers like me who are reconsidering this title in 2020.\n\nFirst, the good news. There is a fair amount of gameplay variety these days: running missions, space combat, building a base, and upgrading your equipment. And yes, you can now do all these things with your friends -- the game supports co-op sessions with up to 4 people.\n\nHowever, the game is still, at its core, a single-player experience focused on exploring new planets and scanning alien life forms. And unfortunately, most of the other features feel like an afterthought by comparison. Some examples:\n\n- Your progress is saved locally. If the game crashes (and it will), you will lose your progress. This is very confusing in a game that portrays itself as a persistent open world adventure.\n\n- Your base is saved locally, and uploaded to the server periodically. If the game crashes, there is potential for major conflicts, such as two copies of your base being stacked on top of one another, which leads to permission issues and the inability to remove the old copy. Extremely frustrating. The problems compound when you try to build a base with a friend. In our squad, this was easily the most disappointing part of the game.\n\n- Because of the local saving, it is very easy to edit your save file to load unlimited supplies and equipment. The server does NOT verify your inventory.\n\n- There is no resource scarcity. In a game about finding and collecting resources, this feels very odd. Once you get past a certain threshold of \"units\" (the in-game currency), you can easily purchase huge quantities of items on the market, or buy a new ship to shoot NPCs with impunity. The challenge factor goes way down at that point, and consequently so does the fun.\n\n- For all the development effort that has gone into the game of late, there seems to have been a severe lack of QA. The game crashes A LOT. Bugs abound; some are hilarious, some are infuriating.\n\nThat being said, this can still be a fun game to put 30-40 hours into with your friends. Save often. Upload your base any time you make even the smallest change. Warp throughout the galaxy, check out new planets, and marvel at the visually-impressive worlds and curious alien life forms you'll encounter.\n\nBase building is not as good as Rust. Space combat is not as good as Elite Dangerous. The market is not player-driven as it is in EVE. The gunplay is subpar by any measure.\n\nBut No Man's Sky does all these things _pretty decently_, and the result is a fun romp around the galaxy.\n\n[b]6/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1588876811, "timestamp_updated": 1588876811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 486, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.950632095336914063", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117954519": {"recommendationid": "117954519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041312774", "num_games_owned": 839, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 18221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3607, "last_played": 1708421169}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the game for 877 minutes in one sitting and came to the conclusion that this game is alright.", "timestamp_created": 1656623784, "timestamp_updated": 1656623784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1027, "votes_funny": 413, "weighted_vote_score": "0.950187981128692627", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145033676": {"recommendationid": "145033676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045298305", "num_games_owned": 4561, "num_reviews": 244, "playtime_forever": 1064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1064, "last_played": 1687123226}, "language": "english", "review": "Its amazing how far Hello Games has taken this from the terrible release to a glorious new beginning, every developer should strive to be like Hello Games!\n\n\nTruly the greatest PC redemption arc ever seen", "timestamp_created": 1693024569, "timestamp_updated": 1693710244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 748, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.950085818767547607", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70104192": {"recommendationid": "70104192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154380891", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "playtime_at_review": 2430, "last_played": 1713297332}, "language": "english", "review": "No Man's Sky used to be overrated and is now underrated, this game is one of the most tragic stories of any videogame that ever existed.

So many things to do with no time limit as to when they need to get done. When I see something shiny and end up spending hours fixating on it just to remember that I was doing something when I saw that, the other thing is still just sitting there waiting for me. \n\nIn general there is something for everyone in this game. If you're a pack rat, you can gather to and inventory manage all you want. Are you a collector? Hunt down the coolest, rarest ships to add to your collection (12 slot limit). Are you into the stock market? You can buy low and sell high with the trade mechanic. Want to learn every language? Fly from station to station asking the lifeforms to teach you their language until you uncover all their words. Each group of aliens has a back story that can be learned going through the main quest.\n\nThough the game is vast and packed with interesting things to do; it is not without it's flaws. On PC (at least), I often find that, after a while of playing the graphics just stop rendering. Everything gets a little blurry and details just stop showing. The only way to fix the graphics issue I've found is to completely reboot the game. (This issue has since been patched and is now working correctly.)\n\nWith the new update, the ramp up to combat makes it difficult to do anything that involves getting out of your freighter or leaving a space station. Pirates attack non-stop! In the air, on the ground, if you're in your ship or not, you can expect an attack from pirates. If you happen to hit a sentinel in the process now you have pirates and sentinel after you. These fights take up way too much time and for someone just trying to survey the lands or build a new base it can be very frustrating. (This issue has since been patched and is now working/ Could still use some fine tuning, but is not unbearable any longer.)\n\nThe multiplayer mechanic could use some love. My game group and I have found that when we are all in the same game issues can arise. The space station will show that all the ships that come in belong to one person in the group. Traveling together in one freighter can cause falling through the map with an inability to get back in generally resulting in death or a need to restart their game. (We have been able to jump to another system and get one back into the ship with some jump run antics). Solid walls will not show for the guest. If they happen to go snooping they will get stuck inside the the structure with no way out and yep you guessed it a restart will be required. (this issue continues to need a lot of love).\n\nI've found when building (especially large structures) the game has an issue remembering what you just did. Decided to change the color of a whole wall? The game will only remember some of the panels you changed. Need to fill a hole back in, It will only save some of what you filled in. I find myself doing things over and over until it remembers. You'll want to carry around a save spot and save often. ( I am not seeing this happen as often. I think the graphics rendering bug fix may have helped here as well.)\n\nThere is currently a bug that causes the settlement prompt to trigger over and over every time you step foot on a new planet if you don't already have a settlement. While this loop is happening it is difficult to complete tasks. It sometimes even stops you from getting back into your ship. If you happen to be attacked during this loop, you would be screwed. The only way to get rid of the loop is to become the overseer of a settlement. If this is not something that interests you, oh well you now own a settlement. (As I now have a settlement, I am not sure if this one has been fixed. if someone in the comments could confirm or deny?)\n\nAll in all, I love this game and find myself coming back to it over and over. I enjoy building and love that gravity is not an issue allowing for really neat builds. I easily get lost in a build. With so many material options, colors, and decorations, I can lose a few days on one build (go big or go home). No Mans Sky would be a perfect game in my eyes if they fixed the issues mentioned above.\n\nMy favorite thing is finding new systems that no one has been to and renaming everything. If you are the first to discover, the game allows you to rename the system, planets, flora, fauna and minerals. You are also able to rename every ship you acquire along with your freighter, multi-tools, exocrafts, and pets.\n\nI personally have not done an expedition and so have no opinion on that.

The moons don't even go around the planets.\n\nAll of the various wonders of the universe (neutron stars, supernovas, pulsars, etc) are entirely absent. There are no stars, they're just part of the skybox but you can't fly to them.\n\nThe 18 quintillion planets that was so heavily marketed isn't impressive when you realize what that actually means: if you took 11 things and come up with 50 variations for each, that is close to 18 quintillion combinations. Most planets are entirely the same but with different bumps and colors, they have the same objects on them and largely the same resources. Once you've seen the first dozen planets, you've seen them all.\n\nYou don't have a sense of scope/scale to your journey. In the galactic map you can see other stars but there's no sense of where you are in relation to the center of the universe. Likewise you don't have a way to track where you were. No mapping or history, waypoints or other ways of tracking your progress. \n\nThe only way to travel between systems is to open up the map and click warp, which initiates a loading screen animation and loads up the new planets. There is no deep space. You feel like you're in an instance with 3 or 4 planets that are mostly the same, then you load up a new skybox with a new set of similar planets. It's nothing like say Space Engine, where you actually do get a true sense that you're in a real universe.\n\nYou can't manually land your ship, you simply press a button for it to autoland. Tons of other maneuvers (like entering a space station) are entirely autopilot. The asteroids which are everywhere have insane pop-in issues, they only show up like 50 meters in front of you.\n\nThe freight ships don't move, they just sit there passively forever. They add zero gameplay depth.\n\nThe space stations are all basically the same.\n\nThe planets are littered with outposts, all identical and with a single NPC alien standing still and staring into the wall.\n\nThe NPCs are entirely shallow, there is literally no point to even talking to them since they never say anything interesting and simply give you something random you likely don't need. Even the automated quest giving NPCs in Bethesda games that hand out those Radiant AI quests would be a massive improvement.\n\nAll of the monoliths are the same, it's nothing but a chore to chase them down. The words you learn don't add any depth to your interactions with the aliens, since they never have anything interesting to say anyway.\n\nThe animals are built on 14 different skeleton designs, with a bunch of random animal parts scrapped on top of each section to maximize the number of permutations and there is no attempt to make the animal make any sense in it's environment or have anything unique in it's behavior. The animals have no evolutionary history and their behavior is incredibly shallow.\n\nThere are no tall trees like were shown in E3, they're all saplings. There are no large forests, no large creatures. There are no large valleys, huge mountain peaks, no giant volcanos, all terrain is uniformly similar across planets.\n\nThe grinding which makes up most of the game is not only boring, but frustrating due to the completely messed up inventory management.\n\nThe interface is atrocious. It's amazing that it can be messed up this bad, the fact that we need a mod just to remove the requirement that you must hold each click for a second speaks volumes. \n\nYou need to load up a menu to do anything, and the menus are terribly designed and completely unintuitive.\n\nThe game is a technical mess. It looks like \u2665 yet runs with all sorts of framerate issues.\n\nIt fails as a survival game since nothing in the game leaves you threatened. Each planet is seeded with abundant resources, and the few things that do attack you are easily defeated. Compare to minecraft where there's a very definite risk / reward system to exploring a deep cave system. Nothing really threatens you in a meaningful way.\n\nThe different minerals and resources don't really matter. Since most of the upgrades to explore the universe are yours within the first hour / two hours all the rest are kind of nice add ons.\n\nThere's no challenge to exploring. There's very little combat and what combat there is very boring.\n\nAll planets are accessible right from the start of the game. I was excited about the idea of acid planets, radioactive planets, cold planets ... I was thinking that to explore a radioactive planet you'd need to craft some special gear. There was a pretty obvious gameplay loop where the dangerous planets had better minerals/ruins/whatever but were very hard to explore. Instead every planet is basically just a copy of the others.\n\nThe constant need to recharge things, which don't really serve a purpose. It makes the game very grindy without any positive feedback. Instead of feeling free to explore the world around me I feel annoyed that if I see something cool it means 30 seconds of tedium while I mine the abundant plutonium. I end up not landing and exploring because of how annoying it is that to take off again I must enter a menu and recharge my ship.\n\nNone of the aliens interact with each other or have any sort of AI other than 'walk around a bit'. \n\nThere's nothing to sit and watch. An occasional ship will fly overhead but they don't do anything. You never really see a battle take place or the ships acting in any sort of interesting manner.\n\nUpdate 2019: redacted previous points above that I thought were updated, most points are still disappointingly true. There have been add-ons like the buggies for getting around faster, base building, multiplayer (which was a promised feature from the beginning but whatever) and a few updates to the resource/crafting tree as well as a story. But the reality is that it's just a new coat of paint on a big turd. \n\nI tried to continue from my old save file and all of my blueprints, technologies, some resources, etc. were all gone and replaced with a module called \u201cobsolete technology.\u201d Apparently I saved in a completely dead system cause none of the planets had anything other than sentinels and animals. No beacons, crashed ships, and incredibly scarce resources. Now I didn't have any warp cells nor the ability to craft any to escape this dead system, I couldn't even craft the visor to locate the anomaly the game constantly was telling me to go to. I asked reddit and others for help but was told that now there\u2019s just dead systems from the update and I should just start anew. I started up a new file and threw my ship, now useless multitool, and maxed out exosuit away. So much grinding for nothing. \n\nTurns out the only thing that makes this game challenging is the lack of upgrades, blueprints, technologies because without them grinding for materials to craft upgrades, blueprints, and technologies is super slow. They pretty much just added intermediary steps to the crafting tree (now you must refine the carbon by crafting a refiner and then finding fuel for the refiner). The added story is about as deep and interesting as mining materials. The story progresses by errand running on a galactic scale to the point that the \"characters\u201d which send you on the errands make less and less sense. Somehow the ship controls are worse and make shooting other ships very frustrating. The only challenging part of space dogfights is the ship controls.\n\nThere\u2019s still bugs too, a lot. You can fall through the floor of a planet or have your ship spawn under the floor, the game will crash randomly, put down a refiner and then not be able to pick it back up again or its contents.\n\nBut every 100 or so planets you visit will be pretty.\n\nWith such lack of depth and poor execution Hello Games is criminal to charge more than $10.", "timestamp_created": 1472060964, "timestamp_updated": 1563844664, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3694, "votes_funny": 141, "weighted_vote_score": "0.947985529899597168", "comment_count": 221, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121032908": {"recommendationid": "121032908", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971314253", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 38887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17347, "last_played": 1710313432}, "language": "english", "review": "Kind of a bittersweet review.

And on top of that their \"Next Generation\" update is arriving soon. I'm astonished how they can keep making an already beautiful game look even better!\n\nControls. Absolutely 100% Simple. 2 hours in you'll master the quick menu as well.\n\nSound. This game is FILLED with ambient sounds, pair that with the relaxing music that overlaps it and you have the recipe for one relaxing game to take your mind off of things.\n\nDifficulty.

Pre-launch, No Man's Sky promised to be the game literally everybody dreams about. Touting quintillions of planets, each randomly generated and different from the last, with random creatures, plants, and geology. No Man's Sky was looking too good to be true, and that was absolutely the case at launch.\n\nNearly every feature advertised in the trailers, interviews, and pre-launch material was missing. Instead, there was a boring husk of a game, with boring planets and same-y fauna.\n\nThen there was the first major patch - Foundation. Foundation added basebuilding similar to subnautica, a survival mode, farming, freighters, and a whole host of quality of life improvements\n\nThen there was the second patch - Pathfinder. Pathfinder added vehicles, base sharing, permadeath mode, more starships, new shops, and even more content. The game was still early, but the groundwork was there.\n\nThe Atlas Rises update added a story mode, new planet types, missions and so much more. It fixed major issues with the UI and QOL improvements. It was shaping up to something\n\nThen there was NEXT. NEXT is the update that truly changed NMS for the better. Multiplayer, unlimited base building, community reasearch, third person mode, character customization, and so much more.\n\nThen came two smaller, but still substantial updates, Abyss and Visions. Abyss focused on improving undersea wildlife, and made the underwater sections of the game look beautiful. Visions added variation to planets, trophies, carniverous plants, and improved the visual fidelity.\n\nNo Man's Sky was a complete fucking failure at launch. But that's simply not the case any more. Hello Games has proven that it's possible to redeem something thought to be unredeemable. They made the biggest dissapointment of 2016 into a fully fleshed game, and it's only getting better with time.\n\nI don't think NMS is worth 60 dollars. Not yet.

This review is for the latest version after the Polestar and Endurance updates. Honestly, I feel like the devs have finally delivered on a lot of their promises. This is a fantastic game for those who like to explore and don't want to worry about combat as much.\n\nPros:\n- Infinite worlds to explore with an insane amount of randomness\n- The views in this game are stunning\n- Fairly seamless loading\n- Variety of ships, freighters, pets to collect\n- Easy combat if you just want to explore\n- Base building on planets works really good\n- Base building on freighter is very convenient but there are some bugs currently (bugged refiners)\n- Settlements are a fun addition and have potential\n- The game is relaxed\n\nCons\n- Still some major bugs that haven't been fixed for YEARS\n- Early game inventory, resource, money management can be a pain (I'm an inventory hoarder)\n- Combat has very little variety\n- Guild & race rankings don't do anything\n- The mission board system needs some work, better rewards, & bug fixes\n- Some things are time-locked for silly reasons (the living ship missions are the best example)\n- 99% of all dialog from NPCs & terminals is nonsense meant to drip-feed you \"lore\" through sentence fragments.  There isn't an easy way to skip dialog either.\n- The only \"unique\" NPCs exist on the Nexus. ALL other NPCs are clones and have the same personalities.\n\nOverall, I would say this is a great game but expect bugs. My 8-year-old daughter watches & plays this with me sometimes and really likes exploring and finding creatures.  The limited combat is easy and still rewarding.  The RNG variety of worlds / flora / fauna is mind-blowing.  If you are looking for an action-shooter THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU.

No Man's Sky is a sandbox, so that immediately may not appeal to everyone. It's literal endless space exploration in a procedurally generated galaxy, and is genuinely remarkable in that regard... and if that isn't enough once you've reached the centre, you get to go through another galaxy, and then another - in fact, over 255 'unique' galaxies.\n\nBUT... I personally found exploration is a pointless endeavour. Everything you'll see is a variation on what you've seen before. I've a mere 150 hours on NMS, a baby in comparison to other players, and I never saw anything truly 'unique' - I've watched many NMS videos, been on the NMS wiki, checked out coordinate sharing and read many NMS posts on reddit - and I've seen nothing that is absolutely honestly, and genuinely unique to go out and look for or find.\n\nThis is not exactly a criticism - NMS is a sandbox game as mentioned, akin to Minecraft, exploration is just one of many things you can do in a sort of 'fantastical' fashion, little is put in your way to explore -In NMS you get in your ship, fly across an alien landscape, then into space, visit a space station or jump to another system, or settle down on a planet and build a base... scan all the various lifeforms on the planet, every rock, every tree... if you want, or not. Whatever. Once you're ship is upgraded enough you can jump far and wide across the galaxy - jump through a black hole, use a portal to travel across the galaxy, or to the next / another galaxy - exploration is all very 'loose' like this - it's almost trivial where you are at any point in time.\n\nYou can make the game difficult, you can make it easy. There is a creative mode, there is a permadeath mode. I spent some time in VR mode and it's very well made, if a little difficult getting used to I generally stuck to pancake mode.\n\nThe base building toolkit the player gets is very comprehensive... possibly the best I've ever seen in a game, so many options, so much flexibility of where you can place stuff and build - the most unique place I came across where created bases by other players.\n\nSaying all this... I've still found NMS a good 'chillout' game - you can just log in, do some stuff, put it down and come back to it. It's a mixture of grind and not, because you never have to do anything to any timescale or reason. Only in permadeath did I focus on one objective to get to the centre of the galaxy and make the jump - purely to challenge myself.\n\nThe plot and story is just a loose set of waypoints with some text. The premise is mildly interesting, but not that engaging. Multiplayer is an afterthought, and personally I feel the game is better played alone, so you get the sense of loneliness you're meant to get while playing. The central 'hub' of the game can be an interesting place however, seeing other players ships and outfits.\n\nBut... now for the negative aspects of NMS....\n\nAll of my major gripes are interface related. I maintain a special place in hell is waiting for the inventor of 'Hold to confirm' actions and NMS is riddled with them. Every dialogue interface is rubbish clicking or throwing you out of conversation so you have to repeat it again. Purchasing items and getting thrown out of the store menu, so you have to reopen it. Using people or things 'twice' to achieve a goal etc. Not being able to turn off certain sounds (i.e 'units received', 'units received', 'units received') - to me all this stuff are lazy UI choices, no QoL thoughts at all, Hello Games total lack of awareness of their own games experience. Sure, NMS has come a long way, but it has a long way to go still.\n\nBasically for me, the interface is absolute hell. Putting the clicks and dialogue UI aside the rest it's console-ified, dumb, big blocks and I hate it so much. I can't say enough how much I actually hate it - and it took me quite a while to 'get over it' and get my head down and play this game... but once you get into a swing of some aspects of the game you enjoy, NMS can be a fulfilling and enjoyable experience.\n\nSo, if you can deal with bad UI and want a space-game sandbox to explore, NMS will deliver - but it's definitely not for everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1700045723, "timestamp_updated": 1700045723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 422, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.937958836555480957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78543921": {"recommendationid": "78543921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198989559732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 21182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14863, "last_played": 1642020696}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had my eye on No Man's Sky for the longest time but just couldn't get myself to buy it before because of all the bad press. I finally decided to jump in when the Origins update was launched and let me just say WOW!! While all the criticism when the game first launched back 2016 was probably well deserved, the state of the game as it is right now makes it seem like a completely different game. \n\nBefore you jump in as well though it's important to understand that the main focus of this game, at least in my opinion, is exploration. It's completely non-linear, you can play without ever touching the story quests and you'll get by just fine or you can decide to follow the story line to try to answer the questions regarding the creation of the universe. \n\nAmong the many, many things you can do, you could focus on creating the base of your dreams, colonizing a planet or if your ambitions are big enough you could also make en entire solar system your home. Maybe you're someone who likes to have nice things and you'll go hunting for the coolest ship, the strongest weapons, a kickass freighter or pimp out all of your vehicles You could have battles in space with your starship, become a space pirate and loot other freighters. You could dedicate yourself to farming resources for construction or trade, or maybe you're more into wildlife and wanna discover the most exotic, bizarre creature in the universe... the possibilities really are endless with this game and weather you go out and explore on your own or with friends, only you are in control of your fate in the universe.\n\nOne of the things that surprised me most about this game is the sheer size of it. You start out on a single planet that forms part of a single solar system with multiple planets/moons. That solar system is just one of possibly millions of like systems that form up a single galaxy... and as you may have imagined, that galaxy is just one of many galaxies, each with it's own cluster of millions of solar systems and practically infinite planets to explore. Of course due to limitation of technology after a while you'll start to notice some similarities between planets, but the developers work very hard to make sure that each system is different and unique in some way, shape or form.\n\nVisually this game is beautiful and the soundtrack, while not overly noticeable, sets a good mood for the game. The next-gen patch that was recently announced will only build up on that and we can expect to see another huge improvement to the aesthetics within each world. Some other things to look out for in the future are reworks to the cave systems and sub-aquatic worlds. While present in the game currently, they do leave a lot to be desired and I'm sure that the developers will expand on this in the near future. Hello Games may have had a rough start, but they're dedicated to make this game better and better, and I have high hopes that they will continue to build on this already great game.\n\nLong story short, I absolutely recommend this game. I understand that it may not be for everyone, but if any of the things I mentioned before seem to interest you then this game is definitely for you.

The game received 3 pretty big updates last year with a lot of new content. The community is huge and the most helpful, kind and well behaved... of basically all communities I know so far. Never have i received hate mail, was bullied with ingame mechanics, met a griefer or a cheater etc etc. Yes, there are people using glitches to duplicate items, trick the basebuilding system and stuff like that.
