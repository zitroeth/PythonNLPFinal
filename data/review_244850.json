The core gameplay is about building vehicles, and the systems involved with that are very engaging.  The physics have plenty of flaws, but are sufficient to make for a great experience problem solving vehicle design and piloting.  Learning the basics and achieving your first milestones is very rewarding.  The seamless nature of travel throughout the solar system is wonderful.  I'll never forget watching the planet shrink away from me the first time I flew off into space.\n\nBut here's where I get critical.  There is very little content outside of the building sandbox.  Once you understand the basics, the game is trivial.  There is very little survival aspect.  You need only supply yourself with electricity and oxygen, which is really easy to do.  There is very little in the way of violent threats in the vanilla game, and they're not really meaningful threats.  There isn't much reason to actually do the work of building a ship and traveling through space.  There aren't really any problems to solve or challenges to confront, without self-imposing them.  Once you understand the basics, you can essentially beat the game in a couple hours.\n\nStart on a planet, gather small amounts of a handful of resources that are easy to find and collect.  Slap some thrusters on a cockpit attached to a storage block.  Get up to space and collect a small amount of the couple resources that aren't available on planet.  You're done.  There's no *reason* to do anything else.  It's pure sandbox.\n\nHowever, the game has a thriving mod community which addresses this.  Delve into mods, and you can get hundreds, even thousands, of hours out of this game.  The engine and the vanilla sandbox are an incredible foundation for building actual gameplay on.  But the entire time you are enjoying this, you will be immensely frustrated by the dev's complete negligence in addressing low-hanging fruit issues with their game that hold back what the mod community is able to do to make their sandbox into an actual game.\n\nExamples:  \n\nThe community has done an incredible job introducing a meaningful presence of NPCs into the game.  Space battles are wildly impressive and fun.  But it seems to be really difficult to incorporate decent AI, such that if the NPCs attack your base, they don't start by crashing themselves into it.  There's mods that add new elements to the physics, such one that adds proper aerodynamics, which greatly improves the engineering aspect of the game, but completely breaks NPCs such that they will just repeatedly spawn and crash in an atmospheric environment.  And there are critically lacking capabilities of the engine to enable much interaction beyond NPCs just spawning and attacking you.\n\nOr there is the ability to mod in extra resources for the sake of adding a progression element to the game.  Have your basic resources that you can gather as normal in your starting scenario, but then modded resources out in the rest of the solar system that you can use to build more advanced components, giving you an actual reason to build a ship capable of interplanetary travel.  Potential for this to be incredibly fun multiplied further by the ability to add custom modded planets to your game, which are available plentifully on the workshop.  But the engine imposes an arbitrary limit on the number of voxel textures, and only leaves a very small number open for custom voxels.  So you'll spend those hours putting together a modded playthrough with a bunch of cool looking planets and custom resources, only to find that almost all of this custom stuff gets painted over with the basic stone texture.  You can't even find those modded ores because they blend in with the rest of the rock.  I sincerely doubt modern machines would be troubled by removing or raising this texture limit, but the community has been asking for it for years, and Keen won't do it.\n\nIt's truly beyond my understanding.  This... program... is sincerely really cool.  I just don't understand why Keen seems to *refuse* to put any effort into making it an actual game with meaningful things to do.  Or more importantly, to support a community that would really love to do it for them.  Even just raising the voxel texture limit would give me the ability, with the mods available on the workshop right now, to put together an experience 10x more interesting than I can right now.  But I don't think it's going to change.  It's a damn shame.  I can only hope that their upcoming VRage3 engine will release without some of these limitations.", "timestamp_created": 1707156392, "timestamp_updated": 1707156392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.882743537425994873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159291832": {"recommendationid": "159291832", "author": {"steamid": "76561199207283514", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "playtime_at_review": 1234, "last_played": 1713051983}, "language": "english", "review": "Spent 20 hours building a ship, then proceeded to immediately crash it into an asteroid", "timestamp_created": 1708908972, "timestamp_updated": 1708908972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 58, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863784551620483398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160740252": {"recommendationid": "160740252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422055250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5828, "last_played": 1712380434}, "language": "english", "review": "still dont know what the hell im doing when i build stuff, but the explosions afterwards always looks cool", "timestamp_created": 1710662652, "timestamp_updated": 1710662652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 38, "weighted_vote_score": "0.807832717895507813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159160275": {"recommendationid": "159160275", "author": {"steamid": "76561199150190190", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1421, "last_played": 1709344620}, "language": "english", "review": "built my 1st rover with just heavy frame,truck cockpit, 2 battery and 6 3x3 wheel \n\ntest drive....just to roll over down a cliff and die\n\n10/10 would do that again", "timestamp_created": 1708789643, "timestamp_updated": 1708789643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787446558475494385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161738541": {"recommendationid": "161738541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076807822", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 202151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1582, "playtime_at_review": 197664, "last_played": 1713015333}, "language": "english", "review": "Check out Splitsie on YouTube.

Multiplayer is probably good though.\n\nExplanation: \n\nI enjoy building and engineering, and those parts of game are good. The problem in single player is: no context. \n\n- I would love to create big battleship but there is no point in it, there is nothing to conquer that requires more firepower than small ship with barely any weapons. \n\n- I would love to create big mining and processing facility but again there is no point to it. There is nothing that requires that amount of resources. \n\n- Fortress with impenetrable defenses? To defend form\u2026 single drone or small space craft? You need only one cannon for that\u2026 \n\n- Same with trading and reputation system. Resources are plentiful and you can craft everything you need in single player so why bother trading? For getting good rep with factions you get 10% discount, lol, and this makes other factions hostile towards you. Why bother to do that? \n\n- Exploration? I've played scenario with 8 planets, and again, there is no point in exploring, no new resources, no new cosmetics, no quests, nothing. Everything you need is on asteroids.\n\n\nIf you don't mind that and like engineering than probably single player would be good for you. Multiplayer seems like lots of fun. \n\nBut if you want to play single and need some context or challenge to go on than this game is probably not for you. \n\nIf you played this and enjoyed the game, then I\u2019m happy you had great time and don\u2019t bother with this review.", "timestamp_created": 1712527635, "timestamp_updated": 1712530247, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759932756423950195", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158223074": {"recommendationid": "158223074", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979277265", "num_games_owned": 564, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 4676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4676, "last_played": 1466898912}, "language": "english", "review": "Any time I play this game, my brain shuts off and I lose 6 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1707824314, "timestamp_updated": 1707824314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751155734062194824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160942693": {"recommendationid": "160942693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025933578", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13186, "last_played": 1712031888}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy to play, difficult to master.

The game is really fun, however trying to play online is a troublesome experience. Even the official servers have a problem where when they restart (every 6 hours) they don't say anything, and you lose all progress 30 minutes prior to the restart.\n\nAlso, don't even try building underground. It works fine, up until you and your friends re load the world and everytime it takes more and more time to load, waiting as long as 20 minutes for it to stop streaming each time\n\nThere is also a huge lack of actual things to do, and since building underground or any sizeable ship just creates server lag for anyone near it, it doesn't leave you with much to do\n\n\nMe and my group of about 5 people, spent about a month and a half playing on a server for a week, and then the server just is slowly riddled with long load times, randomly losing ships, desyncing, crashing and more.\n\nWe also ended up just renting our own server, which was working great initially! However again, building underground even just a little bit creates a ton of issues, and it seems the longer the server is up, the more random bugs, player disconnects and more that happen. Essentially tricking you into investing a bunch of time into the game, only to be essentially unplayable.\n\nIts cool for spawning big stuff in on solo and crashing stuff though. It has its place, but you end up losing literally days and days of progress from super common bugs. Games like 7 days to die you can build underground no problem, never have any of these types of issues. Space Engineers is just sort of an empty game, which seems like they left it up to the modding community to add real content to the game\n\nThe developer certainly has put some effort into things, however it still seems like an early access game.

I have never been this engrossed in a game, and I have been gaming since Pong.\r\n\r\nI don't generally enjoy the combat in this game, I am more interested in building. My first game after the tutorials was Solar System Survival, where I started on one of the non-earthlike planets with a tiny pod to sustain me, and then gradually mined, built up my base, built a small grid mining ship, a couple rovers and finally a large grid ship that would take me to space, and then to the earth-like planet, where I would build a more permanent base and recover from my harrowing survival experience.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this so much I did it again, but after the second landing on earth I turned around and build a space base as well. Thinking I was done, I was reading about doing contracts, and found that it was possible to buy ships from NPC bases. So I put together a Atmos/Ion ship designed to fly while doing contracts, and pretty soon I have a collection of rovers and ships, and spent a lot of time ferrying these new vehicles from the other side of the planet to either my ground base or my space base.\r\n\r\nThen I was thinking, this game would be more fun if there was a way to find wrecked ships as I wandered around, and sure enough, I found an MES Wrecks mod that would spawn random wrecks. So I started a new survival game with this mod enabled, and got myself to earth with a few interesting rebuilt ships.\r\n\r\nThen I went back to my second game and enabled the mod, and proceeded to collect even more ships and rovers, fixing the wrecked vehicles I found along the way.\r\n\r\nFinally, I hit a point where I had so many ships clustered around my space base (more than 100), that the game started to lag, hence, break time.\r\n\r\nI love this game, it's amazing. So many different ways to play, different ways to build ships. I am not done yet, this I know, but I've got to play a few other games before I come back and figure out where my second space base is going to be.\r\n\r\nThe only cons (really minor cons):\r\n\r\nVery little character customization, I know these sort of games don't always have much of that, but it kind of lessens the immersion for me\r\n\r\nMost of the blocks can be painted, but a lot of the blocks that have uses other than armor also have yellow bits, I'd like to be able to change that yellow to something else. There might even be a mod for this, couldn't stop playing long enough to look it up.\r\n\r\nHIghly recommended.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1712108175, "timestamp_updated": 1712108175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558490574359893799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158441880": {"recommendationid": "158441880", "author": {"steamid": "76561199223328500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1688311570}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game.

finally got enough hours into this game to feel like doing a review is worthwhile so here goes.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nAt it's heart, I'd best describe SE as Minecraft in space with a touch of Garry's mod for physics fun.  I enjoy that sort of game, so it went on my watch list until the price point matched what I was willing to pay.  I bought SE a few years ago when it was much \"younger\" and had some issues that made playing frustrating.  There are still a few issues that need to be worked out (more on that later), but I think the dev team has done a great job of keeping it moving forward.  \n\n[h1]First things first:[/h1]  \nThere is no story, just you and vast space and exploration.  Some have said that this lack of story and the lack of any real \"end game\" type content takes away from the game and I can see where they are coming from.  If you're the type of person who gets bored just building things and you want to get to a point where things just work so you can go after bad guys, then this is probably not your type of game.  If you are the type of person who finds yourself annoyed at the story and such getting in the way of tinkering and seeing what you can do with what you have, then this is probably right up your alley.  I cannot stress enough that this game is very much multiplayer friendly.  If you can, play with others.  It's way more fun to work together on things.  It makes the accomplishments that much more awesome when you can show them off and have a laugh with friends when they fail miserably and possibly explosively.\n\n[h1]Getting started[/h1]\nGetting started, I'd recommend watching a few \"beginner's guide\" videos for this game.  A youtuber called \"Vechs\" has a really good set of videos that should do a good job of setting your expectations for your first play.   Here's the first one: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y825m51cCfA]Space Engineers Meteor Storm Survival Episode 01.[/url]  I would recommend starting in space as well.  I'll explain why later, but suffice it to say it's just easier to get the hang of things and in my humble opinion more fun.  Once again, I would also recommend playing with friends if you can.  The basic premise is very much like minecraft: Search for resources then build cool stuff.  In the beginning, you'll be building [strike]ugly[/strike] simple ships that will look much like the lego creations we all probably created as kids with the \"giant box of every lego piece in the house\" mishmash of mismatched parts.  Forgot a forward thruster? Just stick one on somewhere.  Need to go faster?  Slap some more thrusters on that baby.  And of that leads to the next section:\n\n[h1]Physics is fun.... most of the time[/h1]\nRemember when you stuck all those thrusters on your ship to make it go faster? In space .... only your wife/kids/friends will hear you scream [strike]obscenities[/strike] when you realize you won't be able to slow down fast enough to keep from plowing into the asteroid you were going to mine at full speed.  You. Will. Break. Everything.  Just accept it.  And honestly this is part of the game that I hated at first and later came to enjoy more than anything else.  The things you build are yours and as ugly as they may be, your iterative design process that yielded the \"Mine-o-saurus\" with 8 mining heads and just the right size to get inside asteroid caves was a long one.  When you crash it, it sucks.  But this is what I love about it.  More so than any other game I've played, I find myself playing rather conservatively sometimes with my \"favorite\" toys and I take care of them because I'm proud of how well they work and having to rebuild is kinda sad.  I like this \"attachment\" and I think it alters the gameplay in a way that almost fills the void where a story might go.  Now that being said there are ways to create blueprints and rebuild the ships you made more quickly, but I won't go into that here because it isn't always the best option and it is sometimes more trouble than it's worth.\n\n[h1]Space.... the only frontier that you'll enjoy[/h1]\nI say this jokingly, but if I had started playing on a planet, this would probably be a very different review.  Gravity sucks and they haven't gotten the physics balance where it ought to be for good gameplay in my opinion.  Friction is a thing that, in space is not really a key factor.  On a planet, it's everything because any rolling vehicle needs it and it just doesn't work well.  Collisions cause damage, duh, right?  But what if every little bump and bounce your little dune buggy hits causes damage?  It does.  We gave up on rolling vehicles after having more than one explode for seemingly no reason.  As of this writing, wheeled vehicles are just useless except on perfectly flat terrain and that's not really much fun.  Gravity makes building flying devices, arguably the greatest portion of gameplay in SE, more difficult and keeping them in one piece almost impossible.  Landing without crashing, even with a good design, is very difficult. It's weird... space is far more forgiving in this aspect.  You can leave a ship parked in one place with just some thrusters and a gyro and it will stay there, but in gravity, you are constantly using fuel to keep your ship in the air and even more to keep it upright and level.  These two facts make mining on planet an arduous task compared to in space.  We killed more good equipment trying to make something that could mine ore without blowing up than I care to count.  All that being said, once you've got the hang of the game, give it a try... it's a huge challenge, but it isn't without rewards when you do get things working well enough to start to explore the planet a little more.  We even had fun starting on planet and basically working to get ourselves to space before we could start exploring the stars on one play through.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nSo where does this leave us?  \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Great Physics implementation (in space)\n[*]Completely open-ended building\n[*]Great cooperative multiplayer building\n[*]Challenging enough for plenty of replay value\n[*]Fairly well maintained\n[/list]\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]On-Planet Physics is not well implemented\n[*]No real story\n[*]Enemies are a nuisance at best and tiresome interruption at worst\n[/list]\n[b]You should give this a shot if:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]If you enjoyed minecraft and want a bit more challenge and better graphics with a space theme and more physics\n[*]If you enjoy building things in real life\n[*]if you are a meticulous kind of person who likes to design and re-design things for fun\n[/list]\n[b]You should probably pass on this if:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]If you want a space shooter\n[*]If you really enjoy having a story to go with your game\n[*]If you are an achievement sort of person who wants to get to \"the end\" and feel a sense of accomplishment (spoiler alert: there isn't one)\n[/list]\n\n\nI hope this helps make the buy/don't buy decision a little easier for someone.  \n-JMC", "timestamp_created": 1552088510, "timestamp_updated": 1574873437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1411, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.979690492153167725", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110427017": {"recommendationid": "110427017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311381981", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24948, "last_played": 1702512017}, "language": "english", "review": "One of those  games where u dont play for a month but then all of a suden u sink 100hrs into it within the span of a week", "timestamp_created": 1645108912, "timestamp_updated": 1645108912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1376, "votes_funny": 149, "weighted_vote_score": "0.977244138717651367", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98994982": {"recommendationid": "98994982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043539201", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 35364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31988, "last_played": 1691426556}, "language": "english", "review": "I am 75 and retired and yes...a gamer :0) I had been playing a lot of Valheim and what I loved most about that game was the building component.

You start in a ship, flying in the atmosphere of a planet, which you can't leave (because the ship only has atmospheric thrusters, which only work when an atmosphere exists), but you can fly around until you find the perfect landing spot. Once you get there, start scraping your ship to collect material to establish your first base. From there, the world's your oyster. Expand the base, make mining vehicles, explore the planet, set up outposts, ... And when you feel ready, make a rocket, and take off for the stars. If you're lucky, your rocket will be powerful enough for you to leave the planet's gravity well, and you'll be ready to make your first space station! Then of course, you will need a new space mining ship, a shuttle to get back and forth from planets and moons, a mothership to store your stuff and your ships, something to defend against pirates, ...

Implicitly, the evidence is there for some types of people (looking at you, Lego fanatics and Minecraft nuts!), but if you have an attention span that has allowed you to get this far, BUY THIS GAME! \n\nI can not remember a game I am so eager to starting up like SE, every time. Fair warning, the learning curve can be quite daunting (as many hours as I have logged, I'm STILL learning stuff!) and the build time, depending on settings, may take hours to months to build. However, when you hear that \"woosh\" sound from your Gyros kicking in, and the hum of those engines when your ship leaves the station for the first time, its all worth it. Everytime. There will be your fair share of \"WTF?! moments\" but they are character building experiences at this point relatively for me because this game runs amazingly well now compared to earlier versions of the product. Also, the SE groups I have come to know makes me think that SE is one of the least toxic environments I have ever played in for any length of time. 11/10 recommend\n\nOh yeah, and watch for Klang...\n\nLastly, Keen, Marek, and our amazing modding community: Thank you for all of your hard work This is the game I have waited my entire life to play! YOU ROCK!!!\n\nUPDATE 7/3/2022:\n\nThis game just keeps getting better like a fine wine! The love never goes away and the features keep improving! I have recently landed on an AMAZING MP server and decided to create a Boot Camp to help players get themselves up to speed. Eventually, I will stream our adventures! I would be honored if you joined us when the time comes! Let me know if this review brought you there!

My partner in crime placed the blocks. I welded them in place and splashed some paint on it all once the basic shape of it was finished. It was not large, but it was clean, functional, and designed with sophistication.  It was ours, and we had built it out from the tiny little square of space we had started with, turned it into our own little command post lodged in the side of an otherwise unnoteworthy asteroid.\n\nThe ships came first, though. Without the ships, there were no resources to build with. First was the mining ship. We equipped it with four sets of drills and my partner took it out on missions to gather more resources. He was gone, and so I built our second ship: a fast little cruiser made only to get from one place to the next or to scout out potential mining sites. We called it the Toad. And so we settled into a routine: I would take the Toad out and find a nice planet ready for excavation and he would go plow into it with the mining ship. We unloaded the materials. We assembled them into parts. We put those parts into the blocks he had put down. We toiled. We slaved. We built and built and built.\n\nAnd when it all was done? When everything was in place? What did we do then? Did we recline in our player base? Did we look out over the catwalk railing and say, \"Look what we have built from nothing. Admire our structure.\" Did we bask in the glory of a hard fifteen hours of work?\n\nNo. We planned. We created. We started on the true project, the beginning of our empire: the Mothership.\n\nIt was designed to be bigger than our entire station: two refineries of its own, three storage containers, twelve gigantic thrusters, enough room in the hangars to store both of our ships (and possibly more), several medical bays to respawn in\u2014and one ridiculously enormous ship. We placed the first block above our station. And then another and another, until the massive frame of it started to block out the light. It was a monolith to our own accomplishments, a totem of sheer ingenious design and willpower. Not a block was out of place, not a single reactor was missing.\n\nAnd then we ran out of resources. The frame was all done, but the blocks couldn't be finished without more steel plates. We need iron\u2014a lot of iron. So away my partner went! He climbed into the mining ship, steered it towards our latest excavation site and gunned the engines. He hit max speed. He piloted the ship around the end of the ghost-like frame of the Mothership. And then it happened\u2014the unthinkable: he ran out of fuel.\n\nPop Quiz: An object in motion . . . \n\nStays in motion. And he clipped it. He clipped the mother ship. Grazed right off of it and, with no way to stop the mining ship from moving forward, had to bail out of the ship before it carried him away to oblivion. There was a panicked rush to mount a rescue of our mining ship by using the Toad to chase after it so we could supply the mining ship with the fuel its reactor needed to activate the reverse thrusters and stop the ship.\n\nWe gathered the fuel. We undocked the ship. We prepared to launch. Then, with the slow, heart-pounding realization of a horror film, a shadow passed over the Toad.  We looked up at the Mothership, our entire view eclipsed by its awesome mass. We dropped our tools and stared in gut-twisting horror.\n\nThe whole thing.\n\nTilting.\n\nSpinning.\n\nMoving.\n\nCrashing.\n\nThis is what happens when you let normal people pretend like they're Space Engineers.", "timestamp_created": 1421106869, "timestamp_updated": 1421106869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 305, "votes_funny": 637, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932199478149414063", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "10022132": {"recommendationid": "10022132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058300124", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 9132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4807, "last_played": 1441096656}, "language": "english", "review": "I just had an epiphany. Yes I did. \n\nLet me explain.\n\nAll games I play I start on the hardest possible settings. I dislike easy mode because bad habits and the real intent of the developers never shines through. (The devs need to make games easy for some people because they're either time-poor or effort-poor and well, their money and wishes are just as important right?)\n\nAnd this does that. In SE, easy mode doesn't teach you anything. It's a \"Lego meet Asteroids\" style and some even called it for a \"Minecraft\" clone as a result. Add building block. Add another block, and another ad infinitum until you have spaceship. For me, it got boring quickly. It's called \"creative mode\"- just... build.\n\nAnd then there's survivor mode - on hard. Whoa!! I struggled for the first few hours. With little in the way of documentation and no real clue as to what to do, it took me over an hour to work out how to build a single block from the remains of a craft crashed into an asteroid.\n\nFirst there's survival. Have I got enough uranium for power? Should I turn on the gravity generator? How can I save energy until I can salvage enough to.... live?\n\nI need to mine. I NEED fuel. I can mine using my included hand drill but it's... messy. Slow. Trite. \n\nSo to mine I need a mining ship. To build a mining ship I need components. To make components I need an assembler. To use the assembler I need steel. I need glass. I need energy. \n\nAnd all I have is a drill. I have a grinder. I have a welder. And in my scenario, I have a ship I can salvage. \n\nPiece by piece with a grinder, all the while careful of my energy limit, my inventory. I need a refinery. The refinery is needed if salvage doesn't give me everything I need so I'll need raw material to convert to ingots, including uranium ore which I convert to processed uranium to fuel the reactor so I can do ALL these things.\n\nDo you see where this is going?\n\nTo build my mining ship I need a mining drill. To build the drill I need motors, steel etc. Some of these can be salvaged. Some have to be made. Every component needs to located, transported, linked and welded. EVERY component. You need a plan. A rough sketch on what you intend to build helps alot. It gives you purpose because time is of the essence. if you're not watching and run out of fuel you're.... dead. No energy means no refining of uranium ore to refuel. \n\nIt's a grind. And a weld. Yep. Grind and weld. Hour after hour floating in your pressure suit. Maybe you can leave the grav gen on and walk around, expending more of that precious reactor fuel. Who knows. The decisions you make determine what you build and how fast it's going to take.\n\nThe flying is... space like. There's 3 dimensions. There's gravity. There's velocity. There's death. There's no attitude indicators, sky markers, \"horizon\" indicators, compasses or such. \n\nFly too far, lose your bearings and home.... disappears. \n \nThere are no fixed paths or objectives (apart from survive). It's a sandbox. And a multiplayer sandbox at that. Go public, lose it all or go \"friends only\" and do the hard yards with mates to build the biggest dang skyship ever made. There's missiles, guns, turrets, fire and light. Death. There's explosions, broken platforms, busted ships.\n\nOr there's serenity and wonder as you quietly go about your mining ship construction. \n\nThe game caters for everybody from MP gung-ho blast'em players to SP anal-retentives with spreadsheets, CAD and a master plan.\n\nAt alpha, a lot of the options are not as intuitive as I'd like. The UI is a bit invasive and some work could be done here. The universe is.... grey. I'm sure some awesome nebulae would fit in great here and add appeal to the wonder of space.\n\nThere are glitches,  it's alpha as I write, but I've experienced no crashes. It's going to be good thing this Space Engineers and the devs seem happy to include...whatever people damn well please.\n\n7 hours went by in a single session. I'm only half through building my mining ship. I have no objective but to succeed. \n\nMy epiphany? What is success in SE?  \n\nIt's when I finish this ship, I'll mine, refine, transport and assemble another. It'll be bigger. It'll do more. The welding torch will blind my eyes as I drift in and out of the superstructure boundaries, my suit energy draining away.\n\nI'm fascinated.\n\nTHIS can only get better...\n\n9.5/10\ngg", "timestamp_created": 1399243435, "timestamp_updated": 1399353223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3348, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926703393459320068", "comment_count": 99, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18631898": {"recommendationid": "18631898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100786237", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 134220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70784, "last_played": 1708839071}, "language": "english", "review": "I couldn't recommend it more.

I usually take a fat pinch of salt when I see new 'build your own' style game comes come onto Steam too. Not in this case. Space Engineers has quickly earned a spot in my all time favorite PC games for its dynamic and engaging construction system and it's got one of the coolest looking destruction systems I've ever seen in a game like this. The devs have been keeping up with weekly updates since its launch and they're very involved with the community. As a matter of fact, player made content will be appearing as randomly spawned ships in the upcoming exploration patch.\n\nThe construction system is very simple, even familiar for most people I'm sure. It's like Minecraft, in that you're building pretty much everything out of blocks, but that's where the similarities end. Ships are made by sticking a power plant, cockpit, a couple gyroscopes and thrusters (In every direction by the way! Space has no gravity or atmosphere so your ship needs forward thrusters to slow down, etc), maybe a few weapon systems. Then you have to hook up conveyor pipes to most of those things to power them with resources and components you get from mining asteroids. Ships can be as big or as small as you like, the only real limit is how much your PC can handle. Everything from little scout fighters, mining ships, frigates, fighter carriers and even humongous titan-sized battleships can be built. Yes, you could even build your own Death Star, but you might have to wait a little while for a working Superlaser. Or you could just mod your own Superlaser into the game, because Space Engineers has a modding API and a fully fledged Steam Workshop page that's already crammed with all sorts of player created content.\nThere's also an integrated blueprints system (And a corresponding hologram projector for constructing saved blueprints from scratch) so you can save ships and carry them over to other servers/maps, or if the first ship you had gets destroyed and you want a replacement, you can just ctrl-v it into the game after selecting it from the blueprints menu. Very very handy.\n\nShips and stations crumple, tear and otherwise deform when they take damage, whether you're hosing them down with lead, setting off explosions or just smashing into eachother for fun. You can see the damage your ship takes over time as holes, scratches, dents and warping are modelled into most blocks. Even portions of your ship can be sheared off and cause extra damage as they free float in space, getting knocked around and causing even more havoc as they get caught on your ship and tear it apart from the inside if you're not careful. The same rules apply to your enemy too though. It's very exciting and sometimes anxiety-inducing, the way combat works.\n\nThere are two gameplay modes currently, survival and creative. Survival mode lets you build everything from scratch and assemble it together using the various ingame tools you're provided with. Everything needs to be constructed piece by piece and you're limited by how many resources you have and what kind of tools you have available. You can mount bigger and better drills, welders and grinders onto your ships after you acquire enough supplies.\nCreative mode is exactly what it sounds like; you have free reign to do whatever you like in the galaxy and everything is constructed instantly the second you place it down.\n\nA pretty solid multiplayer mode with player-created factions and servers was patched in a while ago. It even supports mods. I haven't spent a lot of time online aside from on my own private server I play with one or two friends on but there's practically no change between offline and online gameplay aside from some occasional connectivity and performance issues.\nThe multiplayer still needs quite a bit of polishing, as does the overall performance of the game, but so far it's come together very very nicely and I expect I'll put another fifty hours or so into the game before it's released.\n\nIf you're into Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Warhammer 40k or any other scifi genre, buy this game.

As sandboxes go, it doesn't have a lot of stuff happening for the player to respond to. There are a couple token NPC types, and some largely directionless NPC ships, but the game world overall feels rather lifeless. Thankfully there are a number of mods that address this, but the unmodded single-player world doesn't force the player to respond to it very much, apart from various resource and survival-related concerns. Expect single-player to be more of a contemplative experience that you take at your own pace, and in which you set your own goals. While I would definitely prefer there to be more active challenges that I'm forced to respond to, the gameplay that is there is still a lot of fun. No other game I've played has made designing and building my own base as enjoyable as Space Engineers.\n\nMultiplayer is obviously more engaging than single-player, the degree depending on the server you're on. I have played very little multiplayer myself, but friends I've talked to have described a range of server types, from hardcore PvP to private little servers focused around building things together. MP is much more stable than it used to be, but you should still be prepared for potentially frustrating bugs, particularly physics-related ones. That said, if I had time in real-life, I'd be active on a multiplayer server without hesitation, because the fun you can have outweighs the frustration.\n\nSpace Engineers' biggest feature has always been the physics system; just about anything can be moved, damaged, or destroyed by colliding with another object. No other game I've played provides this aspect, and it shapes just about every aspect of gameplay directly or indirectly. As the name indicates, the main challenge of Space Engineers is that of engineering solutions to problems, and the physics system is essential to giving the player problems that need to be solved.\n\nThis has been my biggest source of fun playing Space Engineers, because you can weaponize the physics system -- something that has led to a very entertaining and active \"arms race\" between various players trying to build better player-made weapons and defenses to them. The programmable block, which allows players to run scripts they've written in C#, allows this to be taken to its logical extreme.\n\nWhen a game reaches the point where players are building anti-missile-missiles, running guidance programs written by the players themselves, you know it has succeeded. I'm not sure at [i]what,[/i] but it's definitely some kind of success. ;)\n\nThe physics system has historically been the source of most of Space Engineers' worst bugs. Currently however it is vastly more stable than it used to be; while there are still some things the player can do to cause it to go crazy, by and large the game's physics make sense. I do wish Keen would simplify some aspects of the physics system further, to make gameplay easier even at the cost of realism, but the physics system these days is much more of an asset than a liability. And if I'm entirely honest with myself, I've never seen a game that uses physics that behaves perfectly realistically. Fans of Kerbal Space Program will understand.\n\nThis is a very brief review, and I'd like to properly do the game justice by writing an in-depth one later, but this will have to do for now. If you like voxel-building games, sci-fi stuff, and self-directed gameplay, you will probably like Space Engineers.\n\nI certainly do. :)", "timestamp_created": 1555049865, "timestamp_updated": 1555049865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 123, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900184929370880127", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70411549": {"recommendationid": "70411549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013308102", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 46729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21188, "last_played": 1678722190}, "language": "english", "review": "Space Engineers is an excellent game and a gift that keeps on giving.

If you're like me and gladly sink hours into building a complex spaceship to fly it into space, place satellites in orbit, make a mars roving vehicle or recreate the ISS you will love this game. That being said I STRONGLY recommend looking into mods (especially the ones I link under cons) as they compliment some of the more primitive or shoddy systems in the game. Especially the mod that adds real atmospheric/flight physics is a must have, since it makes building functional aircraft a real experience. The speed is normally locked to 100 m/s but this can be changed easily with mods without any real side effects.

The game is not perfect yet but this multiplayer update has set the stage for that.\n\nBefore the update I would not have recommended this game, it shines in the possibility of working together to build things with a team. Doing it solo is fun but without others to pose a threat or work together it can get tedious over time.\n\nA thing that is mind blowing is being able to walk on a moving ship/vehicle. Next is the physics and destruction. In this game you can actually rip a ship in half either by weapons, or by actually crashing through it. Seeing gaping holes in the side of a ship after a battle is an awesome site to see. Before the update walking on a moving ship in MP would result in your quick death due to sync issues. Now I can say it works as intended. It\u2019s amazing to be running around trying to get to a fighter to launch. Note another great thing, that fighter is not a prefab set item. It must be designed and built first and has the same physics and destruction as the ship around it. A cargo container breaks loose? Might bounce around the inside shredding up internal components. Decided to take your helmet off? Well that rocket that just punched a hole in the hull just sucked out all the O2 in the room. Like to mine? Well mining is all voxel, and the terrain deformation is great. Crash your ship expect a crater. Drop a bomb? Well the ground will be torn up too.\n\nNext is scale, when the game says planets, it means planets. There is no cheesy loading screen and the planet(s)/moons are massive. To give you an idea. It easily takes 30-40 mins to get around one. Now try to search the entire thing? Days of searching. While you search you may miss a base, why? Well it is because the player decided to build it underground and made tunnels.\n\nWhen you take this scale into account you can begin to imagine the limitations. Firstly this game takes a lot of processing power. It will push your graphics and CPU hard.  The RAM usage for minimum is 8GB and recommended is 16. That is not normal for many games. This is not however the full story. Games that I will call Normal use tricks to limit things. Tricks and such make performance better. This game does not do that. There is a positive and a negative on this. You full well may make a ship as large as a Star Destroyer to scale, but over time the requirements to simulate the ship will slow your PC down to a crawl. The requirements then shoot through the roof.\nThis however leaves the player to create to his hearts content as long as he/she has the proper PC hardware to do so.\n\nThis leads to multiplayer. If you want 64 players or an MMO experience this is not that. Above I was talking about single-player. Now imagine what 64 players will do. The server is doing player position calcs ALONG with all the ships/vehicles (vehicles meaning wheeled) and moving parts (that huge elevator that moves freely you made? Yeah that is considered a vehicle, that sliding door that folds inward= many vehicles)  it is also doing the physics calcs on these and calculating the building of components and lets not get started with remote controlled drones. There are limits and as players build more the harder the server needs to run as it is all being simulated. For an MMO experience this would require a server farm and thats not for a huge number of players. Over time the games size and complexity and stress on the server will only grow as the players add more and more to the world.\n\nHowever, it is this freedom that leads to this double edged sword. That is why your experience on a server will vary greatly based on how the admin runs the server. Stricter rules means better performance but less freedom. It will come down to testing out servers.\n\nI can recommend this game highly now with the improved multiplayer. The stage it currently is in is stability and less about adding core features but that is a great step and the Modding community is amazing too. Countless mods are out there to add layers of additional features that make the games play-ability nearly endless. For instance with the new MP update work is being done by modders to add the ability to jump from one server to another with a ship. Allowing for a decentralized server setup and allowing for more to be done with cheaper hardware. The modding is not just items I am getting at. Core features can be added and have been added. The devs have even adopted some mods to the game.\n\nOne draw back is time. This game takes a lot of time to play. It is not a new user friendly experience and you will need to look at tutorials and actually learn the game. Work is now being done to make the new user experience better with better tutorials.", "timestamp_created": 1532192070, "timestamp_updated": 1532192070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 146, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894656896591186523", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49288521": {"recommendationid": "49288521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170249193", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 286216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182135, "last_played": 1707487671}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't recommend this game enough.

Mods are almost a must and Keen supports and encourages modding and have made it very easy to find and use mods. They frequently even incorporate community creations in to the vanilla game. As you can see from my time played, I kinda liked the game and there is a huge replayability factor.

If you like to build space stuff, get it, if not, don't.[/b]\n\nPlease ALSO note that these are just my opinions. They are subjective to me, and your opinions may and probably do differ from mine. However, this is my review of Space Engineers after having played it for [b]years[/b].\n\nFasten your seatbelts, because this will be a long and [i]somewhat[/i] in-depth look at this game! Lastly, just as an F.Y.I., I'd like to note that I [b]do not[/b] care about graphics in games, only actual game play. So this is a review of the game play aspect, and not of the specs or graphics.\n\n[b][u]PROS:[/u][/b]\n1.) This game allows anyone who grew up playing with and loving Lego's and other various constructor sets to live out their dreams of making nearly whatever space (and sometimes not) themed object they desire.\n\n2.) The modding community is almost as rich as the Elderscrolls/Fallout modding community, and they further allow one to build pretty much anything. From the Deathstar to a Tardis that transforms into a race car, to that one weird spaceship you once made out of various odd colored Lego's when you were eight, because your <insert sibling> was hogging all of the good Lego's.\n\n3.) Speaking of modding, the game seems to have been made with the ease of modding in mind. Allowing anyone with an afternoon to watch and read a handful of tutorials, and start spitting out little mods by that evening.\n\n4.) The developers do seem to listen to the community. More so than a lot of games other out there. I do like that. However, only when it suits them. But what can you do lol? Six of one, half a dozen of the other.\n\n5.) The game is getting better... slowly. I stopped playing the game for two years because of the some of the enjoyment destroying bugs and problems, and only recently returned to the game. It has improved since it first launched. :)\n\n6.) Even if you leave the game as I did, you WILL come back to it eventually. That itch to really have/make/see that sci-fi creation that pops into your head will burn like a bright coal in your mind's eye, and will only get brighter and hotter as time goes on. Until eventually, you find yourself on steam activating the updates for Space Engineers, eager to slap some hydrogen engines on some blocks like there's no tomorrow! And it will be great! Untill...\n\n[b][u]CONS:[/u][/b]\n1.) Game breaking bugs... The game is only improving, SLOWLY. :( As I said in the \"pros\", it did improve, but it took two years to convince even me it had improved enough to return to it, and it STILL has weirdly glaring bugs. For one, it has a ridiculous game breaking memory leak, STILL. Luckily, this game's community pointed me in the direction of some third party programs to help manage the memory problems. (For those interested, the one I use is called \"Memory Cleaner\", by Koshy John. It works GREAT, and is useful for other memory hungry programs/games, and it's FREE! Just google it.) These memory leaks can cause the game to slowly chug to a stand still, and at best CTD (crash to desktop), and at worst completely crash my computer.\n\n2.) The developers treat players like play testers, entirely too much. How long can a game be in \"early access\"?\n\n3.) The developers treat the modding community like a well of potential cash opportunities. A modder can make a super awesome mod that everyone loves, and next month the developers will come out with their own - but FAR less useful - version of that mod (see: Easy Inventory), or as a DLC Pack *spooky noises* being sold for $3.99 (see: Transparent Displays). And then the modders don't feel like continuing to update their mods, and they die, and then you're stuck with a sub par [i]official[/i] replacement.\n\n4.) Speaking of DLC, almost all the new content for the game is locked behind a $3.99 pay wall. Before any of the KSH torch carriers jump down my throat, or leave [i]scathing[/i] internet comments about this topic, let me say that I UNDERSTAND that developing a game costs money, and it doesn't just grow on trees... Unless you are a farmer, in which case yes, money does grow on trees (after a fashion). But the game isn't even out of beta yet! It's STILL early access, and they have decided to [b]egregiously[/b] create paid DLC for all future content! Also, things players have been BEGGING for, for YEARS are now coming out with a price tag attached to them. Things like better/smaller stairs FFS! And what's worse, is that they then go and dangle these [i]DLC[/i] items in front of those who haven't purchased them by adding them to your build menu, but grayed out. They also show up as functioning blocks on NPC ships. But you can't have those, unless you want to get REAL fancy with some merge blocks! You want two toilets on your ship, better start spear fishing for NPC's, and hope your weapons don't blow that block up when you're \"harvesting\" your catch. Up until recently, I didn't much care one way or the other about the DLC blocks, because I actually don't care about having space toilets, beds, and useless lockers on my creations. However, now they've started adding things like better stairs, and small cockpits. Stuff that can actually make your creation work better, space-wise. One of the biggest things a [i]Space Engineer[/i] has to contend with is space limitation within their creation. Sometimes it means taking out those HUGE stair blocks, and replacing them with a window, or having to completely reconfigure your bridge layout, because you can't fit a light, a Flight Seat, and the air vent in the small space you've left yourself. And now, even many of the people who were on Keen's side with the DLC, are saying some items shouldn't be behind that pay wall, like the aforementioned small cockpit.\n\n5.) Almost none of the new updates have anything to do with fixing long standing, and glaring issues. Making the whole $3.99 DLC thing stink a lot more. NEW UPDATE! It's a table. Did we fix that error that makes AI turrets stop working randomly? NOPE! Look, a table! Have we even thought about tackling the idea of having the game only process the visible sides of blocks, like it handles only the visible voxels, so large block objects don't burn up CPU/GPU processing? NOPE! Look, an MRI machine, that does... NOTHING! Could we add small block to large block connections (WITHOUT the use of clang summoning rotors), like every other player has been begging for FOREVER, and exists in Medieval Engineers, but for some reason doesn't in Space Engineers? Nope! Look, vending machines with \"space\" soda!\n\n6.) After you made everything you want to make, you've finished that Homeworld model, or that Babylon 5 earth warship, repleat with spinning crew section; after you've delved into the \"survival\" mode and visited all the planets; after you've downloaded and played all the mods that interest you; after you've played multiplayer on numerous servers and gotten blasted to tiny bits by more veteran server users with long range kinetic kill missiles... There's NOTHING else. There is NO story, not even a hint of one. Even [i]Minecraft[/i] has some shred of an underlying story, or motive to progress. Dig dirt hole > build lavish palace > go to the nether > blow yourself up with \"intentional game design\" > [i]build Rube Goldberg-esque redstone contraption that slowly murders sheep on an assembly line of death[/i] > go to the end > fight ender dragon. With Space Engineers there is nothing. The game's only been out for years. Maybe there was never any intention to have a \"story\" or \"story mode\". I cannot say, but what I can say is that the lack of more to do besides playing with exploding lego's can and does eventually get stale.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b]\nI give this game forty-two asparagus out of six weasels.

This game is fantastic, and you'll hate every hour you spend on it.\n\n--- To Begin ---\n\nI have been a part of the Space Engineers community for quite a very long time. Although at first, the game was still being developed (as in... Before weapons, detonations, and the etc existed at all). By then, I enjoyed the game for a while however was never extremely hardcore into it. This all ended up changing around the past month and so however. With the introuction of new community groups, factions, and of course mods, (also of course the content being added every week) the game has never had a segment of any real 'boredom'.\n\n--- Graphics ---\n\nThe graphics on this game are done pretty well for many of the Sandbox Sims I have seen out and around. It is noted though, that to run this game on higher graphics settings you -will- require an at least decent PC to run this game sufficiently. There are of course a few glitches with the Early Access still above, such as a few lighting and shading bugs here and there, and the occasional block bug ot glitch. Overall though, the graphics and physics are all well and nice to look at (for the hours you will spend in the realms of space), of course.\n\n--- Gameplay ---\n\nThe gameplay is something that will vary depending on you yourself. If you enjoy building new (NOT FEATURED!)land, orbital, or space creations; enjoy exploring the infinite fields of asteroids, (NOW FEATURED!)planets, moons, and simply space; and would want to join the already growing and very friendly, creative and supportive community, then this is the game for you! The gameplay is fairly simple to a certain degree, the building being commonly referred to as 'minecraft in space'. This, however, changes drasticly past the simple placement of blocks, such as the production chains from mineral ore, to basic materials that can be processed into components that then are used to build and create each block in the game. This is a game where commonly you would want to play with a friend or even more (the more the better!).\n\n--- Community ---\n\nThe Space Engineers Community is one of (if not the) most active and creative communities I have grown to be a part of on Steam. The Workshop houses hundreds of thousands of player-made creations ranging from spaceships of combat, commerce, and civilian use, as well as stations of all types, ground vehicles and orbital ships, as well as now including land bases. There are also an array of hundreds of player factions, from pirates and mercccenaries of war, to civilian trading corporations and industrial commerce administrations. There is never a shortage of player-created factions, and it is always a great idea to find one that suits your interests best, and join in to meet other and new friends, and to share designs, tips, and your own universe experiences.\n\n--- Concluding ---\n\nOverall, Space Engineers is a wonderful game. Although there are of course bugs, errors, and situations that occur, this is  still in Early Access. The game itself is doing quite well so far, and I, alike many many others, are excited to see what will be released next. The release of planets today is a revolutionary new feature as well (Although it is a bit of a framerate kill on weaker PCs). Multiplayer still does have a bit of connection and server bugs, however it is functional and does work for the majority (though most problems I have experienced were from the server hosts themselves).\n\nAll in all, a great game, and I recommend it for any space, simulator, or sandbox fan.\n\nAlways remember, have fun!

If you are an engineer and you like designing and working on big projects this game is absolutely for you. The main selling point is the procedure of designing a ship, watching it fail horribly, going back to the drawing board, and redesigning your work. It's extremely satisfying experiencing your ship or something similar fail several times for you to finally come out with something that has overcome all your problems and pushed through. This is even further improved by adding \"Programmable Blocks\" into the game which you can program in Lua, a script that does almost anything.\nBecause of the vast sandbox this game has to offer it also comes with a small price, an extremely steep learning curve. If you're playing alone you will need a LOT of patience because your browser history will be FLOODED with \"Space engineers how to...\". Learning how to play is part of the fun of this game although I sometimes wish the UI was a bit better in the sense of not being so congested, there's a LOT on your screen at once at times so it can be overwhelming to a casual player.\nWith all that said, there are two MAJOR issues that I see in this game that I, and many others who have played this game, always eventually realize apon playing for a while.\nUnfortunately, where this game shines in its creativity, its actual depth in the PURPOSE of building these feats of engineering are where the game starts to show its cracks.\nThere is no REASON to build a giant giga space-ship that can kill everything, there is no REASON to build a massive base that looks super cool other than it just looking super cool. The drive to progress through the game is cut short when you realize there's nothing past the objective of satisfying the drive to gather materials in the most efficient manner and building the best miner ship or building one big fighter ship that can pretty much kill whatever you want. The time at which you are \"evenly matched\" against an enemy is an extremely thin section of the game as you will fight a few enemies, redesign your ship or build a new one,  and after 2-3 iterations of designing you will have a ship that can defeat any enemy. The game doesn't push you, you are either out-matched, or you will kill the enemy ship without really any trouble. These objectives will keep you busy and are genuinely fun for a creative person who is willing to spend time to create, fail, redesign, and create again, but you will ALWAYS return to the same spot in the end; why? Why should I do any of this if afterwords there's nothing to push further? The reasons to do these things would be solved if it weren't for the lack of:\nDepth. There are many factions you can interact with in the game, and to use the word \"interact\" is used loosely as there are no npc's in this game whatsoever. No other \"human\" characters you can talk to, this leaves the game feeling empty and lifeless. There is a meter that keeps track of your relationship status with every faction, if you do \"bad\" things it'll go down, but the worst thing that can happen is that they attack you when they see you, that's it, you can steal and destroy every faction and there will be pretty much no consequences for it. On the other hand if you do missions and destroy pirates you can become friendly with the faction, this also has almost no purpose as well, you don't gain anything from creating friends, so whats the point? You will get up to 10% increased buying and selling power with that faction, how exciting. Why should I grind missions for hours and hours on end to increase my reputation with one faction, when I can just steal one of their ships, scrap it, and gain a TON of resources in a small amount of time.\nMods in this game are really the only thing that's holding this game a-float. These mods fix quite a few minor issues that the devs have overlooked, and even fix some major issues that I've mentioned previously such as the no goal, no reason, and similar things in that area. This is only a minor fix to these issues because of the disconnect between mods and the actual game, which is usually how mods end up being in any game. Mods add variety in new game-play, goals, and activities to do but they are MODS, they are going to feel different and alien to the base game. These mods can only do so much, the cracks in the game are still very much there, putting a band-aid on a broken window doesn't fix the issue.\nLastly I want to say is that the things that I've mentioned above are pretty much common knowledge at this point, the entire community can agree on most of the things that I've said. The developers of the game haven't released a substantial update in a long time, they release a lot of small updates here and there but usually are DLC's and cosmetic blocks. I would like to see the devs listen to the community more in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1636516172, "timestamp_updated": 1636516172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 108, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.888316154479980469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24895563": {"recommendationid": "24895563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076677206", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 24095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7941, "last_played": 1660094552}, "language": "english", "review": "Found my friend on the planet surface\nCannibalized our ships\nBuilt a shack\nBuilt a truck to haul resources\nBuilt a small flyer to search for more resources\nBuilt a much larger truck\nDug out an underground base\nBuilt a launch pad\nBuilt our first ship to go to space\nCrash and burn\nAdd thrusters\nAdd more thrusters\nMake it to space (feeling of accomplishment)\nReturn to planet and make a rocket ship with living quarters\nReturn to space\nFarm asteroids\nBuild our first space station\nStart building space ships\n\nThis was all done in the survival mode, and I had a great time playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1471122381, "timestamp_updated": 1472260751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 176, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.884538769721984863", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38133531": {"recommendationid": "38133531", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970934684", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 27099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22690, "last_played": 1644847004}, "language": "english", "review": "Space Engineers is one of those games that have a lot of really crippling issues, yet remain compelling. I would definitely reccomend it, since just playing around with the tools it gives you is a blast, but I think it requires the following warning: Space Engineers is a fun toy, but it's not a fun game. \n\nWhat I mean by that is, it's a lot of fun to play around with all the various things you can build in the game, but if you actually want to play space engineers as a game it's incredibly disappointing. You won't be exploring increasingly more hostile sectors of space, building colonies and taking on powerful enemy fleets, you'll pretty much just build things and then look at them for a while wishing there was something interesting to do with them. Open multiplayer servers offer no real relief from this because it's firmly in the hands of a toxic community that will shout down anyone who suggests Keen add some sensible offline protections and other anti-griefing measures, or do anything to encourage more complex multiplayer interactions than eithe sharing everything with someone, or killing them on sight. There is no money to trade with, no way to establish neutral ground that isn't going to get blown up by the first griefer idiot who happens past and no way to lay claim to technologies, capabilities or resources that give your faction a meaningful identity in the world.\n\nAnother big problem with this game is Keen's insistence that if a modder can add it they don't have to. The modding community is very active and generally great in SE, but it's almost impossible to find a mod that at the same time adds a useful functionality, is visually and thematically consistent with the base game and is reasonably balanced. For example, automatic repair nanites are an incredibly useful functionality, but the modded block creates what looks like magic whisps that repair your ship, and they are so incredibly good at it that all other means of maintenance and defense become irrelevant. An official version of this block that used small drones to add a small amount of automatic repair to take the occasional ding out of your hull would be fantastic, but right now it's either magic or nothing. \n\nThe game is also very poorly balanced. Ships are incredibly fragile since there are no blocks that actually act as effective armor or structural parts. Force is not transmitted through solid parts, but simply destroys whatever blocks it initially comes into contact with, so there is no way to structurally reinforce your ship against collisions. Weapons have a similar issue, since they tend to simply destroy whatever block they hit. The toughness of blocks is also modeled purely on hitpoints and not on resistance, so there is no distinction between hard skinned and soft skinned vehicles, you can cut through a battleship's armor with a machine gun, and heavy artillery for dealing with armored targets doesn't even exist. Gravity Generators which should only exist to satisfy people's need to think in two dimensions can be used to build all kinds of weapons and propulsion systems that you'd find in a setting like Mass Effect. This creates a constant immersion breaking effect, where the game is supposed to take place in a relatively low tech hard scifi universe, but players can build things straight out of space operas. If artificial gravity is a thing in this universe then there is no reason why people would make energy by nuclear fission or move spaceships with hydrogen thrusters or use gunpowder to propell projectiles. Everything would work like it does in Mass Effect. \n\nSo, overall, this game is full of really annoying issues, but it's still really fun to play around with. You'll definitely get a few hours of fun out of it. There is a similar game called Empyrion which has a much more reasonable approach to being a good game, but is much less developped when it comes to giving you the tools to make awesome ships. Both games are worth checking out.

Here's why. \n\n-Infinite possibilities. \nDo you want to build a racetrack in space and dash around in gravity-tethered go-carts? You can do that. Demolition derby? Sure, that's feasible. Starfighter dogfights? Yup, you bet'cha. Capital ship slugfests? Seen 'em, they're pretty. Just build without restrictions, build whatever you can imagine? Ayup. Survival mode? Oh, oh hell yeah. \n\n-Multiplayer\nSometimes sketchy, but generally reliable as of the last few patches, Space Engineers multiplayer is genuinely fun. Not in the shoot 'em up bang bang pew pew sort of way, more of the mutual cooperation so you don't all suffocate and die horribly in space sort of way. It's a huge change of pace, and the recent updates have made it feasible to do more than merely survive. You can explore, you can wander the 'verse and see all the beauty and horror it has to offer. \n\n-Physics\nDem physics doe. Needs a little fine-tuning in places but it works out brilliantly otherwise, and allow for artificial gravity and zero-gravity to happily coexist. Crashes are spectacular, damage from kinetic torpedoes is impressive, and for the non-combat oriented, it's just plain fun to fiddle with the physics in this game. From making orbiting satellites to devising new and innovative ways to send things flying at ludicrous speeds. \n\n-Update speed\nKSH is awesome. They push out updates every Thursday, barring major holidays or a sudden and inexplicable bear assault on their offices. They work hard to keep the game up to snuff and it shows with just how far its come in relatively little time. \n\n-Steam Workshop Integration\nSeriously awesome. Want a mod? Grab it. Want to play with someone's ship? Snag the blueprint. Want a new skybox? Done. New world? Easy peasy. Workshop is an amazing tool and it allows you to very easily - and very rapidly - add new spins on the base game. \n\n-KSH is awesome\nSo good they deserve their own bullet point. These guys work hard, are creative, are pretty honest about where they're at and what's going on, and push out updates and fixes like clockwork. They're enthusiastic about their product, they're in touch with their playerbase, they listen to their playerbase, and they're willing to learn from their mistakes so that they can overcome future hurdles. They're working hard and the game is only getting better with each passing week. \n\nIf you're on the fence about this game, don't be. It's a good, solid title. It has its bugs, yes, it has its glitches and its problems, but they've spent several weeks weeding out the bulk of the problems and it plays pretty smoothly now. There's modding support, multiplayer, survival mode, creative mode, and they're rolling out exploration-oriented content - plus patches every Thursday. Not much beats that. \n\nIf you like  building games, buy it. If you like mining games, buy it. If you like exploring, buy it. Some folks say it's minecraft in space, and in a sense it is. It's virtual legos for sci-fi gamers and hopeful shipbuilders, and it's just flat-out fantastic for it.

It is everything I've ever wanted in a space survival game, and it's everything I didn't want in a singleplayer survival game. \n\nThe building system is amazing and satisfying; it's like you're 10 years old again and you're fighting your siblings' spaceships with your own. And then you introduce a survival aspect where you also need to manage your oxygen for basic life support, suit energy to power your tools and also basic life support, and hydrogen levels to be able to zip around at light speed in a jetpack. To do this, you need to mine resources and pump out components through automated assembling machines and refineries and the like. Where this game shines, it absolutely shines above everything else. You can make automated mining drones and sit back in your chair while they do all the work; or you can do it all yourself in the slowest and most inefficient but still engaging process ever conceived, you can add a huge 10x10 drilling system onto your main ship and have all the minerals automatically get processed without having to transport anything from A to B, or have a secondary mining ship that you connect to your main ship so that your main ship doesn't have a bunch of ugly drills on it. When Keen introduced the stone refining into the core ingots you need to make all the basic components, this game shot up from a 6/10 to an 8/10 instantly for me. You didn't have to jump from the Iron asteroid to the Silicon asteroid a hundred times just to survive, instead you could just plant yourself on top of a big, bland one and let it mine and mine with a giant piston-pushing drilling system while you are off doing something else. The more important resources still have to found and mined on their own, which is even better, because it motivates you to actually explore for them and get the resources to create bigger and better contraptions. The mining grind has never been done better than it has in this game, in my very biased opinion.\n\nNow, that's where the bad part comes in; finding the motivation to make bigger and better contraptions. In singleplayer, there are no NPCs, very few (if any) random encounters with enemies (unless you turn on wolves and spiders, which are absolutely ridiculous and their spawning systems are...bad). So, the only risk you are ever truly faced with is your own idiocy when you drive your ship a little bit too fast on your way to your home base in your mining ship, and realize too late that you can't slow down fast enough and crash the whole thing into your base (which is a lot more fun and exciting than it sounds). With no threats to face, why bother building big, bad battleships? Why bother creating a full-scale auto-mining operation to create an endless supply of resources? For what purpose? You don't even really need to defend yourself from anything. Keen did create an endless wave survival scenario, but that just isn't really the same kind of satisfation you'd get from something like building a giant castle in Terraria to keep out the horrors of the Eclipse, where you are being faced with very imminent threats and you are rewarded for designing a more fortified and stable base/killing machine. \n\n\"Why not just play multiplayer instead?\" Because, Chad, it isn't fun. Playing a multiplayer server in this game is not fun, unless you are playing with a giant clan of people where at least two people can be constantly active on the server, because if it's just you and like one or two friends, you're going to go offline for two days straight and come back to find that one guy grinded down your whole base and stole everything, and you spent those last 30 hours doing effectively nothing. Playing in a private server with those same friends avoids that problem, but then just comes back to the same problem with \"why bother doing anything?\".\n\nI absolutely adore this game, and I'm genuinely still going to keep playing it on and off because, like I said, no game has ever come so close to perfecting space survival for me. But I always find myself reaching that point of \"why am I building a giant exploration vessel? There's nothing to see except for the weird monolith that's impossible to find because my system has 4 planets and each of them are way too big for me to cumulatively waste the next 5 days searching the entire surface of for this one artifact just for the achievement.\n\nCore aspects: 10/10\nFun: 7/10\nStory mode: Don't/10", "timestamp_created": 1570384115, "timestamp_updated": 1570384115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 136, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.87110137939453125", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108661520": {"recommendationid": "108661520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198982750328", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 39634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5852, "last_played": 1711811457}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're on the fence about buying space engineers, don't be.

Definitely stick with smaller ships and maps unless you have a monster gaming PC. With a little help regarding the UI, some optimization to improve performance, and just more of what the devs have been doing, by the time this hits 1.0 it will be one of the best games of it's kind. \n\nTL;DR- This game is good, doesn't feel like early access.

We have seen some great progression, some new pitfalls, and some letdowns. So let\u2019s discuss again why this game is still on my mind some years later.\n\n\nTo compare with other games, how I feel that this game keeps on working for me is the fact that it gives creative freedom enough to build nearly anything, and the community is keeping the experience alive with custom scenarios, active community interaction from the devs and fans. We see this same kind of engagement still active with other games that have this kind of integration. Skyrim and Minecraft come to mind as games that held up as part of the community that kept making free content.\n\nOverview\nSo, what is in this game? Space Engineers is a pure sandbox game with some game modes tacked on by the developers as an afterthought. The primary selling point is the destruction mechanic of voxels, both for player-made grids and chunks of rock. \n\nGameloop(s?)\nThis destruction mechanic makes it possible to physically dig into asteroids and planets, gather materials, and use those to build a better mechanical grid. You have tools to destroy and collect these materials in the form of Drills and a functional system to manage your ship\u2019s inventory. I wanted to list the things you can use to collect and improve your collection method\u2026 yet there is only 1 thing to use.. a Drill\u2026 big or small, it\u2019s still a single version of a single block that stands at the core of the what is meant to be the core game loop, collect resources and use them to make better contraptions. There are no mining lasers, nanobots, titanium alloy super drills\u2026 no. Just one\u2026 one speed, one thing.\n\nThis is true for almost everything that is part of this \u2018\u2019survival mode\u2019\u2019 that is the one that has goals and features and balance. It baffles me that we have more variety in batteries, rotors and thrusters, (there are even upgrade modules! Super interesting! Right?\u2026 yet they only work with refineries and furnaces\u2026 the least interactive part of the game) and the tools that all these contraptions are built around have 1 of a kind. It seems that Space Engineers is lacking in depth. I rarely play the game as an exploration game, no, I never play it as an exploration and survival game. There is no end-game, there are no wonderful vista or great creatures to find. There is just you and the physics engine, and your imagination (AND MODS TOO!). This is why after doubling my hours, I still want to \u201cplay\u201d. \n\nBuilding Mode\nI play in creative, I am a \u201cBuilder\u201d for this game, I share my creations to the workshop and even create videos using them. The way you build in this game is pretty expansive. That is mostly thanks to the size of the smallest block or \u2018grid size\u2019 in this game. That size is 50x50x50cm. That's half of most games that use voxels or blocks for their physics. Meaning that you can make builds 8 times more detailed! And ofcourse, when you fly, drive or float your creation to a crash or conflict, it breaks aparts like a beauty. \n\n4/7 Perfect Score\n\nControls\nThis game is available on XBox 1\u2026 but I can\u2019t imagine making anything on a laptop keyboard\u2026 not to speak of a controller. This game should have rebindable controls but as for now this is all hard-coded. It takes a lot of hours to get used to them. I have, after all these hours, still no mastery over the rotation controls for blocks\u2026 So they are far from intuitive. Interface is also still a mess, and part of why I never want to manage any inventory or ship interface is because there are millions of screens with scrollbars, tabs and whatnot. And they are mono-chromatic so good luck finding anything with visual que\u2019s. Luckily there is a search bar. Again why this game would be impossible with anything other than a full keyboard setup. It is faster for me to type in the block name I need to place than it is to search through my \u2018\u2019quickbars\u2019\u2019 (only 9 blocks are available ever on screen) and select it from there.\n\nScore: \n9/ 500 blocks per interface\n\nPhysics\nThis game breaks a lot, it misses its collision frames or desync your creations on a server, yet it keeps steady and pretty when there is little to no stress. Normal gameplay will usually go fluidly and without issue, resulting in an average crash of 1 every 10 hours of play. But that was because you wanted to copy something too quickly or you tried to run a million parses of a single script on that single frame\u2026 Or you loaded the wrong world and it was too old and had memory leaks to spare\u2026 The physics are functional enough to run this, and gives plenty of physics based shenanigans to base your wacky contraptions on.\n\nScore: \nClang/Twang\n\nMultiplayer\nRecent patches really improve the synchronization between players when playing online. This becomes most clear in the high energy content created by the community. Racing with rovers was not possible a few years ago as people would fall through planets, get stuck or randomly explode. I have had some very satisfying experiences during stream and community driven events. So for me this mode is very functional. There are some issues with scripting but that becomes only a problem once you start deep diving into \u2018\u2019developing\u2019\u2019 this game.\n\nScore:\nCompilation Error/404\n\nCommunity Content\nThis game lives and dies with its community. There are awesome mods to use in this game. This ranges from Custom Levels, new blocks & models, skyboxes, custom scripts to run and blueprints. The blueprints are actually part of the game, as they are for your own use to replicate ships you designed earlier in another game mode or world, and even import those of others. This way of community content integration means that each time you play you can find something new. That keeps the game interesting and fresh every time you boot up. or it gives you a reason to keep building and keep sharing, as the system is directly integrated with the steam workshop, with well over 10k designs and content pieces to browse through\n\nScore: \n5/5 Stars with a thumbs up and added to favorite. But there is one guy that keeps automatically downvoting anything I post :/\n\nThis game is still a creative beauty, but I will only recommend it to those who enjoy creating Grid-Based 3D models while also putting them to use in an Multiplayer Environment. For the solo-players I would recommend looking elsewhere (in a game like ARK for example), as the depth of Space Engineers Survival Mode is anything but deep.\n\nFinal Verdict: \nXocliw, Aragath and the team keep on working!

JUST MAKE ONE!!!!\n\n[b]this game all in all is an awesome game. \nbut wheres the catch?[/b]\n\nthe catch is, that this game never had the intention to be a multiplayer game. BUT it desperately needed one since you kind of have nothing to do after you progressed to a certain point ingame. that point is pretty much when crafting your first jumpers in order to move faster through space.\nthe whole way to that point is basically always the same: \n[list]\n[*]planet mining (which means finding all the ressources ofc)\n[*]get into space\n[*]space mining (same with planet mining)\n[*]building a space station\n[*]build jumpers \n[/list]\nthis takes about 5-20 maybe up to 30 hrs depending on how familiar you are with the game.\n\n\nthats because theres no real story, no NPC (except the idiotic \"encounters\" which can be added) yes this is a sandbox game but it would have so much potential if id had a story. because after you are kinda done with those points theres nothing left but base building or start a new game and repeat mentioned milestones.\n\n[b]if SE has a MP...what is the problem with SE multiplayer?[/b]\n\nwell as i mentioned above the game studio never had the intention to implement a multiplayer which lead to a multiplayer mode that is basically unplayable. there need to be drilling restrictions, mods that delete junk in space and on planets, restrictions for certain physics, flyspeed lowering and so on. this all results in a \"slowed\" multiplayer experience since the servers would crash. they just cant handle more than 2-4 players doing stuff that you just do in this game. building large ships with more than a few players can be a real pain in the ass and lead to destruction of the whole thing or constant server crashes.\n\nand so is pvp. besides that theres no shields, no welding or scrapping restrictions, no blocks that cant be destroyed if the player doesnt want to its also impossible because of the mentioned reasons (you basically can just scrap a whole players base while he is offline, you just cant place enough turrets to defend yourself while offline)\n\n[b]CONCLUSION?[/b]\n\nall in all this game is awesome, i spent a few hundred hours myself ingame on steam and maybe a few more offline on LANs. [u]but it would have been better for the game studio to just start over again at a certain point[/u], since they had enough money to do that. unfortunately they decided to throw out that half finished, half destroyed MP instead which may get better with each update, but never will be proper playable. this is the reason i gave up on SE.\n[b]i definitely recommend this game to lone wolves who like playing alone or just with one friend. but for ppl who like to explore the roleplay and RPG character in such games, form alliances and make rendezvous in space just for fun, trade, build large stations and ships and maybe fight each other this game might be frustrating and enraging rather than fun. there are too many parts missing and theres too much sloppy programming and not caring about this game.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1562765752, "timestamp_updated": 1563115453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852165460586547852", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106741961": {"recommendationid": "106741961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036237622", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 231018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 113645, "last_played": 1711902104}, "language": "english", "review": "A review long due as I have now past 1800 hrs at the counter.\n\nIs this game flawless ? no, clearly not.\nIs there a narrative or enticing story ?

The singleplayer is fantastic once you know what you're doing, and progress has a very visible impact. For example, starting on the Earth-like planet and finding cobalt is a huge leap forward in what you can accomplish as it allows you to build thrusters. Compared to something like Minecraft where there's so much to find but very little of it amounts to much. \n\nI will say that after \"\"\"completing\"\"\" survival, which for me was building a big enough ship to get out of Earth's atmosphere and then making a ship to explore space, I felt very let down. There wasn't much incentive to create a space station or a bigger ship besides being able to say that I did, compared to the monumental feat that making a ship capable of leaving atmosphere was, which gave me more gameplay. \n\nSo really the only options in terms of replay value is starting on a different planet, which still has the same cycle of \"set up base, mine, make ship, leave planet\". Maybe I'm unambitious but I got bored pretty quick. \n\nMultiplayer is something different. With friends, the fun is endless. The work of building and gathering materials is made more fun with a helper, and it feels good to accomplish something together. You can then have ship battles, or race buggies, or whatever. \n\nThe shitty thing is that Keen isn't focusing on either of these types of players. They keep adding DLC which has little gameplay impact and doesn't benefit either Singleplayer or Multiplayer With Friends. The Decoration blocks are just that, the Economy pack has no use with friends and doesn't give the Singleplayer anything they haven't already mined or crafted. \n\nFor some stupid reason Keen focuses on Multiplayer with Randoms. The only possible explanation is that they envision some sort of Elite Dangerous MMO type thing with players interacting and doing jobs, but that just isn't feasible. The playerbase is too small and largely resides in Singleplayer or Multiplayer with Friends, the map is too enormous and unpopulated for players to run into each other and Multiplayer with Randoms just becomes a case of \"You're basically in singleplayer but sometimes the server will horribly rubberband\".\n\nTL;DR: Keen keeps focusing on developing for a specific playerbase that doesn't exist and the playerbase that does exist is being left out.", "timestamp_created": 1586692241, "timestamp_updated": 1586692241, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 249, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.847274243831634521", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18243033": {"recommendationid": "18243033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086576034", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 25292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19464, "last_played": 1568775464}, "language": "english", "review": "my Space Engineers experience\n\n1. buy game\n\n2. learn how to play game via tutorials etc.\n\n3. play for a long ass time\n\n4. get bored and stop playing\n\n5. come back a month later\n\n6. 9,000,000 updates\n\n7. open game\n\n8. mind explodes\n\nthank god for active devs", "timestamp_created": 1443485367, "timestamp_updated": 1443485367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 200, "votes_funny": 203, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846961736679077148", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23111579": {"recommendationid": "23111579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162999977", "num_games_owned": 623, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 22108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5856, "last_played": 1699688622}, "language": "english", "review": "Been putting this off for a while now, but due to recent spates of negative reviews i think it would be a good idea to make one, if only to make people more aware.\n\nFirst off before the actual review i will write a warning to newer players.\n\nThis game is unfinished, do not judge it based on its current bugs as they are being fixed. \n\nPeople who claim that development is taking too long need to realize that this was being developed by a very small dev team for quite some time until relatively recently (and a good portion of the current dev team is fairly new to game development), that they are working on two games at once (medieval engineers), and that they used better part of a year developing planets at the demands of the community (which a few members of the long term community think was a mistake. That is open to speculation). In other words, cut them some slack.\n\nThis game is EXTREMELY GPU and RAM intensive, i do not suggest running it with less than 8gbs, (16 recommended). Also bear in mind that some planets will refuse to load on low end GPUs and that others will run badly. For example you will run Mars at 30 odd fps on a GTX 750ti, 50-60 on a 980. Earth and the alien planet will run at 50-60 fps on a GTX 980ti (basically a titan x with less vram). I also hear that AMD cards and CPUs run worse than their Intel and Nvidia counterparts, though this is inconsitant.\n\nAs such i STRONGLY suggest you stay away from planets if you have a weaker GPU, i can manage 40fps on intel integrated graphics in space.\n\nMultiplayer is currently broken, though new netcode is on the way and indications are that it is nearly complete. Stay away from dedicated servers until it drops, private games with 2-6 people run perfectly fine for the most part, though i do not recommend using pistons and rotors, they will invoke to wrath of Clang (the patron god of Space engineers and utter ruin).\n\nThat just about covers it for the warning, i will add more as i either remember things or otherwise find out more.\n\n---------------------\n\nNow, for the actual review.\n\nSpace engineers is a semi realistic sci-fact voxel based building and exploration game (emphasis on the building part).\nIn this game you will build, mine and fight pirates (single player) and other players (multiplayer) in the hope of creating massive battleships to oppress the peasants, and defend what you own. \n\nYou can build basically any ship from movies, other games and TV series, or something original (but mostly you will end up building flying bricks due to your lack of aesthetic skill), the only limits are your imagination, and your computer.\n\nMining for resources is actually very fun in this game due to deformable terrain.\n\nThe fighting part could use a little work, but it does the job fine for the moment.\n\nThe exploration element is similar (if not somewhat superior) to that found in Elite: Dangerous, difference being the main reasons are to find a nice looking place for a base, look for resources, or if you have both, look for the community made ships that are placed extremely infrequently across the galaxy. Rather than just to have your name on a planet, though you can do that too if you really want.\n\nThe UI is, to be honest a little daunting at first, but it does the job. \n\nThe graphics are some of the best in the genre, and the models and effects are currantly being improved.\n\nThe music is decent (love the title screen song), but after a while you get a little tired of it. \n\nThe modding community is absolutely fantastic, on par if not better than the Skyrim one.\n\nInfact the community in general is superb for the most part. Probably the best i have found yet.\n\nThe game is updated every week on thursday, and hotfixes released as soon as they are finished.\n\nYoutubers for this game in general are great, i suggest VideoSage, XP gamers and W4stedspace.\n\nThat about covers it for the review. \n\nTL;DR To me this game is fantastic and has the potential to be even better, and it looks like the devs are going to deliver.\n\n8.5/10\n\nEdit: Before putting a dislike in, make a comment so I know what you disagree on and how i can help fix it.", "timestamp_created": 1463815490, "timestamp_updated": 1463881442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 109, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846278548240661621", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21195949": {"recommendationid": "21195949", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998093250", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 354414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2225, "playtime_at_review": 38586, "last_played": 1713780777}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say about a game that has allowed me to:\n - hollow out an asteroid to create a hidden base\n - smash my astronaut, ships and even a base or two into an asteroid (both on purpose and because I my braking systems were a dismal failure)\n - create mammoth ships for mining, killing or just plain derping about\n - has a community of modders that are so impressive that their stuff is incorporated into the vanilla game\n - work on a [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCUCV2mz3JsEeZUmIHKXbw] machinima series\t[/url] within the game that has so far proven to be a lot of fun\n\nWell I can say: GET IT! \n\nDespite the bugs, the devs consistently churn out improvements (or more bugs) and are definitely continuously active on their games.", "timestamp_created": 1455418864, "timestamp_updated": 1455418864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.845569074153900146", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12488456": {"recommendationid": "12488456", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969900960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 81009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65477, "last_played": 1692509831}, "language": "english", "review": "Space Engineers combines space sim with building and does so extremely well. While the Early Access has a lot of bugs, mostly affecting multiplayer, it is still a blast to play building and flying whatever type of ship you want. It has more than just simple building blocks (the default armor blocks) including things like reactors, solar panels, gatling guns, turrets, pistons, rotors, cargo containers, and more - all of which work and have their own functions. Carefully-designed slope blocks allow you to build ships and stations that only look somewhat \"blocky\", compared to the cubes-only approach of other building games. \n\nSpace Engineers supports mods like nearly no other game does, with the ability to add mods to a server, and have the clients automatically download the same mods from the Steam workshop. Because of this approach, everybody in a multiplayer game runs the same mods, all without an external modding program! So you see Earth in your skybox? So do the other players. Got custom weapons for your ship? So does everybody else. I expect this server-based mod approach to become more common to where it becomes the standard. \n\nFor Early Access, Keen has done an excellent job with updates and hotfixes that come out weekly (on Thursdays), meaning you can log in once a week and see something fresh, as well as see that progress is being made constantly. This shows me they are serious about the game and they aren't going to just shelf this game before release or before it's ready. \n\nWith the update for players to manually control ship turrets, as well as the player-faction features, this game is becoming more and more co-op supportive, where you can control a large ship with multiple players in different roles. Then you could use that ship against other players' crews in PvP, or fight AI once that is implemented (or when mods add AI ships to fight). \n\nSome of the more interesting things you can currently build include: gravity drives, remote-controlled torpedoes, orbital drones, retractable weapons, rotating antenna arrays, giant miners for strip-mining asteroids, detachable countermeasures (decoys), automatically-opening doors (sensors), and escape pods. \n\nOnce they fix the Early Access bugs and add enough features to release out of Early Access, I have a feeling this will be in many top 10 lists of best space games for a long time, if it isn't already.", "timestamp_created": 1413296128, "timestamp_updated": 1413296128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 86, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.844748198986053467", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97550081": {"recommendationid": "97550081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035134890", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 11753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11753, "last_played": 1609209715}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, I REALLY do, most of us do in fact, even the people who seem to have hate for it, do.\n\nbut its not hate for the game, in fact, the very OPPOSITE! we [b]L O V E[/b] this game...\n\nbut we can't tolerate the devs intolerance, neglections, advantage-taking, and \"cash cow milking\" anymore.\n\nkeep in mind, I LOVE this game, I used to think it was the BEST fucking game ever, especially with mods, and the communities creations!\n\n\n\nbut the fact that they've done almost NOTHING, but release DLC, after DLC, after DLC, reskins, reskins, reskins, and barely any ACTUAL update to fix the ACTUAL bugs, and optimization issues, SINCE the game has come out (sure some have, but when they started releasing DLC's, they started doing less..and lesss...and less..)\n\n\nits gotten to the point to where every update/announcement, its literally not even a JOKE anymore when someone in the discussion asks \"another DLC\"? or \"will this update actually fix/improve anything?\"\nand now, to the point to where people are just using sarcasm, and joking about it again, but instead of the jokes from before.\n\nits now joking about how \"I bet its another DLC\" or other shit...\n\n\nI love this game, let me remind you...\n\nbut its nothing but a \"cash cow\" they are milking.\n\nand with how much the devs are deleting some peoples posts for \"disrespect\" despite some people actually giving HONEST TO GOD criticism, I doubt this review will be around for long if they can have ANY say in the matter.\n\nnot only that, they're now trying to milk these \"competitions\" they do, literally look up ANYTHING on the current ones around the date of this reviews posting, and you'll see what I mean, the rules of the \"competition\" are sketchier than any \"fund me\" sources of weird ass products that never see the light of day...\n\n\nand once again, I will reiterate...

Is it a perfect game? No. Does it need some serious CPU and a decent Graphic Card? Yes. Is there any other game like it? \n\nNot even close. \n\nWhile Dual Universe and the much maligned Star Citizen are still hovering in Alpha and have yet failed to materialize their promised potential (my money is on Dual Universe), Space Engineers has produced a finished product that for a small fee will produce untold hours (when you see the total hours I have spent on this game, consider that I run a tech company and teach theology part time and I am writing a book) of enjoyment for those who want a true open Sandbox Space Engineering game. \n\nLet's clear the decks with what this game is [b]not[/b], it's not a space exploration game such as No Man's Sky (another game that has rebounded beautifully). This is purely a game for those who want to start from total scratch and build bases, factories, ships, mining equipment and who find joy in solving actual engineering issues. \n\nLet me give you an example. When you start out, you will be using a hand drill. Tedious. So you start by building a quick base for protection. Then you want to build a small mining ship so you can increase the efficiency of your mining. But it needs power, more power than your starting Windmills can produce. So you build solar panels, but now you need more batteries to store the power. Which means you now how to go find ore deposits in the ground. You can walk around and try to detect them with your very limited scanner in your hand drill, but that takes forever. So you end up building a rover with a more powerful ore detector, and on and on and on. One problem solved creates three more challenges. \n\nAnd when I say [i]build[/i] let me clarify. You can download blueprints from other users that have spectacular designs, but to do that you have to have some level of advancement to begin to set that process up (and it is not done for you; yes you will have to engineer this also). You will discover the joy of designing, testing and flying or driving your first vehicle. And then proceed to cry when it tips over and you realize there is no way to turn it over (yes, you will have to engineer that issue also). \n\nIn Space Engineers, gravity is a bitch. It is unforgiving and will cause massive damage and issues if one is not careful. The physics, while not perfect, is excellent for a game play that is unique. For instance, I built a small mining vehicle whose starting weight is around 42,000 Kg. When fully loaded with rock and ore, around 138,00 Kg. When empty, it is nimble, but when loaded if flies like a bloated pig. Just like it should in real life. When designing ships you must take in account weight versus thrust, yet it is not so complex that you can't simply experiment and once you get enough experience be able to build ships with out trying to do complicated math formulas. But you can if you want. And they do appear to be relative consistent (see the forums). \n\nNow if your still reading this, your either gagging or salivating. If the latter, it gets better. The game by itself is well worth the small amount you pay (even for the DLCs, which I will get to). But it is the modding community (5th most active last time I checked) that pushes this game over the top. The mods are simply incredible, and add everything to additional NPC encounters, pirates, law enforcement (um say if you like to 'acquire' resources from other ships), food and daily survival and modifications to even some of the game core. All made possible by the brilliant decision to open source the code by Keen Software. Keen even adds some of the most beneficial mods to the game itself; a nod to the modders coding prowess. The second brilliant decision by Keen was to allow actual programming to [i]run inside the game itself[/i] which not only allows for easier modding but even allows users with a little bit of scripting knowledge to write custom scripts in their games to automate tasks. \n\nWhile I have just started exploring the world of hosted Space Engineer servers; they themselves are another world(s) and most are heavily modded for different styles and types of game play. From cooperative worlds to ones that lend themselves to Space Battles (another whole topic), there is one you will probably find that fits your style of play. \n\nOne complaint I see is the DLCs (additional content you buy from the developer). IMHO, this is ridiculous. I have purchased every one of them and will continue to do so. I want Keen and his dev group to keep pushing this game to new heights. DLC's I would definitely pay for in the future would be ability to 'jump' to different star systems (should be difficult as hell to build those engines and power requirements that are extreme), bigger solar systems with more variety (And water? Yea, I know it must a difficult one) and different NPC/Alien type encounters (there are some good Mods out there for this already).\n\nSpace Engineers is simply the most fun I have had since MineCraft.

Evey game I played, I started being excited about having to settle up, build my first miners & reach for space ... only to figure out somewhere in the way that I had no reason to do this, no reason to arm up, no engineering challenges or anything. There are no objectives, no rewarding exploration (yeah you can find some generic abandoned ships in space, but at that point you dont need anything more than you already have), no relevent enemy force. So everytime, I just end my game with a 'meh', juste wondering why Ive been playing. \n\nDespite countless forum posts, comments and live stream interventions along the years asking Marek from Keen Studios to focus more on gameplay. In those messages, many great new ideas of gameplay improvement, ways to implement them, and carefull demonstrations on how lack of gameplay is preventing this game from goign to 'somewhat ok' to 'really great'. Yet Marek recently made a clear statement that he didnt want to improve the gameplay as 'he feared that would interefere with the players habits'.\n\nI think having a strong leadership on a game project is great, but can becomes a serious flaw when you end up not listening to anyone else than yourself.\n\nIn the end, the only thing that saves this game is the amazing community of modders that tries hard to fill in the huge holes in this game with new content, gameplay and opposing forces. Im not sure if Marek realize his game would be dead in the water without those guys efforts. At least for me I can confidently say that I would not play this game at all if it wasnt for the mods.\n\nDespite all their qualities, relying too much on mods for your game content results in a unclear and unbalanced experience, hard to approach for new players. Also, mods are very vulnerable to new game versions breaking them, and we've lost quite a few disgruntled modders to that reason already.\n\nIt seems that since Marek's recent interview were he basically states the gameplay wont change, the community's been reacting negatively, hence the huge drop from \"very positive\" reviews to \"mixed\".

The only problem is, all the fanboys shouldn't have tried to shut out people like me raising the alarm that KSH has done this before with another game called Miner Wars.  Yes, I warned everyone early on.  So, you now have a game that updates only when they push paid DLC on you while glaring problems in the game still exists and are rarely fixed and if they do fix a problem it causes other issues that they won't fix again until another DLC is released.\n\n[h1]THE PROBLEMS[/h1]\n\nDon't get me wrong, this game had so much potential but it started out - cheaply coded.  How can you make a huge open-world space game and then develop your matrix using float knowing every architecture rounds differently knowing the client and server will have discrepancies over the matrix?  Why hasn't this been fixed yet?\n\n How can you not think to develop with something that can support the vastness of space?  Like, oh, I don't know, init64?\n\nThe game lacks any and all content.  People say sandbox to try and protect the developers but what they don't mention is the sandbox is supposed to have SAND.  This game is a big, empty sandbox with no sand.  You can build your ship, but... Welp, that's all.  You can do a little exploring but once you've seen a few points of interest, you've seen it all.\n\nThe only threats of death in this game, literally are bugs.  No not arthropods, we're talking game bugs, the kind of things that just randomly happen.  Here is a true story:  My son and I were about to land on a planet and as he goes to lock his landing gear his gears go through the terrain, and his ship gets stuck half-way into the terrain and starts exploding.  I stop the server, restart with the backup 5 mins before hand and login knowing our ships are in motion at this point.  We get to the load screen and it sits there and sits there.  What is it doing?  It's actually waiting for your ship to crash so it can load you at the re-spawn screen.  No kidding - you login and you will sit there for 5 minutes until your ship stops before you can load it.  The game literally waits until you die to let you load in.\n\nAs I said, you're more likely to die and lose your ship to a bug than any in-game NPC or careless collision.\n\n[h1]I TRIED TO LOVE IT[/h1]\n\nA while back, feels like eons ago, I tried to fix the game (actually I kinda did).  This was after being told by the developers that fixing the issues of multiplayer was \"impossible\".  Tell me something is impossible with code and I'll purposely prove you wrong.  What they meant to say was, \"We're just too lazy to give a s**t about fixing it\".  Really, this should have been the tell tell that something was wrong.  But fanbois supported them and made excuses for them.  Well, I fixed it by creating a simple wrapper to filter the bs out of the network traffic.  It worked too.  Grabbing a perfectly random player from the forums to help me test, he agreed it was the greatest fix to SE he'd seen yet and said, \"You should give this to KSH as a gift to help the community\".\n\nI went to the forums with the intent of doing just that, posted the video of the performance improvements and told them a little of what I had done.  The devs went silent while the fanbois ravenously flamed and trolled me.  It's cool though, my feelings don't get easily hurt but when Iieval (the guy I'm talking abou that helped test) went to defend me, he got the same treatment and the video was deleted and called a fake. \n\nMy mind was honestly blown.  I've never seen a gesture of altruism get met with such hostility, anger, and hate.  But why?  Because fanbois are mentally unstable - they identify as the game so any criticism to the game is received by them as a personal attacks.   If you criticism the game, even if  you fix the game and show up their precious developers, you have just committed a personal attack on their honor and they must respond in kind.  That's the psyche of a fanboi.\n\n[h1]COMMERCIAL SUICIDE[/h1]\nActually, it's not the fanboi's fault though.  Keen surrounded themselves with their fanbois early on, even took one of the most ravenous fanbois, gave him a job and had him be the community relations manager.  Yeah, you heard that right.  Xocliw, the guy in all of the Keen videos now was and still is one of the biggest fanbois of KSH and ALL of their games.  Of course you want someone who is kindly to your company, but it became more extreme when they tried to show that they were listening to their community by doing a LIVE Q&A.  The only problem is, you had to be one of those fanbois that filled out an Eve-style application to be on that Q&A.  No kidding, 100% of the participants were 100% fanboi and never asked a hard question - in fact, most were scripted already.  The event was theater, nothing more.\n\nKeen, by surrounding themselves with their bubble of fanbois guaranteed they would develop their game in an echo chamber.  If you play the game, just look around.  AI's that just fly in straight lines, 2 - I REPEAT 2 animals in the game, dogs (oh I'll get to that), and spiders.\n\nI knew there was a problem when they first released the dogs, I knew something just felt scammy.  They were called \"Cyber Hounds\" on release and if you look at the config files, you'll see that's what they are still called.  The reason was because when they released, they would spawn inside your ship while on Earth and blow things up.  Players literally called them \"Jihad Dogs\".  Also, within hours a patch was made to allow people to turn them off.\n\nBut what happened just before the patch is the perfect demonstration of the evils of fanbois and bringing them into your echo chambers.  Understand that at this point, they had already done their damage.  With Keen refusing to ban them or even discipline them in their forums, no one said anything negative to Keen fearing they would be trolled or cursed out by the fanbois.  So when this update with cyberhounds dropped, before ANYONE could even download it, they were literally commenting to the patch notes with, \"Wonderful!\", \"Courageous!\", \"outstanding!\", \"Best release yet!\".  It was like watching a snake consume itself.\n\nKeen could piss all over their community and these fanbois would praise them for the rain and then troll and attack anyone that questioned the temperature, color, and pungent odor of the liquid.\n\n[h1]STILL HOPE[/h1]\nNot really hope, but there is still a reason for people who have bought the game to still play.  Mods and Modders.  I will say this, the game is absolute dog s**t.  But after you start adding some mods, you can actually have some fun with the game.  Unfortunately, mods aren't supported and Keen makes that very clear by delisting your server the moment you add a mod to it.  They also give you a big warning pop-up when you enter \"experimental\" mod to install a mod basically saying they're not responsible for any gaming oddities. \n\nI'm not going to give this game a positive review with that kind of behavior. I love the mods and modders in fact they SHOULD be compensated (and I do donate when I see links in the workshop), but the developers and the game is trash.  The developers have made it extremely clear they are simply \"done\" with the game.  When a feature breaks, instead of fixing it, they throw it in the experimental pile with the modding.  They just announced they'll be adding oxygen and pressurization to that list.\n\nMy advice if you haven't purchased the game:  Don't.

I really do, I've sunk damn near 2000 hours into Space Engineers, making hundreds of ships, space stations, ground bases and even the occasional rover.\nBut the game doesn't seem to have a clear goal, and with the dev's most recent updates and livestreams, it's becoming fairly evident they want to wrap this game up as fast as possible and move on to another project. \n\nNow, the big issue with this is while Space Engineers has some fantastic features, the game can't even run a dedicated server with less than 6 people connected at once, all doing different things without having major sim speed issues and lag. And god forbid if you try to do any big battles using capital ships.\n\nThe worst part of the entire development process of this game is the insane waffling of features. Right now, everyone is clamoring for ladders to be added, since there's currently only two ways to move vertically in the game:\nA: Use a Jetpack \nOr\nB: Make a staircase\n\nJetpacks in trhis game take fuel, which early on can be a finite resource until you can find more.

In this game you can build your own spaceships, stations, asteroid bases, planetary bases, rovers, etc. Building a carrier that can launch small fighters? Sure! A space station in orbit with planetary bombardment capabilities? Why not? A mining platform that automatically drills itself into asteroids to collect ores? Of course! The possibilities are endless...\n\nJust like in Minecraft, you can either play in survival mode, where you have to collect resources to build things or in create mode where you can just build whatever your heart desires. The survival mode is not as fleshed out in my opinion and I usually stick to creative mode. Multiplayer is also supported and while it's not perfect, it works well enough to enjoy it.\n\nWhat this game does well is modeling physics. Unlike in some other games, your creations will adhere to the laws of physics. Usually this works as intended but for some creations the system might break, producing ... unexpected results that can result in your ship taking heavy damage or be destroyed. Unless you build some very advanced creations, this will not be a problem however.\n\nAnother great thing about this game is the Steam Workshop Support. You can download tons of creations to add to your world and - of course - also upload your own. You can mod your game to add new features, blocks and behavior. Just be mindful of the performance hit when you mod your game excessively. Performance overall is something to be aware of though. As your creations get larger and more complex, your FPS will tank hard, eventually coming down to single-digit levels for huge creations. This can and undoubtedly will diminish your experience at some point.\n\nHowever, the game is still very enjoyable and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes space and Minecraft-like games.

I assume that other players here are the \"common\" players and that is where there is a huge problem. \n\nThis game is pretty fun. You get to build buildings, stations, ships all from scratch and in any way you want. a personal highlight so far has been building a station inside of an asteroid and building a 3d printer to print small fighter ships. But that's about where it ends.\n\nThere is no meaningful PVE encounters built in. Some mods have done their best to add in some endgame PVE content but it's executed pretty poorly.

We started on an earth like planet and once we got to space, we realized there was no reason to go to any other planet. There are no special resources, or ships, or alien life to be explored. Just more rock, and the same materials on Earth.\n\nThe actual endgame is taking dozens of hours to build a large ship, and fighting other players with dozens of hours. But the ship combat is unfulfilling. There are some cool options/strategies, like drones and ship positioning (think broadsiding). But basically it's just ships shooting like crazy then limping away.

There is way more things to explore than in other games. You could spend a thousand hours on the game yet you wouldn't explore it fully.\n\nWhat annoys the people and make them post negative reviews are the details. It's true that the game has undergone some reckless patches, without any clear goal (remember they patch the game once a week.

If you bothered to read, you'd know that the new game netcode is being developed RIGHT NOW, so don't expect big patches unless the netcode is released.\n\nLet me tell you some of the things you have right now at space engineers:\n[list]\n[*] Pistons: Yeah, they are buggy right now IN MULTIPLAYER, but that'll get fixed. In single player they are functional.\n\n[*] Rotors: Hanger doors, Robotic arms, hidden turrets, moving platforms...\n\n[*] Conveyors: Item sorting, automated power / item transfer between ships...Combine with rotors for epic.\n\n[*] Planets: Fully moddable planets which add several engineering challenges, such as getting out of the atmosphere of a planet (yes, there is gravity and it's not that easy to get out of the planet, specially in survival), or surviving the long trips between planets.\n\n[*] Remote control and Drones: You can send your ship out of the planet without even being aboard. Obviously, this is not easy to do, and requires engineering (and maybe, programming skills if you want more functionality)\n\n[*] Programmable Blocks: There is an extensive API out of which you can make automated ship station, item sorters, radars, status reports, cargo managers... Or just display the time in an LCD.\n\n[*] Huge modding community: The developers are also focusing on adding modding support to many areas of the game, and right now there is a bunch of mods that ADD REAL FUNCTIONALITY to the game, plus cosmetic ones that look absolutely amazing.\n\n[*] Awesome ship designs in the Workshop: You can get an idea of what kind of ships you can make taking a look at some designs made by other people. You can recreate ships from films and series, like star wars, or from games like FTL. The game offer great building mechanics that make it suitable for a wide range of styles.\n\n[/list]\n\nSo yeah, the game is not BUG FREE, nor FEATURE COMPLETE, but right now it can give you LOTS OF FUN for many hours, and many engineering possibilities with all the mechanisms / machines included currently in the game.\n\nThe only serious con I'd see right now is optimization. Seriously, if you want to play on planets with large ships, be sure to get a high-tier gaming rig.

This game takes the cake in the engineering department when compared to other games of similar genre, it truly feels like you are able to design and engineer things to overcome a problem. The issue there is motive, why build thing to gather more stuff to build more thing? Survival needs more motive to actually survive and build better, otherwise this is just an engineering simulation that gets old quick. It also limits your personal engineering to the block design of those whom created them, perhaps you don't want your cockpit or oxygen generator in that spot, perhaps you'd place it elsewhere and run a hose or duct system through the build so it can remain more compact. This is too much like playing with Legos, where a piece only functions with a piece it was designed to function with, there isn't enough free-form in the way pieces can be linked together and remain functional.

A speed which you also attain by just using a [b] jetpack [/b], I can't genuinely relay how disheartening it is to build a great looking ship with multiple hydrogen thrusters only for it to cap it's speed out after 2 seconds and move at the pace of snail afterwards.\n\nThe weaponry is also very unimpressive, and considering how dull and pointless the survival is or pretty much any combat feels, there is no motivation to encourage to you make a decent looking combat ship either as it's again, purely for the looks.\n\nI mean just imagine it, if Bugatti's looked that great but then only got up to 100 km/h or you saw a amazing fighter jet but then you realize that it only has two 9mm pistols attached under it, do you get my point? After your first ship, the hype genuinely dies extremely fast.\n\n\n2) This game practically does not receive any updates that affect the game in an important manner whatsoever, you can just check for yourself in the link below, even changelogs tagged \"MAJOR UPDATE\" are just a huge array of bug fixes and DLCs that add LITERALLY nothing except reskins of already existing blocks.\n[url=https://support.keenswh.com/spaceengineers/pc/announcement/update-1-199-heavy-industry_1] This Link [/url] is the latest update the game has had, and it has been tagged as a major update, you can also check the rest of the updates on the right.\n\nThat is why I say this game has potential that is never being realized with such developers; This game has a great idea and space is an amazing bed for creative cultivation, however it needs a lot of work and constant stream of meaningful updates/overhauls for a while before I can say it is worthwhile.\n\nTL;DR Game has potential but too many unaddressed problems and it does not seem to be getting fixed considering the developer's history and actions so far.", "timestamp_created": 1639943473, "timestamp_updated": 1639943473, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 712, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816549777984619141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39186096": {"recommendationid": "39186096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178218778", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 774697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 135, "playtime_at_review": 156585, "last_played": 1713653888}, "language": "english", "review": "After so long in-game, I can't remember what year it is, let alone day.

This is because the build time/destruction time ratio is so huge that players have no reason to trust anyone or pick anything resembling a fair fight (Which, in itself, is rare) which makes pvp scarce and one-sided, even on servers dedicated to it.\n\nServers often struggle to meet the needs of a dozen players, which heavily contrasts the expansivness of the game worlds, making servers feel flimsy and empty.\nI imagine a game with huge player corperations duking it out for territory with frequent fleet battles, abit like EVE online but with voxel building, and i'll scream off the rooftops about this game if that ever comes to be.\n\nUntil then I can't recommend this game.
