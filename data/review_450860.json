If you've played early versions of games like 7 Days to Die (the early tech demo before they started using at least some of their own models) or pretty much any other cheap/free survival game you've seen everything that's here. I'm pretty sure this is what you end up with if you follow the (free) tutorial on how to use unity to build a survival game.\n\nAt this price I don't particularly care that it's an asset flip, but I do care that the world you are in is the size of a postage stamp (you are in a tiny valley surrounded by walls that can not be climbed), and that there's almost nothing to do. You spawn next to a car, you can drive around and see the entire valley in less than 5 minutes. Crash the car, kill a boar and a chicken for the achievements and you'll have 100% finished the game in that amount of time. (do note that some of the other reviews are wrong: you do not need the DLC for the achievements, the DLC adds colors to the car, you only need to drive the car for the achievement, not change its color...)\n\nCan you just survive in the world beyond that? Sure, it's an almost functional game. I could almost recommend it for $1 and it's cheap enough (especially on sale) that if you just want easy achievements you can probably just go ahead and buy it. But what actually stops me from recommending it is that it's just too buggy and glitched to suffer through to even attempt enjoying it for longer than that. \n\nI played for 30 minutes just trying to find content, once you chop down a tree, make yourself a bow and some arrows, you're mostly done. I saw one zombie and one alien and they died to a couple of arrows without being interesting.\n\nPlace your tent, place your fire and..... ? Wait? For what? For another glitch to get me stuck in a tree? For another glitch to stop my mouse from being able to turn? For another glitch to fall through the world?\n\nAlso note: the game is no longer in early access, it's been \"released\" for 3 years now and despite promises from the developer that more content would be added, nothing has been. No additional maps, no additional enemies, no new buildings or things to do. But hey, you can pay extra for a gun instead of a bow so that you can kill the same 3 enemies in one less shot or to change the color of the car. Because that's just what a cheap low effort asset flip game needs: microtransactions for cosmetics!\n---\n\nBottom line: There's the start of a very basic survival game here, but it's barely started and lacks anything to really do; and there's too many glitches to even enjoy what little there is.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1605917596, "timestamp_updated": 1608670298, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608086705207824707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36154476": {"recommendationid": "36154476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388539881", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 408, "last_played": 1512147001}, "language": "english", "review": "It needs more stuff but i really enjoy this game.  i love it.", "timestamp_created": 1509411699, "timestamp_updated": 1509411699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605323493480682373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139791970": {"recommendationid": "139791970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004171929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 165, "playtime_forever": 1453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1453, "last_played": 1661639421}, "language": "english", "review": "Got a cat here.

You start the world with a car, an (probably, I didn't test) uninterative prefabricated frame of a building with a car inside, food and water, a not factory-made but pre-crafted hammer from resources in the wild... a campfire and a tent that does nothing but WHINE to you that you are not tired yet even when it is dark! Everything you need is already in the backback, now all that there is to do is building Mansion de la Blablabla. What am I doing!? Where are me after!? I got a car! I can get out of here! You got everything to get out of the wild and find urban life. But instead, you're stuck inside a box of 2D mountains, and get forced to what the game wants you to do...\n\n[b]\"What?\"[/b] you might ask? I don't know... I really don't...\nthe first thing I did was:\n[i]-Get in car, crash car to tree\n-Roadkill boar\n-Roadkill chicken[/i]\nIt was hard to find chicken, chicken small.\n\nIn another thing instead of following the non-existing tutorial or reading the game manual of \"How to survive in wild for dummies\" I did what the achievements told me to do. Well, car has no gas, came to realize that \"Tab\" opens up the crafting panel. Selecting fuel... 30 corn... You know what, I walk - Thank you very much!\nI place down the campfire close to pond, to fire it up it needs logs or sticks, well thank God I got this precrafted hammer, better start chopping trees with a hammer (it worked!)\nI still had meat from boar and chicken as well as bone and fur, might as well cook meat by the campfire. The campfire emits light and generates coal after burning logs.\nGreat, it's getting dark soon, I tried crafting a torch, but I don't have \"clothes\". Well, better HAMMER some stone... I get stone, coal, metal ore, sulfer ore and I start blinking intensally right after the rock just exploded not to be seen again. That was metal as fuck!\n\nI got enough stone to craft what looks like a kiln, I melted down all the ores with it, I cook my raw meat with it, I burn my fur to get [b]C L O T H E S[/b] with it, I pressed C and got on one knee to marry it, she said \"Yes\" and then gave me coal. That kiln is my everything. I stared inside the fire a lot to see my hopes and dreams burn away not turning to ash... but COALS.\n\nI got clothes, now I can craft a torch, did nothing, emits not enough light to see past 1 meter in front of you.\n\nWhile the log count from the kiln (yes, more coal) ticks away... it got darker...\n\nAliens... zombies... mother boars... I didn't hear- or see them just yet. I quickly put down my tent in front of the pond to dream of babbling brooks, I was pressing E on the tent and it started talking to me: \"Shhhh... you're not tired yet.\" FOR FUCK 'S SAKE! I'm getting TIRED of this game! Not done yet however, I was curious for a few more things just when I really have the urge to quit the game...\nI started crafting... an anvil... because my dumbass brain really would thing that you can't craft a literal GUN with just bare hands, limited materials and thin air! The anvil does nothing more other than repair your existing tools in your backpack. OKAY! One last thing I was curious about: WATER, I was about to dream about it but instead I stood in the middle of the pond and I saw \"OPEN\". And you know what I did? I opened up the pond and it had drinkable water, jar and all, right for the picking... it was on that moment, I did quit.\n\nI really want to believe but I didn't saw aliens, I didn't saw dead people eating brains, I didn't saw mother boar angry at me after roadkilling her babies. NOTHING! I didn't see anything. Even better, the whole map is a whole lot of nothing.\n\nStill don't know what the coal was for, by the logic of the game its probably meant for crafting gunpowder. But it turns out, you probably could make a gun with your bare hands instead of an anvil. *smh*\n\nI find myself questioning; What is the real purpose of the game? Is it meant to fun? Has it challenge? Did I leave the sink faucet on? These are all questions that I find difficult to determine whether it is really meant to be.\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[i]-Cars go D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu! I've been in this pl-\n-Kiln is my new kink[/i]\n[b]Meh:[/b]\n[i]-Left one detail, I turned off \"Aliens and Zombies\" for the fuck of it![/i]\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[i]-Everything else!\n-Asset flip\n-The animals don't care much if you kill them (exception for boars)\n-Drinkable water from nature's pond water\n-The surrounding world is empty, there's nothing to do...\n-Haven't tried building... but if you're not building on flat terrain, good luck!\n-Kiln for life, the rest can fuck off!\n-Trees and rocks just explode when they're out of materials for you.\n-Every time you walk, the panning footstep sounds from left to right are annoying and I hate that.\n-Torch and campfire don't emit much light, but when the sun is down you can see the ponds glow from afar.\n-You can craft shotgun shells, but there's no shotgun to be crafted\n-Guns need ammo (obviously), but to make 1 singular ammo shell you need 1 metal fragment which are made melting metal ores and gunpowder, to make gunpowder you need coal (I was right, I had to go back to check) sulfur and 3 potassium nitrate harvested from rocks...\n-Stick to bow and arrow, fuck guns.\n-No multiplay (not that I care)\n-No tutorial\n-No guide\n-No farming\n-No livestock\n-No escape\n-Options are limited[/i]\n\nI really did try to like it, but the game didn't let me. The only thing more enjoyable than watching the kiln burning my hard work is driving around the woods with my car. But that CAR isn't the game's goal! Building a house is, surviving is, eating boar fur and drinking pond water is! But there are better games out there that do a much better job in this genre, like 250% better! The Forest has better survival and other genres to satisfy your gaming palet, with cannibals, a story and other riff-rafts (speaking of which;) Raft has a better survival and eye-candy appeal and story other than this asset-flipper, fucking 7 Days to Die has zombies in it, survival and can be played with friends, HELL! All 3 mentioned can be played together with friends. And before you say; [i]\"apples/pears\"[/i], I'm really just trying to pester you away from this game and let your precious 0,39\u20ac not to be wasted on this piece of work.

Without them there is no point in even playing. The world is pretty small and it only takers a few minutes of resource gathering and you are going to survive without any effort. \n\nAnd yes you can buld houses, but why bother when there are already so many houses avaialble that you can inhabit without any effort.

It is good if it was someone learning how to make video games but it doesn't even play smoothly.\nWhy a cap at 30FPS?

Must get better.\nSound too loud, headphone users be aware when you start the game, you must lower the volume immediately.\nAim, oh, the aim, I crafted 4 spears, tried using them and guess what, they don't even get thrown where you aim them, they get thrown somewhere else for some reason. Another thing, forget about picking them up to use them again, you'll have a hard time trying to find it.\n\nI didn't get past this because I thought it was too boring to start with, not much action, I guess that needs to be changed. You can consider my review incomplete because I haven't seen the city, the vehicles, the threats (if they actually exist) nor the guns, haven't used much of the crafting system either because it is kinda hard to find the stuff to use. Cloth? Never seen it, but most of the crafting needs it. Maybe I'll try this later again after it releases but for now it is boring, trashy, too amateur.\n\nI got the whole game plus DLCs for less than 1 euro so I'm not even mad.
