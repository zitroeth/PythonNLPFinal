The gameplay, although a little annoying at times, keeps itself interesting and simple. I've been addicted to this game ever since I was 8 years old, and it affected a major part of my child hood. The game itself isn't too hard, (although you can increase and decrease it's difficulty!) but is a little bit complicated. I can also definitely tell the dev's didn't take this game too seriously with its silly references, enemy and boss concepts, and just generally a goofy take at some pixel art. For $10, this game is a steal. I still haven't fully completed 100% of the achievements on my steam account despite having over 500 hours in the game. Very replayable, with a ton of secret worlds and easter eggs to discover. I might be a bit biased due to having a nostalgic connection to the game, but it seriously does deserve your time and money. 11/10.", "timestamp_created": 1710544966, "timestamp_updated": 1710544966,

has been made. I'm struggling to make this review because I want to keep it simple but I can't, so I'll try to highlight the things that I most like in it and give some good tips as well. [/i] \n\nThis game is really good.\n\n[b] Alright, here it goes some of the highlights [/b]\n\n [i] A Special thanks to the Zoologist npc, who turned my boyfriend into a Furry Femboy 10/10. [/i] \n [i] The Dryad painting in the Dungeon is the best reward you can get in there. [/i]\n [i] The Sigma Cyborg, who will always be remembered. [/i]\n\n I recommend this game for those with creative minds and also for those who like adventures. There are lots of enemies and bosses to fight and a lot of places and npcs to discover, this game will make you entertained for a long while. \n\nThe graphics are very consistent. \n\nIt has one of the best soundtracks ever made that fits within the game.\n\nseamless experience most of the time.\n\n To get the most out of this game I really recommend you to play at least the first half on your own, i.e., without looking through internet guides until you you find yourself lost about what to do next.\nKeep in mind that this game is well known for having a lot of materials/items that you'll need to have so you can make progress, but it doesn't tell you exactly what to do, so you might use a lot of the internet guides/wiki at some point.  \n\n[b] Achievements: [/b] Patience is what you need to 100%  this. I recommended starting the achievements as soon as you begin playing, some achievements requires a lot of grinding, half of them will come naturally, I wouldn't recommend this game if you are only looking to get the achievements.\n\n[b] Difficulty: [/b] This game is difficult but you can make it easier with some character options in the character creation screen. You can also play in the Journey mode, which is kind of a creative mode that still allows you to progress through the game and earn achievements as well.\n\n[b] Overall I recommend this if you like games that mixes sandbox with adventure.

At first, this game seems like an action platformer game with some building and crafting mechanics, something that was present in many games developed in the same period, but as the player explores the randomly generated worlds items can be discovered, along with the realization that there is more hidden beneath its apparent straightforwardness. \n\nAs you start the game, you can create a character, and among choices like clothes and hairstyles you can choose the difficulty, where journey offers a distinct experience than the others, where you start with more equipment and mechanics geared toward a more creative play style. \n\nYou can also choose between classic and mediumcore that change between money or items dropped upon death and hardcore, where your character, as the game puts it, dies for good. This is not the only choice before starting the game, you can also customize the world you\u2019ll play, starting off with names, that can be randomly picked, the seed that  holds secrets of its own, the size of the map ranging from small to large, the initial difficulty and the main force against the player, the corruption or the crimson, that along with specific enemies also present unique items. \n\nWith all that set up, the player spawns close to a guide and a new world to explore. While mining and fighting, new weapons, armor and tools become necessary and something unique to Terraria, building houses for the characters spread throughout the world. \n\nAs the player explores the world, bosses can be found and those too hold the key to progress in difficulty and item availability. Tiers of better equipment can be created making challenging enemies less imposing.

Maybe I'd be willing to overlook the problems I have with Terraria if I had started playing this when I was 14 and had infinite amount of free time to play and investigate on various websites on how to craft things and optimal strategies for different bosses, npc favorite biomes, etc. Maybe in that case I'd be alright with all the jank and my complaints but regardless, that's not the case and you should only read this review as a new player who's never picked up the game and is first trying it in 2024, dropped in cold without any prior homework on how anything works as I normally jump into most games I play.\n\nFor context I started playing in a multiplayer group with a couple of friends and to be fair I do enjoy playing with them, the problem is I just feel utterly useless in this game cause I have 0 knowledge on how anything works and without my friends I wouldn't have over 75% of the equipment I have. Mind you, I'm pretty literate when it comes to video game mechanics, and I'm decent in both sidescrollers and conventional survival games. I even dabble in grand strategies games as well like stellaris, civ, etc. I'm not scared of complexity in my games. Hell you can even go ahead and check my steam profile, I have 100% achievement on some games, I really don't consider myself a casual gamer either. Despite all that, how is this game so complicated in it's crafting recipes and progression that unless I have a serperate website open like a wiki, I'd be unable to progress even though I'm okay at most video games? It's just bad game design honestly. If you wanted a super complex tiered system for equipment, good on you, but you have to design around it for new players. How difficult would it had been to add that if you went to a crafting table, they'd gave you all the options of what you can make grayed out so you'd at least an idea of what you could work towards, or maybe a book or separate item that gives you a descriptions of different items and possible crafting recipes. and don't even get me started on inventory management. Why isn't there a smart craft system where I can access all my items when crafting from within a chest if it's in the same house? It's not like the game doesn't know you're in a house, they have a whole mechanic around it.\n\nI've played about 15-16 hours and have progressed so much, despite that, it's probably nothing in the grand scheme of things because of the nature of how you replace gear and upgrade items but so far I have this full set of molten armor, enough accessories with modifiers to have about 41 armour, a night's edge, some other stuff I can't remember like a fire-y boomerang and a tri-boomerang as well. I guarantee you that if it wasn't a multiplayer lobby where I'm playing with hardened veterans, just this item set alone, this whole setup would had taken me at least 40-60 hours to obtain. You have to scour the world for a lot of these items and the awesome sword you just made is really just some shitty reagent needed for another more incredible sword. but now you don't want the incredible sword, now you want the epic sword. but now that epic sword is the ingredient for the more epic sauce sword, rinse and repeat. And realistically without the wiki, you'd have no idea how to make any of this. I guarantee anyone who would shoot down my review by saying \"well that's progression innit\" or \"get good\" wouldn't had figured any of it out without talking to friends and/or consulting with an external website and have just been used to this system for years so they don't even bat an eye to it, but in doing so you make the barrier to entry for new players that's impossibly hard to jump over. \n\nBoss battles are a complete clusterfuck, for a game called Terraria they really made no attempt to make bosses that fit in to their terrains at all. You have to make these massive boss arenas, where if I had no idea a boss was going to appear from breaking X block, killing X mobs or talking to X npc, I'd be caught completely off guard and wiped in seconds because I didn't take the time to prepare a 500+ platform structure to be able to kite and dodge these relentless rain of damage coming at me and if you're overgeared you don't even need to think about dodging or anything because you just faceroll everything. There's almost no proper middle ground. Keep in mind, like I stated before, I'm playing in a multiplayer lobby with about 4-6 players consistently, there are some bosses I can't even fathom being able to had taken on by myself, because sometimes bosses would just disappear if everyone dies and it resets the whole encounter (it might even happen with all bosses, I'm not sure). I've not had a single boss fight in my friend group where every member doesn't die at least once and that's without counting me and other newish players who die multiple times on the same boss, we're essentially cannon fodder. I can't imagine a more tortuous way to play this game than doing it in single player. \n\nMining and block placement is also super jank. You can mine blocks behind walls that you can't directly see, which could be useful and cool if the blocks weren't the size of like 3 pixels and I missclicked constantly (skill issue ik, but this review is from a new player with about 15 hours in). I had a particularly hard time learning to pillar and how platforms work. You can mine into a pathway but when you come back you're bumping up against a block on your head/feet (which makes no sense to me). Sometimes I get stuck on like 1 pixel partially broken block which is also very annoying. But what really infuriated me was that I started picking up ebonstone and placing it around cause I though it looked cool. I was using it as my default stone for whenever I needed to pillar, make infinite water pools, etc. I was placing this shit everywhere for a whole session (about 3-4 hours), only to realize from someone else in the group that if you place this shit somewhere it'll spread corruption in the world. Why isn't this explained anywhere? I had no idea that I've been essentially putting little corruption seeds all over our multiplayer Terarria world, which circles back to the whole idea of feeling useless in my party, if anything I'm a liability at this point. Granted no one really complained or does anything to make me feel this way, it's just how I feel because of how uninitiative and incomprehensible the game mechanics are for new players like myself. \n\nI'm probably going to continue playing the game for a bit with my friends because I like spending time with them, but realistically and the reason I don't recommend this game is, if I had to pick a game to play or if I was thinking of a fun single player game, I'd never in my life pick this game. I can't recommend a game with these many issues to a new player because I know how frustrating it's been for myself and I don't think it's worth the hassle. I think about how approachable a game is for new gamers and there's very few games I'd think are as unintuitive and uninviting as this game is.", "timestamp_created": 1710847444, "timestamp_updated": 1710848081, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540338516235351563", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157735762": {"recommendationid": "157735762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198445273279", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 7087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7049, "last_played": 1707764105}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1707250999, "timestamp_updated": 1707250999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53947371244430542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162698504": {"recommendationid": "162698504", "author": {"steamid": "76561199024294312", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 36915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36915, "last_played": 1710655159}, "language": "english", "review": "ter-RAWR-ria, not ter-RARE-ria", "timestamp_created": 1712887555, "timestamp_updated": 1712887555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538461565971374512", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162653245": {"recommendationid": "162653245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198850717125", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 14586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14586, "last_played": 1708710304}, "language": "english", "review": "I made a challenge for myself to try and beat the game on hardcore mode in an expert world, before even beating the game in normal difficulty.\r\nAnd well, It is safe to say that I hate myself and everything else to such an astronomical degree that even I fail to comprehend how much rage I currently contain.\r\nWhy did I do this to myself?

and it is but far more detailed. it is less about the building and more about the combat. \nterraria has many bosses and a progression system that unlocks new, powerful and quicker weapons and tools that make it easier to explore, fight and build. there are npcs in the game that each provide their own unique items for you to purchase from them. the game has a pixel artstyle which will grow on you. there are tons of blocks in the game that allows you to create anything. all you need to do is build, much like minecraft.\n\ngathering certain items take ages and are reliant on luck. which is fine, its just that the time it takes for these items takes hours to gather. thats where most of my time in the game is. fighting loads of enemies to try and get the rarest drops, fishing for biome crates to find exclusive items and refighting bosses because you get unlucky with their drops. the bosses are tons of fun to fight but the fact the item you want to drop doesnt appear, it just sucks. \n\nthe multiplayer is probably the most fun part. exploring the randomly generated world with others, everyone using different weapons, and everyone going on their own quests for different items and seeing people building stuff around the world.\n\ni highly recommend terraria. the combat with bosses is the main part i enjoy although i enjoy building fishing ponds, storage buildings, crafting buildings and boss arenas. but theres far more you can have fun with. just try it.", "timestamp_created": 1710598945, "timestamp_updated": 1710598945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny":

Firstly, it has hands down the single best inventory management system in any game, and it's a good thing it does, as it also has far more items than most. Despite the incredible library of enemies, drops, and craftables, it never feels bloated, and never seems to buckle under its own weight. On the contrary, seeing the vastness of the game lying ahead, is exciting and motivating, rather than intimidating. The progression on your first play might be a little on the \"If you know, you know\" side, as far as knowing what milestones to work towards, but the end result is a world and gameplay that evolves creatively as you progress.\r\n\r\nPeople will call it flat Minecraft, but frankly, past the first 10 minutes that ceases to be true. You will mine, and you will craft, but it's far closer to an RPG than anything else. Getting stronger, getting money, and thinking about your build is a fantastically rewarding experience, and the different difficulties ensure that you can continue having fun well after learning most of the items and tricks. Furthermore, the depth and variety of play-styles make it so that no two play-throughs need to be the same. The rich class system leaves plenty of room for you to impose your own challenges, leading to limitless replay-ability\r\n\r\nOver a decade of huge content updates, for absolutely free, make this one of the best value games on steam. Whether you're at the start of the game, or well past the end, or whether you're playing alone, or with a crew, it's fun at every stage.

It's a massive completely interactive pixel world where you can destroy and build everything, the ground, trees, rocks, even clouds are yours to shape as you please and the gameplay delivers everything in a satisfying power curve so that more things become available as you progress and increase in power. Your ability to deal with enemies increases until monsters become insignificant, and then everything gets harder again. There always seems to be more to discover and new things to see, new materials to find, new equipment to forge.\n\nVery few games are ever this good, It's worth every penny at full price and it's a steal on sale.

Maybe i might commit to Modded playthroughs one day if i come back playing the game again\n\n============== My thoughts on the game? ===============\n\nProgression in this game is incredibly fun unlike other games, i would recommend diving in the wiki for progression if it starts to get stale for you, you'd probably get lost on what to do next to progress further, the whole playthrough for a new player would probably be around 20 hours or something\n\nCollecting items in this game is fun, i collected every item possible and had multiple duplicates of each\n\nTrying out different loadouts is fun, tho i would recommend sticking to one loadout in your playthrough till the end, if you wanna try the other loadouts try a new playthrough, its fun, world hopping is easy and accessible so no need to worry about loosing something.\n\nBuilding is something to get used to, it can be similar to Minecraft's Redstone builds as well when it comes to the technical parts\n\nPlay with friends, this game has like the best Coop ever, a sandbox survival game where near the end it starts to look like an MMO game where you see players having crazy godlike abilities, the Power growth in this game is satisfying, no friends no worries, the game is just as fun without them, i only got to playing with friends the time i already finished the game in both mobile and Pc.", "timestamp_created":

Terraria is peak, it's fun, provides a challenge, best death messages, best communnity, funniest workshop, a GOATED dev team, and some of the best music. You're not limited to anything. Terraria revolves around Exploration, Combat and creating a world. The NPCs have personalities, the lore is rich. No matter how many times you die in game, it's worth the money. If you haven't bought already, get it. I would usually make a memey review but this game deserves a proper one. This game has literally everything imaginable, and for 10 dollars. People have sunk 1000-2000, some even 3000 hours into this game, and I intend to do the same. I suggest you stop reading this and spend your damn money.

"language": "english", "review": "I've spent around 1k hours on Terraria and around 600 on Mods. I loved this game so much so that I have became the walking encyclopedia for my friends that were playing this game.\n\nTo be honest, the game requires a little bit of research to get into as there isn't a lot of obvious directions/tips in the game. After you understood the progression, then the game could be played normally. In addition, this game is meant to be played multiple times in order for this game to be fully appreciated.\n\nThose who were asking for quality game content, the game has a lot of secrets and ways to play the game. First of all, Terraria has a main boss progression, where the game ends at Moon Lord's defeat and/or obtaining Zenith. The game also gives ways to play the game such as building, wiring/mechanics, fishing and so on so forth.. Each of the classes and subclasses are worth trying. I remember I had some fun time playing with only fished items.\n\nThe game is well worth the money. A single, well-played and tended world/character could easily last around 50 hours or more. If you decide that you want to play this game to the fullest, You might spend around 300-600 hours doing so (depends on how you would like to play the game). For those of the players that wishes to challenge themselves, the game also comes with different difficulties. However, the different difficulties might not suit everyone. Imagine a boss with a giant hitbox and fast moving speed three shots your in-game character, Or getting swarmed by event mobs so much so that you get spawn camped (An absolute nightmare in medium core).\n\nAs advertised, the game has some of the best art designs in the pixel game categories, and the sprites of the bosses, mobs and NPC's are very coherent and logical.\n\nOn the side note, the game itself is not designed for computers with low-preforming graphic cores. The game gets a little bit laggy once there is too much happening on your screen. Things like weapon projectiles, chests and relics, too much texture packs and mods from the steam workshop, and perhaps your friends with the better graphics core could might potentially lag your own game. The game might change into a slideshow or a slow motion video if your computer's not really good. I am hoping the Terraria devs work on a more graphics friendly option such as disabling cosmetic particle or something.\n\nTo all of the players out there still deciding if they should buy the game, buy it. Its well worth the money, and the devs are even still refining Terraria even though they've announced the last update.", "timestamp_created": 1710066193, "timestamp_updated": 1710066193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160223348": {"recommendationid": "160223348", "author": {"steamid": "76561199047791530", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2814, "last_played": 1710736364}, "language": "english", "review": "THE GAME IS SO GOOD PLAY IT NOW AND JOIN THE DISCORD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUGHHHHHHHHHHHH", "timestamp_created": 1710030686, "timestamp_updated": 1710030686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160208824": {"recommendationid": "160208824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124061659", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "playtime_at_review": 5925, "last_played": 1713777845}, "language": "english", "review": "Step 1.

The Calamity mod with which i played the majority of the game with added even more depth to the game with amazing bosses and items. However, i did struggle a bit at first with the grinding and progression, but playing with experienced players helped me figure things out.\n\nThe boss fights were intense and required precise movement and dodging skills, which took some time to master. But once I got the hang of it, it was incredibly satisfying to defeat them. The building aspect of the game was also a highlight for me, given that there are no limits to your creativity.\n\nI enjoyed trying out different classes in my playthroughs, including mage, summoner and rogue. Each class offered a unique gameplay experience and added variety to the game. The boss soundtracks were also remarkable and added to the overall immersion of the game.\n\nPlaying with friends or a partner was definitely the best way to experience this game, as it added an extra layer of fun and collaboration. Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys crafting, grinding, building and challenging boss fights.

"playtime_at_review": 7414, "last_played": 1710882329}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Overview[/h1]\nA game about exploration and crafting, you could say it's basically a 2D Minecraft, but it actually has a very different vibe to it, but such as Minecraft, it's the kind of game you can play for hours, building, farming, fishing, exploring or doing whatever you want, and if you ever get bored, you can use community-made mods to increase the game's potential even further.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIt's a survival craft game, meaning you have to get resources through the world, mainly through mining and gathering, as well as hunting monsters. Fortunately there's no \"hunger\" in this game (unless you are playing in some very specific world seeds) and you can progress comfortably at your pace. There are also things such as dungeons and boss fights which you need to go through if you want to progress in the game's \"story\".\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe game features high quality pixel art, which you can say the developers put a lot of work in considering how many creatures, furniture and kinds of blocks this game has.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe game has a really good soundtrack, each world biome and boss has it's own theme. The sound effects are great, and you may even recognize some references in them (such as the zombie sound).\n\n[h1]Price[/h1]\nThe game is very cheap considering the quality and amount of content it has, I would even say it would still be worth it even if it were more expensive.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nYou can choose the overall difficulty level at both character and world creation, but regardless of the difficulty you choose the game also features an event where it gets much harder after beating the mid-game boss.\n\n[h1]Duration[/h1]\nThe game is extremely long, beating it and getting all achievements took me about 120 hours, and I usually play multiplayer so I had help most of that time, and you can extend your playtime even further with mods.\n\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\nLike Minecaft, this game manages to still be fun no matter how many times you play it, besides, harder difficulties can give you some different loot and as mentioned earlier you can add mods to add more content if you ever get bored or want something new.\n\n[h1]Achievements[/h1]\nMost of the achievements are get naturally while progressing through the game, but since some of them require you to defeat bosses (some of which are optional), get rare equipment and do very specific tasks, you could say they are fairly challenging.\n\n[h1]Problems[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]In some very rare occasions, using a lifeform analyzer or radar displays the time, as if you were with a watch, probably due to the fact that they can have their funcions combined.\n\n[*]The achievement to get a key and open a chest in the dungeon is unlocked immediately after getting a key, opening a chest is not necessary (or maybe this happened because my friend had already opened a chest before I got the key?).\n\n[*]Rarely the Stardust Dragon summon may glitch if you change your equipment loadout and his head becomes detached from the body.\n\n[*]In some very rare occasions, enemies (more commonly slimes) move through walls.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1708118718, "timestamp_updated": 1708289091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

Picture this: you're a tiny, pixelated adventurer armed with nothing but a wooden sword and a head full of dreams. Well, buckle up, because those dreams are about to get wilder than a party with the Goblin Tinkerer!\r\n\r\nTerraria isn't just a game, it's a journey. And boy, what a ride it is! From the moment you start digging your first dirt block, you'll be hooked faster than a piranha in a pond. Seriously, try to tear yourself away from the screen\u2014I dare you! Spoiler alert: you can't. It's like trying to resist the urge to grab every single chest you see (hint: you can't do that either).\r\n\r\nBut let's talk about the real star of the show here: the sheer amount of stuff to do! You want to build a towering castle in the clouds? Go for it! How about delving into the depths of the earth to battle gigantic worms and collect shiny loot? Heck yeah! And let's not forget about the boss battles\u2014because nothing screams family bonding like teaming up with your kiddo to take down a giant eyeball or a mechanical monstrosity.\r\n\r\nOh, and did I mention the soundtrack? Because holy moly, it's like bopping along to the catchiest tunes this side of the Corruption. Just try not to hum the theme song every time you close your eyes. Spoiler alert: you can't. It's impossible.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the best part of Terraria isn't the epic loot or the heart-pounding battles\u2014it's the memories you'll make along the way. Whether you're laughing hysterically as you accidentally flood your base (again) or high-fiving each other after finally defeating that pesky Skeletron, Terraria is all about sharing those moments with the ones you love.\r\n\r\nSo grab your trusty pickaxe, rally your squad, and get ready for an adventure that's bigger, badder, and blockier than anything you've ever experienced.

(basically putting me back in the place i was at on terraria 1.0 release, however i had all the best weapons on terraria 1.0 and they were legendary) so gear/ weapons wise i'm not where i was at. \nbut as far as the progressional system goes in terraria 2, it's masterpiece adding tiers upon tiers of progressional unlocks that are even beyond MMO's capabilities. this isn't a full review nor do i care to make a indepth review. i just wanted to state the extreme masterpiece of writing the individuals done to add the tiered system to this game. it's phenomenal! and smashes the competition to dust. \ni was originally intending on just helping my brother beat the bosses and what not, but the game is really good and addicting and has so much to offer that World of Warcraft has lesser

"playtime_at_review": 66004, "last_played": 1704072508}, "language": "english", "review": "Terraria's latest major update, [strike]Journey's End (1.4)[/strike] Labor of Love (1.4.4) is here. And it's great! I'll explain to all of you why I recommend Terraria. You should get this game right now since the game is essentially complete and is full of content (and thanks for all the feedback on my review! It's much appreciated).\n\n\n[b]Intro:[/b]\nIf I were to explain Terraria to someone quickly, I would put it like this: Terraria is a game that has a whole world to explore. You mine, build, craft, fish, and fight to progress through the game. You can focus on fighting enemies and improving your gear to fight various bosses, and/or you can focus on building your house and buildings and making things look pretty. Terraria has something for everyone. The combination of survival, fighting, exploration, and building aspects is satisfying (and I'm someone who usually plays shooter games). So I believe that you can find something in Terraria for you.\n\n\n[b]Building:[/b]\nWhen Re-Logic added half blocks and slanted blocks to Terraria in 1.2, the building got so much more interesting and versatile. There are so many different types of blocks in this game with their own unique textures and styles, and with paint there are even more possibilities. So many creations made in this game are incredibly good.\n\n\n[b]Difficulty:[/b]\nOverall, Terraria with a Classic (AKA Softcore) character and Classic (AKA Normal Mode) world is not that hard, but just be aware that no matter what, you\u2019ll probably die a lot as a beginner. If you like a challenge, however, Expert Mode is the way to go (plus you get extra advantages, such as exclusive accessories, for having an increased difficulty). Even more difficult is Master Mode, giving you more loot than Expert Mode. And if you want the game to be especially difficult, you could create a Mediumcore character (drop all items on death), Hardcore character (permadeath), or use a world seed such as For the worthy. There is also Journey Mode, which is an adjustable difficulty semi-creative mode that requires a Journey exclusive character (can\u2019t go to Classic, Expert Mode, or Master Mode worlds). Personally, I think playing a Classic character in Expert Mode is the most fun way to play.\n\n\n[b]Music:[/b]\nTerraria\u2019s music is great. All of it fits with the style of the game. Almost every biome has a unique song to fit with the theme, and there are different songs for bosses and events as well. I bought the official soundtrack and I love to listen to it whenever I want some background music.\n\n\n[b]Multiplayer:[/b]\nMultiplayer is incredibly easy to set up. The easiest way to play is to join/host through Steam. You can also enter an IP address, which, before 1.3, used to be the only way to play multiplayer at all, but now it's so much easier with Steam integration.\n\nConnection is rarely a problem for me, although I think I\u2019ve found that the host has worse lag than the other players, when there is lag that is.\n\nTerraria is very fun to play with friends and even with strangers. There are teaming options, PVP, and other multiplayer elements built into the game. Bosses are often much easier to beat in multiplayer as well, because usually if one player dies, the other player(s) can continue to fight the boss and stay alive long enough to let the first player respawn.\n\n\n[b]Performance:[/b]\nTerraria runs very well. On my gaming PC, the game runs perfectly on max settings and has nearly instantaneous loading speeds. On my over a decade old Toshiba laptop, the game runs very nicely on low settings, with only minor loading times.\n\nThere are several video settings that can be modified to help performance. I would recommend at least turning the background and effects off for lower-end computers.\n\n\n[b]Price:[/b]\nTerraria is very inexpensive. It\u2019s one of the few games I\u2019ve bought at full price and found it completely worth it.\n\n\n[b]Struggles:[/b]\nTerraria has a learning curve. There are many things left up to you to figure out from the start. The Guide NPC is there to give some help. Many things, however, are left up to the player to figure out, much of which is just learned through time and experience. I would recommend looking up tips, tricks, and other information online, such as on the Official Terraria Wiki, or watch videos, like those of ChippyGaming and Edward on YouTube. Personally, I enjoy the learning curve, and the struggle to learn new things is just the right amount to be enjoyable and not annoying.\n\nTo get to the endgame of Terraria, it does take a while. There is so much content and so many bosses in just vanilla Terraria, that it can be overwhelming, and progression can sometimes feel slow. You may want to rush things like bosses, but you have to prepare well for bosses, or else you\u2019ll probably die. I used to ragequit when I couldn\u2019t beat bosses, and I still get frustrated if I can\u2019t beat a boss. Once you defeat bosses, however, it feels so worth it. And you don\u2019t have to follow an exactly linear path either. Also, you don\u2019t have to play for 30+ hours for a full playthrough just to feel accomplished. From one to a million hours, this game is fun for any length of time.\n\nMy biggest struggle with this game is the grind for certain items. Some items are extremely hard to get, due to low drop rates or pretty extreme circumstances. There are many items with a drop chance lower than 1%. Realistically, you won\u2019t get every item in the game, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re aiming for. I once wanted to get every enemy banner in the game (you have to kill 50 of the same enemy to get a banner) legitimately, but I gave up on that idea because of how grindy it is to kill 50 of each enemy for the rarest ones (that darn Nymph Banner). To put it simply, it\u2019s possible to get every item in the game, but it\u2019s just not worth it. You should, however, build farms for certain items. But the point is, just get the items in the game that you really want to get legitimately, and it\u2019ll be worth it (if you did want every single item in the game, you can use inventory editors or go to free item servers, but it\u2019s not fun to abuse these).\n\n\n[b]Tips:[/b]\n* Organize and name chests ASAP\n* Place rope down a Hellevator\n* Coral Torches are waterproof and Cursed/Ichor Torches (craftable in Hardmode) are liquidproof, making them ideal for being placed on bridges and Hellevators\n* The Smart Cursor, toggled on or off using Left Ctrl by default, is extremely useful for digging straight tunnels, building structures such as bridges, removing large areas of walls, and other functions. However, don't forget to toggle it off when you're not using it since things can go out of control\n* Look up how to maintain world purity, since the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow biomes spread across the world, and the Corruption/Crimson can infect the Jungle biome over time\n* Go fishing. It\u2019s worth it. Fishing gives you so many tools, accessories, and other loot that enhance the game tremendously. Once you find the Angler NPC in the Ocean biome at either end of the world, use him to get quests to find a specific fish, which you can redeem for loot\n* For making potions, use an Alchemy Table from the Dungeon to have a 1 in 3 chance to not consume potion ingredients\n* Use Invisibility Potions while farming for Truffle Worms\n* Use Warmth Potions while fighting cold/ice-themed enemies (Deerclops, Frost Moon, etc.)\n\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nI've played this game for over a decade now. I made a Steam account for this game, and I've played through so much of the game's development back when there wasn't even a fraction of the number of items in the game. To put it simply, Terraria is my favorite game. So after well over a thousand hours of playtime, I can safely say that I 100% recommend buying and playing Terraria.", "timestamp_created": 1588706787, "timestamp_updated": 1669089855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2949, "votes_funny": 64, "weighted_vote_score": "0.982465803623199463", "comment_count": 71, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68122624": {"recommendationid": "68122624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056633551", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 54113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35179, "last_played": 1709751896}, "language": "english", "review": "The only bad thing about Terraria is that it ends.", "timestamp_created": 1587998404, "timestamp_updated": 1587998404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3743, "votes_funny": 686, "weighted_vote_score": "0.978318512439727783", "comment_count": 69, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67670255": {"recommendationid": "67670255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216593609", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 383854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 76, "playtime_at_review": 274753, "last_played": 1713795382}, "language": "english", "review": "I've sunk 4500 hours into this masterpiece and have not regretted a single one, if you're looking for an awesome sandbox builder game mixed with epic bosses and worlds then this game is for you. ten stars out of five", "timestamp_created": 1587365264, "timestamp_updated": 1587365264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3964, "votes_funny": 292, "weighted_vote_score": "0.978249728679656982", "comment_count": 44, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50672131": {"recommendationid": "50672131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011119621", "num_games_owned": 693, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 9192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6755, "last_played": 1690206963}, "language": "english", "review": "8 years of free updates and counting\nCheap price of $9.99 and frequent sales\nHundreds of hours of gameplay\nA crap load of customization options\nAmazing mod support\nTold Epic Games to go away when they tried to buy them out\n\nHow based can a developer get???", "timestamp_created": 1558019394, "timestamp_updated": 1586540973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1284, "votes_funny": 174, "weighted_vote_score": "0.977568745613098145", "comment_count": 56, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82815094": {"recommendationid": "82815094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143917364", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 107279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95562, "last_played": 1710485906}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.\n\nTerraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further. \n\nThen we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime. \n\nAfter that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on. \n\nWith the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.\n\nI will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me. \n\nGoodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors. \n\nSincerely,\nKatie Dixon AKA KittoMen", "timestamp_created": 1608547486, "timestamp_updated": 1624679585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 968, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.977303743362426758", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120714269": {"recommendationid": "120714269", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972644480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 12321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12321, "last_played": 1644740013}, "language": "english", "review": "Other developers: Promise to update their game, never update it.\n\nTerraria developers: Promise to stop updating their game, update it anyways.", "timestamp_created": 1660632262, "timestamp_updated": 1660632262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 735, "votes_funny": 252, "weighted_vote_score": "0.974147140979766846", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32261361": {"recommendationid": "32261361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081727754", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6018, "last_played": 1678467385}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] You feel an evil presence watching you... [/h1]\nThis is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end. \n\nPrimarily, Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health. \n\nMy hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected. \n\nEnemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...\n\nAll in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game. \n\n[i] Fortune and glory kid...

Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy\n- A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight\n- Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now)\n- Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped! \n- Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore!\n- I almost forgot to mention\u2026 SO MUCH CRAFTING\n\nCons? Hmm.\n\n- Inventory management\u2026 the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized!\n- Fishing is pretty useful but\u2026 well it\u2019s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though.\n- Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You\u2019ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me.\n- Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game. \n\nOther thought: \n- If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.\n\nStory time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):\n\nI bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.\n\nSince then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.\n\nThere were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is. \n\nI spent $10 on this.", "timestamp_created": 1545722580, "timestamp_updated": 1547331346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 657, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.970460772514343262", "comment_count": 37, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80585888": {"recommendationid": "80585888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227301000", "num_games_owned": 778, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 7184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6923, "last_played": 1710165882}, "language": "english", "review": "Labor of love from this developer is unreal.\nFree update after free update for several years, and now here we are at \"The Journey's End\" update.\n\nSo much content to play, Huge replay value / replayability.\n\nIf you like sandbox, base building, RPG, or you are a creative person definitely recommend this game.\n\n9.5 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1606472872, "timestamp_updated": 1637780946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 918, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.969511449337005615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84965611": {"recommendationid": "84965611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081194841", "num_games_owned": 750, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 72588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65924, "last_played": 1709522671}, "language": "english", "review": "10 years of active development, 0 DLC, 0 microtransactions, a consistent $10 price tag with consistent 50% markdowns during any and all major steam sales.\n\nEnough about the developers and marketing, lets talk about the game.\n\nAmazing replayability, gameplay variety, length, and sense of consistent progression.

Over these years, I've logged just about 2000 hours total, along with another 1000 hours played offline. Enough showing off though. Why in the world should you buy this game?\n\nTerraria is an experience where you're given basically unlimited liberty. Even before you start, you get to completely customize your character and world. After setting it all up, you get dropped into the center of the overworld, where you can go off to do whatever you want. For those of you who got bored with Minecraft as I did, don't worry, as Terraria completely fixes that problem with branching pathways in weapon classes and self-imposed challenges. \n\nYou can even get a vastly different experience, cooperating with friends on an extremely easy to-set-up multiplayer server. By hosting directly through Steam, you just open up your world from the Multiplayer menu, and send an invite to your friend(s)! It's that easy! No need for messy port-forwarding or separate third party accounts!\n\nIf your class specific challenges and multiplayer options can't fill your needs, there are tons of really great mods to check out! Thorium and Calamity are 2 of the biggest ones out there. Thorium blends and balances perfectly with the base game's progression, while Calamity adds some incredibly difficult boss battles and other challenges in higher levels than the progression of the base game (or so I've heard... I'm still blind to most of it). Separately, those 2 add so much on their own, but there are so many others that can change so many things about the game. Possibilities are endless when it comes to modding in Terraria.\n\nBack to the base game, the music is absolutely outstanding, and along with the ambient noises, the game has an amazing sense of atmosphere. Evil places feel like they're filled with dark energy and horrible power. Underground caverns are filled with anxiety of incoming danger and hope to find loot. The list goes on...\n\nBosses can be difficult to fight (especially in Expert, and soon, in Master Mode), but the weapons and abilities that you can obtain in Terraria simply make you feel amazing, each one having its own uses. The controls are entirely customizable, even allowing for extra mouse buttons to be used (if you have any), and they're extremely tight. I can't say I've ever seen a more fun grappling hook mechanic than the one in Terraria. It's like a 360 degree hookshot, and the physics feel absolutely perfect on it. There's no better feeling than grappling onto a block and releasing the hook (jumping) early to launch yourself with some huge momentum (then, if you're like me, doing it again immediately in the opposite direction, and repeating). Mobility might be really slow, and to be honest, a bit boring at the start of the game (in Normal Mode, at least), but it greatly improves as you make progress.\n\nLastly, the Terraria community is one of the best out there. So many helpful folks are in the official Discord Server, if you ever have any questions that the Guide NPC or the thoroughly in-depth wiki site can't answer. There are many things I didn't cover here, but I don't have time to go into every reason why I love this game, and I doubt you have much more time to keep reading them anyways. ;P\n\nSorry, my train of thought can sometimes go off the rails. Thanks for your time reading this far, and I hope this review was helpful! Hope to see you around in the community! :D\n\nTLDR;\nThis is an utterly fantastic game.

It's ability to make people gravitate back to it after an update is very nice. Speaking of updates, the developers release amazing and wholesome updates from time to time. I really recommend this game for mainly two reasons, it has a great replay ability were you just keep making worlds and playing it over and over again. The other reason is that you can do a lot of stuff with the world. From making giant houses and contraptions to attempting to kill a boss multiple times, it is a fun game. But it is also multiplayer which is a great addition. Playing by yourself can get boring sometimes but when I play this game with my friends, I just can't stop playing. I really recommend this game, it is definitely worth the 10 dollars.\n\n\nEDIT: 1000 hours later re-review (2,123 hours at the time of edit)\n\nThis game STILL stands as one of the best games I've played to date. \n\nJourney's End (update 1.4) was a great update, although it didn't change much in the way of over-all game progression, it revamped and/or added to many of the lackluster parts of the game, (ex: bloodmoon fishing, town rework, new mushroom biomes, summoning rework, etc). There was also variety of balancing changes that were introduced with 1.4, which I believe were for the better. Some staple items were nerfed, but still very good. On the other hand, a lot of niche/\"bad\" items were reworked or buffed, making them on par (or better) compared to many other items. \n\nIt would also be a crime to not mention the modding scene for this game. If you buy this game, do yourself a favor and download tModLoader off of steam, because oh my, there are a lot of great mods out there. Keep in mind that tModLoader isn't 1.4 (yet), but is still a massive blast and a great experience.\n\n\nSome mods I would heavily recommend are:\n\nSplit\n     This mod is my favorite so far, prioritizing quality over content. Everything in this mod is\n     very well made.\n\nCalamity\n     The most popular mod by far, has an AMAZING soundtrack composed by DMDokuro,\n     definitely check out their other work. (and don't forget the music is a separate mod!)\n     Play this mod on expert mode with revengeance rune active for the intended experience!\n\nThorium\n     This mod adds a musical bard class that buffs you and your allies, so definitely play this\n     one with a squad for the best experience.\n\nFargo's mods\n     This group of mods adds an 'eternity mode' that will truly unleash hell upon your world,\n     and I don't mean more health and damage for enemies, I'm talking unique mechanics.\n     Changes to all of the bosses AI and some normal enemy AI makes them feel fresh again, \n     the enchantment accessories you can make, and 3 town npcs that you fight as bosses \n     later on (they are seriously well done). You will die a lot, so have patience.\n\nTerraria Overhaul\n     This mod doesn't add much in the way of items or bosses at all, however, it will make\n     Terraria a much different experience. You might not like a lot of what this mod has to offer,\n     and a lot of mechanics can be disabled in the settings, but at least give it a try.\n\nPolarities\n     Polarities is sadly a mod that only works in singleplayer, but what it has to offer in return is \n     an amazing experience. New biomes, bosses, enemies, items, a few new mechanics, and \n     another dimension you can travel to (that can lead to some very interesting sequence\n     breaking in terms of progression), there is a lot this mod has to offer. Definitely give it a try.\n\nand do not forget to get a variety of QoL mods to help you out (1.4 doors, boss checklist, etc.)\n\n\nEdit 2: more mods to check out (i'll add descriptions later)!

(Even more if you like to min max stuff)\n\n\n\n[AND NOW, AN ESSAY FOR YOU WEIRDOS THAT LIKE TO READ] (like m-me)\n* (note: heavily based on my experience, your experience may differ according to your own personal preferences)\n\n\n[Overview]\n* I'm fairly casual in comparison to other more hardcore players. I stop playing for a few months after a session or two, but every time I touch this game again (usually on a whim) I just fall in love with it all over again despite having completely finished it several times already. Something about this game just feels really satisfying to play and every time i touch it, I was met with an incredibly pleasant experience (even though i die and fail a lot).\n\n* Although, for complete beginners, the game is really easy to drop when you first touch it (I know since I dropped it when i first got the game) since you're not entirely sure what to expect, but take your time to learn the basics and do some wiki lurking here and there when you're stuck and you'd find that the game goes much deeper and offers an incredibly rich experience than you'd first expected (I know it did for me).\n\n\n[The Game]\n* Game flow fundamentally revolves around defeating bosses. You make preparations for boss battles which when defeated, unlocks more options for you to play around with to prepare for the next boss you set your sight on, progressively making you stronger but also changing the world around you, introducing something new with each boss defeated whether that be new equipment, or entirely new areas of the world. \n\n* Often times defeating a boss once won't give you everything you want, so you will occasionally find yourself killing a boss twice or thrice. Although, if you prefer, you can do them only once and move on which would be as equally viable as slapping them over and over until you have everything they can possibly drop for you (although it might be bad for the bosses' own mental health).\n\n\n[The Experience]\n* Terraria doesn't particularly demand you to play it in any specific way. You can play it in any way you prefer and at the pacing you wish to play in. It gives you a goal and challenges you but doesn't confine you to just a single exit, instead it gives you hundreds of tools to play and tinker around with in how you approach the obstacles the game presented to you.\n\n* The amount of diversity in the way you can progress and complete this game in is outstanding. My experience in the game didn't feel predictable nor repetitive despite the game having clear checkpoints (the bosses) and a limited world (literally just an island). Despite always having the same biomes guaranteed to spawn in a world, each experience feel new and being acquainted with them does not make the experience bland but instead enriching it since the way you interact with your environment matters, making me feel rewarded the more I know and understand.\n\n* It also helps that all content in the game whether it be building, mining, farming, exploring or just good old murder of local wildlife weaves back into the core game progression seamlessly without ever feeling out of place, making it easy to get immersed with the game. Thanks to this it does not confine you to any kind of play style, you may progress through the game however you want to, but it also does not discourage or punish you for straying off from the core progression.\n\n\n[Conclusion]\n* Its a good game, give it a chance and take your time getting used to it. Don't shy away from the wiki if you feel like you're really stuck or unsure what to do next. If you're not feeling like a hardcore masochist the game also offers a much more relaxed experience through Journey mode characters so try that if you're a really casual player. Fine tune the experience to the experience you're looking for and you'll find yourself in an incredibly pleasant experience (that also involves a lot of dying, but you'll get used to it)\n\n\nSo basically,\nWhat i want to say is, this game is fun and i love it\nI recommend it if you're bored\nI spent 2 hours writing this\nIts 3 AM\nHow'd this happen", "timestamp_created": 1637522692, "timestamp_updated": 1637523069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 388, "votes_funny": 42, "weighted_vote_score": "0.95674055814743042", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90235302": {"recommendationid": "90235302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088751837", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 5418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2548, "last_played": 1684879682}, "language": "english", "review": "i spent four hours getting a pet unicorn by slaughtering many of its kind", "timestamp_created": 1618309399, "timestamp_updated": 1618309399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 493, "votes_funny": 322, "weighted_vote_score": "0.956472456455230713", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80853945": {"recommendationid": "80853945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145518653", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 49144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2212, "playtime_at_review": 35256, "last_played": 1713798845}, "language": "english", "review": "This is most likely the only review I will ever do for a game, and I believe that the grounds of my review are legitimate. I have played this game for just under 600 hours (Online) and countless more offline, as well as playing it on my friends account for many more hours. 6 years ago, I asked my cousin if I could buy a game. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. It was dirt cheap, 10 US dollars at the time, which is a crime considering how much love and passion has gone into this game, as well as the many sleepless nights it has provided me and many other fans. Waiting for it to download, I was ecstatic. The art style was cool and retro, and the gameplay trailers promised a land filled with enemies and abandoned temples that had succumbed to time, ripe for the picking. Many biomes to traverse and even some hidden gems scattered across the world. I couldn\u2019t wait to get my grubby little hands on it. From the moment I booted up the game, the music and visuals instantly invigorated me. It felt so cool to create your own character, so many different styles and colours, so many choices and personalization\u2019s you could do. I spent around 5 minutes creating my first character, and after that, I was set out into a mysterious world, filled with giant worms and flying spit bugs that would decapitate me at a moments notice. My first night is one I will never forget. Armed with shuriken\u2019s from a nearby cave and stranded on a hill, I had no choice but to fight off the hordes of undead. They were coming at me from every direction, and with demon eyes flying overhead, death was inevitable.\n\nAs soon as I respawned, my gut instinct was to protect the guide because he had no home to hunker down in. Eventually, we held off the masses and dawn finally came. I had realized that I needed a house to stay in, and that\u2019s when I had discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of any games I have played; the building. \n\nThere are so sososososososo many blocks to build, hammer and axe together in intuitive, creative and interesting ways. The early days were not the best for building, as the textures were quite pixelated and low quality. But the quality of the builds had gotten exponentially better. The community came up with so many unique and downright amazing builds, and it only got better with each update. There was sloping blocks, paint, different walls, how each block melded together, how each block interacted with other blocks, the light sources, the different platforms that you could use. All this and more meant that anything that you could think of you could build. This game was one of the best imaginative and creative masterpieces that has ever graced the steam platform. \n\nAfter I was done building my house, I set out to find more loot to plunder. That\u2019s when I realised that this games combat is executed flawlessly. Normal mode was a bit too easy for me, so the combat was less punishing then I\u2019d like it to be, but the devs heard about this and introduced both expert and master mode in later updates providing a perfect balance between satisfying combat and the risk taking nature of the skirmishes that took place within the different biomes. Everything about the combat is satisfying, even hitting a slime with a simple copper short sword or an axe is satisfying. And it only got better from there. The progression is done immaculately, precariously positioning the player on a tight rope of equipment and weapons while also drunkenly swinging at the player from every which way, you have to be on your toes at all time. Just when you think you\u2019ve become a god at the game with wearing molten lava and swinging a sword made of fire, the game punches you in the gut and curb stomps you. And you cannot wait to get back into it.\n\nThe gameplay loop is a satisfying composition of combat, farming and building. Everything that you do in this game contributes towards progress. Building houses? More NPC\u2019s to trade with. Want herbs? You got potions to buff you with. Fishing? Boom, rare items that could (RIP Reaver shark) catapult your progress into the future, skipping entire phases of the game. Speaking of phases of the game, it has some of the best and most satisfying transitions in between gameplay elements. Every bit of progress that you make feels infinitely more satisfying than the last, and it keeps pushing you forward, to the point of not stopping. I remember trying to farm for a rare item (Turtle Shells) for 14 hours straight, and I only got 1. I did other stuff in between, sure, but the game keeps you hooked in between objectives and allows for some breathing room in between bosses. As well as being incredibly challenging and rewarding, it is peaceful at times.\n\nWith the Journeys end update, the new music added a whole new layer immersion. I could spend hours flying a kite on a rooftop, listening to the songs and watching my NPC\u2019s just walk around and chat. There is so much to do in this game, its not just combat oriented. And all of this is just in single player! The game has so much support for its community, from steam support and mods all the way up to the wiki and forums that the devs occasionally scour. It is a fantastic game, and I could not recommend it more.\n\nI absolutely adore this game, and it has been a vent for my creativity and inspiration over the years. My words could never do it justice, even though I hope to describe even a fraction of what this game has been to me. \n\nThanks for reading \ud83d\ude0a", "timestamp_created": 1606568137, "timestamp_updated": 1606568137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 346, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.955604314804077148", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91489216": {"recommendationid": "91489216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367818847", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 130525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 91212, "last_played": 1713659879}, "language": "english", "review": "1520 hours of my life gone", "timestamp_created": 1620234951, "timestamp_updated": 1620234951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1185, "votes_funny": 560, "weighted_vote_score": "0.95450127124786377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112992276": {"recommendationid": "112992276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099288308", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 68202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67339, "last_played": 1676850983}, "language": "english", "review": "i like when eye of cthulhu goes urraaeuh", "timestamp_created": 1648507967, "timestamp_updated": 1648507967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 469, "votes_funny": 202, "weighted_vote_score": "0.953634142875671387", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114135046": {"recommendationid": "114135046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273637110", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 88098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67470, "last_played": 1709174341}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty fun, just discovered this cool boss called the \"Wall of Flesh\"", "timestamp_created": 1650388160, "timestamp_updated": 1650388160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 409, "votes_funny": 383, "weighted_vote_score": "0.952871263027191162", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84470675": {"recommendationid": "84470675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211406312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 324701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305343, "last_played": 1709732143}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely phenomenal game, thousands of hours of playtime, difficulties for all people and a unique experience that leaves you feeling godlike and powerful for every second you play.\n\nOne of my all time favourites, a game done right, made with love, and overall deserving of the praise it receives.

And honestly, it deserves it. I think this is a damn good game. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s a perfect game and there are certainly some things you should know before you buy it, but I will happily give it a recommend.\n\n[u]Let Me Begin with What the Game is About and What Makes it Cool.[/u] You start out with a basic sword, axe, and pickaxe, in the middle of nowhere. You\u2019re first step is to get wood and build a shelter to protect you from the zombies at night. Next you need to dig down and get ore to make better gear. So it\u2019s 2d minecraft? Well it\u2019s more than that, let me continue. You\u2019ll need decent armor and weapons to fight the tougher monsters that live underground and to fight bosses. \n\nYep bosses. Bosses are one of the defining elements of this game. Bosses are big and imposing and they play this awesome adrenaline music when you summon them (a lot of the Terraria music is awesome btw). And there\u2019s a huge variety of bosses too: There\u2019s a floating eye that aggressively charges at you, there\u2019s a big worm creature that breaks into smaller worms as you damage it, there\u2019s an angry plant that can only be fought in the claustrophobic jungle, there\u2019s a cult leader that summons mirages of itself and makes the game into a bullet hell with how many projectiles it spits out. Now bosses can be very punishing, but this is a building/crafting game, so you can build your own arena with platforms to jump on and walls to protect you from (some) attacks, or craft potions that boost your speed, health regen, armor, and damage. The fact that you can tackle bosses on your own terms in your own arena is one of the most interesting parts of the game and it really makes boss fights feel epic. \n\nKilling bosses is the main way you progress through the game. Killing them gives you some kickass loot or lets you access a parts of the world where you can discover some more kickass loot. There\u2019s a lot of loot in this game. And it\u2019s some pretty cool loot too. You get staffs that call meteors down from the sky, fireball staffs, swords that shoot fireballs, machine guns, rocket launchers, different kinds of ammo to go in your guns, yo-yo\u2019s (yo-yos are a really cool weapon), boomerangs, tools that summon monsters or turrets to fight for you, tools that let you jump real high (useful for dodging boss attacks), vehicles that let you move real fast, grappling hooks for going spelunking. The more bosses you kill and the further you progress, the more powerful and interesting the loot you get. Seriously, getting new loot just feels absolutely wonderful in this game.\n\nSo yeah, I would say mining, boss fighting, and collecting loot are the meat of the game, but there\u2019s plenty of gravy too. Maybe you want to take a break from boss fighting and do some fishing so you can get a chainsaw fish and also some potion ingredients. Well then you probably want to create a few ponds throughout your world. And you\u2019ll probably want to set up some minecart tracks or teleporters to get to your ponds quickly. Or maybe you want to set up a mushroom farm because mushroom are good for potions as well as crafting some late game armor. Well you\u2019ll want to create several rows of dirt so the mushrooms have plenty of surface area to spawn on. And if you don\u2019t want to harvest mushrooms manually you can set up a bunch of conveyor belts and wire so the mushrooms just fall down and come to you. Or maybe a part of your world is corrupt. Corruption spreads slowly so you may want to dig a trench around it to keep it quarantined, or you can buy a special gun that cleanses corruption outright. Or maybe you need a bunch of unicorn horns. You could go to the part of the world where unicorns spawn and kill them with your flaming yo-yo. Or you could dig a big pit and every time a unicorn come by it falls into the pit and dies because the pit is full of lava and spiky traps. This is a crafting game where enemies are just another crafting resource, so setting up a death pit to farm unicorns is a logical thing to do. There\u2019s plenty of stuff to do in Terraria and plenty of ways to do it.\n\n\n[u]And Now for the Parts of the Game You Might Not Find so Cool.[/u] First of all, the difficulty. Specifically, the bosses. Bosses will kill you. Bosses are tough. You can give yourself boosts with potions and armor, but dodging attacks is your best bet. And that can be very difficult when the boss charges rapidly at you or shoots a dozen balls of lightning at you. You will need to learn the attack patterns of bosses and you will need to train your reflexes. I mentioned bullet hell earlier, and I really do think this game has bullet hell elements. If you just can\u2019t stand bullet hell games you probably want to avoid Terraria. (Since difficulty is a pretty subjective thing, you may want to look up a video review of Terraria and see some boss fights and combat for yourself.)\n\nAnother thing I want to mention is the sheer amount of stuff to learn. You should be prepared to spend a lot of time on the Terraria wiki. It\u2019s a crafting game, so you\u2019ll need to look up crafting recipes as well as how to get ingredients. It\u2019s also a game about fighting giant bosses, so you\u2019ll need to know how to summon bosses and you\u2019ll probably want to read some tips on making an arena. If you want to build a garden or fishing pond you\u2019ll want to know when certain herbs bloom and how much water to put in your pond. For building more complex structures, you may want to look up tutorials on youtube (the game has gone through several updates though, so some youtube tutorials are out of date). Personally, I kinda enjoyed learning the game. I\u2019d get some weird item in my inventory and immediately going to the wiki to see what I could do with it. But I realize not everyone wants to study a wiki while they play video games. \n\nOne of the interesting parts of the game is how it\u2019s a building/fighting hybrid kind of game. And while that\u2019s cool some of the time, it can be really annoying at other times. Say you\u2019re underground building an arena to fight a boss, then a bat flies out at you, now you have to stop building and take out your weapon. So you kill the bat and try to get back to building, but another bat spawns and you have to kill that one too. The game literally has a formula where if it detects there aren\u2019t any enemies near you it will spawn new enemies, so you will constantly have to fight off annoying enemies while you\u2019re trying to build or mine. (I should mention that there are tools that help deal with enemy harassment, but you need to know how to get them, which reinforces my point that you need to read the wiki) \n\nI don\u2019t really like Terraria\u2019s endgame. Most of the early and midgame consists of exploring, building, and crafting, with the occasional action-packed boss fight thrown in, which I like because it offers some nice variety. However the endgame is back-to-back combat. Fight a boss, then fight a bunch of minibosses, then fight another boss, then fight four living towers which spawn very fast very dangerous enemies, then fight another boss. For my first playthrough of this game I stopped playing when I got to the endgame because I just didn\u2019t want to slog through all the fighting. Now, I actually like the combat and I liked fighting bosses throughout the game, but it\u2019s a simple combat system and fighting loses some of its charm when you do it for too long. \n\nSo this review turned out longer than I expected. I guess I wanted to be thorough. When I first played this game I got pretty frustrated at times and I was prepared to toss out the game altogether. But then I got into it a bit more and learned the mechanics better and I actually really liked it.

It all started many years ago, when I got acquainted with one of the most wonderful, warm, and memorable games in my life - Terraria. When pronouncing this word, I immediately feel warm in my soul, I remember the wonderful soundtrack and completely immerse myself in my thoughts. Before reviewing, I immediately want to note that this game gave me a new perception of computer games, and gave me a great childhood.\n\nI myself am not an ordinary player in Terraria, and there are few such oldies, because I got acquainted with Terraria even before its release, or more precisely, before the official release of the game on Steam (May 16, 2011). And although I have played 200 hours of this game in my Steam, I actually played it for about 1000 hours. When I was little, I, like all children, played Minecraft, and I really liked this game, I thought that I could not find a better game. But one fine day, my dad came home from work and told me about Terraria, which just appeared. Another employee told Dad about the game, and another employee told this employee, and then I don't know the story of the spread of rumors about a brand new freshly baked Terraria. When I first started the game, I created my character, spending several hours on it, pressed the button to create a world, and found myself on the ground. Someone walked next to me, his name was Guide, who first fell into the abyss ... I don't know why he did it, but it didn't really bother me. The first thing I learned was how to walk, jump and dig, and it was incredibly fun! After that I dug a hole for myself, buried myself on top and went to play Minecraft ... Don't judge strictly, but for a child then Minecraft was much more colorful, and had a 3D view, and not a cropped 3D space along the Z axis. But a couple of days later I went back in into the game, and again continued to explore the world, the game did not cause as much enthusiasm for me as many people who have started playing quite recently. And I don't know if it's good that I started playing such a raw game. But as time went on, I studied the world of Terraria more and more. I got to know cute teardrop-mongers and creatures that were constantly killing me. I realized that I needed a home to live, and that's when I discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of all the games I've played - building. So I gave up traveling and started BUILDING and DIGGING! And then this game completely sucked me in. I quit Minecraft and started DIGGING, KILLING, AND EXPLORING. I met new residents who can SELL! And a nurse who can CHOOSE! I also realized that the Guide is not a useless piece of garbage, and that you can have a heart-to-heart talk with him. In the end, I killed the ominous Eye of Cthulhu, which sowed fear, and the game ended there ... But soon new updates came out, I downloaded new versions and went all over again. And it was interesting. I went through each update, and did not get a mental pleasure. Since I like everything more difficult, I started playing the game on the Expert Advisor, and later on the Master. But all this was not enough for me! And I started to go through mods, for those who know Calamity mod, I went through this game with Revenge and Death modes, and also after a few hundred attempts I went through Boss Rush. Then I lost my nerves.\n\nWith each update, the game brought new emotions and a colorful world to the players and me. Every progress you make is much more satisfying than the last one and continues to push you forward, to the point where you don't stop. There is no point in talking about old versions, so I'll tell you a couple (hundreds) of words about the new Terraria.\n\nFor me this game became a home in which I felt comfortable. The game is currently in the game about 500 varieties of mobs. There are also 19 bosses and 13 mini-bosses, as well as 3 additional bosses in the mobile version. And from listing recipes you can break your tongue. Sloped blocks, paints, different walls were added to the game, each block merged together, each block interacted with other blocks. Light sources, different platforms that you may have used. All of this and more meant that anything imaginable could be built. Many people create amazing mechanisms and worlds, better than on paper!) Although they made a convenient interface for creating my character in the game, I also devote a lot of time to creating a character). And the music and style of play makes me crazy. I bought this game for my every account, and made all my friends, no matter if it was voluntary, to purchase this masterpiece. And if you are thinking whether to buy this game, I can hardly answer you ... YES !!! This game is amazing both solo and when playing with friends! You can catch hares and then fill the whole world of your friend with them! It's worth buying for this!\n\nI can confidently say that Terraria has become my corner of safety, this is my home, there is no place easier and quieter than it.\n\nThanks Andrew Spinks, Whitney

Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that.

Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything, and that's only with absurd luck (see \"The Creation of the Guide\" painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up, and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt-out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion, did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the [i]Terraria[/i] world, you discover something surprising.\n    [*][b]Creativity[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics, but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic, and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors. [i]Terraria[/i] features innovative design at its finest.\n    [*][b]Progression options[/b]: Like any good RPG, there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment, and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely, never feeling too easy, cheap, or absurdly difficult.\n    You never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather, in my experience, my friends and I frequently [i]had too many options[/i] and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive.\n    [*][b]Balance[/b]: A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into. [i]Terraria[/i] manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress.\n    [*][b]Diversity[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] promotes itself as a game for any type of player, and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers, explorers, and builders, and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered, and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo-yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside-down? Of course--and that's bug-free! If that's not enough, you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone.\n    I've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters, you can teleport, build trap-filled dungeons, set up PVP minigames, and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible.\n    [*][b]Automation[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items, hundreds of monsters, dozens of mechanics, and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto-select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one-click digging. Quick-stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one-by-one, chest-by-chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease-of-use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores.\n    [*][b]Performance[/b]: Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements. [i]Terraria[/i] is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites, particle effects, physics, lighting, and entity interaction. Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough*[i]Starbound[/i]*cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year-old desktop on Windows XP with low-end specifications. The performance of the game to medium- and some low-end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand, if you have a high-end system, go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy [i]Terraria[/i] in its full glory.\n    [*][b]Quality of life[/b]: Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is [i]Terraria[/i]'s gameplay mainly devoid of bugs, but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds, allowing for easy singleplayer-to-multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick-stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in-game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general, you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface.\n    [*][b]Continued updates[/b]: It would be very easy for [i]Terraria[/i], as popular as it is, to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers, instead, make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer-community relationship is superb.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n    [*][b]New player friendliness[/b]: The in-game help system is stunted, and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of toys in [i]Terraria[/i]'s sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game.\n    [*][b]Grinding[/b]: While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress, several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in-game day, the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4,800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch, yet [i]Terraria[/i] is not above this issue.\n    [*][b]Moddability[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features, but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1463549474, "timestamp_updated": 1479961496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 284,

The content is beyond overwhelming with many bosses, challenges and options that you won\u2019t ever get bored of. The game revolves around [b] you [/b] the player, as the difficulty and gameplay change depending upon your progression. The art style and music are very exceptional, bringing us the fanbase pleasant memories even to this day.\n\n[h1] \ud83d\udcd6 Setting: [/h1]\n[h3] Summary [/h3]\nTerraria is a land full of mystery and wonder. You the adventure are given the task to cleanse this magical world from the spreading [b] cancer [/b] called Hollow/Corruption. Many powerful beings will stand in your way, so grab some loot, find allies and restore the balance. Since many players forget the fact that Terraria includes a story in the first place. I suggest you read the lore from the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Lore] Wiki [/url] to get accustomed to the plot.\n\n[h1] \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Gameplay: [/h1]\nTerraria refers to casual and hardcore players alike. You can slay forces or start creating buildings, without though being obliged to do so. The game offers a variety of blocks and items that encourage creativity. You can even build your mini-golf park! The goal here is to have fun and not just constantly grind for loot.\n\n[h3] Difficulty [/h3]\nThe actual Difficulty mode is a character set selected during character creation. There are 5 types of difficulty: Softcore, Mediumcore, Hardcore and the newly added [b] Journey [/b] mode that can only be played on journey worlds. All the above-mentioned modes change the penalty upon death.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] Description[/th]\n[th] Difficulty [/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td] Characters start with extra equipment [/td]\n[td] Journey [/td] \n[/tr] \n[tr] \n[td] Characters drop [b] coins [/b] upon death [/td] \n[td] Classic [/td] \n[/tr] \n[tr] \n[td] Characters drop [b] items [/b] on death [/td] \n[td] Mediumcore [/td] \n[/tr]\n[tr] \n[td] Characters cannot [b] respawn!! [/b]  [/td] \n[td] Hardcore [/td] \n[/tr] \n[/table]\n\nAnother form of difficulty is [b] world modes. [/b] Those are separate settings that apply to the [b] world, [/b] rather than the [b] character. [/b] Players may choose between Journey, Classic, Expert, and Master mode when creating a new seed. Each mode provides more loot, as well as special accessories depending on the difficulty you have chosen. I advise [b] new [/b] players to start with the Classic mode, as Expert and Master are very demanding for a novice adventurer.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894347971\n[h3] Starting your adventure [/h3]\nTerraria starts its gameplay slow and steady, as it should be. You begin your journey with only 3 tools (sword, axe, pickaxe) at your disposal and a companion useful for his crafting guides. It\u2019s up to [b] you [/b] the player whether you want to challenge the game since your imagination, skill and creativity shape the word and thus the adventure. As a tip, I suggest you start building a small house in the beginning.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894343444\n[h3] Interactive playstyle [/h3]\nTerraria forces [b] you [/b] the player to manipulate the environment to survive. You can chop trees used for crafting; mine rocks used for building or combine all the materials to cross large gaps etc. Physics plays a major role in the game\u2019s playstyle, so do expect lots of deaths caused by [b] fall damage. [/b] There is also a small detail concerning nightfall, but that\u2019s a surprise for you to explore.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894342641\n[h3] Scaling [/h3]\n[b] Grinding [/b]\nTerraria is very famous for its grinding potential. There are many repeatable bosses, each offering different and unique [b] treasure bags [/b] that are considered valuable for your future encounters. Countless items offered by a specific boss or gained by certain activities, such as fishing, have a very low [b] drop percentage [/b]. This concept favours repeatability, so do be patient, as sometimes even the best things in life take a while.\n\n[b] Classes [/b]\nThere are 4 classes in Terraria: Magic, Ranged, Melee and Summoning. Each class requires different armour sets and weapons that provide unique stats and abilities, depending upon the material they were made from. It is most favourable to stick with 1 class during a playthrough, as this way you can aim your focus on specific items and equipment. Read the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide:Class_setups]Wiki [/url] and choose carefully which role to main first.\n\n[b] Loot [/b]\nThere are lots of accessories, mounts as well as vanity items with interesting [b] specialities [/b] that bring joy to competitive and creative players alike. A perfect example is the [b] Cloud in a Bottle [/b] which grants the user the ability to extra-jump midair. You can combine the accessories to create even stronger ones in the Tinkerer's Workshop. There are countless combinations, so take your time while reading the [url= https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Tinkerer%27s_Workshop]Wiki. [/url] \n\n[h3] Wiki, Wiki and more Wiki [/h3]\nOverall, the experience is amazing, however, the learning curve is extremely demanding. This is a feature that does not go well with many players. As you have noticed above, you [b] will [/b] have to consult the [b] wiki [/b] regularly to truly master the game. Otherwise, you going to encounter many problems and difficulties that eventually will lead to confusion. Terraria is [b] very [/b] grind demanding game, so bring some friends in your journeys as co-op is more than encouraging!\n\n[h1] \ud83d\udc41\u200d\ud83d\udde8 Visuals: [/h1]\nTerraria runs pretty well even on a [b] potato [/b] Pc. It is a small game with a gorgeous yet simple artstyle that continues to captivate me to this day. The game runs smoothly in low settings with minor loading times. In the rare case you encounter problems with performance, I suggest you turn off the effects.\n\n[h1] \ud83c\udfa7 Audio: [/h1]\nTerraria\u2019s music is [b] exceptional [/b] in its way. Every biome, boss as well as event has its unique song that fits the theme. I encourage you to buy [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/409210/Terraria_Official_Soundtrack/] Terraria: Official Soundtrack [/url] as it proves to be a piece of excellent background music to listen to. You also provide a small token of appreciation to the developers.\n\n[h1] \ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f Side Notes: [/h1]\nTerraria is a challenging game for those who want to reach its completion. Before starting your adventure, I recommend you to get accustomed to terms like Pre-Hardmode - Hardmode mode etc. The game takes time to master, so do not get disappointed if you are struggling in the beginning. Be patient and most importantly have fun.\n\nIf you crave more challenges the [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/] tMoadLoader [/url] (available on Steam) will become your best friend, so why don\u2019t you give it a try!!\n\n[h1] \ud83d\udce3 References:  [/h1]\nThe below links are some content creators that gonna make you fall in love with the journey. They provide tips as well as tricks that prove very useful having them at your disposal :\n\n\u2022\t[b] Chippy Gaming [/b]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ChippyGaming\n\n\u2022\t[b] Yrimir [/b]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Yrimir\n\n\u2022\t[b] Hero [/b]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/HERO\n\n[h1] \ud83d\udccb Verdict: [/h1]\nHaving in mind its low price compared to the amount of content that it offers, I consider Terraria a gaming paradise for both creative and challenge thirsty players. It refers to all ages, as its unique gameplay encourages fun and creativity. You can build constructions, kill enemies, fight bosses, everything depends upon your playstyle.

The onboarding *exists*, the hints are *there*, but it's not enough to replace a wiki.\n[*]While the spritework is nice, the small scale of everything holds it back. Various details in tiles and character cosmetics are too small to really appreciate, which can make the look of the game unappealing to some people. (Though if you're already looking at this review, you probably won't mind that as much.)\n[*]The game's \"two phases\" appeal to different people. Early game is slow, with slow exploration, awkward attacks, and a bunch of \"hold left click for 10 minutes\" moments. Late game is fast-paced, challenging, and almost rushes by. If you're ONLY into one of these two, you may have trouble dealing with the other.\n[*]The small scale, coupled with the fast pace of combat in the lategame, lead to some visibility problems. Aiming at enemies that are off-screen is a somewhat common occurrence in this game.\n[/list]\n\nMy recommendation for your first playthrough:\n[list]\n[*]Play with friends, preferably someone who already knows how this game works.\n[*]When making a character, choose \"Classic\" (\"drop coins on death\"). \"Mediumcore\" is a big deal, so don't choose that unless you know what you're in for.\n[*]When making a world, *try* Expert mode, *especially* when playing multiplayer. A lot of the more interesting mechanics are only available there.\n[*]If you're playing solo (or nobody in your group knows what to do), talk to the Guide NPC a LOT, or use a wiki.\n[*]Start by exploring and making basic houses, continue by battling a few bosses, THEN get into building fancier things. (You gain a lot of building/mining abilities at that point.)\n[*]Anytime you find a new item that has \"Material\" written in its description, show it to the Guide NPC to learn what it's for.\n[*]Dropping the doll in the lava will have serious consequences.\n[/list]\n\nThis game's great. Not for everyone, but I still get obsessed with it every now and then.\nOne should not wish for sequels, but if this game ever got one, I'd have high hopes for it.\nThe mods are also great.

She played it, fell in love with its charm, and knew I would enjoy it as well, so a few months after its full release, she bought it for me as a gift. I fell in love, just as she did, the charm of the visuals, simplicity of the game play, the music that gives me nostalgia each time I hear it (especially the daytime track, those beeps and boops are forever ingrained in my head). I played for hours and hours just fiddling around, digging, exploring, creating more worlds to explore and dig into just for the fun of it. I played to the point I FAR surpassed my mother in Terraria knowledge, and she often asked me for help XD. I watched from the sidelines (as I was/am too shy to really go into the community) as the game grew, changed, and developed into what it is now. While I honestly do not play as much as I used to, I mostly played after big updates to play around and explore with the new content, I still hold those memories fondly, and I'm pretty sure I still have my first world out in my files somewhere.\n\nBut that's enough story time, you came for my review:\nI can't recommend this game enough to ANYONE who has any interest in the genre, the pixel graphics are incredibly charming and cute, the controls might take a small amount of getting used to for some people unfamiliar with it, but they're not hard. The content is vast, you almost NEED to go into the wiki pages if you want to see it all. You can easily sink hours into the game if you're not careful, and literally explore worlds upon worlds of some fascinating procedurally generated landscapes and tunnels. The price of the game is definitely worth the amount of content you get.\n\nIf there was anything I can think of (at this moment) that could be a downside, it might be that it could be a bit too easy to not know what to do, especially if you are playing on your own at first, and have no idea what you are supposed to do, there is a Guide NPC, but he doesn't exactly convey much about what needs to be done.\nYet at the same time, that's part of the point, this game is about freedom, to do whatever you want in whatever way you want to do it.\n\nHappy 10 years, Terraria <3", "timestamp_created": 1621189791, "timestamp_updated": 1621200413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 330, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926061570644378662", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70407246": {"recommendationid": "70407246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020125851", "num_games_owned": 15701, "num_reviews": 840, "playtime_forever": 13015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12196, "last_played": 1592363206}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Terraria is a game I recommend everyone to own on Steam.   It consistantly goes on sale for $2.50, and this game offers dozens of hours of solid entertainment. [/h1]\n\nTo be completely honest, for years I did not like Terraria. The biggest problem with the game is you literally don't know what to do or how to progress in the game without looking up a guide on the Terraria Wiki, or by asking more experienced players. To me, I just find that as bad game design.  There could have been some sort of quest log that gave you some indication of what to do next, otherwise the beginning of the game becomes rather dull.\n\nMoving on, once you do know what you are doing, the game becomes surprisingly more enjoyable as Terraria focuses on combat and boss encounters. Each boss is different from one another, and are actually challenging. The game limits you from getting better gear until a specific boss is defeated which keeps the challenge high throughout.\n\nApart from that, as you kill bosses new enemies and events will appear in the game unlocking a vast new variety of weapons, items, and equipment. \n\nOne thing I had not realized is the incredible amount of content Terraria offers. As soon as you think you are done with the game, it just keeps going with even more bosses, more grind for even better gear, and just so much new stuff as you go along. (be sure to keep checking the wiki to see what bosses are next and how to unlock them)\n\n\n[b]It is very important that you play this game with a friend. Playing it solo is simply not as fun, especially considering the time investment.[/b]\n\n\nGeneral overview:\n+ Loads of content\n+ Fun combat system with a large variety of weapons, spells, and gear.\n+ Lots of fantastic bosses\n+ Very challenging\n+ An ever-changing world with loads to explore\n+ Great fun with friends\n+ Very easy to host a server and game is very minimal on resources (meaning anyone with a PC can enjoy this, even on a laptop)\n\n- Somewhat impossible to progress without a guide\n- The first half of the game is rather boring compared to the later half\n- A bit straining on the eyes with pixel graphics, especially with a high resolution monitor\n- A bit too challenging at times (especially playing solo)\n- Resources are limited, meaning you won't be able to get items without generating a new world (your character can move between worlds and servers)  [b]Highly recommend generating a medium to large world[/b]\n\n\nTo sum things up, Terraria is a fantastic game to play with at least one friend (preferably just 2-4 ). It offers an extremely high amount of content, lots of bosses, fun gameplay, lots to explore and craft, and its cheap! \n\n+++ Highly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1591476453, "timestamp_updated": 1591567122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 481, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925932586193084717", "comment_count": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79830210": {"recommendationid": "79830210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124809401", "num_games_owned": 1740, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 23786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23769, "last_played": 1607366355}, "language": "english", "review": "You can jump in this game.", "timestamp_created": 1606328795, "timestamp_updated": 1606328795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 707, "votes_funny": 435, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925902187824249268", "comment_count": 31, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92903240": {"recommendationid": "92903240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030896210", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 63754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 958, "playtime_at_review": 60100, "last_played": 1713799777}, "language": "english", "review": "I will be brief.

Well, they're wrong. Terraria is like Minecraft but better in any way.\nExploring feels like it should be: quick, simple and rewarding and the arsenal of tools like pickaxes, drills, ropes and torches makes that even more enjoyable. The environment is full of chests and vases that reward you just for walking around. You can also found Heart Crystals that boost your Max HP and Fallen Stars that boost your Max Mana.\nCombat feels clumsy at the beggining, but the more you play, the better it will get. The combat turns from a Copper Sword Stabby-Stab to Missiles, Bursts of Energy, Homing Bullets, Falling Meteorites, Massive Swords.\nMining is as it should be: quick! You can spend only 5min just mining a rare ore, where in Minecraft, you will spend hours to find Diamonds and it depends on layers, stripminings, caverns, etc. In Terraria, you have things to help you find ore more easily, such as better tools, Pets that give you light, torches that highlight treasures, potions that show you where the treasures is, equipables that describe your surroundings, bombs/tnt that, for sure, help you get rid of the terrain and you don't feel that you've wasted your materials spending them.\nThe Progression in this game is top notch. In the beggining you can't even beat a blob, but as soon as you grab some armor you can beat it easily. It's fun to discover that you're still too weak to walk to other biomes like the desert and jungle. And after you get comfortable with the gameplay, when you can beat every mob in the world, the game has the BALLS to strip that liberty away and put you in Noob Phase again. The switch between Pre-Hardmode and Hardmode is a huge step for gaming. It strips your sense of greatness without striping you off your items.\nThe world, your map change with the flow of the game, new ores appear, the ore changes between worlds, so it is never the same, new mobs appear, corrupted biomes spread to other biomes, and if you don't pay attention, it will, eventually, take over the whole map.\nEven if you had explored the map previously, you will still explore the same areas because new ore, loot and enemies will appear. It never gets old being killed by Unicorns and Pixie Fairies. \nThis is the first game where I do like brewing my potions, in Minecraft that function feels useless, either you don't use it at all, or you only use it for boss fights or breathing underwater. In Terraria you use them for everything. You use potions for Scaveging, Danger Hunting, Boss Fighting, Teleporting, Flying, Water Walking... It feels good using potions, and you don't feel cheated when you use them.\nFishing is under appreciated. This mechanic is way better than Minecraft's or Stardew Valley's. You are not obligated to do it, but it will reward you with ore, vanity items, furniture, money, very good equipables, rods, bait, fish (that can be used for potions). It can be boring at times, but you don't even have to be alert, it functions with a simple mouse click.\nBuilding is god-like, you can build everything, you have all kinds of furniture, you can mold blocks with your hammer, and you can even paint all blocks in the game or create your custom biomes with paint. Even if you are bad at building and you'd like to build great things (like me) you can easily copy any screenshot of any building you see browsing the web. The houses you building will all feel comfortable.\nWiring is like Minecraft's Redstone, but more simpler (sometimes). Wiring gives you the opportunity to build traps, build farms and teleport yourself around the map (yes, TELEPORT). Wiring also gives you motives to be careful when exploring caves because there might be traps lurking.\nEven if you play alone, your world feels alive, everywhere you go you have something. Wanna go left/right? You have Desert, Tundra, Jungle, Beaches, Meteorite, Hallow, Corruption/Crimson. Wanna go up? You have Sky Islands and Sky Lakes.\nWanna go down? You have Granite, Marble, Spider-Nests, Mushroom Biomes, and even Hell (Underworld).\nThe world isn't infinite like in Minecraft (I know it isn't infinite, but c'mon) but it still feels huge, and it even will change overtime with your adventure.\nTerraria will still offer you options like Pets, Light Pets, Mounts, Minecarts, Grappling Hooks and even Wings that you can collect if you feel like getting all the items.\nEven with all of this variety Terraria will offer events like Blood Moon, Solar Eclipse, etc which will give you another look at more new mobs, even more loot and even more fun. Some of the events change over time too, and offer great loot.\nAnd the bosses? Omg, the bosses are amazing. When you play, you're always thinking of when the new one's gonna come out. You'll get addicted to beat bosses, and Terraria has a fair share of bosses. In the beggining they feels kinda weak and easy, but it will change over time too. Bosses have themes behind them, Queen Bee is in the Jungle, Eater of Worlds is in the Corruption, Moon Lord appears after you defeat the Lunar Events, etc.\nAh, and it even has multiple classes, and each and every one of them feels rewarding to play. Every one of them is fun to play, and the game doesn't force you to choose one of them at the beggining of the game, giving you time to experiment each class during your playtime.\nNPC's, in Terraria are very good and distinguished from each other. They don't look alike and don't \"NAH\" \"OH\" around. Each have their own personality and each one of them serves a purpose and gives life to your world, you will never feel alone.\nAfter all of this, you get another difficulty, which increases the difficulty (ofc), but increases the drop quality and it even gives you Expert only items that are worth the difficulty just for the items alone.\nThe game feels rewarding and delivers in everything that is shown, and it is still being updated.\nThis game is not grindy, you will only have to grind for specific items that are not required.\nAnd even with all of that, you still have mods. I have not experienced them, but everybody , in the Terraria community, knows that mods are god like. Mods like Calamity and Thorium are a must.\nAnd the Soundtrack is very good. Each biome has it's own theme, and it's very recognizable. You can tell the day/night cycle just by listening, or the biome you're in and the transitions between biomes are very well made. The bosses have their own themes too, but I'm always too busy fighting them so I don't even have the chance to listen.\nI've played so many games and I have NEVER seen a community like Terraria's. Everyone is so helpful, and the Youtubers are so memorable, from Happydays to Python and Grobeman.\nSo, after reading my review, and looking at the \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" reviews for this game, what's your excuse for not buying? It's the best time to buy this game, it will get another update soon full with new stuff. This game is still relevant, God dammit\nSeriously, why don't my friends like this game?!", "timestamp_created": 1556239954, "timestamp_updated": 1574811361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 275, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.922216951847076416", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 621729, "total_negative": 14299, "total_reviews": 636028}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwnYpXjQ0uwE": "Mon Apr 22 23:33:00 2024"}}
