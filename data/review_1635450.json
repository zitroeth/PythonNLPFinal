Really loved the concept of animal crossing x rust. I was confused to see the low rating this game had until I got suspended for a terrible reason. Now I understand why there are comments like \"dev bans people for no reason\" and \"moderation system is wack\". These comments are all facts. I got banned for \"antagonizing\" a player. No racial, sexual comments and not even a swear word but for talking back to when he said \"please stop harassing me!\"(even tho I never harassed him). If you are an insanely serene dotard, play this game because it is a fantastic game and you won't get banned if you never type. However, if you are not a dotard and want to enjoy the game by interacting with players, don't buy this because you will get banned if you are unlucky. Moreover this isnt the real problem. The biggest problem is the discord server that has mods who are quite literally braindead. I clearly state my opinions on this corrupt ban system and after a few conversation, they kick me out and ip ban me permanently(this discord server is the only way for players to appeal bans). They also delete everything I typed to hide it from others players from seeing it. So now I lost my $20 dollars that I spent on this game for (1) conversing with a player in game (2) sharing my opinions on how shitty this system is. And the most frustrating thing is that nobody will understand how shitty the discord server is because they legit delete any message that they think is annoying. It's like the novel 1984 where the authorities have the complete power to control what people say and type. Absolute joke banning system and discord server. \n\n\n**Update** I obviously got unbanned because as I mentioned, I typed nothing that deserved a penalty. Some idiot mod banned me for absolutely no reason. To get unbanned, I had to personally contact the server's community manager(because the degenerate mods banned me from the official discord server) and had to explain everything from beginning to end. After a few hours, he tells me that I am unbanned. However, I STILL cannot play the game because it STILL doesnt allow me to join the server. Now I'm STILL waiting for the manager to fix this. Great management. Really surprised to see how terrible the support system is compared to the actual game.  The game itself deserves an award. But the support system is just a chaos where the mods abuse their authority by kicking people out for nonsense. The mods/admins also delete any opinions that they don't like. To conclude, buy this game if you don't type. Do not buy this game if you type and is not willing to suck the toes of the discord mods.\n\n**Update 2** \nApparently the community manager who unbanned me changed his mind and stated that I deserve a 1 day ban for harassing a player and 3 more for not being patient and mean towards the mods plus ban evasion(for playing on alt account). So I just accepted it because I didn't want to get IP banned again and there is no way of arguing over someone's subjective opinion(not being patient and being mean lol ridiculous ). Also, one of the admins( Admin Artur to be precise,) called me a \"cretin\" when kicking me out of the discord server. Kinda funny when you consider how my bad behavior(which got me a 3 day ban) towards the mods was using the word \"retard\" to criticize the system that bans people and doesn't notify them. If you think I'm lying I can send screenshots through discord(bossgalio on Longvinter discord server). \n\n*Edit* I feel like I generalized too much when describing the admins/mods. Some of them are really smart and do their job in a professional way. Guys like Tucker, Diogo and especially MIneMy do amazing job interacting with players and listening to their issues. Huge shout-out to MineMy who takes care of the Korean server by himself even though he is only a mod. This guy does more work than all the admins combined. Other mods/admins seriously lack brain cells and have mental capabilities of a 14 year old who simply exist to abuse other players using their status, which is pathetic. \n\n\ud55c\uad6d\ubd84\ub4e4 \ubcf4\uc2e4\uaebc\uba74 --> \uc11c\ubc84 \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub07c\ub4e4 \uba87\uba87\ube7c\uace0 \ub2e4 \ubdf0\uc6c5\uc2e0\uc784. \uac4d \uc9c0\uc098\ub300\ub85c \ubca4\ub54c\ub9ac\uace0 \uc345 \uc2e4\uc218\uc778\uac70 \uc54c\uba74\uc11c \ubcc4 \uc9c0\ub784\ubc1c\uad11\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub05d\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc6b0\uae40. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub098\ub9cc \uc774\ub807\uac8c \ub9d0\ud558\ub294\uac8c \uc544\ub2c8\uace0 \uc61c\ub0a0 \ub9ac\ubdf0\ubcf4\uba74 \uc774\ub7f0\uac70 \uc8e4\ub124 \ub9ce\uc74c. \uacb0\ub860: \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub294\ub370 \uc11c\ubc84\uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \uc548\ub41c\ub2e4.\n\nUpdate Aug 11 **\n\nIt seems like the steam discussion forum is heavily censored by someone. Idk if it's the admin/mods of the discord did this but all the things that players other than me typed regarding the behavior of admins/mods got deleted and only positive comments exist. Kinda corrupt that steam forum *discussion* page is being censored, \n\nOnce again, the game itself is fantastic. It's just that the admins/mods who run this game represent the stereotype of discord mods perfectly. Spinless people who only exist to feel the sensation of ruling over thousands of players.\n\nUpdate Sept 3 - Oct 11\n\nI got permanently banned. The reasons were \"impersonating\", \"stream sniping\", \"trolling\", \"following\", \"stalking\", and general \"disruptive behavior\". I did NOT do any of these and they didn't provide a single piece of evidence. I guess they really wanted to ban me because of this review and how much attention it received as well as how I raided and killed some of the admis/mods. If you are planning on buying this game, do NOT play on US servers, especially US uvana 5 and 6. These servers are infested with the actual admins that run the game(admin B*nn and Fl*yingC*w). So if you kill any of them they can permanently ban you through coming up with idiotic reasons. Example such justifications can be \"stalking\" or simply \"disruptive behavior\". And I am not lying, I have a screenshot of the email which outlined these idiotic ban reasons. I appealed the ban but they basically sent the exact email again without a single source of evidence or any logic at all. I also contacted the developers of this game but they NEVER respond to emails. They truly believe that their admins are rationale and inherently good(Which is definitely not true. They abuse their power through banning players.)  Avoid purchasing this game or refund it before the 2h limit reaches. If you really love the game, then I highly, highly recommend you to avoid the US servers. \n\n*If you are a streamer(even with very little viewers), you will never get banned unless you are  extremely toxic. So if you plan on streaming this game, you can ignore this entire review(and other like 500 negative reviews that directly target the admins) because the admins and devs care SOOO much about public image of this game that they censor the official discord server and the steam discussion forum while allowing streamers to play. Some admins actually play WITH streamers(admin B*nn) and abuse solo players(I have video footage of a streamer and an admin shooting and killing one player as a team of like 12 people. This is obviously fair because it's a PvP game. However, this common sense of shooting and killing in a PvP does NOT apply to admins and streamers because as I said, if you kill one of these admins they WILL ban you.)\n\nConclusion: \n- If you are a streamer, ignore all of this and play the game because you will never get banned. And the game itself is fantastic.\n- If you are not a streamer, avoid this game or play in servers other than US.", "timestamp_created": 1658525469, "timestamp_updated": 1665529811, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1379, "votes_funny": 66, "weighted_vote_score": "0.921342372894287109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127871362": {"recommendationid": "127871362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983023130", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1585, "last_played": 1703979056}, "language": "english", "review": "fyi you can host your own server and turn pvp off if you just wanna play with friends or peacefully alone. \nFun game.", "timestamp_created": 1670106314, "timestamp_updated": 1670106314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 179, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919654726982116699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111182305": {"recommendationid": "111182305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092709325", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1647144567}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't know Animal Crossing had a collab with PUBG", "timestamp_created": 1645986548, "timestamp_updated": 1645986548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 266, "votes_funny": 134, "weighted_vote_score": "0.903483211994171143", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111634294": {"recommendationid": "111634294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363583673", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 786, "last_played": 1647308657}, "language": "english", "review": "So Here's my Story so far.\nSpawned into the island.

You will see this game is tagged as Early Access and it's currently in beta. This is not immediately evident inside the game. The menus and graphics are gorgeous for this style of game. The music is well matched. The crafting and cooking systems are pretty basic, but there is huge potential to expand items and recipes. There are several things you can cook and craft in the game currently, but I feel like you could do plenty more with minor changes to the current items. For example, you can use 4 bundles of wheat to craft a bag of flour and then use 4 bags of flour make a loaf of bread. Or 3 to make a croissant. You can eat both the bread and the croissant, but that's it. I would like to see a recipe where you can use a loaf of bread and add fish or some other meat and create a sandwich for example. Everything appears to be single tiered at the moment, when there is clearly room for multiple tiers.\n\nThe map itself is beautifully done and the different climates offer great variety of looks suited to the climate.\n\n[h1][b][u]The In-between[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nI started with my own server that I played on privately for about 8 hours. While it was fun, it got old fairly quickly as there was no one to interact with. While I plan to continue my private server for testing and playing, I've opted to try the US-WEST Uuvana 1 server to get some human contact.\n\nOnce you begin to walk around, you will notice there aren't many people around. One thing this game appears to be lacking is NPCs. There are plenty of items to interact with, but with the lack of population (due to a mixture of the game's infancy and some toxicity within the community caused by griefers), you would expect more NPC to interact with. This is not the case. While it isn't horrible, it can feel very lonely at times. Especially since the map is large. It may not seem like it, but without a well thought out plan and some assistance from a Dinghy or boat, it can take several minutes to trek from one end of the map to the other. While you can technically swim from shore to shore, you use massive amounts of energy doing this and you would die without feeding yourself multiple food items.\n\nThe different climates are fantastic however, I do find that in it's current state of beta, there isn't a huge variety in food, wildlife (not really any variety at all here besides the fish) and I would like to see the tents and houses take on a different look based on the climate area you choose to station.\n\n[h1][b][u]The Bad[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nThere seems to be a LOT of anger towards the developers due to the constant wipes, bugs and lack of moderation for the most part with cheaters and griefers. While I personally understand this game is truly in it's infancy, others are not as understanding. This comes with the territory when you charge for a game that isn't \"done\". We currently live in a world where we apparently choose to pay to alpha and beta test, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing on it's own, it does set a precedence that allows some developers or develop studios to establish a bit of an ego. While it's easy to say \"This game is in Early Access or beta, there will be bugs\", it's an entirely different beast to charge money for it and then just say \"Sorry, not sorry\".\n\nUuvana Studios skirts a fine line in this regard. They do like to remind players every chance they get that this is indeed not a finished product and while you did pay for it, you aren't actually entitled to anything other than access to the game. I've seen people complain, rage and beg in their Discord because their entire collection was wiped due to an update. Uuvana Studios offers no solution to this aside from a reminder you are playing an unfinished game on an unfinished server. This is understandable of course however, it is absolutely bad customer service and should be recognized as such. I don't know of a solution to this issue but I do recognize it as that thin line mentioned above.\n\nRunning a private server was relatively simple. A little [i]too[/i] simple I dare say. I mention this because there are very few things you can change about the game's configuration. I expect that to change at some point, but I don't think it's on the radar to make any drastic changes to this. I would like the ability to configure all aspects of the game such as pricing, recipe configurations, damage numbers, drop quantities etc. This is something currently lacking (or at least I couldn't find any way to configure those things).\n\n[h1][b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nI do believe this game can be great. There are so many aspects that feel like they're just scratching the surface here. There's potential for numerous levels of crafting and cooking. The PvP aspect of the game adds something unique to an otherwise entirely different genre, but could use some tweaking. I'm excited to see where this game is going to and especially excited for the possibility of a Workshop full of mods.", "timestamp_created": 1672475792, "timestamp_updated": 1672476605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 79, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.887107610702514648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117103730": {"recommendationid": "117103730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856200104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 38964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8381, "last_played": 1708490023}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, let me say, I actually love this game.

I resigned some time ago. But I'm no longer an mod, so I'm only trying to rate what I feel.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]Updated November 19, 2022[/h1]\n[url=https://imgur.com/a/E3lB52h]Imgur image link[/url]\nNew announcement updated around 9:00 PST today. Long inquiries about what problems are currently happening with the game, what solutions are available, what they think about why these problems continue to occur and seem to keep avoiding responsibility, and what efforts will be made to communicate with users. They wrote the contents as a notice. Looking at this notice, I am very satisfied. I would like to thank the team for being so transparent. The relationship between client and host is based on trust. If you try to communicate anything, I think it's worth it even if it's not a really well-made AAA game. I hope you show a better side of yourself in the future.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]Updated November 17, 2022[/h1]\n[url=https://imgur.com/a/TxK298o]Imgur image link[/url]\n[quote=Th3Fly1ngCow]\nHow about you stop being so over critical I also don\u2019t need you searching everything I said trying to a make a point\nI only know.

I hope we have time to open our hearts and share what we missed each other. Communication doesn't always help, but at least it's better than feuding. And it never gonna give you up, and never gonna let you down\n[/quote]\nFun fact, I just banned from official discord server after wrote this by breaking server rules. Is steam public community include in discord? I don't think so.\nNever play this game if you like to say bad things about the game or the admins. You'll be banned. I never hacked, I never harassment, I always respect all of lv communities, I was international moderator, I was longvinter translater, and I was private server owner. I supported many Korean players, at least some global players. I wrote many document of longvinter. If you want to waste your time and contributions, buy this game now.\n[hr][/hr]\n[url=https://imgur.com/a/etpTzWI]Imgur image link[/url]\nMy timed out period has been adjusted. Unfortunately it has increased from 24 hours to 1 week. I think they don't like to admit or even hear about this situation. Can these actions be justified?\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]1. Very novel gameplay(design) (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 5/5)[/h1]\nFresh indeed. Who would have thought to put guns and chainsaws in baby games like Animal Forest? I also agree that this game is a great healing game where you can enjoy healing and killing at the same time. It's a game so well designed that no one can argue against the gameplay itself.\n\n[h1]2. Disappointing content (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 2/5)[/h1]\nBut I'm sorry about the content part though. Frankly, if you build a house, upgrade it, place turrets and build a house, and kill someone... blahblahblah.. it's a game you don't enojy anymore. Boats, new areas, and bunkers have been added with recent updates, but the development of content cannot keep up with the progress of general users. Rather, it's more like a repetitive quest than something you don't enjoy due to lack of content, but I still wish there was content that I could enjoy. Alternatively, Alternatively, it would be nice to develop so that users can create content separately, such as supporting official modding and promoting in-server events.\n\n[h1]3. Korean server unfriendly to beginners (\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 1/5)[/h1]\nWhy is the contents of the Korean server here? Because I am Korean xD. If you don't play on the Korean server, I think you may skip this paragraph.\nEven if you don't know about other servers, the Korean server is too harsh for new users to settle down. Not a generalization that speaks for all users, but the reality is that we all know that some users mock and bully new users for their own enjoyment. you'll get a buff that doesn't take damege, it will last for 1 hour and will not be provided under any circumstances after that. Looting or user hunting is one of the contents of this game. but of course the dev who is neglecting it. Due to these problems, the new users will disappear, and the existing users who have no new users will get tired and bored and leave the game one by one. Regarding this part, I would like the development team to consider the examination carefully and improve it.\n\n[h1]4. Specifications higher than I expected (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 3/5)[/h1]\nThis game.. The specifications are higher than I thought. Even the lowest option basically recommends an external graphics card, which is too heavy compared to other UE4 games. I wonder if it's heavier than Minecraft lmao. But I'm satisfied with the fact that it runs enough without frame drops on the pc running PUBG. Yeah? Where's the person who uses a PC that doesn't run the game these days? A... idk..?\n\n[h1]5. This game is filled with BUG but it will be fixed (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 3/5)[/h1]\nI've seen and seen numerous bugs since version 1.0.3. Despite the introduction of anti-cheat, there were many cheaters and even more users exploiting bugs. Of course, there is no immediate fix for new bugs like zero-day vulnerabilities. Because once they have researched the bug and have a solution in place, they can fix the problem. But this game was so serious. At the time when item copy bugs were rampant, they weren't able to distribute that general hotfix. They just blocked users who were sus of using copy bugs. Also, the boat flew around like a spaceship, Users couldn't properly enter the server, the game stopped at one moment and popped, and when I saw it, it looked more like a prototype than a preview game. Due to the characteristics of indie games, users and teams work together to fix problems and create content, but this game was nothing more than that.\nUpdated on 27, devs updated 1.0.9c experimental build and I checked, many issues were fixed. So, for now, the game is playable. I give 3 stars.\n\n[h1]6. The CS that they gave away to dog (\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 0/5)[/h1]\nYeah. Even if I was an official moderator, I think I can admit this. Even now, all operations, including the official server, ARE REALLY SUCKS. The official servers are often turned off, and it was turned off for some reason, and there was no word announcing that it would be turned on when.\nAnd there's problem on ban system. It seemed that all users were considered as potential hack/bug users without even having a log system that could accurately determine them. As in the recent innocent ban situation, the first response to the inquiry was that there was no problem, but later reversing that something was wrong was equivalent to not being qualified as a administrator.\nOperation is a really disappointing part when you see many complex things. As a result of this, it seems that all Korean servers were full at the beginning of the game's release, but now it seems that no matter how many there are, they cannot fill 30 people. It's a very unfortunate situation from the point of view of games that, no matter how well-made, are ruined because of one operation. Please break the prejudice that 'our management are always fine' and operate horizontally.\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nI would like to give 14 points out of 30. I have enough love for the game, but I don't want to encourage you to start fresh. It would be a lie if I wasn't disappointed with this game, but I still have hope that this game can develop further.", "timestamp_created": 1666537744, "timestamp_updated": 1669536246, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 79, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867271065711975098", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110899243": {"recommendationid": "110899243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059769732", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1645806856}, "language": "english", "review": "I posted a negative review complaining about a game breaking bug and an update came out a few minutes after fixing it.

I like it.\n\n[h1]Why the negative Review? TLDR[/h1]\nI felt like putting this fairly on top of the review, since people might never see the end of it.\nAt the current state of the game, I don't reccomend casual/cozy players to buy this game, since the public servers are overcrowded, filled by hostile players ready to raid you and the farming is unoptimized (but probably intended).\nIf you however decide to rent/host your own server, be warned:\n- Most sites may rent servers to you, yet joining them and playing on them is extremely buggy if not even impossible.\n- The server list, may only show your server if it \"feels like it\". Meaning, that it's extremely buggy and to reload it, you might have to restart your game. Every. Single. Time.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- [b]The Graphics[/b] - Gosh this game is stunning in it's own way. It feels cozy and lively.\n- [b]The Title Music[/b] - Sounds nice and relaxing.\n- [b]Shop System[/b] - Easy enough to learn, good to find, [spoiler]nice stock indication[/spoiler]\n- [b]Fishing[/b] - It's fishing.\n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- [b]Servers[/b] - Hosting a Server costs money and is almost only doable through external websites.\n               - Servers are overcrowded and you'd have to build far away from shops and docks.\n               - Playerbase (as expected when you give Players weapons) are hostile and might chase and kill you.\n- [b]Farming[/b] - While farming can be a nice asset to any game, getting your first house + accessories, weapons/defense, gardening, food, etc. is annoyingly longlasting.\n- [b]Buggy Lobby Listing[/b] - As stated above, finding a lobby is beyond annoying. The interface might break, bug out or just not work at all, meaning you'll have to reboot your game. A lot.\n- [b]Finding Friends[/b] - With this I mean, the general idea of playing with someone you already know. A friend, spouse or anything in between. If you first start out, you spawn of different islands, not knowing where to go and how to meet. If you get a hang of it, it's ok-ish, but it's still annoying.\n\n[h1]None of this means, that I think this game is bad or has no potential![/h1]\nWhile I always want to support new and coming games, I don't think it's worth spending your money on it, just yet.\nMaybe come back in a few Updates.

(written as of 15th of March 2022, This may be outdated)\n\nThis game should not be compared to rust as it is less difficult and lacks the toxicity of rust.\nA better comparison is Animal Crossing with guns.\n\nI've played solo on [EU] uuvana 1 (which in my experience has always had upwards of 30 people online)\nfor 11 hours and has reached the endgame.\n\n It was my first time playing so I really struggled in the early game. The game included a tutorial however it wasn't very helpful after 5 minutes. Immediately you notice how broken this game is. Dupe glitches has defeated the entire point of this, people with tens of turrets mow you down anywhere you go.\nyou learn to avoid them but this really irritated me.\n\nThe game progresses way faster depending on how you play it.\n\nFARMING in this game is almost entirely pointless until the end game and even then it isnt the best. \nBlack lotus' are the only viable plant to farm.\nIf i could tell my past self anything it would be not to waste hours on farming and that i should have used the alternative method to get money. That alternative method being.\n\nLOOT RUNS. This is by far the best way to get money in the early and mid game (and in my opinion the end game). Doing runs allows you to easily get items to sell. this is how i grinded for my first 15k cash for a turret.\n\nTOXICITY... There is absolutely no toxicity in this game, no fights and monuments and in fact no fights at all. This has to be the friendliest game with guns ive ever played, often during loot runs where other were present there wouldn't be any gun fights, Instead a race to the loot containers.\n\nGUN FIGHTS, like mentioned, the chance of you running into a fight is rare but when you do they are unfair.\nThe winner is always the one carrying the most/best food as you can easily recover all damage by spamming food. whilst the concept of stamina and health being the same thing is good it is executed badly, there should be a limit on how fast you can eat food or some sort of restriction, just anything to prevent food spamming. Another thing to mention is that players can just leave during gunfights and preserve their loot making the entire thing just a waste of time and ammo.\n\nRAIDING, this is definitely the most disappointing part of this game. There is absolutely no point in raiding, there is barely any profit to be made and it's just a waste of time, there are some cases where you can make a decent profit but in that time you could have done a loot run and made more cash. YOU CAN ONLY RAID THE OUTSIDE OF PEOPLE'S BASES AND NOT INSIDE, This just defeats me, like what's the point... this is the reason i believe you should not compare this game to rust.\n\nDUPES, this game is completely broken, i understand its still in beta however it's almost like they did not test the game at all, from what im aware they have already patched 2 dupe glitches in the 3 weeks this game has been out and im confident there is a active dupe glitch right now as the player market is filled with \ncarpets, chests and planter boxes.\n\nECONOMY. The economy is completely broken, Tarps being very cheap and can easily be crafted into planter boxes which can then be sold for major profit. Another thing to note is that if you play legitimately you will never be economically / financially better than an exploiter who abuses bugs and dupes\n\nBUGS, the abundance of bugs makes this game frustrating, people spamming tents at spawn, invisible items filling your inventory and getting stuck in rocks to inevitably be chainsawed to death. just to mention a few.\n\nDOMINATION. dominating is probably the most boring thing in the game as there's not much to do late game than mess around. no pvp, no big raids, so satisfaction.\nso the question is.\n\nSHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME.\n\nNo, the game lacks content and can become boring, the horrible pvp and raiding remove any excitement you may expect to feel. The game is buggy and dupes rule the game. \n\nAfter 11 hours I feel like I've experienced most of the game which is upsetting. This game can be so much more and I hope updates could improve the game. The game is still in beta so you cant judge it too hard.\n\nThe game is half the price of rust which is totally not worth it, i believe this game should be 1/3 the price of rust and i could even see this game being free. (I compare this game to rust here as the general consensus to people who haven't played this game here is that it is animal crossing mixed with rust.)\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a different experience from rust or to someone who cannot afford animal crossing / doesn't have a switch\n\nDon't let this review dictate whether or not you buy this game. I had lots of fun whilst playing this game, completing the journal really reminded me of when I first played animal crossing: new horizons. However I believe the negatives outweigh the positives.\n\nEDIT: after reading some reviews i noticed how many were saying this game is toxic, I disagree with this, most if not every player ive met had waved at me and then continued to do what they were doing, whenever I toxicity it often caught me off guard as after 11 hours i was expecting most to be kind. (note: i am not in the discord so i cant account for that)\n\nAnother thing that confused me from other reviews was the amount of complaining about no space to put down a tent. if you have ever played rust you know that you dont find a base location instantly. the map is fairly large and you do have to walk away to spawn to find a place where you can place your tent.", "timestamp_created": 1647307845, "timestamp_updated": 1649377625, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 171, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792071223258972168", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113870222": {"recommendationid": "113870222", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991842608", "num_games_owned": 883, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1649987203}, "language": "english", "review": "Like so many people before me have already mentioned, this game is essentially what would happen if Animal Crossing and Rust had a baby.\n\nAt first glance, you'd look at Longvinter and think \"Oh, they released Animal Crossing for PC?\", because from an audio/visual standpoint, it resembles Animal Crossing, almost entirely. That being said, once you actually hop in and start playing the game, you'll quickly notice that this game differs from AC quite a bit.\n\nJust like at the start of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, your primary objective is to set up camp, in the form of a tent. The tent can be acquired by purchasing it from a vending machine, located in one of the many outposts spread out across the world. Just follow the shoreline and you'll be sure to find one. However, in order to purchase your first tent, you'll need to earn some cash.\n\nSo what does one have to do to earn a quick buck, you ask?\nThere are a few different ways to go about this in Longvinter. Collecting plants, fishing, looting the various landmarks spread around the world for items, and then selling all the aforementioned things at the vending machines back at the outposts. Even PvP can be profitable, but you most likely won't be doing that as soon as you join your first server.\n\nWhen you've gathered enough money and purchased your first tent, it's now time to find a nice spot to call home. This is where Longvinter starts differing quite a bit from Animal Crossing, and leaning more into the Rust-side of things.\n\nYou see, as I mentioned above, PvP is a very real thing in Longvinter, so being strategic about the placement of your tent is going to be fairly important, since you'll be competing for resources with all the other players that live around you.\n\nOnce your tent is set up in a nice spot, you'll want to either buy or find a fireplace and a workbench to place inside your tent, as well as a few containers to store your hard-earned loot in. These things can all be found both in vending machines, and in lootable containers at the various landmarks around the world.\n\nThe workbench is arguably your most important piece of furniture/technology here, as not only does it allow you to craft a multitude of items, such as weaponry or furniture, but it also allows you to upgrade your tent to a house by collecting 100 pieces of wood. This is especially useful, since your tent will by default be automatically removed after a set amount of time.\n\nThe fireplace (along with campfires) will allow you to cook food and regenerate energy, which is also used as health in Longvinter.\n\nSo now that you've got your house set up, what's next?\nWell, you'll probably want to set up some planter boxes outside your house to grow various plants, such as berry bushes or flowers. And it would be silly to just let your neighbors walk onto your land and allow them to steal your crops, so you may as well build some fencing around your house to keep them out.\n\nBut then, what's to stop your neighbors from just breaking down your fence and stealing your precious flowers anyway? Time to start building some automated sentry turrets and place those bad boys all around your garden. That should show those thieving neighbors that you're not messing around. Actually, while you're at it, you've probably got a couple of weapons and some ammo laying around from all the looting you've been doing. Why not put those to use and show the neighbors who is the boss in this neighborhood. Guns solve everything in Longvinter.\n\nJokes aside, as of this review, the game is still freshly in Early Access since less than a month back, and there's not a whole lot to do in the game at this point in time, but Longvinter already has a ton of potential to hit on multiple different audiences, whether you're coming from a PvP/Survival-background or a more casual Sim/Farming/Building-background, there will be something for everyone in this game.\n\nSo far, I haven't run into a single bug or crash in my short time playing the game, and most of the interactions that I've had with other players have been a quick wave before heading in opposite directions. The developers seem incredibly keen to listen to their community, and although they appear to already have a vision for what they want their game to become, it looks like they are very interested in making something that their playerbase actually wants to play, plus they post frequently about what's currently being worked on.\n\nI look forward to seeing what's to come for Longvinter.", "timestamp_created": 1649989563, "timestamp_updated": 1649989563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.788125336170196533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124496129": {"recommendationid": "124496129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175156183", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 8370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7805, "last_played": 1711053939}, "language": "english", "review": "I really liked this game, but the constant resets, servers going down for extended periods, and lackluster moderation make me not want to play anymore.

I've been an Animal Crossing Fan since my childhood and I recently started playing Rust. So this game looked like a perfect match for me! I was sceptical first, because of some reviews. I started playing on the official servers first. I streamed this game on Twitch and my community and I loved the asthetics and the little sound the player makes if he moves haha! I had a hilarious time and I met another german player. It was fun to interact and I love the fact that you can play together online. 5 mins later a viewer joined on the same server and we formed a team. Another 5 min later two other viewers joined too. It was hard to find a place for our tent, because the official servers are full. I think for a single person it's fine to find a place, but as a group of 5 we struggled. BUT we went to the new autumn island and there was plenty of space. We had a lot of fun. Sadly the next day some of our tents were gone (I think it's a bug). But we bought new tents. The next day after our houses were gone again. That was a bit frustrating. People could steal from our garden, because it wasn't protected anymore. Anyways I started streaming this game on monday and I'm addicted since then. Same goes for my community. I think around 15 people or more bought the game (Best Longvinter Influencer kappa) and we started our own server. And it is soooooo MUCH better, because you have a lot of space, you can move freely and we have our own rules.

Don't listen to the negative reviews. Yes, there are bugs and occasional annoying server issues, but it's still in Beta.  If you like chill Animal Crossing style games but wish for guns, loot, and more social interaction without a Nintendo Online subscription, just pay the $30 (or wait for a $15 sale) and thank me later. \n\nOriginal Review: \nI'm a middleaged mom who got bored of mundane Animal Crossing and tired of the intense battles in Fortnite and repetitive gameplay of Raft.  I yearned for a game with a balanced amalgamation of survival, online multiplayer, cute graphics, loot spawns, and relaxing gameplay with a hint of danger.  \n\nWHY is Longvinter so underrated?! It has exactly what I've been looking for in a casual game and had me addicted on the first day and then again after the monthly server wipe.  Probably 95% of the people I've met in game are friendly with a few turds mixed in who will shoot you in the back with an assault rifle after waiving hello.  It is aggravating to find your base raided and a tad annoying to deal with monthly wipes, but it also provides goals to motivate continued gameplay.  Then there's the loot spawns...SUCH a rush to find a fresh loot drop and try to escape with the goodies!  Being early access, I have noticed a few bugs and occasionally have to force close the game via Steam and restart, but I have confidence these will be worked out in time.      \n\nI HIGHLY recommend at least giving Longvinter a try...you can always request a Steam refund if it's not your cup of tea.
