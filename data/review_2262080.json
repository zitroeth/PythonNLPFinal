Start in a nice pastoral setting, summon the first boss when you feel ready. Defeating the boss unlocks new materials and structures to play with. Go to a slightly spookier biome, find the next tier of materials and mobs, make the next tier of tools and armor, summon the second boss when ready, rinse and repeat. It's a formula that works and let's the player move at the pace they are comfortable with. Plus you have a programmable grammi buddy who adventures alongside of you.\n\nThe secondary loop is the city building. You can found a city and then summon grammis to work in it as helpers (slaves, they never stop working). They come with a few basic scripts, which I appreciate because it removes the tedium of either writing the same basic script over and over again, or trying to copy and paste it between grammis. For example, there is a Craft from one resource script. All it requires is for you to click on the workstation, the box that's the source of materials, and the box that the finished product goes in. All on one screen, then press play, and off your grammi goes. You can also make your own custom scripts if you want to, haven't played around with that much, yet.\n\nThe one area that disappointed me is the exploration. The map is procedurally generated and feels like it. The starting biome is pretty, but that's about all I can say for it. When you explore it, there is nothing memorable and very little to find. There are mushrooms and berries to pick. You can find a chest in a rowboat (that is often far from any water), a chest in a cart, or a chest under a roofed frame. All three chests contain the same exact items. The only thing to find other than an occasional wolf, boar, or deer, are these black watchtowers that you can climb up. As you near the top, a stone in the center of the single room at the top spawns some wolves and animated mushrooms to attack you. You kill them, destroy the stone (or it keeps spawning more critters, guess you could stay and farm them if you want), loot the chest (again little to no variety in loot), and leave. That's it for the starting area. It's very easy to lose your bearings when everything looks the same. Luckily, you can bring up a map that will show you what direction your home city is in. You can also place markers on the map and after killing the first boss create portals to teleport back to your city.\n\nI've gotten to the point where I am about to found a new city in the second biome. It's visually distinct from the starting area and seems to have a bigger variety of things to fight, so I'm hoping that the exploration aspect of the game improves as I move along. If not, the game is in Early Access, so hopefully that's something the devs work on.", "timestamp_created": 1711840273, "timestamp_updated": 1711840273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746534526348114014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162092907": {"recommendationid": "162092907", "author": {"steamid": "76561199453805889", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 457, "last_played": 1712141683}, "language": "english", "review": "In it's current state the game is overpriced,\n\t---1. weapons act the same despite their looks and same can be said for the enemies, now matter if its a giant snake, wolf, turtle or goblin they will rush you, hit you, and then circle around to hit you again unless they have a ranged attack in which case they just lob rocks or \"poison\" that does nothing different to the rock except look different, which makes combat just hit with weapon that does the most damage until you or the mob dies and you will rarely die unless there's a lot of them especially since the grammi that follows you can easily fight off any mob.\n\t---2.There is little reason to explore  as every tower, monster camp, and dungeon is copy pasted and biomes don't vary to much, \n         ---3.Now for the selling point and what made me interested in the game the grammi, what they can actually do is limited, if you understand a basic coding you can turn them into an assembly line for any item you need and thats pretty much it, the one that follows you is bigger and can fight but you can't tell it how you want it to fight. \n\t---I think the best way to sum up the issue with this game the lack of personality, everything acts the same with the only difference being a simple color/model swap.

It\u2019s especially fun with friends, making it a refreshing change from the usual competitive games.\n\nWow, Omega Crafter! Just when I thought games were all about who's the quickest or the strongest, along comes this gem that flips the script. I\u2019ve only clocked a bit over an hour on this early access title, and I'm already hooked. It\u2019s like finding that cozy spot on your couch that feels just right.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the big deal? Omega Crafter throws you into this quirky world that's kinda under attack, but not in the way you\u2019d expect. It's all about building, exploring, and, best of all, hanging out with your \"Grammi\" - think of it as your sidekick who\u2019s down for whatever crazy plan you\u2019ve got in your head. And yes, you can program them to do almost anything. Want a dance partner? Done. Need help chopping down trees? They\u2019ve got you.\n\nPlaying this game feels different. I mean, I love a good competitive match as much as the next person, but Omega Crafter? It\u2019s like coming home after a long day. It\u2019s chill, it makes you think, and it's a blast, especially when you rope in some friends to join the madness. You\u2019re not just playing; you\u2019re creating, laughing, and sometimes just watching in awe as your little programmed buddies do their thing.\n\nBuilding your own city is as cool as it sounds. You find all sorts of materials and then get creative. And with the Grammi\u2019s help, you can automate stuff, which feels like you\u2019re managing your own little world. And the best part? You can bring your friends along for the ride. Whether you\u2019re teaming up to take down a tough monster or just hanging out and building together, it\u2019s a whole lot of fun to share the experience.\n\nLong story short, Omega Crafter is a gem. It\u2019s not just about surviving; it\u2019s about creating, exploring, and having a good time with friends. It makes you feel good, like you\u2019ve actually accomplished something fun and worthwhile. If you\u2019re looking for a game that\u2019s a break from the usual, definitely give this one a try.

I give it a recommended because I think it will be good in the future, but if you don't like incomplete early access games then wait a bit.  If you look at the video for the game you see all these complicated cities and stuff going in. Unless you get more programming commands as you advance I'm not sure how you would do all this.  \n\nRight now I\"m a 'master programmer'.\n\nOpen Window                  [100%]\nDrag   Icons                      [100%]\nDon't drool on keyboard  [58%]\n\nYep, I'm a master programmer.\n\nIt's not that the programming setup is bad. It's just that, when you take out all the conditionals and looping, there's really nothing you can do.  For example\n\nLoop Start\n    Cut down tree until it falls down\nEnd Loop\n\nOK. What if I want to cut down the tree, pick up the stuff, and move it? There's no commands to tell the the bot thing to go to a specific location other than a field - which is an area where planting tiles are laid down.   So, most of the time, the guy just stands there and complains he cant find any trees.  I can't say - go to 100,100 (camp center relative) and look for trees.  I have to lead the guy there. So, while I don't have to chop the trees, I have to take the guy there and stand and watch.   It's like a road construction supervisor simulator.  I stand there and watch the other guy do the work.  I haven't found the coffee yet though.\n\nAs for the 'fields'.  OK. I figured it out. You place planting plots on top of the village tiles. Got it. I set up a 'super program' to tell the guy to go get a seed from the box and plant it.  RUN PROGRAM!  I'm automating now... wait. The guy is stuck on my campfire.  I have to go nudge him so he can walk to the plot. OK he's planting. Coming back and ... stuck on the camp fire. \n\nHow do I move the camp fire? I can destroy it but what if I want to move it? Looks like I can't.  Ugh.\n\nYeah, it's early access but the videos show these amazing automated cities and I can't figure out how, based on the command set, you would get this.    I can 'automate' building things if the chests are filled correctly by telling a bot to make something at a table by getting materials from chest a, making the item, and putting it into chest b. However, there's no way for me to control filling it with materials.  Like I said, if the granny (grammi) isn't led by the nose to a tree it just stands there and complains. And then, when it cuts down the tree it moves on to the next. I have to pick up the wood. There's a 'pick up' command, but since the bot has to be right there I can't assign another guy to go out and pick them up. Then, there seems to be no way to tell the bot to take the stuff that was picked up and go put it in a box. \n\nFor other things, like making tiles to expand the village, you have to do that from your build menu so it doesn't seem to be automatable.   It would be nice to be able to set up a granny bot to go look for and chop down trees, then pick up the logs and bring them back and put in a chest.  As I mentioned earlier, there's not location commands other than 'field' so you can't tell them to roam an area and pick up dropped stuff. It's like manual automation. As long as you manually lead the bot to the right place, it will do an automated job. As long as you bring the resources and put them in a box, a bot will do it's automated job.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Maybe it's coming later on. But right now I can't figure  out how to do anything completely automated that will let me go off adventuring while work gets done. I have to be there to handhold the whole time.\n\nThe 'programming language' is best described as meh--  Nothing interesting and nothing really useful.  I know. It's for the children so they can learn about programming. When I was a kid we had the Timex/Sinclair 1000 with 2k of ram, no storage, and black and white graphics! AND WE LIKED IT! It's cute and all, but I can't see a 5 year old writing device drivers or code to predict stock market trends after becoming a master programmer. \"Good job little budyd. You're a programmer!\".  \n\nAs for the story... there isn't one yet. I have no idea why I'm there, what I'm supposed to do, or why I should care. (Hey, that rhymes).  I have seen a couple of boars, some wolves, trees, rocks berries, mushrooms and that's about it.  Am I supposed to look for something? The tutorial was short and very basic and didn't give a single hint as to what your motivations or goals are. Sure, it's early access. Regardless, right now I have no idea what to do so I can't really give any info on this aspect of the game or how good it is since I'm not sure if it's there. Yes, early access. Checks in the mail.  Coming soon. Void where prohibited. Batteries required.  Some assembly required. All that good stuff. But right now - Meh. \n\nFinal item - Grammi? Why Grammi? Find a cooler acronym. Saying \"I'm building a base with my grammi\" sounds like you are a British kid playing in his back yard with his family.  \"I have me grammy build something and then I ask me mum to move it.\"  How about  \"(B)asic (A)rtificial (R)obotic (F)riend\" or (T)actical (U)se (R)obotic (D)efender.  \n\nIt will most likely be good on final release and it is not a bad game, if a bit empty. IT'S EARLY ACCESS! WHY CAN'T YOU REMEMBER IT'S EARLY ACCESS? I can't really review a game on features that haven't been released yet and the review is supposed to tell you whether or not you should buy it now.  If I brought you a 1/2 cooked lasagna and said - it's early access - what would you think. It needs to be cooked more? Then put it back in the oven and call me when it's done. (Assuming you like lasagna. Otherwise you might just dump it over my head and call it a day..", "timestamp_created": 1712061101, "timestamp_updated": 1712062510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538489580154418945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162144676": {"recommendationid": "162144676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119838119", "num_games_owned": 4122, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 364, "playtime_at_review": 345, "last_played": 1712741825}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]\u25a0Overview[/b][/h1]\nOmega Crafter is an open-world survival craft game where you team up with programmable sidekick, Grammi. Program Grammi to gather materials, build your town, and forge weapons and armor to take on foes. (Online co-op is also an option, although I haven't given it a try yet.)\n\nA survival craft with programming, it sounds hardcore, but actually, this game is quite casual in a good way.\n\n\n[h1][b]\u25a0Grammi[/b][/h1]\nIt\u2019s a cute creature that serves you as a loyal minion.\nThere are two types, companion and city.\nBoth can be programmable.\nThey work tirelessly forever without food and sleep.\nBut when they get knocked out, it takes a few minutes to recover.\n\n[h3]Companion Type[/h3]\nThere is only one in the game and it always follows you.\nWhen you are in a fight, it fights with you.\nThere is a dedicated skill tree for it separated from the player\u2019s.\n\n[h3]City Type[/h3]\nThey only stay inside the outpost and they don\u2019t fight.\n\n\n[h1][b]\u25a0Survival[/b][/h1]\nThe game is called a survival-game, but it doesn't have demanding and annoying survival elements.\n\nThere is no hunger and thirst. So you don\u2019t have to worry about feeding yourself or the minions at all.\nThere are food items, but they give you temporary buff effects and slightly heal HP.\nThere are no equipment duration mechanics, so they don\u2019t break.\n\nIt\u2019s fantastic that there are no hardcore survival features in this game, since those elements make me want to quit playing a game.\n\n\n[h1][b]\u25a0Building Outpost[/b][/h1]\nCrafting items is one of the main objects in this game. You have to craft equipment to get strong and produce and process items to progress the game.\n\nIt\u2019s up to you if you build a minimal city or enjoy building a detailed city.\nObjects are unlocked as you progress the game.\n\n\n[h1][b]\u25a0Automation, Program[/b][/h1]\nSome people may think programming stuff is overwhelming, but it\u2019s not that difficult. The game doesn\u2019t force you to dive into complex programming. Using only simple templates also works. It\u2019s like building up sentences in a way.\n\nOf course creating a detailed and complex order is one way to have fun. You can create detailed and complex orders with conditions. It\u2019s really satisfying when you manage to successfully automate as you intended.\n\n-Loop\u2026\n-Try this\u2026 if you fail\u2026\n-Attack [...] until it breaks\n-Repeat\u2026, \u2026times\n-Search\u2026 and pick up\n-Restart the process\netc\u2026\n\n\n[h1][b]\u25a0Craft[/b][/h1]\nGather material and create stronger equipment and place advanced craft workbenches to craft equipment, refined materials, consumable food, etc. Explore deeper and encounter the stronger enemies and get rarer material.\nYou can include craft in an automation process.\n\n\n[h1][b]\u25a0Progression[/b][/h1]\nOnce you unlock the specific item, you are able to feed any items for EXP to level up the world. Additional City Grammi and an additional outpost will get purchasable.\n\n\n[h1][b]\u25a0Battle Mechanics[/b][/h1]\nIt\u2019s simple and casual.\nAll you can do is\u2026\n-Melee attack \n-Shoot arrow\n-Dodge roll\n-Guard with shield\n\nThere is ordinary stamina mechanics, so it\u2019s not zero depth.\nIf you don\u2019t like fighting, leaving it to your companion Grammi is an option. But they are not invincible so be careful.\n\n\n[h1][b]\u25a0Cons[/b][/h1]\nThere are no severe problems, but I will share some minor complaints. The game is still in early access, so I am sure the dev will add and fix a lot of stuff. (Or I might haven\u2019t progressed the game enough.)\n\n-Some SEs are not good. Especially when you attack trees and rocks.\n-The character customization doesn't have a variety of options.\n-There is no story element, apparently. I have no idea what\u2019s going on in the world and the player character.\n-Night is dark but there is no equipment that provides a light source like a portable torch.\n-There is no decent way to defend an outpost, since City Grammi can\u2019t fight.\n\n\n[h1][b]\u25a0Summary[/b][/h1]\nEven though it\u2019s an open world survival craft with programming, it\u2019s casual and really approachable even for light gamers.\nIt\u2019s not punishing and you can play at your own pace.\nBuilding up automation with Grammi is fun too!\nIt's already fun and a very promising early access game.\nHighly recommended!\n\n[code][h1][b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36212671]\u25a0Follow my Steam Curator for more reviews![/url][/b][/h1][/code]\n\n[h1][b]\u25a0My Review Video[/b][/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkL-4cy80po", "timestamp_created": 1712182923, "timestamp_updated": 1712183067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537391304969787598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162039713": {"recommendationid": "162039713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076528121", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1712382054}, "language": "english", "review": "babys first coding project", "timestamp_created": 1712075307, "timestamp_updated": 1712075307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523926854133605957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162927235": {"recommendationid": "162927235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280519100", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 896, "playtime_at_review": 888, "last_played": 1713319652}, "language": "english", "review": "Not so much commands for helpers, but idea is great!\nI can see progress patch-by-patch.

While the coding is extremely cool once you start to understand it, there seems to be some limitation in creating more than one sequence of events for your little slaves to do. You can set them to do one thing,\r\n\r\nThere also needs to be more options for gear. Right now it's basically a cycle of do said zone, collect gear from zone, craft gear for that zone, beat that zone, enter new zone where old gear is useless and repeat cycle.

Unfortunately, because it is Early Access, with emphasis on [i]early[/i], it's hard to see where this is going yet.\n\nThe exploration is randomly wandering around very three (so far) large biomes that have very little to do in them, other than fighting the limited mobs, gathering limited resources, and finding limited dungeons.  Oh, and each biome has a boss that you can defeat repeatedly.\n\nThe survival consists of eating different foods for different buffs, but you won't die if you don't eat - very Valheim-like.  The mobs aren't too tough, with a few notable exceptions,but even the harder ones are more along the lines of \"bullet\" sponges - keep moving and you should defeat them easily.\n\nThe crafting consists of making a limited number of weapons, armor, food, etc., but somethings can only be made at workbenches, while some others can be made in your hand.  Personally, I think having the character being able to craft certain items via hand like forges, smelters, walls, etc., should have been restricted to a workbench.  This would give you another reason to delve deeper into the automation, which I'll discuss next.\n\nSo, the real star of the game - automation.  I mostly like how it is implemented in this game.  It is fairly easy to comprehend, setup, and execute, and so far I haven't had an issue with pathing, Grammi's \"forgetting\" their jobs, or other issues that seem to crop up in quite a few games similar to this.  There are a few \"programming\" options that I wish were present, but this is EA and I haven't maxed out world limit (think of this as the tech ages/levels) in the game.\n\nCombat is rather lackluster - spam attacks with a bow, sword, spear, etc., at mobs that make a beeline towards you and initiate their special attack as soon as they get within range.  There are some mobs with ranged attacks, but still, nothing really challenging.\n\nFinally, for $24.99, you're mostly supporting the dev, as what is here doesn't seem to justify the cost.  I don't have an issue with that, but do some research if you're expecting a very in-depth game, as this isn't at that level yet.\n\nI can recommend it to fans (of the genre(s)), but anyone else should do some hard thinking before purchasing at this time.", "timestamp_created": 1712345444, "timestamp_updated": 1712368656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161966836": {"recommendationid": "161966836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161001646", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1712035846}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS IS THE GOODEST GAME.

It makes the game feel cozy and not just about hackin' and slashin'.\n\nThat's where my nice things end sadly. where the game needs improvements:\n\n-Entities are generic and have poor AI pathing/combat\n\n-Translations need improvement as there are a good number of spelling and grammar errors. (Not game breaking and you still get the point i.e. \"You did it! Congratunlation.\"\n\n-I am going to alienate myself here but I play with controller wherever possible. It isn't possible here as I had to bounce back and forth between keyboard and controller every few seconds which I didn't enjoy.\n\n-The music feels lifeless. I feel like they could have enlisted someone off of Fiverr to do a decent job but instead went with whoever in the team has the slightest grasp of FruityLoops. \n\n-Mapping. What happened here? I remember back in the RPG Maker 3 days where you could design your own map and if you tried to put hills sometimes they would end up like these big pointy, untraversable, spires. There a re a good few of these which makes me feel like the Devs didn't do a walk through of their own map. I hope I am wrong.\n\nConclusion: I think while the Devs are both of a foreign language and are amateurs in game creation, they have a great idea here and I think with more effort and using the money from sales to hire on some developed talent, they can make something really outstanding here in a couple years.

Each player gets a Grammi, who can be programmed to do a lot of the heavy lifting for the players. Using the city grammi's of which there are many, things like crafting arrows can be automated. It's a unique twist on what is quickly becoming a crowded genre. \r\n\r\nPositives:\r\nLearn Object oriented coding\r\nDifficult bosses, but with easily readable routines. \r\nFun to play with friends. \r\n\r\nNegatives:\r\nI've found that it makes me motion sick now, where as it didn't before. Hopefully as more accessibility becomes available, it won't be an issue anymore. \r\nScaling. A boss that's hard for a player to Solo is a lot easier when six people are beating it down. \r\nNot much guidance after the tutorial. \r\n\r\nDespite it's negatives, I've found myself really enjoying the game. There's a lot of game considering it's in early access as it requires exploration. It may tell players where the first big boss is, but after that, it's about finding it yourself.
