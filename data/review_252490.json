By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

It's like being thrown into a survival sandbox with the goal of creating a glorious empire, but instead, you end up being chased by a naked man wielding a rock. Here's my tongue-in-cheek review of this roller coaster of emotions called Rust:\n\nAre you tired of predictable games where the biggest threat is boredom? Well, Rust has got you covered! Step into a world where everything wants to kill you, including your so-called \"friends.\"\n\nAt first glance, Rust might seem like a quaint little survival game. But oh no, it's more intense than trying to explain quantum physics to a goldfish. The first lesson you'll learn is to trust no one. Your best buddy might be helping you build a base one moment, and the next, they'll be stealing your pants and running off into the sunset laughing maniacally.\n\nThe graphics? Well, let's just say if Picasso designed a post-apocalyptic wasteland, it would look like Rust. Prepare to marvel at majestic sights such as floating rocks, trees with commitment issues.\n\nBut fear not, aspiring survivalists! Rust offers a rich crafting system that lets you build anything from simple tools to elaborate fortresses. Of course, the catch is that every time you take a step outside your base, you're risking it all. It's like playing Jenga with your sanity.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the wildlife. Sure, you've got your typical wolves and bears, but have you ever been chased by a chicken with a vendetta? Trust me, it's an experience you won't soon forget.\n\nNow, let's talk about the community. It's a delightful mix of hardcore survivalists, roleplayers who take their virtual lives too seriously, and twelve-year-olds screaming profanities like they're auditioning for a Tarantino movie. It's like a social experiment gone wrong, and you're trapped in the middle of it.\n\nIn conclusion, Rust is like that spicy curry you ordered thinking you could handle the heat. It's chaotic, unpredictable, and occasionally leaves you questioning your life choices. But despite all its quirks, there's something strangely addictive about it. Just be prepared to lose your dignity, your loot, and possibly your sanity along the way.\n\nFinal Verdict: Rust \u2013 Where friendship goes to die and, Would play again... if I ever manage to stop crying in the fetal position.\n\nRemember, in Rust, you either adapt or you become someone else's dinner.

When I looked at the community section, I realized that many people have been unfairly banned recently. If you check my account, there is no bad news. You can see that there is no purposeful action.

help but feel the weight of the void that Rust has left in my life. This game, if you can even call it that, is a digital plague that infects the minds of its players, consuming their time, their sanity, and ultimately, their relationships.\n\nAt first glance, Rust may appear to be just another survival game, but don't be fooled by its seemingly innocuous facade. It's a trap, a digital siren luring unsuspecting players into its treacherous waters, only to drown them in a cesspool of frustration and despair.\n\nFrom the moment you spawn into its unforgiving world, you're thrust into a Darwinian nightmare where only the strongest survive. But survival in Rust isn't just about scavenging for resources and fending off hostile players and wildlife; it's about sacrificing every ounce of your humanity in a desperate bid to cling to existence.\n\nThe community, if you can call it that, is a toxic wasteland populated by griefers, trolls, and sociopaths. Trust no one, they say, and for good reason. In Rust, betrayal is not just common\u2014it's expected. Your so-called allies will stab you in the back the moment it benefits them, leaving you with nothing but a bitter taste of betrayal.\n\nBut perhaps the most insidious aspect of Rust is its insatiable appetite for your time. It's a black hole that sucks you in, promising endless excitement and adventure, only to leave you stranded in a never-ending cycle of grinding and monotony. Hours turn into days, days into weeks, and before you know it, you've lost all sense of time and purpose.\n\nAnd then there are the consequences beyond the game itself. Relationships strained, friendships shattered, and loved ones lost. Rust doesn't just ruin your virtual life; it seeps into every aspect of your existence, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.\n\nIn conclusion, Rust is not just a game; it's a digital addiction, a destructive force that preys on the vulnerable and leaves nothing but devastation in its wake. Approach with caution, for once you enter its world, there's no turning back. It's a descent into madness, a journey from which few emerge unscathed. Avoid it at all costs, unless you're prepared to sacrifice everything you hold dear at the altar of Rust.", "timestamp_created": 1711495557, "timestamp_updated": 1711495589, "voted_up": false,

The challenge is addicting, however you will eventually become demoralized from the amount of endless cheaters that play this game and quickly move on to something else.\n\n*Update:\nI'm able to take my time and enjoy all the aspects of this game on a PVE server atm and am having fun.

From the moment you spawn into its unforgiving world, you're thrust into a primal struggle for existence where every decision matters, and every encounter could mean life or death.\r\n\r\nWhat sets Rust apart from its peers is its unyielding commitment to emergent gameplay. Unlike other survival titles, Rust doesn't hold your hand or provide a set path to follow. Instead, it drops you into a vast, open world with nothing but your wits and instincts to guide you. Whether you choose to form alliances with other players, build towering fortresses, or roam the wilderness as a lone wolf, the choice is entirely yours.\r\n\r\nThe sheer depth of Rust's crafting system is staggering. Want to build a cozy shelter to weather the elements? Gather resources and start constructing. Feel like raiding an enemy base? Craft explosives and siege weaponry to breach their defenses. The possibilities are endless, limited only by your imagination and resourcefulness.\r\n\r\nBut be warned: Rust is not for the faint of heart. The world is teeming with dangers, from starvation and dehydration to vicious wildlife and hostile players. Every step you take could lead to peril, but therein lies the thrill. It's this constant tension between risk and reward that keeps you on the edge of your seat, heart pounding as you fight tooth and nail to survive another day.\r\n\r\nBeyond its brutal gameplay, Rust boasts stunning visuals that bring its harsh world to life in breathtaking detail. From sprawling forests to desolate wastelands, every inch of the landscape is meticulously crafted, immersing you in a world that feels both beautiful and savage in equal measure.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps Rust's greatest strength lies in its community. Whether you're teaming up with friends or forging alliances with strangers, the bonds you form in Rust are unlike any other. From epic battles against rival clans to moments of camaraderie around a flickering campfire, Rust fosters a sense of camaraderie and camaraderie that few other games can match.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Rust is more than just a game; it's a visceral, immersive experience that challenges you to adapt, survive, and thrive in a world where danger lurks around every corner. With its deep crafting system, stunning visuals, and vibrant community, Rust stands as a shining example of what survival gaming can achieve. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the genre, Rust offers an adventure unlike any other, one that will keep you coming back for more time and time again.", "timestamp_created":

"language": "english", "review": "After 83 hours of gameplay in Facepunch official server hosted in Great Britain, I can say that only 1% of the players who buy this game will be able to have some fun or entertainment. Developers of new videogames should start considering a new formula to implement sandbox survival pvp videogames.\nAnyway, my experience so far and the reason for this review starting since day 3-4 in official european facepunch server:\n* Find wooden base without doors, create doors and cupboard and lock it, essentially stealing someone elses work. The wooden base was located in a forest.\n* After barely one day and a half have multiple people destroy the metal doors. The first time they left after stealing only two boxes with things I did not need did not care had not use for. Second time \"they\" destroyed all doors put a door with a codelock and left my bedroll intact. They also destroyed the cupboard and created a new one locking it too. They did not put materials inside, the reason for doing this was to make sure none would be able to use the base anymore. I threw away all the materials so probably they picked nothing and the reason to destroy the base was simply for the sake of it. The base disappeared a few hours later since they put no materials inside. \n* Use the base to unlock some technologies by entering using ladders. Have the raiders destroy nearby wooden bases made by a chinese, one of which I also took over to store tools to collect the scrap.\n* Migrate and make 2 1x1. Spend the next 50 hours making trips to collect 50-120 scraps to unlock t1 technologies.\n* Complete the tier 1 technologies. I can fight with shotguns and revolvers, 90% of the players who will kill me will shoot me from 50+ meters, making the shotgun and revolver useless. They also have healing, better armor and possibly even nightvision googles, to shoot even at night from big compounds.\n* Try to collect more scrap to be able to repeat this process for at least 100 hours more while been absolutely defenseless. Get killed by wolves 6 times in a row, then get killed by player with tier3 machinegun, and player with revolver, just after I respawn and decided it was not worth it to try again at deep night.\n* To top it all, 99% of the players who killed me in rust so far, are A) Russian B) Chinese  C) Russians with chinese names. Obviously you will see people chatting in Cyrillic 99% of the time. \n\nMy advice to improve the experience: \n- Rename facepunch eu servers to \"Facepunch Chinese-Russian Hosted in Europe\".\n\nAddendum: I did not write a lot of anecdotes of course. In regards to toxicity in voice chat, mostly none since russians and chinese dominate the server and they are basically playing a battleroyale where they are the only ones with weapons, so they never die or lose anything. I played a lot of hours since I bought the game. Any other person with less time to play would find his experience to be exponentially worse. Finally, I may go on playing Rust in the future, since I already bought it, but I doubt 99% of those who buy it will not regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1711024862, "timestamp_updated": 1711025286,

Great job holding bombsite B.\"\nOffer advice: \"Remember to check your corners when entering a new room.\"\nReinforce teamwork: \"Let's stick together and trade kills if one of us goes down.\"\nEconomic and equipment updates:\n\nDiscuss the team's economy: \"We should save this round since we're low on money.\"\nSuggest weapon drops: \"I can drop an AK-47 for someone who needs it.\"\nRequest utility usage: \"Save your grenades for the next round, we need the money.\"\nRemember, clear and concise communication is key in CS:GO, so make sure to convey information quickly and accurately without overcrowding the voice chat.

Yes, you heard that right. You spawn into this wild, untamed world with nothing but your wits and your will to survive. And maybe a rock. If you\u2019re lucky. \ud83e\udea8\ud83c\udf51\n\n**\ud83d\udc65 Social Dynamics: The Good, the Bad, and the Utterly Hilarious**\n\nRust isn\u2019t just about surviving the elements; it\u2019s about surviving each other. You\u2019ll encounter players who are as likely to help you build a shelter as they are to chase you down with a spear for the sheer fun of it. Trust is a luxury here, much like pants. And speaking of Easter eggs, keep an eye out for the infamous \u201cChurch of the Rock\u201d - a player-made sanctuary where the rock is worshipped. Yes, the same one you start with. \ud83c\udff0\ud83d\ude4f\n\n**\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Crafting and Building: Minecraft on Hardcore Mode**\n\nBuilding a fortress with automatic turrets and intricate traps is the dream, right? Just remember, for every hour you spend perfecting your base, there\u2019s a naked newbie out there with nothing but a dream and a dozen satchel charges ready to blow it all up. The circle of life in Rust is brutal but fair. Pro tip: hide your loot in the most inconceivable places. Like a decoy chicken coop. Yes, really. \ud83d\udc14\ud83d\udca3\n\n**\ud83c\udf0d Environment: Where Nature is Out to Get You**\n\nThe environment in Rust is as beautiful as it is deadly. Radiation zones, wild animals, and the ever-looming threat of hypothermia are just a few of the delights awaiting you. Ever been killed by a chicken in Rust? If not, are you even playing it right? Keep an eye out for the rare, possibly mythical, glowing-eyed wolf. Some say it\u2019s the game developers' way of saying, \u201cWe love you. Now die.\u201d \ud83d\udc3a\u2728\n\n**\ud83d\udd2b Combat: Where Every Encounter is a Story**\n\nWhether you\u2019re engaging in a full-scale raid with your clan or defending your solo base against marauders, combat in Rust is intense, unpredictable, and often hilarious. There\u2019s a special kind of camaraderie that forms when you and a stranger spend 10 minutes missing every shot, only to die to a bear together. Truly, memories to cherish. \ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc94\n\n**\ud83c\udfa9 The Easter Eggs: Hidden Gems for the Observant**\n\nRust is riddled with Easter eggs for those with a keen eye. From the \u201cRustangelo\u201d paintings (masterpieces drawn on signs by players) to hidden messages from the devs in the most unlikely places, there\u2019s always something new to discover. Keep an eye out for the \u201cDancing Bear\u201d video. It\u2019s an oldie but a goodie, showcasing the devs' sense of humor. \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc3b\n\n**\ud83c\udfad Conclusion: Rust - A Beautiful Nightmare**\n\nIn the end, Rust is more than a game; it\u2019s a social experiment wrapped in a survival simulator, dipped in chaos, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of insanity. Whether you\u2019re the architect of the next grand fortress, a lone wolf surviving against all odds, or the naked newbie with a rock and a dream, Rust offers an unforgettable experience. Just remember, in Rust, the journey is the reward. That, and finally finding pants. \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc56\n\nSo, to my fellow professional, crazy, funny Rust gamers: embrace the chaos, revel in the absurdity, and never, ever forget to laugh. Because in Rust, when everything goes wrong, that\u2019s when the real fun begins.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\r\n\r\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\r\n\r\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\r\n\r\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\r\n\r\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\r\n\r\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\r\n\r\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\r\n\r\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\r\n\r\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\r\n\r\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\r\n\r\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\r\n\r\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\r\n\r\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\r\n\r\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\r\n\r\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\r\n\r\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\r\n\r\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\r\n\r\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\r\n\r\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\r\n\r\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\r\n\r\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\r\n\r\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\r\n\r\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\r\n\r\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\r\n\r\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.", "timestamp_created": 1709933279, "timestamp_updated": 1709933279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160132143": {"recommendationid": "160132143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173901303", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 119552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "playtime_at_review": 118753, "last_played": 1713155407}, "language": "english", "review": "gud geme", "timestamp_created": 1709931570, "timestamp_updated": 1709931570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160125747": {"recommendationid": "160125747", "author": {"steamid": "76561199572371661", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 408, "playtime_at_review": 7881, "last_played": 1712797675}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1709925998, "timestamp_updated": 1709925998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160120618": {"recommendationid": "160120618", "author": {"steamid": "76561199066490725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 47999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5349, "playtime_at_review": 34196, "last_played": 1713797352}, "language": "english", "review": "once i was an innocent boy i came across this game called rust first 100 hours ok first 200 hours ok first 300 fun first 400 hours more fun plus 500 hours life collapsed my parents hate me i became homeless and now living in my friends room under his stairs.. please never touch this game again it will make you go crazy you will never see life the same i have ruined my entire future with this game but other than that i atleast had a friend that left me after he insided  me  i got raided 536 times on all my servers.", "timestamp_created": 1709921240, "timestamp_updated": 1709921240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160106823": {"recommendationid": "160106823", "author": {"steamid": "76561199538974840", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 170, "playtime_at_review": 1269, "last_played": 1713564139}, "language": "english", "review": "Emotional roller coaster of a game!

Unlike most games, rust's combination of the two made the pvp so much more intense than almost any other game i had played. This was because I had so much to lose if i lost a battle. This weight of every scenario got me addicted but it was an experience that I soon became addicted to which pushed me to get better an better at the game so I would lose less.

I get daily messages from EAC (the anticheat of the game) that someone who i reported before was banned and removed from the game. I really regret buying the game overall. It is unplayable because of the cheaters. As i observed the cheaters that are reported before are banned after 3-4 days or a week later. BUT it still will not help that they already ruined my gameplay, my hours, my valuable time.

Having played for many hours, and met so many new friends who have given me tours of their farms, and even donated valuable equipment to help me get started on my farming experience! (M249 Harvest Machine, the L96 Tractor, AK Seeds, HQM Ploughing equipment) . My experience has been great in summary, and this has been one of the most relaxing games to play , even on the steam deck! Its a rewarding game in my opinion, that values your time and brings people together!\n\nThe Pro's:\n1.) Incredible Anti-Cheat: This is industry leading anti cheat software, ensuring you and your friends can all farm in peace!\n2.) Relaxing: You can sink countless hours into the game , building your farm knowing the community wont grief or try to ruin your play experience.\n3.) Value for Time: Unlike most games, your farm progress will save, so when you come home from work the following day everything will be as you've left it! \n4.) Community: Everyone is really kind on this game, and help each other out often! \n5.) The Graphics: 11/10, this is the engine Unreal 5 is based on, with industry leading volumetric clouds, server meshing and path tracing, the game stands out and looks the best in 490x234 @ 144hz, make sure to enable HDR 400 for that extra pop! \n\nThe cons: \n1.) Sometimes i log on and my farm has disappeared, i'm not sure why but it may be because i didnt pay for a planning permit (still figuring this out) \n2.) Sometimes other farmers accidentally blow up my walls and are wearing my clothes, im  not sure why, think its a glitch? \n3.) Sometimes my sleeping bags and beds get changed to rude words, i think its a glitch on the server i played? \n4.) Sometimes i seem to be taken to modded servers with guns and explosives etc... i think thats on me though i must be connecting to custom games or LAN games. \n5.) I'm running the game on an i5-2800 , 11GB RAM (i know its a lot) and an ATI Radeon 8800 (2gb vram i know its overkill but i do graphic design for the Ugandan FA as a side hustle). I still seem to lag though and sometimes only get 239 FPS which is weird because i installed another RGB fan in my PC last week... any help with this? is it because i keep it one colour? \n\nThe Conclusion:\n\nIn summary rust is one of the best farming simulators out there! if you want relaxation, some puzzles and to make new friends along the way! (or farm solo) then this game is for you! \n", "timestamp_created": 1710531058, "timestamp_updated": 1710531058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160367667": {"recommendationid": "160367667", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992232562", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 26540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26540, "last_played": 1698203622}, "language": "english", "review": "400+ hours played and I can honestly say this game is hot garbage now.. cheating is insane, same people cheating for years with nothing done about it.

In game, I frequently hear people telling others how the sincerely hope someone's mother would die and all manner of horrible things.  Go to the official discord and try a voice channel.  People spending HOURS in a full on shouting match, just screaming racist/sexist garbage at each other.\n\nI finally managed to get all my achievements done thanks to the few nice people I met, but it was a miserable ordeal to get it all done.\n\nBasically, you need to ask yourself three questions before buying this game:\n\n1). Are you a no-lifer.\n2). Do you think killing offline players makes you great at pvp?\n3).

However, behind the veneer of excitement lies a game fraught with fundamental flaws and a staggering emphasis on grind over genuine enjoyment.\n\nGameplay Basics: ( 4.2/ 10 )\nRust's gameplay, at its core, is a chaotic mess. From the moment you spawn in a hostile environment, you're thrust into a relentless cycle of resource gathering, base building, and constant threat from other players. While the premise sounds engaging, the execution leaves much to be desired. Clunky mechanics, unintuitive UI, and inconsistent hit detection plague every interaction, turning what should be tense encounters into frustrating exercises in futility.\n\nAmidst the fervor surrounding Rust lies an overhyped promise of emergent gameplay and dynamic player interactions. In reality, the game's community is rife with toxicity, griefing, and rampant cheating. Instead of fostering meaningful collaboration or strategic alliances, Rust often devolves into a cesspool of hostility and exploitation, further exacerbating its already glaring issues.\n\nTime Consumption: ( 2.4 / 10 )\nPrepare to sacrifice vast amounts of time to Rust's insatiable grind. Progression feels less like a rewarding journey and more like an endless treadmill, with each step forward accompanied by hours of mind-numbing resource farming and base maintenance. The game demands an exorbitant investment of time, making it inaccessible to those with limited availability or a desire for balanced gameplay experiences.\n\nVisuals and Optimization: (5.6 / 10 )\nWhile Rust's visuals aren't groundbreaking, they effectively convey the desolate, post-apocalyptic setting. However, the game's optimization leaves much to be desired. Even on high-end hardware, frequent frame drops, stuttering, and server lag detract from what could otherwise be an immersive experience.\n\nCommunity:( 5.0 / 10 )\nRust's community is a mixed bag, ranging from helpful veterans to malicious trolls. While there are pockets of camaraderie and cooperation, they're overshadowed by the prevalence of toxic behavior and griefing. Newcomers beware: navigating Rust's treacherous social landscape can be just as daunting as surviving its harsh environment.\n\nConclusion: ( 4.1 / 10 )\nIn conclusion, Rust is a game that squanders its potential with a heavy-handed focus on time-consuming grind, lackluster gameplay basics, and an overhyped sense of emergent gameplay. While there are glimpses of brilliance scattered throughout, they're overshadowed by the game's fundamental flaws and toxic community. Unless you have an abundance of time to spare and a high tolerance for frustration, Rust may not be the survival experience you're looking for.", "timestamp_created": 1711374120, "timestamp_updated":

say that this game is like a box of chocolates\u2014full of surprises, some good, some not-so-good, and a few that make you question your life choices.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the players. One brave soul claimed to have lost a wife, six children, and a social life to Rust. But hey, at least they've got two boxes of AKs and a zerg anal-rape party going on. Now that's what I call life priorities.\n\nThen there's the guy who blames Rust for taking away two crucial high school years and leaving them \"terminally retarded.\" I'm not sure if Rust is to blame for that, but if it is, it's got some serious explaining to do. I didn't know a game could affect your cognitive abilities that much.\n\nLet's not forget the one who listed every possible ailment known to humankind as a result of playing Rust. I mean, who needs a doctor when you can just blame your health issues on a video game? Forget WebMD; just check your Steam library.\n\nIn the midst of all this chaos, we have a beacon of hope\u2014a reviewer who decided to share a delightful cinnamon roll recipe in the middle of Rust reviews. Because nothing says survival in a harsh world like a warm, gooey cinnamon roll. Take note, fellow survivors: when in doubt, bake it out.\n\nOf course, there's the one person asking for the return of Rust Legacy, reminiscing about the good ol' 2014 days. Nostalgia hits hard, especially when you're getting chased by a bear and remember the simpler times.\n\nAnd how can we overlook the poetic genius who described their Rust experience in rhymes? \"I've got a revy, have no fear! Just caught the base manager with his rock in his hand.\" Move over, Shakespeare; Rust poetry is the new literary masterpiece.\n\nIn the end, Rust is like that rollercoaster you can't resist riding, even though you know it might make you lose your lunch.

Listen. I've reviewed this game once before but as I'm sitting in my FUCKING 8 FUCKING AM mother FUCKING college COM101 class I've decided to write another one. This is a non-biased tired college kids review.\n\n1. DO NOT play this game for the 8 hours before your 8 AM classes. ( If you have no 8 AM Fuck U )\n2. If you do play Rust for 8 hours before your 8 AM make sure you don't drink while doing it.\n3. If you play for 8 hours and drink FUCKING skip your 8 AM because you know for damn sure that's the day that your gonna be the only FUCKING person to show up to class and your professor will try and make small talk with you.\n4. If you've got time to play Rust in college for 8 hours a day you must be failing all your damn classes or be an education major.\n5. Just Stop.\n6. If your are currently procrastinating all of your damn work and playing rust you might as well just do your damn work because it will be less mind numbing and overall depressing because you know your gonna get shit on so why are you doing it.\n7. If you ever choose to write a review of Rust or any other steam game during a college course you are not paying attention and are wasting your money and for damn certain if you play rust your not on scholarship so your wasting your own money.\n8. This game is the best and your should play it 24/7.\n9. If you have over 100 hours in this game do NOT tell people because they will question your sanity.\n10. This review was definitely written by a person and not ChatGPT unlike all my assignments.\n\nThank you for reading my review \n- Yours Truly Fucking Tired Ass College Student", "timestamp_created":

not just a game; it's an immersive journey into the heart of survival and human interaction. Developed by Facepunch Studios, Rust drops players into a harsh, unforgiving world where every decision matters, and every encounter could mean life or death.\n\nAt its core, Rust is a sandbox survival game where players must scavenge for resources, craft tools and weapons, build shelters, and fend off threats, including both the environment and other players. What sets Rust apart from other survival games is its relentless focus on player interaction and emergent gameplay.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of Rust is its realistic depiction of survival mechanics. From hunger and thirst to exposure to the elements, players must constantly monitor their needs and adapt to their surroundings. The world of Rust is as beautiful as it is dangerous, with stunning landscapes and dynamic weather effects that add to the immersive experience.\n\nHowever, what truly sets Rust apart is its player-driven gameplay. Unlike many other survival games, Rust features a persistent online world where thousands of players inhabit the same server. This creates a dynamic and unpredictable environment where alliances are forged, betrayals occur, and every encounter is a potential conflict or collaboration.\n\nThe PvP (Player versus Player) aspect of Rust is where the game truly shines. Whether engaging in tense firefights over limited resources or forming alliances to take down larger threats, the human element adds a layer of depth and excitement that few games can match. The thrill of outsmarting an opponent or overcoming overwhelming odds with teamwork is what keeps players coming back for more.\n\nIn addition to its PvP elements, Rust also offers a variety of PvE (Player versus Environment) challenges, including hostile wildlife and environmental hazards. These threats keep players on their toes and add an extra layer of tension to the already intense gameplay.\n\nVisually, Rust is stunning, with detailed environments and realistic character models. The game's sound design further enhances the immersion, with ambient noises and realistic weapon sounds adding to the sense of realism.\n\nWhile Rust is undeniably a challenging game, it also rewards creativity and ingenuity. The game's extensive crafting system allows players to create a wide variety of items, from simple tools to advanced weaponry and fortifications. Building and defending a base against other players is a satisfying experience that encourages strategic thinking and teamwork.\n\nIn conclusion, Rust is a masterpiece of sandbox survival gaming. Its realistic mechanics, dynamic player-driven gameplay, and stunning visuals come together to create an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a lone wolf looking to survive against the odds or a social butterfly forging alliances with other players, Rust offers something for everyone. Just be prepared to face the harsh realities of survival in one of the most unforgiving worlds in gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1712327353, "timestamp_updated": 1712327353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502407073974609375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162672164": {"recommendationid": "162672164", "author": {"steamid": "76561199125966877", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 189, "playtime_at_review": 147, "last_played": 1713316143}, "language": "english", "review": "literal brain rot", "timestamp_created": 1712854321, "timestamp_updated": 1712854321, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502257764339447021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163186008": {"recommendationid": "163186008", "author": {"steamid": "76561199085263656", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 63886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6075, "playtime_at_review": 62317, "last_played": 1713794045}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0438", "timestamp_created": 1713554290, "timestamp_updated": 1713554290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502212405204772949", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160214468": {"recommendationid": "160214468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356508058", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4736, "last_played": 1704643686}, "language": "english", "review": "neighbour starting firing rockets at my base and then proceeded to recreate september 11th 2001 \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1710020397, "timestamp_updated": 1710020397, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502202630043029785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159916095": {"recommendationid": "159916095", "author": {"steamid": "76561199263358834", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 153687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1298, "playtime_at_review": 148829, "last_played": 1713798260}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE RUST only when the minguns are in the game then im crazy on rust", "timestamp_created": 1709658828, "timestamp_updated": 1712236066, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159141713": {"recommendationid": "159141713", "author": {"steamid": "76561199484338526", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 97897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5377, "playtime_at_review": 77777, "last_played": 1713685320}, "language": "english", "review": "Its great fun when you shit on others and make them cry", "timestamp_created": 1708775638, "timestamp_updated": 1708775638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158235821": {"recommendationid": "158235821", "author": {"steamid": "76561199615424113", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5598, "last_played": 1711936830}, "language": "english", "review": "do not play this game it makes u very depressed and sad", "timestamp_created": 1707837785, "timestamp_updated": 1707837785, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50205761194229126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161848218": {"recommendationid": "161848218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017438051", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1711849485}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is okay, but it isn't good.

If you got a large group then you can probably get a head, but the amount of people killing people as they spawn in is ridiculous. Like if that's what you have to do to feel better about yourself then sure. This is why no one wants to support this stupid game and why it's community is dying. It's full of jerks that have no class and just love bullying people online.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent survival game this isn't it. You jump into the game and start breaking a rock to get some starting materials, and some jerk on a horse runs up and fires explosive arrows at you. \n\nIt's losers that play this game that will get nowhere in life, because they are jerks to everyone.

Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.\n\nAte some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.\n\nI slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.\n\nThen I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.\n\nIts now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.\n\nIn a tiny hut on a mountain with my sleeping bag and meager belongings after 12 hours of playing straight, I can probably safely say I'm enjoying this game.", "timestamp_created": 1389927461, "timestamp_updated": 1389927461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2028, "votes_funny": 501, "weighted_vote_score": "0.972937822341918945", "comment_count": 76, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105334757": {"recommendationid": "105334757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145926405", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 168764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2106, "playtime_at_review": 81888, "last_played": 1713559642}, "language": "english", "review": "Rust is a game. \nIf you like...\n-Sleeping\n-Feeling happiness\n-Being intimate with women\n-Maintaining a relationship with your family\n-Breathing fresh air\n-Having friends\nIt is not your game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1638764031, "timestamp_updated": 1638764031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1026, "votes_funny": 621, "weighted_vote_score": "0.96440500020980835", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114961442": {"recommendationid": "114961442", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971625326", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 32323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14335, "last_played": 1702787832}, "language": "english", "review": "Once upon a time in Rust, in less cringy format, recollected to the best of my memory.\n\nTogether with the help of a random friend, I made a small, simple base and proceeded to work on gathering resources for I'd say about 20 hours, upgrading said base along the way as it was my intent to turn it into a farm.\n\nI was getting harrassed by a small group of people every now and then but they didn't seem really interested in raiding, just camping or taking whatever kits they could get from our exchanges.\n\nAfter a small conversation in outpost, I realized something very important about landmines, something that seemed very unused at the time.\n\nOut of spite from the exchanges that got nowhere, I decided to put all my efforts into crafting possibly over a hundred landmines, surrounding the area around the base with them. There were many bushes and grass around the area, making it easy to hide those mines.\n\nAfter that, I started armoring the base, changing specific stone walls to metal walls, and more important (and some fake) walls with high qual.\n\nA couple of hours later when working on furnaces I started hearing the sound of certain landmines popping, often chain detonating as one detonated the other. A couple more exchanges later and some kits I took and another group of people got entangled into the mess, a larger clan, which also ended up getting killed by the landmines, several times. The explosions and constant fights however, seemingly attracted more and more people, nakeds, smaller groups, duos and people trying to cash in by getting kills and kits from others.\n\nI had upgraded what I could, with whatever resources I had left. Occasionally using what kits I could salvage to do a little bit more shooting, but most of the time as a solo you're not getting anywhere when there's such a large amount of players expecting you. Wipe was almost at hand, so I didn't really mind.\n\nThe honeycombed walls didn't last long, and it certainly wasn't longer until they got through to where they wanted. But even then, people still kept dying to more landmines. I had honestly lost count of how many I had placed around, of how many resources were used. But boy did I have a smile on my face, knowing that as soon as they got into the TC, there was really nothing I had in terms of resources other than a couple stacks of high qual and metal scrap. And I'm more than sure that the amount of gear lost to the landmines, as they [b]destroy items[/b] in one's inventory if they die to one, was not worth what was found there.\n\nTL;DR I used every single resource gathered over a wipe to make a large amount of people most likely lose an enormous quantity of their work and resources for almost nothing.\n\n11/10 would do it again.\n\nThank you,

I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.", "timestamp_created": 1387882899, "timestamp_updated": 1387882899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11389, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.943779230117797852", "comment_count": 207, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101813705": {"recommendationid": "101813705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198833803960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 182, "playtime_forever": 36033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21303, "last_played": 1696697923}, "language": "english", "review": "9.5/10\nSpawned, got shot.\nBuilt a base, saw it explode, got shot.\nbought a rock skin, got shot.\ngot free weapons from a ''friendly'' player, got shot when i turned around.\n", "timestamp_created": 1635513950, "timestamp_updated": 1635513950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 417, "votes_funny": 263, "weighted_vote_score": "0.943643569946289063", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90107359": {"recommendationid": "90107359", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014693335", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 207495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151957, "last_played": 1662842722}, "language": "english", "review": "This game ruined my life I don't know why I ever got into it I wish i never did it ruined my grades it ruined my sleep schedule it ruined me as a person and I want to kill myself now. 10/10 game will keep playing\n\nEdit: I plan on getting addicted to Rust again, I will be playing for weeks until I run out of food in my fridge and I die of playing Rust.\n\nEdit 2: Snow has died from a blood clot in his leg like he's some sort of Korean kid.

This game has made me and my whole friend group spend countless hours to mauled in the very end to the point of blind rage. I have pooped blood because of the  sheer speed of the stool coming out of my buttcheeks because I am so infuriated. The graphics are great if you want your PC to explode in your face causing third degree burns. The animations are also nice if you are into games that makes your character look like they have lost control of basic motor skills. You cant even change your characters appearance so I look as disappointing in game (maybe more) as I do in real life. That being said if you want to attempt to feel unforeseeable rage I highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1686522876, "timestamp_updated": 1687022301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 358, "votes_funny": 224, "weighted_vote_score": "0.942314088344573975", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106213824": {"recommendationid": "106213824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408600710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 157912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122882, "last_played": 1712307566}, "language": "english", "review": "Woke up on the beach\nWandered\nMet some guys dressed up in dishcloth holding ak47's\nThey yelled at me \"Hey naked!\"\nI went closer\n\"Come with us, you are now our prisoner\"\nThey take me to a base with an isis flag.\nI enter the base.\nThey shoot my feet making me dance, and ask me to sing.\nI didnt sing.\nI was called useless\nThey threw me into their thunder dome.\nI was forced to fight another naked with my rock!\nI killed the naked.\nEveryone screamed ALLAHU AKHBAR\nthey took me outside and gave me a pumpkin.\nThey fell asleep by the pool so I tried to make a run for it\nI zig zagged while being shot by ak47's from their roof.\nI escaped.\n\nI went home, bought rust and the same thing happened on here.", "timestamp_created": 1640060286, "timestamp_updated": 1640060286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 997, "votes_funny": 1407, "weighted_vote_score": "0.941809177398681641", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94604520": {"recommendationid": "94604520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879939817", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 329191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223714, "last_played": 1703203577}, "language": "english", "review": "Before i played Rust, i had a small wee-wee, no friends, no girlfriend, depression,and absolutely no life.

I was naked.\n\nI ran around, looking for a fellow survivor. After an hour, I saw him. I yelled at him as loud as I could, and he turned around. \n\nWe greeted each other, and agreed to work together.\n\nAfter a few days, we'd built a house, and had enough supplies to last a week. We had weapons, food and water. Life was good.\n\nOne day, on our daily raid, we spotted someone. He was naked, and ran towards us. He greeted us, we greeted him back, and he and I started a conversation. Suddenly, my friend pulls me back and whispers to me. He said we should kill him. Survival of the fittest.\n\nI looked back at the innocent man and gave him my pickaxe and told him to leave. My friend sighed, and gave him some clothes. He thanked us, and left. \n\nThe next day, he appears again, to say thanks, and that he has a gang as well, so that we could join him. We kindly refused. He sounded a bit agitated, but he said no problem, and left.\n\nLater that night, I hear footsteps outside our house. My friend was fast asleep, so I grabbed my homemade shotgun and looked outside.\n\nIt was the man. The man who we gave a pickaxe to. He was inspecting our house with someone else, but quickly left after he saw a bear running towards him.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up my friend and told him what happened. He told me I shouldn't have trusted him, and that war is coming.\n\nI was raiding an old town, when suddenly on top of a hill in the distance, I saw him. Although this time, he had his gang. There were a lot of them. About 10-20. My friend noticed this as well, and told me to get inside. We got inside, and it was quiet for about an hour. My friend and I go outside, and see them waiting.\n\nThey said that they were friendly, but we didn't trust them. My friend and I got out our shotguns and told them to leave. They didn't listen. \n\nThen the war began.\n\nThey got out guns and shot at us, firing at all directions. My friend got hit, and yelled at me to get inside and lock the door. My friend barely got inside, but when he did, it was already to late- they were inside.\n\nLuckily, we had a panic room for this kind of situation. It had an iron door, which could only be broken down by C4. We rushed down there as the scavengers began to search our house.\n\nAfter a few minutes, they'd discovered we were in the panic room, so they began swinging at it with the pickaxe I gave them. It didn't work. When suddenly, I heard a boom. They had C4.\n\nMy friend and I discussed what we should do. We agreed that when we get taken hostage, we run like hell.\n\nThey eventually got in, took all of our gear, and we were naked again. They were about to execute us when suddenly, my friend got up and began to run. He ran as fast as the wind would take him. They missed every shot they took at him, so I decided I had nothing to lose, so I ran as well. \n\nIt was pitch black outside. I felt around and felt a bush, so I hid in there. In the distance, I could see torches everywhere. My friend saved my life, but the enemy was searching for him. There was nothing I could do, so I ran off, and began my new life.\n\nTo this day, I don't know what my friend is doing. Dead or alive, he's a hero. The enemy army got raided by an even stronger group, and me?\n\nI'm surviving.\n\nStories like this make Rust such a good game. It truly is an experience. I highly recommend this game.

[/h1]\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]General game information [/b][/h1]\n\nThis game is a great example of a survival sandbox game. You can literaly do whatever the hell you wanna do. Do you wanna roleplay? Go for it. Do you wanna build stuff and let your creative mind blow of some steam? Go for it. Do you wanna murder another player in cold blood with your trusted rock? Go for it.\n\nObviously there are populair ways (PVP) to play the game but when you spawn in this game.. naked and along on a beach.. armed with a rock and torch.. with nothing holding you back.. you will realise why you woke up on the beach in the first place.\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]My experience [/b][/h1]\n\nAt the time of writing this review i've been playing this game for years. It started out with a mate of mine buying the game. I was watching him through some streaming software and I thought it looked fun. So I bought it.\nAfter figuring out the basics of crafting and resource gathering the two of us started building a wonderful base. That base lasted for a full hour. Then we were severly punished for the flaws in our design by a more experienced player. This happened over and over and over and over again. At this point a lot of people lose interest in the game, I didn't.\nFor some reason I was determined to learn from my previously made mistakes and improve on them.\nThis resulted in over 1800 hours of gameplay. 1800 of GLORIOUS hours. But like I said earlier, this game isn't for the feint of heart.\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]State of the Game [/b][/h1]\n\nWhen you invest a little into this game physically and emotionally.. you will run into people referring to \"Legacy\" being the best state of the game, I disagree.\nThe current version of Rust is a combination of two previously tested systems of the game.\nThese are named: [b]The Blueprint system + The component system[/b].\nMost Rust players will tell you that the blueprint system was the best system this game has ever seen. Over the last few years them tried different systems which generally didn't get any love.\nA week ago (at the time of me posting this review) They revamped the system to the one I mentioned earlier.\n[b]The Blueprint system + The component system[/b] - Aka the best system Rust has ever seen + new features of older failed systems revamped.\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]The pros [/b][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]If you use a microphone, you will have the most fun and random interactions you have ever experienced.\n[*]There's a lot of ways to express your creativity. Basebuilding, gearsets, drawing penisses on other peoples bases.\n[*]There is no real endgame, so you can set your own goals. Trust me when I say that those can be very rewarding.\n[*]Its a great game for Youtube content (has profanity filter, auto censoring nudes ect.)\n[*]Its a great game for Twitch content (has a streamer mode to hide from streamsnipers, has profanity filter, auto censoring nudes ect.)\n[*]As a big community that really loves the game, but for the most part is filled with toxic players. (Like any other game these days)\n[*]The game is constantly being developed. Weekly changes+additions with every patch.\n[*]The game also has a great Dev team, they are hardworking and very dedicated\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b]The cons [/b][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It has a big learning curve. The first thing you need to do is join a empty server and start figuring stuff out cause on a populated server you will get punished for it.\n[*]A lot of people KoS in the current state of the game, which is fine for me cause im used to it. But if you are new it can be very offputting.\n[*]The game has a very annoying memoryleak that will cause problems no matter how much GB you got in that godlike computer of yours. (they are working on it)\n[*]Deciding on the correct server for you to join will directly affect how much fun the game is for you as a soloplayer.\n[*]The official servers are terrible. There is hardly ever a admin in there to counteract a possible cheater. My advice: Stick to the community servers.\n[*]The game uses a day/night cycle. During the night it truly is pitchblack and you wont be able to see a thing. Unless you have Nvidia, then you can just fire up the gamma and you'll be fine. Especially vs people that have a AMD graphics card. Its a annoying problem in the game thats currently being looked into.\n[/list]\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]The future isn't set in stone. [/b][/h1]\n\nWell, sorta. If you take a look at the facepunch website you will be able to see a roadmap. On this roadmap you will be able to find features and fixes they lined up for the game. Some will be added shortly and some will probably never see the light of day. Keep in mind the game is currently still early access and might change drasticly in a year. I've seen the game go through 3-4 different systems now. And all of them had fun aspects and negative ones.\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion [/b][/h1]\n\nIf you are still interested after reading all this, definately buy the game. Over the years of me playing Rust, I've had the most interesting interactions and the most fun experiences ive ever had in a game.\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]Side note [/b][/h1]\n\nI'm working on a really big tutorial for this game. So if you are interested in that.. please check out my profile and subscribe to my youtube page. If not, I hope this review helped you a bit. Im not a professional reviewer or anything of the sorts.

Zergs are especially powerful after they implemented the group update where you can see your teammates blips which means you dont have to call for a jump check anymore.\n\n[b]NOT NOOB FRIENDLY[/b]: Very, very, very, few people you meet will be friendly. Normally, anyone you meet with any type of weapon will be hostile. You'll even see nakeds fight you with their rock when you spawn.\n\n[b]PLAY WITH FRIENDS[/b]: Can't emphasise this enough. Having atleast one other person to play with is all you need. There are a lot of responsibilities you have as a rust player and it will be twice as easy and twice as fast to do it with a duo partner.\n\n[b]YOU WILL DIE[/b]: You will die with all the loot in the world, many, many, times. Even more so if you try to play solo. I don't want to say solo is impossible, hJune shows us that, (and lots of other rust youtubers) but for new players its a no go.\n\n[b]TIME INVESTING[/b]: The people who play the most have the best results. As in a person who plays 10 hours a day, everyday, for the entire wipe, will get much further than someone who plays a couple hours a day. If you don't have lots of time on your hand to play, I wouldn't play at all.\n\n[b]TOXIC COMMUNITY[/b]: With any game, there is a fairly toxic community. Half the fights you win with a gun, your opponent usually makes fun of you for how many shots you missed and how much gunpowder you wasted, but I find this funny.\n\n[b]HACKERS[/b]: Mostly on offical servers, so i suggest for you to play on community servers such as solo/duo/trio. Only problem is community servers die quicker than official servers.\n\n[b]EXPERIENCE[/b]: Once you learn the ropes, it becomes a really fun game with intense moments and great fights.", "timestamp_created": 1533597258, "timestamp_updated": 1533597258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 208, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.918989419937133789", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50962369": {"recommendationid": "50962369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009618090", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 114511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79543, "last_played": 1696012445}, "language": "english", "review": ">Starts Rust\n>Makes a base\n>Get Raided\n>Makes a new base in snow\n>Get raided 3 times in one day\n>Makes two new bases in desert\n>Both get raided\n>Finally have a place to live without getting raided\n>Finds the enemy\n>Suggests joint raid with a clan\n>Farming sulfur like a machine for rockets\n>1 box of rockets made later\n>Does the raid\n>Build the raid tower\n>Bring the rockets\n>Get backstabbed and loses 1 box of rockets.\n>Farm for another box\n>Raid them 1 week later\n>They hate us\n\n\n10/10\n\nMonths later...\n\nFacepunch > Introduce updates that destroy's the game.\nMe > Well I'm out.\n(Info in comments.)", "timestamp_created": 1559248221, "timestamp_updated": 1567420601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 669, "votes_funny": 939, "weighted_vote_score": "0.918735861778259277", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130216571": {"recommendationid": "130216571", "author": {"steamid": "76561199205032134", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1591, "last_played": 1696800265}, "language": "english", "review": ">>Get offline raided for the first time\n>>After I respawn meet a friendly while gathering wood\n>>Explain my situation\n>>Dudeigotofflineraidedforthefirsttime.mp4\n>>\"Oh no Akimbo, that is a terrible feeling isn't it?

Would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what you're getting yourself into.\n\nWell, first off, Rust is a game of \"Survival\". But their definition of survival is... well... different. To be bluntly honest, the nature of the game encourages and rewards you for being an absolute dickhead. For a game that plops you naked on a beach with nothing but a rock, there are alot of guns and powerful weapons players can get easily and very early on. The game appears to cater to clan and group wars, which I'll admit, makes for some excellent videos. But the fact of the matter is most people (myself included) don't want to play that way. This game becomes a HUGE investment of your time as typically, it will require hours to build a \"raid-proof\" home. And once your home is finished, you'll look out at the beautiful sunset and log off, confident your hard work has paid off, despite the fact that your home is only 30% actual home and the other 70% is pure armor. But when you log in less than 24 hours later, you find yourself waking up on noob beach. Because for every hour you spent building your home, some prick has spent double that left clicking the attack button with one hand while furiously fapping with the other to wreck your hard work. But if you can manage to build a good home on a good server, the game can be a very rewarding experience.\n\nRust for me had alot of disappointing, infuriating moments, which often keeps me from coming back to play. But it also had alot of great moments. The act of logging on alone was an anxiety, waiting at the loading screen wondering if I've been killed or if I was still safe. The intense feelings of paranoia from the presence of other players and of protecting my home. The adrenaline rushes of being shot at, and of going on intense raid missions. The excitement of assassinating a powerful kingpin (who deserved it) or gunning down a warring maruader. And finally, the feeling of looking out the window of my beautiful home at a beautiful view of the sunset or a full moon on the ocean. A game has never before invoked as much emotion out of me as Rust has.\n\nI would reccomend these tactics for staying alive:\n- Play \"Native American\" style. Plant your sleeping bag in a bush where no one will find it, and live a life of very little materialism. If you die or are robbed, you lost very little\n- Hide. Build your home where no one will find it. Consider sacrificing a fort for a smaller home. It will be easier to raid, but harder to find. Raiders will assume there is a bigger bounty inside a bigger fort, but might decide not to waste their time on a smaller home because they'll think you're poor. Stay far away from the West and East coasts (where new players generally spawn), away from the middle of the map, and away from the road and rad towns. Build next to clusters of big rocks, or terrain that would be unappealing for travel (for example, tundra), and never in the open. You will likely be found eventually, but I have had games where I was either never found or if I was, players just left me alone. And it will give you lots of time to estabilsh your hold. \n- Play the game RIGHT after servers wipe so that you're the first person to start on a brand new island\n- TRUST NO ONE. You may find players that will like to trade or who will actually help you. But always practice your politics very carefully. Most players will shoot you on sight\n- Get a feel for the population of the server. I usually go to servers that appear abandoned and play alone for quite some time. Sometimes it works, sometimes the server suddenly becomes popular. You can refresh the server lists to constantly know how many people are on a server at all times. On rare occasions, you can find servers where the strongest players are friendly's who will actively hunt the kind of people who seek to ruin your day. You can collaborate with these people\n- Understand raid tactics. You can lock your door, but can they blow a hole in your window? Come in from the roof or the foundation? Did you destroy the stairs so no one can get up to you? Did you build a third floor in case they blow up the first floor ceiling? Did you armor the hell out of your cupboard so they can't build their way around? There are lots of things to consider, and the game is constantly updating in ways that require new strategies.\n- Raid a few homes yourself. I'm generally a peaceful player, but if I see someone setting up camp too close to my territory, I treat it like a threat. Because let's face it, it generally is. The players will eventually find your home if they haven't already, and you can't trust them not to come after you. Again, you can check the servers for population and you can scope out targets to determine if the player is currently online. Exploit weaknesses, get in, loot, and get out as fast as you can. Know how long the travel will take and take advantage of things such as the cover of night. Stay out of the road and weave through trees, bushes, and etc. Make sure no one sees you, catches your name, and make damn sure you aren't followed. \n\nGood luck and happy hunting", "timestamp_created": 1449649231, "timestamp_updated": 1449649231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 465, "votes_funny": 109, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912742733955383301", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55701988": {"recommendationid": "55701988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090455852", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 58597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58597, "last_played": 1550771301}, "language": "english", "review": "This was easily one of the most fun games I had in my entire library!
