Don't get me wrong - there are people who like this kind of thing, who think it adds \"depth\" to a game, but to me, a lot of this stuff could be done faster - the game would still be long enough, just less tedious, which is surely a good thing.\n\nI also find myself wishing that the game were more procedural - that the world was different each time you played. It wouldn't have to be much more than just randomizing where the resources were - but as it stands, it seems to me that it has quite limited replayability.\n\nThose grizzles aside, though, it's a very pretty and amusing game, and remarkably reliable given that it's early-access. If you like building things and don't mind doing a bit of simple maths to work out optimizations, this game might be one of the best of its kind at the moment.\n\nRecommended.\n", "timestamp_created": 1707617240, "timestamp_updated": 1707617240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668181836605072021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162517326": {"recommendationid": "162517326", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036607683", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 248, "playtime_at_review": 2023, "last_played": 1713517288}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know what kind of cr@ck they put in this game but I can't stop playing.

I fired up *Satisfactory*, expecting a quaint factory-building escapade. But oh, how wrong I was! The loading screen winked at me like a mischievous quasar, whispering, \u201cPrepare to lose your sanity, Captain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf20 **The World of MASSAGE-2 (A-B)b: Where Nuts and Bolts Dream of Stardom**\r\n\r\nPicture this: *Akycha1*, a binary star system where the suns high-five each other every 10,000 years. And nestled in the gravitational armpit of *MASSAGE-2 (A-B)b*, there it was\u2014a planet-sized assembly line, belching smokestacks and humming with the cosmic rhythm of rivet guns.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd27 **The Factory: A Symphony of Screws and Regret**\r\n\r\nI built my base on a floating island, because why not? Gravity is for conformists. My factory sprawled like a caffeinated octopus, churning out widgets, gizmos, and existential dread. Conveyor belts snaked through the air, defying physics and common sense. I named them: Steve, Gerald, and Ingrid. They never judged.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f **Quantum Quandaries: When Nuts Multiply Like Rabbits**\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s where things got weird. I upgraded my smelters with quantum flux capacitors (patent pending). Suddenly, screws multiplied faster than conspiracy theories at a flat Earth convention. I blinked, and my inventory overflowed with nuts. Not metaphorical nuts\u2014actual hexagonal bolts. I considered renaming the planet Nutopia.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf2e **Alien Encounters: The Sentient Space Slugs**\r\n\r\nOne day, I met the Sluggernauts. These gelatinous philosophers roamed the plains, pondering the meaning of life, the universe, and whether they\u2019d look better in chartreuse or cerulean. They gifted me blueprints for interdimensional bacon sandwiches. I wept.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf0c **The Event Horizon: Beyond the Veil of Reality**\r\n\r\nAs I automated quantum coffee (because regular coffee is for quarks), I glimpsed the multiverse. My factory\u2019s humming turned into a cosmic choir. I saw parallel dimensions where my alter ego, Howard the Peculiar, wore socks on his antennae. Was I still playing a game, or had I become a subroutine in the cosmic mainframe?\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd2e **Conclusion: Lost in the Binary Ballet**\r\n\r\nSo here I am, dear readers, transmitting this review from the event horizon itself. I no longer see Akycha1; I see the universe beyond\u2014a kaleidoscope of cat memes, warp drives, and existential dread. My life? A footnote in the cosmic code.\r\n\r\n**Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50** (because sanity is overrated)\r\n\r\n*P.S. If you find my sanity, please return it to the nearest black hole.*\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udef8 **Captain Howard, signing off.

So with my nearly 1000 hours of game time in this game at the time of writing this review I hope that my 2 brain cells will help some new players as the game prepares to leave out of early access. \nThis game I will rate as a solid 9/10 stars overall. Why? oh just you wait. ill tell you all the things!\n\nDEV TEAM\nFirst of all. I usually don't have much of an opinion on DEV teams, I usually find them.... underwhelming and lacking in communication with the game community. But! This team has managed to stay informed with all the bugs and glitches in the game and also kept us in the community informed so well that I have never really had any issues paying for this game the one time. and it goes on sale from time to time too! \nIt is not often that I find such a refreshing team that is left to build an awesome game with no issues in understanding that we in the community have lives to live. on top of that just when I start to wonder when the next update will drop there is usually a post about it somewhere. There is not many games that I would buy more than one copy for but this is one of them.\n\n~They keep us well informed on various platforms like on, \"https://www.youtube.com/@CoffeeStainStudios\"\n~They worked hard on this game and still put it on sale unlike another factory game out there.\n~and while they don't have and wont be offering official modding support, they still love the modding community too!\n~They are mindful of players in the game and try their best to give the community what is asked and are honest when they wont or cant do something.\n\nGAME-PLAY\nFirst of all, if you are the kind of gamer that requires quest/object flags to tell you what to do constantly, you will really struggle with this game. \nThe game is a wonderful open world game with plenty of areas to bulldoze and build on-top of to your hearts content. BUT. to be clear, you can not change the terrain at all in the game. Some rocks, trees, and other objects are destructible but there is no large scale terraforming in Satisfactory.\nThe game while buggy at times or laggy/glitcy is understandable in the more recent months. If you watch some of their videos you will find out that they rather recently updated to a newer game engine to help give the players the best experience come 1.0 release. So with that in mind keep in mind that bugs and the like will happen here and there till the game leaves early access some time late this year (2024) or so if plans stay on track. \n\nPROGRESSION \n~The point of satisfactory is to have an open world experience without a game telling you how to do things or go about doing something. You get a few tips and tricks early on in game during the on-boarding tutorial of the game that will help teach you the important stuff of the game. However, it is entirely up to you on how you build your factory. there are many ways to build a production line. Starting off you may find yourself wondering around not sure where to place your base and factories, but you can deconstruct with no worry of needing more stuff to build those things again. Make it perfect or sloppy as hecc!\n~Satisfactory gives you the player control of how much effort you want to go. if you want to min/max EVERYTHING, You can!\nif you want to do the bare minimum, you can!\n~To be honest. This video is a great source of what I mean. Give it a listen or watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq_IklMd0Mc&t\n\nHonestly there is so much to be said about this game that is good about it. and while there are also many things that could be made better, I think what we have is a dang good start for a one of a kind 3D factory game like this. Sure there are others but none of them seem to have the amount of care as satisfactory. \nThis game will make you think, you may have to do some math. but I think this game at the very least helps keep me from losing one of my last two brain-cells. who knows. But I really think this game belongs in all education systems! it could be a powerful learning tool.\n\nIf anyone has any questions drop a comment below and I will respond to them when I am able. but I really think that Satisfactory offers a little of something for everyone. Give it a chance. give it like 10 hours.

The first time I saw someone play the game I thought it was\"meh\", but when I tried it out myself I was baffled how much time you pass in the game without noticing it. You think to yourself \"Oh I am gonna quickly build that production line\" and boom a couple of hours go by like 5 minutes.

Don't go into this expecting big end game rewards. I was hoping I would get to fly, swim, anything. Something marvelous. No you're reward for doing all that work and grinding is just more work and grinding. Is the core loop addictive and fun? Yes, but I can't help this hollow feeling in my chest that the only thing I can explore after all that work is just... More flat planes and jagged fucked up parts of the map. \n\nTip to the devs you need to work on your map MUCH more (reward exploration more and make it easier to build good looking structures) same thing with rewards for player progression. You've nailed your factory game play, but everything else is hollow and lacking. It's like if the only thing you could do in subnautica is build stuff and swim around. No sense of danger or real exploration at all. \n\nHey you don't have to put enemies in the game (the enemies in the game now are dog butt because they insta aggro and teleport 70 feet into the air to randomly demolish you while you're building) Use the environment to challenge us. For instance there's a massive river in a crater in the middle of the map. That gave me a real challenge to work around so I could get to the dense coal patches located in it. \n\nUse mountains, rivers, lakes, heck even resource limitations to challenge us as players.\n\nAnyway looking forward to where this game will go in the future especially if my advice is taken into consideration.", "timestamp_created": 1708976147, "timestamp_updated": 1708976147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159203300": {"recommendationid": "159203300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002569736", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1708827702}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game!", "timestamp_created": 1708826901, "timestamp_updated": 1708826901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159158639": {"recommendationid": "159158639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198876533077", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3672, "last_played": 1708957256}, "language": "english", "review": "This game so good that I procrastinate on booting it up to play every time, because when I start I can't stop playing", "timestamp_created": 1708788483, "timestamp_updated": 1708788483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159129984": {"recommendationid": "159129984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198991189558", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 4817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4790, "last_played": 1710192830}, "language": "english", "review": "tism goes off for this game.", "timestamp_created": 1708763816, "timestamp_updated": 1708763816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158948176": {"recommendationid": "158948176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046628674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 12064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "playtime_at_review": 669, "last_played": 1713582875}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing", "timestamp_created": 1708580043, "timestamp_updated": 1708580043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158877888": {"recommendationid": "158877888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031955673", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2382, "last_played": 1709423277}, "language": "english", "review": "I've said before that the best video games tend to be the ones that give the feeling of achievement when accomplishing tasks - this game takes that to the extreme. This brilliant and huge game will have you feeling more pride than you wish your parents had in you. Constant micro-successes in a progression-based game that constantly keep you in a state of \"moving forward\" and being engaged. \nSurvival/Combat: The survival/fighting starts of negligible while you're first starting out, but scales up as you go as you have to overcome some beasties to get what you need in the later game - but by then you can build very fun weapons to deal with it. The survival element as a whole is very welcome and adds more to the game, without being a particular focus.\nExploration: 10/10, the map is absolutely HUGE and all of it is so interesting to explore. No matter how big your inventory gets, you'll wish for more space so you can explore the whole world and scavenge everything on your way for the MAM!\nConstruction/Creativity: 11/10, your imagination is the limit! I've seen games dedicated to designing bases that have less options and flexibility as this game. You can make basically anything to fit whatever aesthetic you like. I've seen people make decorative cathedral-like structures, and others make industrial apocalypse style grinders.\nThe \"Factory\" grind element: 11/10, the problem solving, streamlining, and progression is just fantastic. There's so much more to this game than just \"the grind\" that you almost forget about it, and the grind itself is satisfying as heck.\nReplay-ability: 9/10. Most people can get MANY do-overs on this game to last them years. Starting in a different location alone changes the first like 30 hours of gameplay. I could see myself, solo, restarting a few times before even needing to set my own challenges for the game, and still enjoying it.\n\nNote RE Single VS Multiplayer: I started off this game on my own in the basic spawn area. I enjoyed it so much and sunk so many hours in whenever I could and I enjoyed it all SO much. However, I personally think there comes a few points in the mid-game where \"the grind\" is a bit much for one person, and I think it's apparent this game was intended to be best played with at least one other person.

Wish I would of bought it a LOT SOONER!\n\nWhat isn't there to like? I could make this review a LOT shorter if I only point out it's shortcomings as there isn't much to bash this game with. Is it hard? Yes and no but it will definitely get your old noodle thinking. So lets start off with the obvious.\n\nThe game is beautiful, extremely LARGE MAP and a LOT of details have been but into this game. Unfortunately this means you will have to have a decent rig to play this game in it's full beauty. The flexibility this game gives you to remold this world is staggering and the best point of this game? You can play it as YOU see fit but I won't say this game STAYS easy as the goals in the game keep getting raised in the most surprising way. PRODUCTIVITY! And the key to productivity? Figuring out HOW to fully auto-mate your factories where you DON'T need to be there 24/7 for them to keep working as you keep upgrading your tools to maximize production because halfway through the game? You are delivering products with multiple complex parts that need to be assembled in mass. You CAN assemble 90% in this game yourself BUT there will be a massive time penalty as that is what you will be stuck doing the majority of the time... for HOURS. This game will easily eat up DAYS of your time as you figure out what works, what doesn't and usually? Starting over when things become too much of a mess and you plan out your next restart. There's little tricks you eventually figure out as you play the game and here's my biggest hint, leave room for expansion. Those veins you mine for ore? Those drills will eventually be upgraded to double the output so? Plan for it, put a belt splitter you don't need NOW for later. Of course there's other people who can make factories so tight and efficient? Making me look like I'm still taking baby steps which? Doesn't matter as long as I'm enjoying the game.\n\nThe thing I like most about this game? There is never any pressure to play save the pressure you put on yourself and dying is actually hard to do as long as you don't get reckless but there ARE a few dangerous enemies that WILL chase you down once you run across them but run, run! RUN!! usually works if you don't stick around TRYING to kill them. Odd note? Once you get your vehicle, save for the hachers, ALL enemies actually ignore you in a vehicle and the hachers actually can't damage the vehicle which YOU don't take damage as long as your driving. Even those deadly enemies that chase you down. There is also specific tools that are extremely useful in building that the game never touches on. Too many to list but go on YouTube to find them yourself. This is a pretty deep game that isn't here just to kill you but if you push your luck? It doesn't have a problem killing stupid.\n\nSo this is a very fun game that WILL bog you down with massive orders and ironically, even opening up your tech tree is going to cost you a lot of processed materials. I was a little slow on the uptake but? Soon as you have a new piece to make? Automate it early, it's going to save you a lot of headaches later, even if the process isn't efficient because? Parts are being made just with the game running without you having to CRAFT them all yourself. Makes me glad this game lets you make signs to remind you what a certain group of machines do after you get into automating over a dozen things.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game as it definitely is a treat to play with a lot of freedom to play it as YOU want. Just might be just a tad too addictive for it's own good but that's just how good it actually is.", "timestamp_created": 1708276533, "timestamp_updated": 1708276533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158541937": {"recommendationid": "158541937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987782675", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 639, "last_played": 1708294295}, "language": "english", "review": "Just started after alot of deliberation with myself.

I've killed myself with toxic waste products and been killed by giant corrosive spider-like creatures that are a living nightmare. I've adopted adorable Doggo's and raised them as my sons and daughters to further my own materialistic gains. I've recorded routes for six-wheeled haulers to transport goods across the rough terrain. I have driven a dune buggy into canyon that had no bottom. It's still falling out of space and time I suppose. I've manufactured items, that bend space and time around themselves, by the thousands. And transported them into a giant grinder so i could buy a Boombox and some cassettes. I've stepped off of towering  monoliths of my own creation onto the backs of gentle Leviathans and flown with them like Sebastian did. I've spent mornings in swamps gathering mycelia. Afternoons in jungles buildings railways. Evenings in deserts building Factories on stilts over the dunes. And Nights on the ocean shores constructing ironworks to support immense power generating facilites to keep it all moving. \n\nBut my favourite parts were when the building seemed like enough for the day.

Dedicated Servers for Experimental Version Currently.\n[*] [b]Can I crossplay multiplayer with Epic versions of the game?[/b] Yes. And you can link your Steam and Epic friends lists together if you'd like.\n[*] [b]How does this game differ from Factorio?[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Both games have enemies and combat, but you don't need to defend your base in Satisfactory. Think of Satisfactory's challenge more like clearing out biters from strategic resource deposits.\n[*] Ore deposits in Satisfactory don't run out like they do in Factorio. The challenge is finding new Iron Deposits so you can make X Motors/minute.\n[*] Did I miss something? Oh right, the game has an entire extra THIRD DIMENSION. What more could you possibly want? But the third dimension greatly differentiates the logistics challenges between Factorio and Satisfactory.\n[/list]\n[*] [b]Are there player \"levels\"? Can I fall behind my multiplayer friends?[/b] No! When you join a multiplayer game you have access to the technologies unlocked as part of that save. If you join a different game, you'll have access to THAT game's technologies/progress.\n[*] [b]Is Early Access buggy?[/b] Bugs are few and far between in the Early Access branch, and the developers have been quick to fix any game-breaking or frustrating bugs as the result of a new update.\n[*] [b]Is there a story mode?[/b] Not yet, but the developers have hinted at story elements being added to the game in the future. There IS a tutorial that walks you through concepts in the game, and then progression and exploration is left up to you!\n[*] [b]Is there procedural map generation?[/b] No, but [i]that's a good thing[/i]. The continent is 30 square KILOMETERS and every inch was hand-crafted by humans. It takes 18 MINUTES to walk from one corner to the next. Only the most dedicated players will experience the entire planet in a single playthrough, or you could play the game 20 different times for 20 different challenges. And from the moment you land on the planet, you're given an open-world to explore: there are hidden caves, easter eggs (made by the same devs as Goat Simulator, so you know it's gonna be good), optional jumping puzzles, unique resources to collect, alien creatures both friendly and aggressive, and more.\n[*] [b]Are there mods for the game?[/b] Yes, there's an growing third-party modding community (I use mods every day to record YouTube tutorial videos). As I write this review, it's not clear if Satisfactory on Steam will use the Steam Workshop, or some other method.\n[*] [b]Are there resources to help me if I get stuck or need help?[/b] TONS! There's an official wiki run by the game's developers( https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com ) - careful, there are a lot of spoilers there, I run a YouTube channel with clear, no-BS tips and tricks to help improve your factories( https://www.youtube.com/maxthecatfish ), and there's an active streaming community on Twitch as well ( https://www.twitch.tv/maxthecatfish ).\n[*] [b]I Enjoyed X, is Satisfactory for me?[/b]\n[list]\n      [*] Minecraft w/ Factory Mods - ABSOLUTELY\n      [*] Factorio - Yes\n      [*] Oxygen Not Included - Probably\n      [*] Rimworld/Terraria - Maybe\n[/list]\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Long-form Review[/u][/b]\nSome background: I've played Factorio, Oxygen Not Included, Rimworld, Terraria, Minecraft, all extensively. I love think-y games like these and others, and Satisfactory provides so much more.\n\nSatisfactory fairly compared to Factorio - both are factory building games that reward players for designing well-tuned factories. Place a miner over some iron, smelt it into iron bars, craft those iron bars into iron rods, turn those rods into screws, combine those screws with some iron plates and you've crafted your first Widget. Now craft hundreds more and combine your widgets into a MEGA WIDGET. So on and so-forth. If that sounds boring to you - picking yourself up by your bootstraps and literally building up civilization from scratch - then you might want to stop reading here. That said, many of you have likely played Factorio, or adjacent games like Oxygen Not Included and are wondering if it's worth letting go of a few more of your [Insert Local Currency Here] for a similar game.\n\nBut what sets Satisfactory apart from Factorio is that it brilliantly combines the thoughtful puzzling of a factory builder, with the sheer joy and excitement of an open-world exploration game. In Satisfactory you might spend equal time tuning and designing your factory as you will exploring the continent hunting for unique resources, upgrade modules, and staring at awe at the planet's 20 hand-crafted biomes.\n\nThe game gives you the tools be creative with your designs, too! Want to build a factory that looks like a sprawling megacity? Do it! Want to create a regal Grand Central Station for base? Go for it! Want to litter the countryside with phallic effigies?...technically possible! But the beautiful thing is that you don't HAVE to do any of these! Or, you can do them all \u2013 whenever you want. The game as it stands is entirely open-ended and relatively stress-free, from the moment you gain control of your character you can do whatever you\u2019d like, go wherever you\u2019d like, and that freedom is\u2026exhilarating!\n\nIf you simply want a factory building experience without the explorative aspects of the game, you can have that. If you want a sandbox to build in then \u2013 in all honesty - Minecraft might be more your style -  but you can ALSO accomplish that in Satisfactory with the right mindset. The game provides both mental and dexterity challenges but you can bypass each of these in creative ways using the tools at your disposal in ways that feel authentic to the gameplay experience!\n\nBut the game does have a tendency to feel lonely. You\u2019re the sole human inhabitant of this far-off planet. And other than snuggling with your pack of \u201cLizard Doggos\u201d or the voice of A.D.A.  \u2013 the player\u2019s snarky AI assistant  - in your helmet, you\u2019re on your own.\n\nUnless\u2026you bring some friends! Satisfactory offers drop-in-drop-out peer-to-peer multiplayer across both Steam and Epic versions of the game and the developers have mentioned that Dedicated Servers will be added to the game sometime\u2026soon\u2122. Until then, up to four pioneers can build together, fight monsters together, plan factories together, rebuild factories together, yell at each other for rebuilding that part of the factory without consulting the others, delete a pivotal conveyor belt out of spite for being berated by your friends, then go off and form a NEW factory, with NEW and BETTER friends who know that conveyor belts should be build at 90 degree angles and how DARE you even CONSIDER using the default recipe for crafting screws when the steel screw recipe is obviously superior in both throughput and resource requ-\n\nOn second thought, maybe the single-player experience is best for you. I kid, of course \u2013 it\u2019s a nice change of pace to experience the full breadth of the game with your friends. And for the most part the multiplayer experience in Satisfactory is smooth. The game IS still in early access and there are a number of known bugs and issues, but all-in-all the game has been relatively bug-free and that\u2019s an accomplishment worth praising these days. The game's team is incredibly communicative , and the community has responded in-kind with community-driven resources like satisfactory-calculator.com and the ficsit.app unofficial modding community. \n\nIf you enjoy think-y challenges and building structures in a massive open-world, you'll enjoy Satisfactory. If you want an FPS-forward adventure game, look elsewhere. But if you'd like some factory building mixed in with planet exploration mixed in with a bit of combat, you should absolutely consider buying Satisfactory.", "timestamp_created": 1591644404, "timestamp_updated": 1637418233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1828, "votes_funny": 59, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946296095848083496", "comment_count": 80, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101039417": {"recommendationid": "101039417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003084271", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 48464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16773, "last_played": 1690081255}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is weirdly addictive.

What I got was a rich game with a very well designed alien world to explore, with subtle messages about environmentalism and the beauty of nature contrasting with the efficiency of machinery.  There are literally breathtaking vistas, vast beautiful cave networks, impossible alien landforms, and completely on point music and sound direction.  The slightly sinister feeling nature of your FICSIT overlords lends some deep nuance; what are you actually doing here? What role are you playing, and who are you serving?\n\nI'm not an optimizer. I enjoy efficiency, but I'm not one to overdesign to get there, so my bases end up having a naturalistic \"base camp\" feel, while my friends are building towering factories with rows and rows of machinery. I'm really glad to say, this game supports both playstyles fantastically. I see my friends having a blast designing and organizing monolithic black cubes full of layers and layers of machinery, whereas I love spreading out and nestling my machines in with the trees and cliffs.\n\nThe one thing I would dock this game for is that the ecosystem feels too player-focused. I want to see predators chasing prey and fighting other predators for territory. I want to see animals that consume resources, and possibly animals that caretake and develop their own resources as well. This might not be the game for that, and if you're also wanting to see an alien ecosystem spring to life, I highly recommend Subnautica. However, I can't deny the intentional design I feel in segments of this game. Collecting power slugs to me feels like collecting Missile Packs in Metroid. They are usually placed in areas that have a similar challenge feel to them, and are a wonderful reward for exploration.  I can't wait to find out what Somersloops and Mercer Spheres are for, because they provide such an intense incentive to explore that I think is missing from some games like this.\n\nThere are still bugs and glitches, particularly with enemy AI. It's very rudimentary and when you master kiting enemies, they don't provide that much of a challenge, even with the Xeno-zapper.  It's only when they congregate and team up against you that they feel like a challenge.  On the other hand, that complexity is used to great effect in the placement of hostile mobs today, so I can't knock the simplistic AI too much because it combines and scales difficulty fairly well, despite the somewhat limited toolkit for designing these encounters.\n\nAlso, placing the Space Elevator is a religious experience. I don't care how jaded you are, it's a masterstroke of technology that that sequence plays out so organically and dynamically. You really *feel* the scale of the structure, and it changes the skyline forever.\n\nI feel like there are still some quality of life hiccups around inventory management. As an FPS player, I often find myself hitting the number row to switch my in-hand equipment, only to remember too late that those hotkeys are for your building toolbelt.  I'd love a way to switch between modes, even if it just means holding shift while pressing a number gets the build mode quickbar, and just pressing the number equips a new item to your hand slot.  On the other hand, there are some very nice Quality of Life touches that I appreciate once I've gotten used to the quirks of this game.  Actually placing buildings is decently streamlined, and I appreciate the way building off of foundations allows for a very granular angling. Once you're started building a foundation to fit the area, the 90-degrees snap-to-grid functionality feels very useful.  The only complaint I have here is the sometimes janky feeling of trying to get conveyors to snap together. It can be very finicky about what counts as a valid angle, and the feedback isn't always clear about why a conveyor can't be constructed. \"Encroaching others' area\" ends up being a somewhat frustrating exercise of shimmying things around in minute ways just fiddling to get the lines all connected.\n\nHonestly, though, the game is beautiful enough to warrant the price tag. I don't just mean graphics specifications and technical aptitude. The design of the game's assets and their placement creates spellbinding beauty. The way biomes flow into each other feels extremely organic and immersive, and I've never seen transitions so smooth in any other game. It feels like it surpasses Breath of the Wild in this respect, and some of this may be because setting this on an alien world helps smooth over any strangeness in geology or botany that would subtly break immersion otherwise.

The main ones are:\n\n1. Well-scaled factory sim. The game lulls you in with the perfect amount of simplicity at the start to make every added bit of complexity make sense in the larger scale of the game. Often factory sims drop you in, teach you a couple of things, then let you get overwhelmed with the scale of the project in front of you. I felt this particularly with Dyson Sphere Project - the game tells you what the endgame is, then gets you started on a scale that seems so impossibly small you don't feel like you're making progress. It's not a bad game at all, but I think the drip-feeding of ever-increasing complexity, depth, and scale make Satisfactory a real winner in this regard.\n\n2. The first person perspective is a terrific choice. Often the top-down/isometric view factory sims seem too remote, too abstract. Being on the ground and walking around your factory makes it really rewarding to indulge in...\n\n3. your architectural dreams. The game is all about systems planning, throughput efficiency, and logistics, and you can indulge in all of that without ever dressing up your factories or making them look nice. But if you like designing a brutalist monolith as an homage to Arne Jacobsen then this is possible. The game has plenty of scope for aesthetic sculpting.\n\nDrawbacks: not many, but I do hope they will be implementing some story elements, and the game can feel a bit lonely and empty of purpose as a result of this I think. Purpose is provided by your own ambitions and by finessing your production lines to achieve the next level of complexity - this is fine, but it would be nice to have some flavour or unexpected reasons to adapt production from time to time.

It's a similar game focused on building and exploration. Yes, it already has enough content to play it for more than a hundred hours, even if only by doing a single playthorugh. Yes, it's already worth the price if you are into this kind of gameplay. If you want more details, read the rest of the review. [/h2]\n\nI should preface this by saying that I already have played multiple hours of Satisfactory (Around 200-300) on EGS. This is a review of somebody who has seen everything the game has to offer at the moment, but still wants to play more of it which is clearly indicated by the 25 hours of playtime I already put into the Steam version. God, this is turning into an addiction. Anyway, on with the review: \n\nFirst things first, stop calling this 3D Factorio. It's not that, and it simply leads to hundreds of people forming false expectations and complaining about the game not playing like Factorio. Really, you don't say? It's also important to understand that when deciding whether this is a game for you. If you're simply deciding based on you liking Factorio then be careful, this game play way different and has a different focus. So, consider yourself warned.\n\nOkay, so what is Satisfactory? It's an open world factory building/exploration game. There is currently no precise end goal (more on that later), but the overarching objective is to automate gathering of resources and materials production by setting up networks of construction building that will allow you to produce materials you will need to unlock more buildings and ever more complicated materials to craft, which will lead to bigger and more complex building networks, and so on. Eventually you will be forced to expand your factory to really big sizes and transport resources from long distances away to keep up with the demand. It's the same basic formula as games like Factorio, but here it plays out a little bit different. I will focus on these since those are at the same time some of the game's biggest strengths, and the things that may put off those people who expected an experience more akin to Factorio, since so many people are overly fond of describing this game as \"3D Factorio\"...\n\nFirst major difference is the map. There is a single map and no random map generation. Sucks right? Not really. The map is really, big. And I mean REALLY big. Big enough that you will not even explore a third of it on a normal playthrough, and you will expand to even less places. Also, it's a hand crafted, 3D map, which means it's infinitely times more interesting to explore and work with than any randomized map you could ever hope for. It;s also a 3D map, so there is elevation and multiple layers to work with, cave systems, huge mountains, all of this means there is an insane amount of space to explore and work with. And you are given 4 starting locations to work with, which easily translates to at least 4 unique playthroughs thanks to the sheer size and amount of things the map has to offer. This is in my opinion a huge improvement over randomly generated maps, that never really feel unique from one another after a single playthrough. The technology is not there yet.\n\nSecond major difference would be the focus on exploration. Unless you find yourself one of the popular \"best\" starting spots, you will have to very quickly start exploring and looking for more resources. Most places you will find will not give you enough nodes to supply enough throughput to run even an early game factory (unless you go really small), so you will have to look for more even early on. There are some biomes and spots that bend that rule to various degrees, but most novice players won't know about them, and I encourage to avoid them if it's your first playthrough. Aside from resources there are other very useful things to look for: there are collectibles such as various plants that heal you, power slugs that can be researched and turned into items that allow to overclock your production buildings (necessary if you want to go for maximum efficiency), wrecks that have a lot of free resources spread around them (sometimes really valuable and high tier ones) that also contain hard drives, which are essential items that let you unlock alternative recipes for materials for even more efficiency and possibilities. There are also roaming monsters that you can kill for their drops that can be later researched and used to make some unique items, and rare resources that are normally used to craft things later in the game, but if you find some of them earlier you can use them to make some really useful and powerful upgrades that will massively help you in both building your factory and exploration. So yes, exploration is a REALLY important aspect of the game, if you really dedicate yourself to it you could spend almost as much time on it as on building your factory. And thanks to the map being so big and hand crafted there is definitely a lot to explore.\n\nThird major difference is how it plays. It's a very relaxing game, the only stress you'll experience is going to be moment to moment combat with roaming monsters, and getting stressed by trying to figure out why your factory is not working as it should and where is that one conveyor belt you forgot to connect. There is no immediate danger to your factory, there is no base defence from the enemies, there are no survival elements like food or water. It's a game purely focused on building and exploration, sprinkled with some combat when exploring or expanding into remote locations. Once kill all the monsters in the area, it's yours to explore and exploit, and if you build powered infrastructure then the monsters will stop respawning in the vicinity. And if you read this and think that it means it has less going on for it than the other games that have some kind of base defence elements, then you're wrong. As I already said, exploration is a major part of the game, something I haven't seen been done this well and to such extent in any games from this \"factory builder\" genre. Building your bases is also a much bigger and more involving task here. The third dimension is not simply just a gimmick. It's a major factor to consider when setting up your bases. Elevation plays a huge role and can be a real challenge to overcome. Sure, you can build everything on the ground like you would in a 2D game, but even then the ground is not flat. There are hills, valleys, natural obstacles, big rocks that you can't really get rid off, cliffs, water... the game really wants to make it as difficulty to build big bases on the ground. As you would expect from a random planet you were just dropped of on, it's not very well prepared for mass Industrialisation. That's why building vertically is such a big element of this game and the game gives you plenty of tools to accomplish this. Moreover, the game gives you a lot of things to spice up the building process and accomplish things that are simply not possible in a 2D game. Do you want to run multiple conveyor belts on top of one another? There are tools for that. Do you want to close off your factory with walls and roofs so you don't have to look at the horrible spaghetti you have made? No problem. Maybe you should now mounts those conveyor belts on the walls you just made? Or maybe through them? The game has a lot of tools to make the building process interesting and not feel like you're bound to the game's rules. There are always multiple ways to accomplish the same goal.\n\nI could go on for a couple more paragraphs, but I ran out of characters.

The graphics are very nice and you can see that the map is created with a lot of love and attention in detail.\nThe Gameplay is awesome. You have got a mixture of exploring (combined with a very minimal amount of survival), factory building, planning and optimizing (especially for people with the same OCD as I have). \n\nDue to the excellent Tutorial, you get a nice start into the game and instantly start to optimize, research and explore.\nNew buildings and technologies can be researched due to payments via produced parts. The small steps within the Tiers aren't that hard to achieve but the bigger Tier Steps (3 - Space Elevator Steps) are more difficult to achieve and are demanding a not so small factory.  \n\nAs you can see in the trailers you can build your factory with your own style. Personally, I'm more the OCD guy, but you can create your own conveyor belt spaghetti if you want. Nobody is forcing you to build in a certain way. All that creating, building, planning and optimizing can be done in your own pace. No hurries due to non-existent economical influence factors, targets or deadlines.\n\nIt is a game where you can relax, confront problems and solve them with your own creativity and intelligent management.\n\nHope you will enjoy this game, I know I do! \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1607000106, "timestamp_updated": 1607000106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 219, "votes_funny": 5,

Factory building? That just sounds boring. After we watched the Youtube channel Let's Game It Out and laughing ourselves sick, and finding this has multiplayer, my husband and I decided to give it a shot, and at least it would kill a few hours.\n\nThis game is honestly one of the better, if not best early access games I've played. Yes, the multiplayer is buggy (don't bother with transportation, network issues cause people to not be where they look like, etc) but it's a very solid base, a lot of it does work and works very smoothly. There's so many early access games that have a ton of ideas and stretch themselves so thin, and you wonder when they're going to add any depth to it... and they don't, and you end up with a 2 mile long puddle. It has everything it said, but it's still a puddle. Satisfactory has a surprising amount of depth, even if you don't like the building (and are playing with someone that does), you can still help with gathering items, scouting, placing beacons, killing the local fauna, etc.\n\nThere is no plot in the game as of yet, but there's a ton of little touches that I really enjoy. The fact there's a wrench keychain on the sword, and another on one of the other weapons (I think the rebar gun), and several other things just give much more life to a faceless, voiceless character then expected. I mean, each time you pick up a new tool, your character looks at it (and often fiddles with something, like the keychain), and that is just... enjoyable to see. It shows the character you are is a person, not just a robot for the player to pilot around.\n\nThe world feels like an actual world too. Yes, the biomes are fairly small and close together, but they flow into each other really well, and it feels like a properly done, alive world.\n\nThis is one of those games I get excited when I see an announcement from the devs, because I'm looking forward to more of the game, not the feeling of \"Oh, another DLC to add to the pile\" or \"Oh goody, an update, I need to stop playing for a week so they can hotfix everything AGAIN.\" It's just... nice. It's a nice, colorful, fun multiplayer game and I wish there was more games I could say that about.\n\nI want a FICSIT coffee mug too.

As you expand production and unlock new tech, you'll be refactoring your base and traveling out further for rarer resources.  Overall, this loop *just works*, and fairly fun and balanced.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f AESTHETIC:  \nFor EA, Satisfactory is super polished.  Yes, your conveyor belts will clip through things and you'll find bugs, but overall it's a beautiful world to explore and steal resources from.  The design is less like Factorio's diesel-punk (e.g. Wall-E) and more like Subnautica's shiny-future (e.g. Eve). \n\n\u274c ANIMAL BALANCE: \nThe animals and their spawns are way too aggressive currently.  You can clear out an area only to have to do it again a few minutes later, and the weapons you get do not give you much advantage.  It makes expansion more of a chore than a fun challenge.\n\n[h1]Similarities to Factorio[/h1]\n\n\u2714\ufe0f THE FACTORY MUST GROW: \nExplore, expand, and exploit an alien world is the main theme of this game and it's just as fun as it is in Factorio.  You will build, refactor, and build again parts of your supply chains, but each time it feels rewarding as you continue to unlock tiers.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f THE THIRD DIMENSION: \nFactorio is an automation game, but the loop boils down to a two-dimensional puzzle of belts, assemblers, and inserters.  Satisfactory keeps that loop but moves it into the third dimension.  There's no inserters - belts connect everything - but you'll be solving some of the same problems as Factorio just  in three dimensional space.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f NO BASE DEFENSE:\nNative life doesn't attack your factory if you grow too fast or too greedily.  In fact, the factory itself can't really take damage, so there isn't any lose condition (yet anyways).  You can just casually build and expand a factory, which is still fun but lacks a late game challenge.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f DOWNSIZED PRODUCTION: \nSatisfactory takes a different approach to the massive amounts of resources that Factorio has, and has significantly scaled down production.  For example, with each mine you will be constructing one miner and six smelters, as opposed to Factorio's dozen miners and four dozen smelters.  Buildings as more expensive though to compensate, and it balances out.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f INFINITE RESOURCES: \nOnce you build a mine in Satisfactory, it will produce resources indefinitely.  This makes Satisfactory more a game about managing rates of production rather than the additional inventory management that comes from bursts or busts in your supply chain.  Also any lack of power shuts down the whole factory instead of simply slowing it, which makes it even easier to plan production lines.\n\n\u274c AUTOMATION NOT INCLUDED:  \nWith Factorio, you could automate [i]everything[/i] including the assemblers, and even go most of the game without crafting anything if you chose to.  Satisfactory, unfortunately, only lets you automate crafted item construction, not buildings or foundations, which have to be all hand-built by you.\n\n\u274c BELTS [strike]VS BOTS[/strike]:  \nThis is the biggest difference, IMO.  There are no bots in Satisfactory, and no blueprint feature as of yet.  There's that sweet spot in Factorio where you start to scale up with bots and your factory grows exponentially, but that's not here with Satisfactory.  It gets really annoying when you have a nice plate-assembly configuration you want to copy somewhere else, but you have to build it all again from scratch.\n\n\n[h1]Similarities to Subnautica:[/h1]\n\n\u2714\ufe0f LUSH ALIEN WORLD:  \nThe aspect of exploring an exotic alien world full of danger makes Subnautica one of the better games out there, and Satisfactory has gone this same route too with multiple biomes.  There isn't the unending procedural generation like Factorio, and you have to plan your expansion accordingly, but Satisfactory scratches that exploration itch.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f MEGAFAUNA: \nBig alien creatures roam the planet with you, and sometimes get in your way.  They're mostly cosmetic right now and not that dangerous (yet?), but as for the giant spiders they can go **** themselves.  Late game resources are especially challenging to extract from a very dangerous biome.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f RESEARCH TREES: \nThere are multiple paths you can take to acquire new tech and toys, either through the main game, scanning native life/resources, finding crashed ship hard drives, or grinding out fun bucks by trading items for company goods.  It's novel way to go about researching different branches and I hope they don't drop them.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f BASE BUILDING:  \nEverything in Satisfactory is built the same way you built bases in Subnautica, with your little sci-fi projector thing, but on steroids.  It can build copies of the same building pretty quickly, given if you have the resources to do it, but only one type of building at a time.  It takes some handling to get used to laying foundations at scale but they have a snap grid to help.\n\n\u274c SENSE OF TERROR: \nSatisfactory is really missing that thrill of being alone and feeling hunted, that Subnautica captures so well as a survival horror game.  You can argue that's not the point of Satisfactory (it's not), but Subnautica fans will not find it if they're looking for it.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of either Factorio or Subnautica, you'll probably find something to like in this game.  The devs have done a good job of making good, functional releases and their community manager guy is awesome.  The game is definitely justified at this price.\n\n[i]Note for New players[/i]:  Check out the [i]Let's Game It Out[/i] YT videos to see how not to play the game.  Also, when picking a biome to start, the Grass Fields has the most room to easily build but by mid-late game you'll be incredibly far from rare resources.  Given how much of a chore it is to expand and transport long distances, you're better off starting in the Northern Forest for now.", "timestamp_created": 1591653508, "timestamp_updated": 1591723269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 278, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.907826840877532959", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124581254": {"recommendationid": "124581254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161363787", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2334, "last_played": 1704210375}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good way to keep my room warm", "timestamp_created": 1667038048, "timestamp_updated": 1667038048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 195, "votes_funny": 198, "weighted_vote_score": "0.907285034656524658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130240501": {"recommendationid": "130240501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372754156", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1121, "last_played": 1688209322}, "language": "english", "review": "It's so satisfying to make the most absurd, unorganized, and horrendous looking factory.

The player can explore the planet alone or with their friends, producing new materials, and building new factories over and over again. [/h1]  \n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n+ Satisfying gameplay about building factories and designing an efficient production\n+ It\u2019s extremely addictive, the neverending feeling of \u201cjust one more thing\u201d\n+ Decent amount of materials, productions, and pieces of machinery \n+ Amazing graphics\n+ A huge handcrafted map to explore \n+ A huge replayability value\n+ Atmospheric music that perfectly fits the game\n+ Constant updates from the developers\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n- The game can behave a bit weird in multiplayer mode, keep in mind, that it\u2019s still under development\n- Lots of important and needed features that are still absent \n- Minor bugs here and there \n\nI must say, that I am a huge fan of Satisfactory. I am playing this game since March 2019 and it feels like I have no plans on stopping, this game never bored me since then. What is really important to say here, that I was never a fan of building games, where the player has to explore, craft, survive, and all stuff like this, this was never my kind of thing. \n\nSo when I purchased Satisfactory, it was more like an experiment for me, just to see what\u2019s people are talking about. Plus I was really hooked with its trailer and screenshots, everything seemed there extremely attractive. \n\nAnd to be honest, I fell in love with this game instantly. What I really liked there, that this game doesn\u2019t put any pressure on the player. There is no such thing as \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d in Satisfactory - you can\u2019t make any mistakes in this game. The player is free to do whatever they want and to construct their factory or anything else just the way they see it.\n\nSatisfactory is all about the player\u2019s creativity, it\u2019s all about the satisfying building experience, this game is absolutely stress-free and a perfect choice for the players who are looking for the games, where they don\u2019t have to worry about their score, gaming skill or how good they are comparing to other players. \n\n[b] Story [/b]\n\nThere is no such thing as a proper story in Satisfactory as of June 2020, however, the developers promise to add the story in the future updates. The basic idea of the game is that the protagonist lands on the unknown alien planet called Massage-2(AB)b and starts building there a new factory with complex productions. \n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\n\nThe game starts with an understanding that the player is completely alone on a pretty big map and now he has to start building the factory here. The protagonist has basic instruments to build the main base and a small yet efficient weapon to defend himself from the enemies on this planet. Satisfactory explains the basics of the game on a pretty understandable level, so every single kind of player can get into the game easily.\n\nAt first, the player has to build the main base and then find his first iron nod to start gathering its materials. From this point, the whole game starts to unfold itself when the player starts to build long-chained productions to produce different kinds of materials, searching for various types of resources and thinking about how to build them all in the most logical way. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2149424031\n\nThere is a tier system in Satisfactory that lets the player unlock technologies and new possibilities to expand their factory. This helps a lot for the player to get into the whole idea of the game gradually so by the time the player hits the final tier, they will be prepared and know how everything works and what kind of instruments they have in their arsenal.\n\nDuring this unlocking process, the player has to build the space elevator, which has to be connected to the production chain. This allows the player to send requested materials to the company, the main protagonist works for to unlock the next set of tiers. Unlocking all the available tiers will take a while. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2124300767\n\nAfter unlocking every single tier of production, the players are free to do whatever they feel like. Satisfactory\u2019s only limit is your imagination and you can\u2019t do something completely wrong here, the freedom is yours. You can focus on building a mega factory, think about new projects to start or explore the whole map to make sure that every single node is occupied - this is all up to your choice and this is simply amazing. \n\nThere are a few types of enemies in Satisfactory that can be a bit dangerous in the early game but once the player unlocks more powerful weapons, they won\u2019t be that dangerous at all. To be honest, I still don\u2019t understand why they even exist in the game, because they don\u2019t do any harm to the player\u2019s constructions and they don\u2019t any challenge to the gameplay with its existing. My only guess is that the developers plan to give them a much important role in future updates. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2124299500\n\nThe game can be played in both solo and multiplayer modes up to 4 players. However, the multiplayer mode is much bugged than solo and it can be a bit unstable in terms of internet connections.   \n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that the game is still under development and it\u2019s constantly updating every few months adding new features, possibilities, and fixing minor bugs and issues. But even for the fact that this game is still in Early Access, it looks absolutely gorgeous.    \n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\n\nThe game looks amazing, with all those beautiful colorful landscapes, trees, and plants all over the alien planet. The map is divided into four different zones each with its own atmosphere, nature and overall feeling. In general, I can say that this game brings the most outstanding graphics I have ever seen in base building games. \n\n[b] Sound [/b] \n\nMusic in Satisfactory is something I can talk about for hours because it\u2019s magnificent, it definitely fits the atmosphere of the whole game. Considering the fact that the whole game is a pretty chilling and meditative experience, the soundtrack of this game definitely plays along greatly. If you ever feel like you are tired of the in-game music, I strongly recommend you to look for the playlist in Spotify called Satisfactory - Ambient Soundtrack.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\n\nSatisfactory is the game that I am playing since it has been launched back in March 2019. Frankly speaking, I am that kind of person who gets bored with the games pretty quickly but this is not the case. I always come back to Satisfactory to build something else, to check new updates, to play with my friends, or to start a brand new map, considering all the mistakes, I\u2019ve done in the past. This is a perfect sandbox base-building game that is constantly updating that I can recommend to everyone who is looking for a chilling and meditative experience. \n\nI am in love with Satisfactory.\n\n[b] Enjoy!

Initially, there are hurdles to overcome (if you are coming from a top down automation game) but once you get your brain wrapped around the change to vertical building, it becomes yet another game that will steal hours upon hours from you. \n\nGraphically it is beautiful. You get a full sense of being in an alien world with enough recognizable things to stay grounded in reality. As with most automation games, you'll start over several times (if not more) as you build yourself into a corner with little room to expand. Which is something that this game demands...space. Lots of it. You'll dedicate entire plots of land to a single item. You'll advance and realize you did it all wrong and now you can't get part A to building B without building the most inefficient and ugly belt system to get there. \n\nIf you favor aesthetics over function, prepare to have your brain fried as you try to figure out what you need and where it needs to go before you build it. But there are other ways to transport items. You get trucks of a couple sizes, a variety of belts and poles to align them as you see fit and a train system that will put your engineering chops to the test. \n\nAs far as adversity, there isn't much of it. Some of the wildlife is aggressive but nothing that requires you to be a master at reflexes. Most of your time will be spent with a digital cup of coffee in hand, staring out at what you are building and wondering how you are going to get the things you need at not only the right place, but at the right ratios as well. Exploration is where the real danger is especially if you are like me and don't look before you leap. Many a canyon have welcomed my lifeless body because \"oh there is something glowing there!\" took priority over \"is there a giant cliff here?\". The progression through the tiers of items is good and every new milestone reached allows you to make much needed updates to your factory to improve throughput, tighten grid placement, and traverse the world quicker and with fewer speed bumps. So you'll start with hand tools and eventually be able to jetpack to new (previously unattainable) areas. It feels organic and makes for a fun and engaging game curve to follow. \n\nThere are some quality of life things that I'd like to see such as more efficient ways to build massive structures rather than one piece at a time, labeling of containers to know what's in them from a distance, and a more robust netcode (MP games can get violently choppy if you are playing with anyone not local to you). \n\nOne major con is that the map is singular. There is no randomization and once you have explored it all, that is it. You'll learn where nodes are and it does pull some of the exploration awe out of the game. But you are too busy to worry about that. The factory must grow. \n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic building/logistic game and it continues to suck hours from my life.", "timestamp_created": 1612902996, "timestamp_updated": 1612902996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 135, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895419001579284668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149185497": {"recommendationid": "149185497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332390678", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4224, "last_played": 1700774158}, "language": "english", "review": "Day 1: Fun game looks really nice with the graphics\nDay 2: Made some new upgrades its looking good!\nDay 5: Space Elevator wow so cool!\nDay 20: Power grid is out\nDay 50: What is happening there is so much happening help\nDay 100: THE FACTORY WILL SURVIVE PRODUCE PRODUCE PRODUCE\n", "timestamp_created": 1698662607, "timestamp_updated": 1698662607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 278, "votes_funny": 81, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893544018268585205", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71213682": {"recommendationid": "71213682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036135921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 94495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8207, "last_played": 1703594944}, "language": "english", "review": "Factorio is better, but hear me out!\n\nTLDR: the game can be frustrating at first, but gets increasingly better as you progress and learn.\n\nIt is a different game and should not be compared to Factorio, but you just can't help but compare it. When I started it I got rather disappointed, borderline quitting, because I tried to play it like Factorio, I expected it to be Factorio, but things that worked there didn't work here. But as I progress through the game and unlock things, as I learn the differences and adapt my new ways, I fell in deep love with Satisfactory.\n\n- I got frustrated to hand feed biomass to my burners - until I unlocked coal.\n- I missed the gridlines, hand placed buildings didn't align, factory looked ugly - until I learned about foundations (it allows snapping to grids).\n- All buildings looked the same, it was impossible to navigate in your factory - until I unlocked color-coding.\n- I hated to move across my factory jumping over my endless belts - so I learned to place them above my head.\n- Main Bus is not the best idea here, the game encourages you to use automated vehicles instead.\n- I wanted an infinite flat surface to build, I disliked the idea to squeeze my factory around irregular terrain - until I discovered that 3rd dimension opens up endless possibilities. The ability to build vertical is the strongest side of this game and looking back at Factorio I'm gonna miss this feature a lot.\n\nThe game is beautiful (graphics resemble Subnautica for some reason), but animations are beyond awesome! After over 100 hours I still enjoy them. And I don't mean that Factorio is ugly, it is not.\n\nExploration is a huge part of the game, a big part of the tech tree is dedicated to help you with exploration. But on the other hand we have a hand-made map here. Will it be fun to explore it for the tenth time? Especially with online maps with pin-pointed locations?\n\nThe resources are infinite here, they don't expire. You still need to find new ones as your factory grows.\n\nThere is no pollution, no tower defense. You only fight creatures while exploring the world.\n\nThe game is still unfinished, there is no end game. And the end game worries me the most. I haven't reached it yet, but I wonder if there is a reason to motivate me to endlessly expand my factory? In Factorio we had endless research to gradually increase our capabilities, I don't think we have it here. Yeah, I can earn the in-game currency to buy things I don't need, but I don't feel it is enough.\n\nBut so far I love this game, I became obsessed with it. Every night I cannot sleep because I think of ways to improve my factory, every morning I wake up with a new vision to tear everything down and rebuild. Sometimes I cannot wait till morning and get up midnight to try new solutions. And if I successfully fall asleep I have endless walkways and belts in my nightmares :)\n\nYes, I recommend this game. You can't expect it to beat Factorio (the second best rated game on steam), but oh god it is awesome!\n\n----\n\nUpdate after 200+ hours:\n\nMy fears of end game hasn't been realized this yet. After I unlocked all techs and alternative recipes, now I need to completely rebuild my factory, with nuclear power and railway network bringing resources from all over the map. I expect this project take me a month or two.\n\nAlso I changed my mind and I'm building the main bus :)\n\nPeople commenting about me comparing it to Factorio: yes, I said one should not compare it, BUT YOU JUST CAN'T HELP BUT COMPARE IT. https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/somebody-can-t-help-doing-something", "timestamp_created": 1592901748, "timestamp_updated": 1593512069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 479, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893757939338684082", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90240024": {"recommendationid": "90240024", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994277836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 43334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 181, "playtime_at_review": 10121, "last_played": 1712610643}, "language": "english", "review": "WARNING.
