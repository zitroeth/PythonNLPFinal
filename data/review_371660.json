A recent example is the case of The Crew, whose servers were shut down, depriving players not only of the multiplayer mode but also of the single-player story mode, and is now also is inaccessible on Ubisoft Connect. This situation is not new; in the past, we saw similar attempts with games like Assassin's Creed III and Far Cry 3, where server closures affected access to DLCs. A more serious case was that of Might & Magic Duel of Champions, a free-to-play game with microtransactions, whose closure not only removed the game from stores but also erased achievements and statistics from accounts, rendering important player information inaccessible.\n\nWith this panorama, we cannot guarantee that Ubisoft games, especially those linked to their Ubisoft Connect application, will remain in our accounts or that we can play them when we want. Until there is a change in these policies, it is not recommended to acquire these titles. Personally, games linked to this company will no longer be part of my wishlist, even if I am interested in playing them.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEn la actualidad, adquirir juegos publicados por Ubisoft puede no ser la mejor decisi\u00f3n, a pesar de la calidad que puedan ofrecer.

Un ejemplo reciente es el caso de The Crew, cuyos servidores fueron cerrados, privando no solo del modo multijugador, sino tambi\u00e9n del modo historia para un jugador, y que adem\u00e1s ahora es inaccesible en Ubisoft Connect. Esta situaci\u00f3n no es nueva; en el pasado, vimos intentos similares con juegos como Assassin's Creed III y Far Cry 3, donde el cierre de servidores afect\u00f3 el acceso a DLCs.

It's basically Far Cry 4 with more gimmicks.\n\nThe weapons are fun, but the bow is absolutely over powered. It shoots fast and kills 99% of human enemies in one shot. \nThe club...Sucks. Why would I run towards the guys trying to skewer me when I could just out range them with my bow or thrown spears? And against animals tanky enough to absorb an arrow or twelve you're better off using the spear.\nSpeaking of the spear, it rocks. Just toss it and it kills almost everything in one body shot. What survives should just be head shot instead.\nI love the bee bomb, it actually got me to use off hand grenades which is something I almost never do. I find most grenades take too long and I'd be better off just shooting the enemy. But the bee bomb detonates on impact and affects a very wide area. It can also be air dropped by your pet owl.\n\nSpeaking of the pet owl, you're the \"beast master\" now.\nSo you can tame wild predators and call them to your aid, using them for stealthy take downs or even riding them around since there's no more vehicles (no boats or wing suit either.) \n\nStealth has also been slightly redone, instead of a scope or camera you now have Assassins Creed style eagle vision and a pet owl that can recon enemies like a spy drone. Day and Night also have a much more dramatic affect on your visibility as well as what animals spawn. \n\nHunting and crafting are still mechanics, boo. \nIt's not the end of the world but I really started to get sick of it after awhile. So glad FC5 moved away from these features.\n\nNight is...Weird.\nPredators spawn in huge droves and attack you CONSTANTLY which I think is supposed to make it more difficult but honestly just makes night a good time to farm hunting items. Its also so bright out its almost impossible to tell when it actually is night fall. \n\nPrimal also made some changes to fire, making it a much more central mechanic.\nIt still doesn't spread as wildly as it did in FC2 but now you can ignite your weapons whenever you want. Which is useful as many collectables require you to burn some brambles out of you way to reach them, and since guns are lacking the best way to kill multiple enemies is to set EVERYTHING on fire.\nThe best part though, is most animals will run away from flaming weapons super useful for travelling at night.\n\nOverall, its an alright game.

The game feels familiar mechanically in that combat has the same weight and you can gather resources as in previous games, as well as tackle forts and bonfires (instead of radio towers). However, the prehistoric setting and the lack of vehicles and guns allows this entry to feel unique. Weapons must be crafted with resources found all throughout the map and there's a big focus on melee combat (though bows and throwable spears are present). Throwables are handled creatively as instead of grenades, you get jars full of bees, beserker poison and fire. There isn't much story present, though essentially you're fighting for the dominance of your tribe within your immediate inhabitable region. This isn't neccisarilly a bad thing, as the real appeal of the game is its gameplay, just as the other games are focused on.\n\nWhile I do recommend the game, it does have a few issues. First, it's not immediately clear when you've finished it. I did all the \"campaign\" missions, only to be confused when there was no definitive end cinematic or even credits roll. While I did enjoy the hunting aspect of the game as well, I found that there were simply too many predators. I couldn't go anywhere without being constantly hounded by bears, wolves and sabertoothes all at once. The other Far Cry entries have you constantly bombarded by enemies as well (which I also find annoying) but you're at least left with the option of driving away. Here, you must confront pretty much all predators if they happen to catch sight of you. Last, for some people, they might have an issue with the basic layout of the map being incredibly similar to that of Far Cry 4. I can understand how some might find this \"cheap\", but the layout of the rivers and different terrain types (as well as variances of discoverable locations) make the map feel completely different. It also feels much different because you're walking or running everywhere as opposed to using vehicles.\n\nIf you've enjoyed previous entries of the series, you'll probably like this one too.

There's not many games out there that cater to settings in prehistoric times though. At least, not ones I have found worth playing. Far Cry Primal satisfied that itch a bit. There's even decent archaeological influences, details, and references slipped in if you know where to look! I enjoyed the part that involved a Venus figure. Hell, the game's dialogue is event based on a proto-language believed to be spoken at the time! This game is very immersive when it comes to that. It feels real and authentic, and it is not an effort I would see most games making. So kudos to that. But I wish they had subtitles for more than just cut scenes. I pass by fellow villagers so often but I can never tell what they are saying. There's a few recognizable root words (Thank you, Latin!), but other than that it's kind of impossible to tell what they are saying without subtitles. And to me, being able to understand all the dialogue is important for immersion. There was also the fact that this is set in prehistoric Central Europe, but a majority of the Wenja look like they have Afro-centric features, and it strikes me as a decision made to make the Wenja look more 'tribal' so... That's a thing. Also, some of the animal and plant life choices were kind of odd to me. Raffelsia in Ice Age Central Europe? NOOOOOO! Dholes that look like African wild dogs and sound like heyenas? DOUBLE NOOOOO! Those details were kinda jarring to me, but I am a stickler about scientific accuracy I guess.\n\nBut enough about history, how is the game? Pretty solid, honestly! I was coming off of The Long Dark just prior to playing Far Cry Primal, so I had initially expected the 'survival' aspect to be similar to that game. Instead I got a Stone Punk action-adventure with resource management. Which, honestly, is awesome and makes for a really fun game! Just not what I expected. But I guess that I on me for assuming. Beyond that, the gameplay is good. The details, textures, and setting are GORGEOUS. I've experienced very few glitches too, which is nice. And frankly those glitches I HAVE seen have mostly involved animal models flying through the air after I've killed them. If you've never seen a fully grown mammoth soar 20 feet straight up into the air, you are seriously missing out.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I am way too much of an anthropology nerd for any game to meet my high expectations for historical accuracy. But this game is still really good and worth a try! I mean, YOU GET TO RIDE A SABER TOOTHED CAT. That really is enough said.\n\nEdit: RE: Wenja and Afro-centric features.

How did you feel about the gathering, hunting and crafting systems of the previous two games?  Those feelings will tell you EXACTLY how much you'll like Far Cry Primal.\n\nYou play as Takkar, a beast tamer out to defend his people from the onslaught of the cannibalistic Udam tribe, and the pyromanic Izila tribe.  Annnnnndddd that's pretty much it.  Now, I think writing a story that takes place in 10,000 B.C. is a tough sell.  You don't have a lot to work with, as these are essentially pre-tribal conditions.  Complicated social concepts CAN'T exist.  I knew this going in and was prepared for a simplistic plot, but I was surprised to learn that several linchpins of the plot are conveyed entirely through drug trips.  Now, I know that drug use has somehow become a theme in the last two Far Cry games, but using it as a plot mechanic creates a problem as it injects an element of pure fantasy into an otherwise entirely realistic game.  It draws attention to the fact that the game is neither as realistic as it should have been, nor as entertainingly fantastic as it could have been.  \n\nMost of the game's quests revolve around recruiting half a dozen specialists for the tribe and doing their bidding, as well as growing the tribe by doing things like saving tribe members (Wenja) in trouble and taking outposts from the enemy.  Almost all of the rest of the game is hunting, gathering and crafting.  \n\nIn theory, this could have worked.  If you're going to have those systems dominate your game, go deep.  Hunting could have added real elements of tracking to the game, at the very least.  Instead, you hit V to see things through some magical Hunter Vision that is never explained.  Takkar's primitive arsenal is somewhat impressive, if redundant on certain items, but it could have been more complex.  I would have liked to have seen a flint-napping skill to increase the quality of your weapons over time.  Instead, we're left with the generic \"gather these items and magically make your stuff better\", which every Far Cry game has done.  Many of the game's unlockable skills have no purpose other than to craft or gather more than one thing at a time, but if you do every MEANINGFUL quest and gear/skill upgrade in the game, there's only about 25 hours here.  \n\nThere are the typical side-quest/collectible/explore-area routines that every Far Cry game has, but every single one of them gives you either XP, a skill point, materials, or adds to the tribe's population.  The only conceivable benefit to growing the tribe (besides unlocking certain upgrades) is that they will gather certain types of materials FOR you and drop them into a bag you can access from almost anywhere in the world.  I don't think I completed half the game's content, and it was all rewards such as these.  While the world itself is savagely beautiful, there's just no point in going sight-seeing for such meager things.\n\nMany quests are locked off unless you develop certain buildings within the tribal home, using quite a lot of resources.  I would have liked to have seen a much more extensive building mechanic since the game is so focused on gathering and hunting.  \n\nBeing a beast tamer, you can tame 17 animals, but mostly they just have permutations of each other's abilities.  Outside of role-playing, you will use three or so, tops.  You can also ride certain ones, like the brown bear or either of the sabretooth cats, but not the largest bear.  Should you find one, you can also ride a young mammoth, but not the big ones, which I suppose is fine since it's stupidly overpowered anyway.  Most of the animals you just toss bait at to tame, but three of them (the most powerful) have their own legimitately exciting quest chains.  It's a real shame that they aren't nearly as durable AFTER you tame them, but I suppose nerfing their health was the only way to balance them out.  \n\nYou can access any summoned animal from within the menu, and send them back just as fast.  If they go down in a fight (which even the toughest ones will with unfortunate regularity) you can feed them meat to get them back up.  If they die outright, you'll need red leaves to bring them back to life.  Sending them away before they die makes them invincible, and they regain health when not summoned.  Commands are limited to \"go here, come back, go kill this.\"  There's also an owl you unlock in the beginning who can scout and tag enemies for you, but also kill a selected enemy outright or drop some of your bombs on them.  How did you unlock this stupendous ability to command the beasts?  A drug trip, of course.\n\nThrough a combination of a fully upgraded owl, and stealthy pets, it's possible to take out an entire base without lifting a finger or being discovered, however it is far more fun to fight alongside your beast, or simply run everyone over with a mammoth.  The combat system is a bit clunky.  Sometimes hitboxes are questionable, as are lines of sight, and melee combat has no crosshair and is pure guesswork where you're going to hit.  Takkar has vastly superior technology compared to his enemies, even without the beasts.  \n\nPay no more than 30 dollars even if you're a fan of the systems I've outlined.

No, caves aren't just holes with a bear inside, they're separate experiences with sometimes huge indoor setpieces and enemy camps. No, the game's central village is not a lifeless facsimile of a town with nameless NPCs with dead eyes that make you wonder who you're actually fighting for, it's a hub that grows more lively every time you return, showing your progress quite literally through the presence of named NPCs, trainers, huts, and even cave paintings that grow according to what you've encountered, found, or unlocked.\n\nI can only recommend this one, but make sure to play in Survivor mode, it truly feels like this was the way the game was meant to be released in the first place.", "timestamp_created": 1524391443, "timestamp_updated": 1524391482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 132, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90375208854675293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105005362": {"recommendationid": "105005362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118564247", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 2182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 981, "last_played": 1649680737}, "language": "english", "review": "I am still waiting on Far Cry Primal 2", "timestamp_created": 1638374991, "timestamp_updated": 1638374991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 173, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900800049304962158", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133488711": {"recommendationid": "133488711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130557897", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 3405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3405, "last_played": 1619644289}, "language": "english", "review": "Should be it's own franchise with 3 or 5 games by now.\nThe BEST Far Cry game by far.", "timestamp_created": 1677241790, "timestamp_updated": 1677241790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 161, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.898090481758117676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21862607": {"recommendationid": "21862607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052283991", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 921, "last_played": 1469316825}, "language": "english", "review": "Turn off:\nall auto assists, hud elements,the minimap, \n\ndont tag enemies, dont use the owl, do not use hunter vision, do not fast travel, dont chase every little icon on the map, try not using the map and navigating like a caveman, put the difficulty up to where you feel its a little too hard to really get you feeling vulnerable.\n\nIt will feel strange at first.

It should also be noted that following the release of Far Cry 4 the creators received criticism for the use of the English language. The 4th entry introduced a Nepalese setting (a fictional country called Kyrat) but the main emphasis was still on having characters speaking only English.\n\nWith Primal we really go prehistoric. To get full immersion (or realism) the creators actually reached out to linguists to successfully integrate Proto-Indo-European into the game which is the very language that was spoken thousands of years ago. This is a dead language so knowing how to write it doesn't mean speaking it is equally easy. The linguists hired by Ubi needed some time to recreate the language and successfully adapt it. Listening to each tribe member uttering words in this language is one of the highlights of Primal. Every cutscene is a jewel in this game. \n\n[b]The all too familiar game mechanics[/b]\n\nNot much has changed other than the setting. The core concept remains the same: we have an open world environment where we are free to go wherever we wish. Special icons indicate those missions that advance the story - the rest are side missions. We have tons of these. In fact, after completing some story missions an icon of Dah (a member of one of the rival tribes) appears in the far east section of the map asking us to take this fort. We are too weak to do that so your best bet is to spend several hours looking around finding some additional tribe members.\n\nAnd this is the interesting part of the game. As usual we get XP for all kills we do or quests we complete. Levelling up means the receipt of skill points to spend. But until we complete side quests for certain individuals (who will join our tribe after) a lot of these skills will remain locked. Do you want to learn how to tame beasts? Get Tensay as an ally. You prefer bows to spears and clubs and you'd like to be an expert of this weapon? Find Jayma, the hunter.\n\n[b]And the novelty[/b]\n\nWe have 7 key members to recruit who will all open up several skills for us but this requires building a dwelling for them. These huts can later on be upgraded for extra XP and other bonuses. You will need all these characters to increase your arsenal of weapons which is now a bit different as Primal bids farewell to all pistols, machine guns and shotguns we used in previous game. But bows are present in modern titles so you are probably familiar with this weapon. It's fun seeing how some of these items are the transitioned version of those present in modern games. Take fire bomb, for instance: you throw it and it explodes. What is this if not an incendiary grenade? Or the bee hives that you can also throw to dispose of enemies in a certain area. Bees or no bees - this is a type of grenade. \n\nWhile getting familiar with the new wildlife (sabre-toothed tigers, mammoths and even rhinos roam the land of Oros) you will notice that the game randomly generates missions. This usually involves the Wenja (your tribe) confronting its rivals (Izila or Udam) or simply being attacked by a predator. Saving these people will not only yield you some XP but the natives will also join your base at the Western section of the map. Increasing the population of the tribe will be mandatory for some hut upgrades. These (and the ones we can apply to our weapons) will require all kinds of resources: we have different types of rocks, plants and wood here and, of course, the hide of the animals that we kill.\n\n[b]Domestication of animals[/b]\n\nProbably far-fetched but catchy, right? Taming beasts is one of the best features Primal has to offer. Again, Tensay will be essential for this but in order to get the full experience of the game I recommend that you recruit all major characters as soon as possible before advancing the story. The higher the skill is the more dangerous predators can be tamed. This task is actually pretty easy as it requires meat to be used as bait.\n\nThe animals have different attributes. Bears are the strongest but wolves are faster. Some are also difficult to notice by the enemies so when taking an outpost and having an idea to do it stealthily leave your bear pet behind and instead pick a jaguar. Some come with additional, unique abilities such as collecting resources for you or revealing an extra portion of the map or simply being immune to fire. Killed pets can be revived and eventually you'll have an assortment to choose from. Awesome!\n\n[b]Takkar, the caveman[/b]\n\nPrimal is a great and surprising addition to the Far Cry franchise. We can invest dozens of hours into helping Takkar in his mission to conquer the Valley of Oros. Those of you having played the new Deus Ex games will recognise Elias Toufexis who does the voice-acting job for our hero.\n\nIf you like the extra challenge you can switch to survival mode which introduces stamina that not only running but gunning (I mean spearing or bowing) can drain. Not that the land of Oros wasn't already a dangerous place: there are frequent day-night cycle changes and it will be nighttime probably when you'll perish for the first time as a pack of dire wolves attacks you from out of nowhere. Don't fret! There are several spawning points, though, as you slowly take over the land by capturing all bonfires and outposts.", "timestamp_created": 1567269487, "timestamp_updated": 1567270324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 125, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878846049308776855", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32828014": {"recommendationid": "32828014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010653243", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2633, "last_played": 1498506160}, "language": "english", "review": "I was really hesitant about getting into this game as FC2, FC3 and FC4 were outstanding.

I find this game extremely immersive, although I feel like I am playing with Adam Jensen 12000 years ago (same voice actor for the main character), which is not a bad thing at all, I like his voice.\n\nMusic, sounds, visuals, how the animals move, etc. (with the limitations of AI obviously) all contribute to creating a fantastic environment. If you burn an animal while hunting it, it will slide and set fire to the ground it slid onto... not that I like to burn animals alive, but if they come attack me while I am minding my business then I have no choice but to defend myself. But then you realise, wait a minute, that tiger was scared of fire, is this game going to be realistic and let me scare other animals away? And it does, you just point your fiery club towards them.\n\nYou get to tame animals, craft everything you own, build your village - I am guessing these are the elements that players of the previous Far Cry games feel are more of the same. As I said, being the first Far Cry game for me, I find this all very rewarding.\n\nAll in all, it's a beautiful, immersive experience, I highly recommend this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1479642383, "timestamp_updated": 1479642383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863639116287231445", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84975660": {"recommendationid": "84975660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044858933", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 1300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 803, "last_played": 1611190808}, "language": "english", "review": "Go back to monke.", "timestamp_created": 1611062140, "timestamp_updated": 1611062140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86185377836227417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57543942": {"recommendationid": "57543942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082261622", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 628, "last_played": 1584818483}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Far Cry Primal[/h1]\n\n\u2764 Audience \u2764\n\u2611 Beginner\n\u2611 Casual Gamer\n\u2611 Normal Gamer\n\u2610 Expert\n\n\u263c Graphics \u263c\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Alright\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Fantastic\n\n\u266c Music \u266c\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Alright\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Fantastic\n\n\u2620 Difficulty \u2620\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Hard\n\u2610 Unfair\n\n\u00a7 Bugs \u00a7\n\u2610 Bugs destroy the game\n\u2610 Lots of bugs\n\u2611 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing encountered\n\n\u262f Story \u262f\n\u2610 There is none\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Alright\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Fantastic\n\n\u2694 Gameplay \u2694\n\u2610 Frustrating\n\u2610 Sleepy\n\u2610 Boring\n\u2611 Fun\n\u2610 Challenging\n\n\u06de Game time / Length \u06de\n\u2610 Really short (0 - 3 hours)\n\u2610 Short (4 - 8 hours)\n\u2611 Few hours (10 - 20 hours) [if you focus on the main story]\n\u2611 Long (40-60 hours) [if you complete everything]\n\u2610 Very Long (61-100 hours)\n\u2610 Extremely Long (101+ hours)\n\n$ Price / Quality $\n\u2610 Full price\n\u2611 Wait for Sale\n\u2610 Don't buy\n\u2610 Refund it if you can", "timestamp_created": 1574273903, "timestamp_updated": 1574273903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 181, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858514308929443359", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103079629": {"recommendationid": "103079629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169448172", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2304, "last_played": 1640760780}, "language": "english", "review": "This is probably my personal favorite Farcry game.

Thats cool\n+Insane difficulty options, survival mode, permadeath mode. This is true suffer for who wants a real challenge\n+Speeches are original language from those years. Only subtitles we have\n\nStill, unfortunately..\n-Color correction is mess, it is really bad. Too warm, causes horrible visual\n-Depth of field and film grain. Again like FC4 you cant disable them. JUST WHY. While you use owl its really hard to spot an enemy due to depth of field. \n-You can disable most of UI features yes but you cant disable the enemy location indicator on your crosshair. The game is directing you like ''enemy behind, turn and shoot'' this making game so easy\n-Crafting system is nice but if you dont rush the story (its FC game, ofc you may want 100% completion) you basically improve your skills and gear to maximum very early. So that makes the game a lot easier again. Even on hard mode game became extremely easy..\n-Removed realism dynamics (every new FC games just looks better than previous ones, they are removing everything) plus there isnt rain\n-Side quests are fun but after a while they are becoming too repetitive and you are realizing that they are not ending. They are not infinite but, yeah..\n\nSuggestions\n! Do not buy Wenja pack or apex edition. Just DONT. All extra rewards are free in Ubisoft game club. If you buy apex you are getting 3 extra mammoth missions but they are s*hit. Hit standart edition\n! Like FC4 im considering the normal mode is dumb mode. Enemies are blind asf. Start it from hard and disable enemy tags and some features with it.\n! Dont forget to use your animals frequently \n! You really dont need to play all side quests even you are targeting 100% Depends on you\n\nIt should a bit more short but 100% on hard mode took 36 hours from me.

Set in 10,000 BCE, the game is a \"survival of the fittest\" type, with heavy emphasis on hunting and gathering. At launch, this release saw mixed, but favorable, reviews, and still two years later it stands out as the most unique Far Cry game. Whether or not you should invest your time and money into Far Cry Primal depends on exactly what you're looking for in terms of gameplay.\n\nSet in 10,000 BCE (the end of the Upper Paleolithic era and the beginning of the Mesolithic period) in the fictional land of Ouros, gamers play as a Wenja tribe member known as Takkar. The game opens with an amazing scene where Takkar and his hunting party are stalking a herd of Wooly Mammoths, but after claiming victory over their kill the party is decimated by a Saber-toothed Tiger that is eager to claim the kill as his own. Takkar barely escapes with his life, and proceeds alone to the land of Ouros. Of course, he makes some rather eccentric friends along the way who both join his Wenja tribe and help to teach him new skills; the most prevalent being beast taming. Unlike other Far Cry games, Primal has two \"big bads\" that rear their ugly heads along the way; Ull, champion of the cannibalistic Udam clan, and Batari, the queen of the fire-commanding Izilla tribe.\n\nUltimately, much like the realism-based Far Cry 2, your enjoyment of Primal will depend on what you're looking for in a game. This installment is much different than any of the series' predecessors, and those that are looking for the traditional experience of the franchise are more likely to not enjoy what Primal has to offer. The majority of the gameplay is centered around hunting and gathering, since story progression is generally based on having to fulfill upgrade prerequisites related to tribe huts, clothing, and weapons. In short, expect to spend most of your in-game hours scavenging for various types of rock and wood, as well as tracking down specific wildlife for their pelts. Since they obviously didn't have guns in the Mesolithic era, Takkar only has the use of one and two-handed clubs, a spear, and three different types of bows for primary weapons. For secondary, there are fire, poison, and bee bombs, stone shards that act as knives, and bait for luring aggressive wildlife. To top it all off, everything has to be crafted, there are no weapon pick-ups; if you throw a spear or a club, you better hope you have, or can find, the resources to build another.\n\nThe game also offers a lot of variety when it comes to difficulty, as you have your standard Easy/Medium/Hard/Expert levels, but also Permadeath, Second Chance, and Survival modes; players can even combine one of the first two with the latter option for an even more realistic, yet hardened, experience. Permadeath and Second Chance are just what they sound like, but Survival mode disables the mini-map, and is a lot tougher on the stamina meter. In this mode, everything from running and swimming to doing battle takes away stamina, which can only be replenished by eating meat and resting; it also causes the player to use food and stamina for fast traveling. This mode also eliminates the use of certain skills as well. Even outside of Survival mode, dying from hypothermia is a thing; it's incredibly important to keep ontop of upgrades like clothing, and making sure you have enough animal fat to set your weapons on fire. If you manage to pull off beating the game on Expert Survival Permadeath, you're even treated to an additional video from the developers at the very end of the game.\n\nOverall, the realistic mechanics of Far Cry Primal are very in-depth and well thought out, and that's because Ubisoft listened to the fans for once. The gameplay is far less obnoxious than what was presented in Far Cry 2, as the enemies do not respawn in captured locations. Of course, being a Far Cry game, there are still elements that tie it to previous titles; campfires and caves can be liberated and captured to be used as fast travel points, and to reveal more of the map. There are several different types of side-quests, such as beast taming missions, helping Wenja do various things, and also random events when wandering the map. One factor that may be a make-or-break for some people is that there is absolutely no co-op option in this release; Far Cry 3 and 4 both had an additional mode for this.\n\nThe main problem with Far Cry Primal is just how much time one has to put into hunting and gathering. At times, it feels as though you'll never get around to story progression because you need to upgrade someone's hut by gathering 40 of some far-off wood, 30 of some kinda rock, 10 animal hides, and some other things. When you finally get the upgrade materials, you'll get a small chunk of story before having to go back and do more for another hut. This means that a lot of your time will also be spent using the Hunter's Vision mechanic, which turns the world grey and highlights resources in yellow. As a result, you'll be missing out a lot on the beautiful visuals due to this. The game looks fantastic, especially with the additional HD textures download, and the scenery is absolutely gorgeous; even despite the lack of weather effects, such as rain.\n\nWell, there you have it. Far Cry Primal is a good game, but it's not for everyone. Could it have been better? Almost certainly, and if Ubisoft did reel it back a bit on the hunting and gathering it wouldn't have taken away from the realistic approach. The characters are oddly compelling, despite speaking an unknown language, and the fact that they're all eccentric in their own ways makes them stand out. If you want to fall down a real rabbit hole, take a look on YouTube for a theory on how all the Far Cry games are connected, including linking in Primal... it's some pretty interesting stuff. While $49.99 CAD feels really steep for this release, grabbing it on sale for 50-75% off is a great idea if you're down for some hardcore, primitive survival.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]4.0/5.0[/b] - Excellent, highly worth playing.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n\n[h1]Related Reviews:[/h1]\n[b]Review for Far Cry: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/13520/]Here[/url][/b]\n[b]Review for Far Cry 2: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/19900/]Here[/url][/b]\n[b]Review for Far Cry 3: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/220240/]Here[/url][/b]\n[b]Review for Far Cry 4: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/298110/]Here[/url][/b]\n[b]Review for Far Cry 5: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/552520]Here[/url][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1520170977, "timestamp_updated": 1522676856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 134, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833337068557739258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64768591": {"recommendationid": "64768591", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981793213", "num_games_owned": 1078, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 6315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6311, "last_played": 1609087415}, "language": "english", "review": "Far Cry Primal is an open world game like other Far Cry games, but set in the Stone Age, in 10,000 B.C. This is not a game in which you should expect any firearms since there was no such thing as gunpowder in the Stone Age. Expect lots of hunting, crafting, and wildlife.\n\nThe game\u2019s setting is in Oros, a fictional forest in ancient Europe. There are grassy plains, sleepy villages, and beautiful waterfalls. It is teeming with wildlife and this is what makes Far Cry Primal feel more alive than in previous Far Cry games. There is a day/night cycle as the sun looks very realistic and the moon presents a ghostly luminescence at night. There are all kinds of wild animals looking to eat you up and you must always defend yourself. It is scary to see the sharp eyes of a pack of wolves staring at you in the night.\n\nYour character is Takkar, a hunter who is trying to prove his mettle with the Wenja tribe, one of three tribes in the game. Everyone speaks a prehistoric language that sounds convincing and the dialogue is subtitled. There no central antagonist like Vaas Montenegro or Pagan Min in the previous Far Cry, leaving the storyline a bit thin and less cohesive than in previous iterations. The main antagonists are rival tribes like the Udam, a cannibalistic tribe, and the Izila, a tribe that worships fire. Your allies are tribal leaders such as Tensay the Shaman, Jayma the Hunter, and Karoosh the Warrior. You must complete their missions to convince them that you belong to the tribe.\n\nThe RPG-like skill points are back in Far Cry Primal and they are important in building Takkar\u2019s abilities. His abilities deal with survival, hunting, gathering, crafting, fighting, and beast master skills. These skills motivate you to kill wild animals for crafting ammo and there is no shortage of wild animals to kill. One of the most special abilities is the ability to tame animals. Toss a piece of meat as bait and the animal will go for it. While it is distracted, you can sneak up on the animal to tame it and it is suddenly on your side. Taming an animal will lead it to fight on your side against other animals and rival tribes. A tamed beast becomes very useful in some of the story missions and village missions assigned by members of the tribe on its home turf. There are also larger versions of the same beasts that you can tame such as a blood fang sabretooth tiger, a great scar bear, and a bloodtusk mammoth. The mammoths are gigantic elephant-like beasts that deliver a world of pain when battling them.\n\nYou can conquer outposts and bonfires with your tamed beasts. Before intruding, however, you can use an owl to scout the area and tag enemies. With enough skill points, you can send an owl to drop bombs to attack enemies. The owl is like the binoculars in other Far Cry games. Your weapons are primitive ones like clubs, spears, and a bow and arrow. Tossing a spear at an animal or a rival tribe member delivers a satisfyingly gruesome blow. You can ride on some beasts like a sabretooth tiger or mammoth.\n\nBesides the main story missions and village missions, there are regular random side missions requiring you to free a Wenja who is being held captive or freeing animals from their cages. This becomes too repetitive and tedious throughout the game. I eventually stopped pursuing this type of mission after accumulating enough skill points and focused on the remaining story missions and village missions of the game.\n\nThe graphics look quite realistic, as the wild animals look scary when they howl or growl. The northern region looks as cold and snowy as possible. I attained frame rates of 200+ consistently even during tense sequences. My lowest frame rate was around 60 and that was when loading the game or when entering a cinematic sequence.\n\nI think Far Cry Primal is a fun prehistoric game that would be entertaining to those who have played past Far Cry iterations. However, if you strictly like playing with modern weapons like guns, assault rifles, and rocket launcher you may not like this game as much. The story is a bit weak, but Oros is a setting that feels very alive and gamers should try this prehistoric setting.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1583768218, "timestamp_updated": 1583768218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832725822925567627", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74463226": {"recommendationid": "74463226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227555376", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1690767453}, "language": "english", "review": "return to monke", "timestamp_created": 1597679781, "timestamp_updated": 1597679781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 65, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832514047622680664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156977330": {"recommendationid": "156977330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359367843", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1428, "last_played": 1706381824}, "language": "english", "review": "OMG!!!

Instead of towers, there are bonfires; instead of vehicles, there are beasts to ride; instead of guns, there are clubs and bows. It's still very much a Far Cry game, for better or for worse. Some new additions to the formula include an owl that gives you a literal bird's eye view of areas, wild animals to tame and control, and some crafting and base-building mechanics.\n\n[b]The Good[/b]\n1. The graphics. Far Cry Primal is a pretty game. The lighting in particular is fantastic. I have yet to see another game with lighting as beautiful as Primal's. Whether it be the way grass and trees sway in the wind, the way moonlight bleeds through the trees at night, or all of the environmental effects and particles, Primal is definitely a good-looking game. I can't help but take screenshots as I play.\n\n2. The quest structure and general progression. Primal takes a cool approach to giving quests. Throughout the game, you work toward building up your own village. As time goes on, the village gets bigger and bigger, and more quests become available to you. There are main quests, which are given to you by key characters (Urki is my favorite) or are found out in the world. Then there are secondary quests which are given to you by villagers or people in your tribe out in the wilderness. In general, you speak to someone about a quest, they then mark an area for said quest somewhere on your map, you then make your way to said marker, then the quest begins. It may bother some, but I felt it to be more organic than how past games handled things.\n\n3. Crafting and village building. You will collect various animal skins, different kinds of rocks, a plethora of wood, and various other things throughout the world to use in crafting. You can craft new weapons to aid you in combat, or you can use the crafting materials to build new huts for key villagers. New weapons, items, and quests become available to you through crafting things. As your village gets bigger, villagers will begin to collect crafting materials for you, which you can then find at many camps spread throughout the world.\n\n4. Beast taming and hunting. There are many animals in Primal--some friendly and some not. A few among the non-friendly ones include wolves, bears, panthers, and sabretooth tigers. You can toss up some meat near one and make them into your friend. They will aid you in combat and in hunting, and a few of them can even be ridden to make traversal less of a chore. Each tamed beast has its own strength, speed, and other perks. As for friendly animals, those include things like deer, fish, and turtles. You can hunt and skin most animals for their hides or meat.\n\n5. Exploration and collectibles. The world of Primal is big and beautiful. At times I feel it's a bit too big. There are many different kinds of areas: wet grasslands, tall forests, closed-in caves, flowery fields, snowy mountains, fiery ponds, and more. Each has its own secrets to be found and collectibles to collect. There's a real sense of verticality to most of the areas, what with the mountains and hills that dot the landscapes. You eventually get an owl which aids you in exploring the world from a bird's point of view. There's also plenty of collectibles: stones, cave paintings, masks, and more. Honestly, they serve no significant purpose. I'd like to see these kinds of collectibles removed from future Far Cry games or at least be given some greater purpose than a useless collectable.\n\n[b]The Meh[/b]\n1. Caves. There are a dozen or so caves to find and explore. Some are cool, but most were a chore. They're too tight and frustrating.\n\n2. No way to block melee attacks. Considering the game has a greater emphasis on melee attacks, it's surprising to see the lack of any way to block with clubs or spears. Not a deal-breaker by any means, but I would have liked to see some blocking, as melee felt clunky at times.\n\n3. Climbing. I wasn't a big fan of climbing in Far Cry 4, and while it's more thematically appropriate in Primal, I still am not a big fan of it. Climbing isn't fun. It's slow and boring. But hey, it saves time from having to walk around hills and mountains at times. If climbing returns in future games, it'd be nice if it could be faster, or maybe it could be done via a motorized grappling hook.\n\n4. Villagers' teeth. For a game set in 10,000 BC, it was surprising to see how nice and straight villagers' teeth were. This is just a nitpick, but something I noticed.\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\n1. The story. The weakest part of Primal is its story. Whereas Far Cry 3 and 4 both featured interesting villains with their own motivations and ideals, Far Cry Primal falls flat. Instead of having a single villain, Primal offers two other tribes that are fighting for land and resources. There are no real nuances to either groups' motivations, and memorable moments are few and far between. It is very much tribal (perhaps the game should have been called \"Far Cry Tribal\"?). You learn just a little bit about each toward the end, but nothing significant. Primal is a very slow burn kind of game. Stay for the brutal wilderness and the crafting and hunting mechanics, not the story.\n\n2. The map marker isn't accurate. Countless times I would mark a collectable on my map only to find it dozens of feet away from the marker. This is only really an issue if you're aiming for 100% (which I did). It'd be nice to see the marker be more accurate when marking collectibles in future games.\n\n3. Tamed beasts ruin stealth. A few of the tamed beasts will be stealthy with you, but most give out your location pretty quickly. If you're going for a stealthy approach, dismiss your beast beforehand.\n\n4. The world is too big. As someone who dislikes fast travel, I found traversing the world on foot or on beast to be a bit too mundane toward the end of the game. I'd rather see smaller, more richly populated worlds than larger, sparse ones.\n\n5. Issues with quests. There's one hunting quest that is bugged. I spent more time that I am willing to admit trying to get it to work. I got it in the end, but it'd be nice if more major bugs were patched. There's also an issue where I would clean out a camp of enemies, accept a quest nearby, only to return to said camp and see it fully populated again.\n\n6. Recurring issues. Primal has some of the same issues that have plagued the series since 3 and 4. Namely, there are plenty of weird or broken animations. Sometimes I'd jump to a ledge only to fall a bit before the climbing animation kicked in. Sometimes the animation wouldn't be lined-up well with said ledge. Sometimes I'd skin and animal only for the animation not to line up, or for the animal to roll down a hill as the animation played. The same was true for looting enemies. Some of the plant-cutting animations were strange as well, where the animation would play and then the plant would just vanish. More polished animations would be welcomed in future entries.\n\n7. Late-game difficulty. The game became too easy about half-way through. I deliberately went out of my way to avoid getting all of the upgrades, but even so, I had become a master of combat. With the exception of one late-game boss encounter, the general difficulty curve quickly drops off. I'm not sure how this could be fixed, but a more consistent difficulty curve would be nice for later entries. At least there's hardcore mode, which looks pretty cool. I haven't tried that, but I did play in \"expert\" mode without the HUD on. That was fun.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nAll in all, Far Cry Primal is another Far Cry game. Whether that excites or bores you depends on many factors. Primal tries to shake up the formula by adding beast-taming, a greater emphasis on exploration, and crafting mechanics, but it's still a Far Cry game. I had fun, and I recommend the game, but you should know what you're getting yourself into before making a purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1525648934, "timestamp_updated": 1525649439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.831213533878326416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148365346": {"recommendationid": "148365346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035827118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1908, "last_played": 1698196005}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best Far Cry games!\n\nAt launch in 2016, this game received mixed reviews due to widespread performance issues on PC, as well as reusing a gameplay formula too similar to that of Far Cry 4 (e.g. climbing mechanic and ride-able elephants/mammoths). However, as with many games, the benefit of hindsight is powerful. Far Cry 5, New Dawn, and 6, have shown us that each new entry into the Far Cry series is very much an iteration of the previous entry, rather than a large overhaul that many in the audience would like. Far Cry Primal stands out in the stagnating series due to its novel *irony intended* setting (Palaeolithic Europe in 10,000 BC), tight and concise story, fairly sizeable open world, new period specific weapons (spears, clubs and the ol' faithful bow and arrow), and tamable and ride-able animals.\n\nIn a video game series which for the last 10 years has been slowly iterated on, Primal is a fresh *relatively* innovative entry. Coupled with Ubisoft resolving most of the performance issues and bugs, post launch, Primal is a genuinely good entry into the Far Cry series, worthy of a players time. Albeit, avoid purchasing at the regular price on Steam (please purchase during a Steam sale - not because the game is not worth it, but the product is more than 7 years old and people shouldn't have to buy a game at full price after 7 years IMO).\n\nLastly, a note on historical/archaeological accuracy... whilst the game developers have clearly put a lot of research, love and care into the design, aesthetic, world and features. The game is archaeologically inaccurate. However, its not so egregious that you'll encounter Homo sapiens roaming around with pet dinosaurs *but* many of the technologies presented in the game simply did not exist in central Europe 10,000 BC or anywhere in the world at that time. One should consider the game world more of akin to a mash-up between Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and early Neolithic technologies inspired by European and Middle-Eastern archaeological sites.", "timestamp_created": 1697506270, "timestamp_updated": 1697518579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.827188491821289063", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110823663": {"recommendationid": "110823663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198886473579", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1801, "last_played": 1644960853}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\nP.S\nI write review on my own experience", "timestamp_created": 1645619250, "timestamp_updated": 1704793788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825670897960662842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108283314": {"recommendationid": "108283314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413255738", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 18207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8042, "last_played": 1696668032}, "language": "english", "review": "I have never played any of the other Far Cry games, and I randomly decided to buy this game one day when it was on sale for like $7.

The bow and spear is very fun to use, the club is just a standard mele weapon and isn't anything special but overall I enjoyed the combat in this game very much.\n\nThe missions were fun in my opinion, they were captivating enough to keep me interested throughout the game.\nThe side missions are very abundant and I still haven't done them all yet but plan to. \nI also love playing Takkar the Beast Master, riding a sabertooth tiger into battle is so much more fun than driving cars in the previous entries. The hunting in this game is so much more fun than in the previous two games also because you are playing as what is essentialy a glorified Caveman it feels right that you should be naturally good at hunting since that is what they had to do to survive. There are plenty of upgrades for your gear that will have you hunting all different types of animals. There are also the special hunting missions which have you track Boss animals and fight them and afterwards you can tame them and even ride them.\n\nThe world map is very similar to FC4 but I don't see a problem with this at all because the landscape and setting is so much different that it was never at any point noticable but even if it was so what? I love going back in time and adventuring in an area thousands of years before, its great fun honestly. \nOn the technical side of this this game ran at a very smooth 65 + FPS on very high settings and I only noticed it drop below that when using the owl.\n\nOverall I would reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of this series or is new to it, this game offers so much and I wish I gave it a chance earlier but better late than never!

In fact it's Far Cry 4s map remolded and revamped although you literally cannot tell. The map has been altered to be extremely vertical and being as your a neanderthal caveman in 10,000 BC your options are somewhat limited. I would recommend playing the game on survival and turning off all the HUD elements. If you do this it severely limits the types of perks you can get, fast traveling capabilities, all types of indicators, etc. literally leaving just you, your bow/spear and the sounds surrounding you. \n\nIt's very satisfying running around hunting a mammoth or a tiger with nothing but the sounds and markings as your guide. You actually need to listen to your environment. \n\nThe game definitely has its gimmicks like riding around on a tamed Sabertooth Tiger, but I suppose it's all part of the fun if you look past the realistic aspect. \n\nThe world is extremely pretty look at it, is quite large, but can get a bit repetitive in certain areas. \n\nThe story itself is serviceable more than anything. The coolest part about it is that Ubisoft developed a language for our characters and their tribes (which is pretty bad-ass) - not to mention the voice actor Elias Toufexis as our main protagonist, which is always welcomed.  \n\nThere is a lot to do as far as optional quests, missions, collectibles etc. I still didn't finish all of it. If you are gunning for only the main story you could probably do the whole thing in less than 20 hours and upwards of 100 for a 100% completionist.

You play as Takkar, a Wenja (some kind of a tribe) warrior that is trying to conquer the Land of Oros for his people. Conflict starts when Takkar found out that Oros is conquered by Udam (cannibal tribe) in the north and by Izila (Sun worshipper) in the south. Far Cry Primal introduces several new features and an entirely new story 'pattern' compared to its predecessors. You are no longer a badass rambo-like warrior or a teenager stranded in an island or a remote area. The main new feature is the taming capability. Along the journey, Takkar was introduced to his skills as a Beast Master, capable to tame dangerous predators and even ride it after you have reached a certain level. In short, Far Cry Primal is a fresh new idea in the Far Cry series that offers the same gameplay pattern but with new environment, features, and challenges.\n\nFirst off, I'm going to talk about the good things. It still has the same gameplay pattern as other Far Cry series - you still have to conquer 'radio towers' (now called bonfires) and enemy encampments while completing your journey in the main story at the same time. It still have the same epic graphics like Far Cry 4 but the story pattern is completely new. Hunting has become a major element in Far Cry Primal since you have to craft everything instead of purchasing it directly from a store. Takkar also has Assassin's Creeds' Eagle Vision that can track animal tracks, blood scents, and enemy heat signatures. This is vital in helping you hunt for animals, especially rare animals. If you love hunting games, Far Cry Primal might not be as realistic as an actual hunting game but it's satisfying enough for me. You will also progress faster compared to previous Far Cry because you'll get permanent XP boost if you rescued a lot of other Wenja (remember the impromptu events). The combat system is obviously very different, there were no guns yet so you only have clubs, throwing shards, several different 'bombs', bows, and spears. You can't butcher the whole base from afar with a .50 cal sniper rifle again, you have to come up close for most of the combat - even the long bow only give you so much attack distance. Their effort to create their own pre-historic language is also worth mentioning, I always respect game developers that pay a lot of attention to details in their games.\n\nNow, the bad things. The content is a lot less compared to Far Cry 4 in order to make it 'makes sense'. But come on, the throwing shards, grappling hooks, animal taming, animal riding, and a ton of other features already don't make sense in the first place. The 'radio tower' part is also much shorter, you won't need to climb anything. Simply kill several enemies, shoot a fire arrow and boom, you're done. No more parkour-ing to the top of a tall tower. Map is also smaller-ish (I'm no expert in measuring virtual stuff) but it's adequate. They really should have put more features in the game. Now, the story. I somehow feel it's much less engaging and very short. As you see from my gameplay, I finished this game only in 23 hours. That 23 hours already gave me a TON of time to fool around completing the side quests, crafting everything, complete my beast collection, and building my village. IMHO, this is the reason a lot of people harshly dismissed this game as a Far Cry 4 re-skin with less content. The short story, little amount of weapon choice, and the less content disappointed them. The main beast taming feature simply couldn't make it up to the amount of lost content. To make it clear, the specific 'lost content' for me is the long and beautifully written story, fighting arena, flying, lots of weapon choices, engaging story, capability to make choices that will affect the outcome of the story, etc.\n\nBut, I still personally love the Far Cry series. I don't really care much about the less content, it's still 23 hours of fun for me. As I said in my thesis, it's a fresh new idea. An entirely different age, a different combat system, different story 'taste' and basically, as long as it's a Far Cry series, I don't care about the reviews - I want to play it. As an analogy, same thing goes for the PAYDAY 2 DLCs, the weapons may be useless and all but as long as it's something new, I want it, regardless of the mostly negative review. I'm not saying this game is 'bad but buy it', it's good and it's worth it, but don't expect to have the same experience as the previous Far Cry series. If you're looking for a very long gameplay, go for Far Cry 4, but if you don't mind the bad things that I mentioned, this game is heavily recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1464933105, "timestamp_updated": 1464933204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797165811061859131", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54744818": {"recommendationid": "54744818", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960364629", "num_games_owned": 4362, "num_reviews": 294, "playtime_forever": 4412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3869, "last_played": 1685675443}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]Wenja War Party ! [/b][/h1]\n\nSup All ! I in truth don't get why this game is / was disliked so much. I truly love this game and have played through it 3 times now lol I love the crafting and hunting . I love the story and feel of the game. I wanted to wait to add my review till i got the Apex Edition . So .... the Wenja Pack DLC isn't really worth the asking price , so if you can get it on sale i would. (Truth by now they should just add it to the base game for free).\n\nMost of the game is Hunting , Foraging and Base and Takeover of Udam and Izila stuff.  Mixed in with some Wenja Rescues. But its done so well that i don't mind the repetitiveness of it. \n\nIt plays like most Far Cry games and has Set missions and Base take overs . There is no flying ( Not counting Urki lol )  in this one but the Mammoth and Sabertooth tiger riding i dig 100% . Love the Sabertooth more being its your hunting companion as well as your Mount. The graphics are pretty darn good , Bigtime if you use the HD Texture Pack. The controls are the standard FPS and like most FC games . The Landscapes are Lush and Beautiful ! There is a level difficulty and survival mode for those that want a challenge.\n\nI wish Ubisoft would do a Far Cry Primal 2 and add more land , missions and more story and add Co-Op ! So just Primal on a grander scale. Or even embrace the Steam Workshop So we can add and make our own stuff to add. \n\nThe price may be a bit steep by today , but all in all i think its worth it . But if you can snag this Gem on sale or from a 3rd party site cheap i would 100% say \"Buy Mortimer Buy !!!\".", "timestamp_created": 1566459114, "timestamp_updated": 1566532162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.795751035213470459", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144452551": {"recommendationid": "144452551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172083417", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 9191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9191, "last_played": 1575661215}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing.

Good quality chewing gum, but the taste has worn off a long time ago.\n\nIt has all the ingredients you would expect from a Far Cry episode. It looks amazing, you get to hunt, upgrade your weapons, unlock a bunch of nice stuff, free outposts, search for collectibles, kill lots of tribesman, gather plants. All very nice and all.......but....We know all that stuff...ther is no surprise anywhere. It took me about half an hour to \"get\" this game. Half an hour to understand what direction this game would be going.\n\nAt first i was excited to hunt for some prey. I wanted to feel like a stoneage hunter who stalks his prey and outsmart it using the right type of weapon and using the landscape in my advantage........Well....Far Cry gives you a big f#ck you in that regard. Instead of smart A.I. it just gives you numbers.......I mean life is literally everywhere. Walk for one minute and you'll encounter 20 goats, 15 deer, 10 wolves, 6 lions, 3 sabretooth tigers, a bunch of wooly mammoths and some people of friendly and enemy tribes. It does not feel like an actual jungle where the absence of obvious danger makes it all the more exiting. The thought there could be a dangerous animal around the corner is way more scary than being a 100% sure there is a dangerous animal.\n\nThe storyline is thin and characters are not to interesting. The NPC's give you tasks and you will do this tasks. That's about it. They've tried to make the NPC's weird or funny of tough, but you never get a \"relationship\" with them. Thet is no real character development and emotionally I would not give a single f#ck if the NPC would have died horrible deaths.\n\nThe language they speak sounds good and authentic, the voice acting however not always so spot on. For example \"Urki the thinker\" is a somewhat funny guy who does dumb things (won't spoil). But you can clearly hear an american redneck accent in his pronuciation. Maybe Far Cry's creators have done this on purpose to match his stupidity, but it just not works for me.\n\nI have not finished the main story yet and I don't know if I will be finishing it.

Just kidding. Same voice actor, though.[/i]\n\n[h1]We come from a land down Oros! You better run, you better take cover![/h1]\nPrimal takes place in a fictional land called Oros located in... the wiki says Central Europe \u2014 given that there is snow in the north, I'll concede it's probably not in Australia. However, none of these things will stop Takkar and his tribe of the Wenja. \n\nUpon entrance into Oros, Takkar, or rather your embodiment of Takkar discovers that the Wenja occupy a land of two other hostile tribes. The Udam and Izila. More commonly referred to as the Flesh Eaters and Sun Walkers, respectively. \n\nBut, the real question is...\n[h1]Is this really just an expansion of Far Cry 4?[/h1]\nYes and no. It's not quite a full fledged Far Cry, but it's much more than Blood Dragon was as an appendage to Far Cry 3. Whereas Blood Dragon was essentially a satirical retro future nod. Primal could stand on its own, and in fact, does. Despite having, minus the guns, the same exact mechanics from Far Cry 4. With, if I may be so bold, a precursor to the companion system found in Far Cry 5. \n\nGiven the time period, the weapons within this game vary from clubs, spears, bows, slings, traps, among various types of nefarious things inside of clay jars. Such as poison, bees, a beserk drug, as well as the tried and tested fire bomb. However, these weapons alone may not give you the advantage you might think they would. Takkar has the uncanny ability to tame just about any animal. Along with his owl, [strike]Senu[/strike] who can relay positions of enemies as well as drop bombs. Takkar can have animals such as wolves, lions, jaguars, bears, sabretooths as well as the ever present meme-tastic Honey Badger. \n\nEach of these creatures offer slightly different benefits. Typically, things of the same species offer the same thing with the exception of the rare creatures. For instance, Jaguars are small and speedy. They offer much better help when remaining undetected is paramount.  Conversely, bears do the total opposite, audacious and boisterous, bears are capable of aggro-ing enemies and pulling their attention. Giving you time to put the fire out on your arm and pull the arrow out of your chest. Lions are generally somewhere in between these two extremes. Rare versions of these creatures offer other things. For example my rare black lion that I grew rather fondly of throughout my playthrough could auto-detect and tag enemies within a small local area and had a high resistance to fire. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1921041658\n\nAs you build the Wenja tribe, you'll meet lots of wacky characters, some will offer new technology for you to use. Not to mention that as the tribe grows, so to will your resources for crafting weaponry. \n\nAfter the story has resolved, you can start over with survivor mode. A mode that makes everything.. well.. more difficult. No minimap, limited stamina and nighttime is much more dangerous. And tamed beasts permanently die (if killed), where as normally they can be revived with a few red flowers. \n\n[b][i]THE GIST:\nOther than the setting and weaponry. It's largely a proper Far Cry game. You run around and reclaim bonfires and raid outposts. Save Wenja tribe members and take down dangerous animals. But I can't shake the feeling that it somehow feels more special than a normal Far Cry game where it's very much a \u201cfish out of water\u201d situation and somehow this almost completely innocuous and banal person can take down an entire crime syndicate/government essentially by themselves depending which Far Cry you look back on.

It's exceptionally rewarding to see the tangible affects you have on your village and your tribe the more you begin to conquer this world. Primal is an excellent game all round, gameplay, combat, visuals and audio score - wise, however the graphics detail could have been a little bit better on the console version with noticeable draw distance, water and hair detail being particularly lacking for next gen,  but graphics will always be second to gameplay.

I'll start by saying right out the gate that I enjoyed Primal despite its issues, but its issues unfortunately keep it from becoming a full standout in the Far Cry games. At first release, Primal was torn apart by a decent amount of people; its setting and concepts were praised and the graphics were (and still are) considered beautiful, but the gameplay and the repetition received quite a bit of criticism. So, what exactly is Primal?\n\nBasically, it's set in 10,000 BC. You're a hunter-gatherer named Takkar whose tribe, the Wenja, are scattered within the hostile land of Oros and he's tasked with the monumental goal of bringing them all together through finding special characters, completing numerous sidequests, and so on. Accompanying the Wenja are the Izila, masters of fire, and the Udam, brutal neanderthal cannibals. Interestingly, Ubisoft went through the effort of constructing a fictional language for the three tribes, all with different tones and inflections. It's really impressive in that regard.\n\nIt's a Far Cry game so the hallmarks are still there: capturing outposts and bonfires, completing main story missions and sidequests, and using skills gained to upgrade your abilities as well as gathering ingredients across the world to strengthen your weaponry, most of which are melee (clubs, spears) and ranged (bows and the ability to throw your weapons at enemies). Key difference here is that you'll find pretty early on that animals in Primal are much more of a threat to you than the humans are. You don't have a gun anymore to clear out a pack of angry wolves or shotgun down a bear. No, you're... you're stuck with your primitive weaponry, and on the higher difficulties the game can be pretty tough. There are regions of the map that are snowy and involve a cold meter, so that added some extra tension.\n\nTwo mechanic are introduced specifically for Primal: the ability to tame animals and the dangerous nights. Regarding taming, you can start out taming basic animals but with enough skill points you can tame a lot more. You can ride mammoths too. Now, I'd say play your own way here, but just keep in mind that once you've tamed the stronger beasts, you're gonna find your journey in Oros being easier. A LOT easier, in fact. You can dismiss them if they make it too easily, though, and can very much play the game without them. Me, I only tamed the animals for collectible's sake as they count toward the 100%.\n\nSecondly, nights are a lot more dangerous. More predators come out, you can't see as well, and you end up needing to get to a safe space or use fire to scare away said predators. It's freaky.\n\nStealth is an element of the game I've praised in 3 and 4, and it's no different here. In fact, it's almost MORE rewarding here because it gets tough clearing out hordes of enemies. Of course, this leads to the first issue of the game, and it's in part why I ended up enjoying the stealth much more: the combat is kind of lackluster, melee-wise. With regards to the bow and to the extent the spear, the ranged combat is what you'd come to expect when you use the bow in the other games, but the melee combat is seriously barebones.\n\nWhen you're equipped with the club, you've got two options: throw it at the enemy, or hit them. Right, obviously. Except... hitting enemies just doesn't feel good. You literally just run up to them and hit them, that's it. It's basic as hell. Don't get me wrong, when things go awry I don't have a terrible time because sometimes I get to pull out my trusty spear and toss it into the chest of an enemy and send them flying, or throw a giant club at them and knock them out. It's just that it's not really engaging.\n\nAnd that's the problem, because the game is also really repetitive. For me, the repetition is fine because fundamentally I'm a completionist. I could have about a hundred collectibles to collect (and believe me, there are a lot here) and all of the side missions to do, and I'd be fine. It's just... the combat isn't all that engaging, and so you FEEL the repetition a lot more here than I think you'd feel it in the other games. When you're in the open world, you're being constantly bombarded with animals and humans. The whole goddamn map is out to get you, so it's not like you have many opportunities to avoid combat unless you just run away all the time.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that the game is too bright, and that's partly because there are NO weather effects whatsoever. I'm a little baffled by this, and it does make the game hurt my eyes, but I digress.\n\nOne thing that should ABSOLUTELY be mentioned for those interested in any kind of comprehensive survival mechanics is that the game includes Survivor Mode, complete with achievements involving it. Survivor Mode changes the game in different ways: removes your minimap, has you using resources and stamina to fast travel, stamina meter, tamed companions can't be revived, etc. It has a Permadeath option and an achievement that involves beating the game in Survivor mode with EXPERT DIFFICULTY & PERMADEATH ON. Yikes. Good luck!\n\nOverall, not a bad game. Not a GREAT one either, but it's not bad, and it's stupid caveman fun at the end of the day.

The Stone Age is a good addition to the Far Cry series with something new in every game. The franchise made a great improvement to the crafting system and weapon stats. This is exactly what the previous games needed. Overall, I enjoyed Primal a lot more than any of the previous games (besides Far Cry 1 and 2) because Primal didn't feel like a chore to complete. The daily resource system is a huge improvement because you don't feel obligated to collect every single loot sack around the map; thus eliminating a useless scavenger hunt for items you don't need. Although the map is recycled from Far Cry 4, you hardly notice it at all because the environment is much different.\n\nThe taming system for your animal companions is a great addition to the game. Each beast has different stats depending on your style of play, although, some beasts are not entirely useful as the more elite predators. The scenery is gorgeous and caves are fun to explore. You get to play with fire and feel more primitive with the type of weapons you use. Collectibles are more unique and side quests are more enjoyable and not as repetitive like Far Cry 3 and 4. The side quests may not be 100% unique, but it's a better approach from Ubisoft.\n\nThe game is short, which I like because Far Cry 3 and 4 took a lot of time to finish entirely. My only con with Primal is that the story is not as good as the previous games imo. This time you face two antagonists, but the story is simple for a 10,000 BC style game which is to be expected. \"Kill and Conquer\" pretty much sums up Far Cry Primal. \n\nFar Cry Primal is a lot of fun and draws you in a lot more than where some of the previous tittles in the franchise failed to reach more playability.

Far Cry Primal is a copy and pasted Far Cry 4, some things have changed, but it's not enough to be worth the price it's being currently sold at. Being set in the stone age, the weapons that you have are vastly different and more primative from the other games in the series (obviously), but there is nothing good about this, the bows I found were too weak to be useful, I ended up throwing spears instead, and the melee weapons (there are 3, club two handed club, and spear) felt dreadful. The melee combat had not been developed at all since the past games, which isn't a good idea because in the other games you do not rely so heavily on using melee. On the standard mode, normal, this game was way too easy, I rarely used the owl to scout when I discovered I could simply charge in with a spear and spam left click.\n\nThe only language spoken in the game is a mix of made up words with a Proto-Indo-European structure, this was an issue as it meant that it was near impossible to have a real connection with any of the characters, by the end of the game I could remember basically only the main characters name as the other characters didn't mean much to me, their stories felt pointless and were there just to make the game time longer. I didn't feel like I was doing anything for a reason, I'd go to a place and kill some people and burn some stuff, with no real care as to why.

Tribes fight for survival against cannibalistic clans on the dirt roads, while saber-toothed tigers, cave lions, mammoths and grizzly bears threaten the inhabitants in the dense forests of [i]Oros.[/i]\n\nThe prehistoric experience is enhanced by characters and dialogues built in a period language, indecipherable today. The feeling of being present in a world without rules is enhanced when Takkar, the protagonist of the journey, is thrown into Oros to improve his war tools and do whatever he wants.\n\nUnlike the other games in the franchise, Far Cry Primal doesn't go deep into the narrative. The title goes straight to the point and leaves us free in the middle of the jungle. The premise is simple \u2013 Takkar must recruit new fighters to strengthen the army of Wenjas, whose objective is to exterminate the leaders of the rival tribes Udam and Izila.\n\n[b]Although the campaign is consistent, composed of memorable scenes, the same cannot be said of the villains, who add little to the overall context of the plot. An antagonist with personality is really lacking in Far Cry Primal, like Vaas Montenegro and Pagan Min's impeccable performances in Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4.[/b]\n\nThe dialogues, perfectly adapted to our language, are brief and direct, as the game wants you to discover the secrets at the base of exploration. However, exploring is not so simple, as Oros is a dynamic world where things happen all around you all the time. Animals hunt their prey, cannibals commit mass slaughter for a mere piece of meat, and enigmatic events mystify tundras and caves.\n\nFar Cry Primal's map is relatively large, but smaller compared to Far Cry 4, for example. That's because most of the time it will be necessary to walk to complete the dozens of missions and side activities that take place in real time. While it is possible to ride animals later in the story, walking is the best way to explore and gather raw materials.\nEven with the radical thematic shift, from the Himalayas of Far Cry 4 to the Stone Age, Primal keeps the essence of the Far Cry series intact. Make no mistake, you'll still need to take over enemy outposts and take over pyres \u2013 which replace the communication towers from previous games \u2013 to unlock new fast travel points.\n\nSkinning animals also remains a necessity, the system for crafting weapons and items is much more robust in this version. Takkar must craft bows, clubs, spears, and bee bombs out of his own collected materials, meaning no weaponry is purchased or granted free of charge.\nThe downside is that there are few weapon options to be crafted through the crafting system. Combat, at times, seems to be limited by the limited variety of weapons available, and makes it necessary to act most of the time with the same arsenal.\nPrimal is, above all, a survival game. If the player kills an enemy with a spear or arrow, for example, it will be necessary to look for the accessory in the body of the downed opponent so as not to waste ammo.\nAre you feeling cold? So seek shelter and build a fire to keep warm. Got injured during a head-on clash with rival tribes and don't have raw meat to restore your health meter? Go hunting. Survival will depend solely on the ability to hunt effectively and manage resources.\n\nThe beast taming system is Far Cry Primal's most notable change. There are dozens of tameable animals between canines, felines and predators, which can be used as battle partners and means of transport. The functionality of turning animals into allies manages to renew the combat mechanics shaped since Far Cry 2, which guarantees an extra layer of complexity to the gameplay.\nIn the best Pok\u00e9mon style, Takkar is able to use the beast to fight specific animals and warriors from unique attack commands, but first he needs to make the animal docile with the help of supernatural powers learned from the Master of Beasts. If your pet dies, you can heal it with meat or revive it at any time via the menu.\n\n[b]Another welcome addition is the village building feature. Wenja village serves as a safe haven for tribe members. In view of this, Takkar must fortify the hollows to unlock new abilities and weapons. The same materials for creating weapons are used to make new hollows, but the dwellings consume much more raw material.[/b]\n\nDue to its dynamic climate, the Land of Oros raises the challenge of wild creatures when the sun goes down. The dangers of the night period test every player's survival skills as visibility is low and there are more predators hunting.\nThe feeling of fragility at night is intense and desperate, as you have to set fire to weapons at all times to be able to see. The problem is that each time a torch is used, a unit of animal fat is consumed, that is, there is always the risk of running out of light in the middle of the dense forest.\nPrimal was designed with the same engine as Far Cry 4, but the new game's look is much more inviting. It's impossible not to be surprised and jaw-dropped at the incredible level of detail in the dense vegetation that surrounds the open world of Oros. Tundras, rocky mountains and forests form the ecosystem of Far Cry Primal.\n\nSurprisingly, the fauna and flora of the prehistoric adventure do not use the base formed in Far Cry 3, quite the opposite. Here we have new plants, trees and creatures meticulously planned to be part of a unique universe.\n\nNot afraid to dare, Far Cry Primal reinvents concepts established by its predecessors to deliver an open-world adventure with a focus on survival. The game just hits everything it sets out to, even with the shallow and predictable story. Ubisoft proves that the franchise formula is still capable of adapting to any environment, whether in the Himalayan mountains or in primeval forests.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n-Incredibly detailed

So it's finally time to go over this game! This game is by far, the BEST Far Cry game I have ever played. This was one of the first steam games I got, it was also my first Far Cry game that I played, and it really got me into the other games. So let's get into the actual game! First, the concept of the game: the game taking place in 10,000 BC makes this game extraordinary by itself already since it's so different from all the other Far Cry games in the franchise. The natural environments are astonishing with stunning graphics along with the wildlife made it feel more special in itself. The characters are unique with their own stories, skills that they teach you, and tons of items to craft. Above all the story is phenomenal! It really captures the brutality of the stone age, and it's so interesting to see what life would be like in the prehistoric era. The journey in this game is truly amazing and words can't describe how awesome this game is I love it to bits, and it really doesn't get enough love. While writing this I haven't beaten Permadeath YET, but I intend to 100% this game.

It's still a FPS, Stealth open-world game in its core; with added features of Survival, Melee combat, Animal Taming and much more.\n\nThe most immersive, tense and unforgiving entry in the series since Far Cry 2. You're no longer an overpowered \"hero\" but a mere human fighting for survival in nature. Exotic beasts and apex predators are roaming around the world, you must use your wits and skills to make the most out of whatever the world throws at you.\n\nSpeaking of world, this is one of the most beautiful Jungle environments I've ever experienced in a game. I often found myself lost in awe of breathtaking vistas, from tall redwood forests in the west to the snowy canyons in the northern mountains, to an underwater cave here, to a grand waterfall over there. No matter where you go, the beauty of Oros will never fail to catch your attention.\n\nIf you enjoyed any of the previous Far Cry games, if you enjoy immersive digital adventures, heck, if you just like games in general, you'll love Far Cry Primal.

I'd like to point out that this wasn't supposed to be a direct copy of the other Far Cry games, whilst still being a Far Cry game. However out of all the reviews I see, these 'experts' are playing the game on normal and complaining about it being 'too easy'. I'm running around on expert mode having the time of my life and feeling some very REAL fear when confronted by a Sabretooth. A big part of Far Cry is immersion. Game is too easy? Up the difficulty. It's not neuroscience. If you're not feeling hunted when you're running around at night, you're not playing on a hard enough difficulty. Don't give a bad review because you didn't decide to challenge yourself. \n\n2) People keep complaining that the melee system is flawed. Why? Because there aren't brutal melee finishers for every weapon? Last time I checked if you got into a brawl with 3 guys with a club it's not going to be a moment of finesse. It's gonna be a moment of blind rage-induced swinging hoping to hit their faces. The same is true for the spear. If I stab someone in the face or the throat it counts as a 'headshot' and is an instant fatality. That is the sort of accuracy of a spear. You're trying to tell me we should be able to swing it around like a quarterstaff? Far Cry isn't known for prompted cinematic kill moves other than silent melee kills with most weapons. Why did you expect anything other than the very basic idea of an amateur swinging a stick? You're a caveman. Not a professional assassin. \n\n3) Complaining about the fact that they went through the trouble to include genuine proto-european dialect, or that the game is too short. I reiterate, a big part of Far Cry is immersion. If you're not paying attention to the script, the emotion in their voices, or the storyline, and then you complain about not enjoying it, it doesn't sound like a problem with the game. That sounds like a problem with you paying attention. When it comes to timeframe, I'm 33.3 hrs into the game right now, and due to difficulty level (died probably 14 times trying to kill Dah) and how I genuinely enjoy hunting in this game, I've got plenty of collectibles and side quests left, and several story and character missions. \n\nAll in all, I'm not trying to bash anyone for their review because everyone has their own opinion. However I felt that this game was very harshly judged and mostly so because of the preceding games. People either expected something completely different or relatively the same. The weird balance in between seems to have some people upset, but did any of you really expect Far Cry to evolve as a series without some trail and error? Considering this is their first foray into any other era than modern, I'd say they did pretty damn good. \n\n8/10 For a decent story about the brutality of this time period.\n9/10 For appearances, the game is just plain pretty on high settings! Spent probably over an hour of gameplay just admiring certain views!\n9/10 for performance.
