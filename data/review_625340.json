The game takes place in a world ravaged by a deadly virus that has transformed the majority of the population into mindless mutants. The game presents players with an interesting and engaging storyline that provides a good framework for the gameplay.\n\nHowever, despite the potential, the execution falls short in several areas. The game suffers from numerous technical issues such as bugs and glitches. The game's graphics and sound effects also leave a lot to be desired, with the overall quality feeling like something out of a game from a decade ago. The lack of diversity in enemy types and the limited number of weapons available also detracts from the overall experience. One of the biggest issues with the game is its lack of content and replayability. The game can feel repetitive after a few hours, with the same objectives and enemies appearing in almost every level. There is also a lack of variety in the environment, which can make the game feel monotonous.\n\nDespite these criticisms, it's important to remember that XERA: Survival is a one-person project. The developer has created a game that has a lot of potential and ambition, but the limitations of working alone are evident. The fact that a single person was able to develop a game of this scope is impressive, and it's worth supporting indie developers who take on such daunting tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, XERA: Survival is a game that has a lot of flaws and limitations. However, it's also a game that has potential and is worth playing if you can look past its shortcomings. The game's one-person development team deserves recognition for their efforts and creativity, and supporting indie developers is always a worthy endeavor.

However, after wandering around for a couple hours and exploring the map, there [i]really[/i] isn't much to do.\n\nThe towns are empty.\nThe majority of buildings that you'd want to get into to setup a nice ambush or have a vantage point are inaccessible.\nThe buildings that you can get into such as houses are bare and empty with a bag of chips in the corner or a can of soda upstairs in the closet.\nThe main city is generic with absolutely no reason to go there. No loot worth mentioning, minimal AI, no players.\nDon't curse. Seriously. My buddy called me a cunt in chat and was instantly banned.\nThe ATV, the only vehicle in the game is buggy.\n[list] \n[*]Stuck on a pebble? Can't get out.\n[*]Hit a hescos near the roadblock?

Too bad since the ATV has a mind of its own and will only go 2.5mph resulting in the initial confusion getting you killed and teabagged.\n[/list]\n\nPlayer interaction i.e. pvp is regulated to around safe zones or at the airport and/or military base. Only areas worth looting are airport and military (with an occasional visit to the roadblocks). Compound \"event\" is pointless since the moment the fist turns red (indicating someone is there and it is in progress) you will have multiple people whether teamed or solo camp outside on the hills until you are finished looting to murder your face the moment you step outside and turn the area into a mini battle royal while everyone scrambles to get to your corpse. (No joke the first time this happened, the sheer volume of rounds hitting my ragdolling corpse from every direction made me think of murphys execution scene from the original Robocop)\n\nAirdrops are an interesting addition. Usually results in players setting up an ambush point near a dropped crate and raping your face as you wait the ten seconds to open it. (I did it too. Its easy loot.)\n\nI had a run in with what I thought was a cheater. Teleporting around to better flanking positions, getting the drop on me from the complete opposite direction from which I initially engaged him/her. Turns out it wasn't a cheater but the developer himself [b]*drum roll*[/b] JOSHUA.\nThis person is quite full of himself with an arrogant attitude. When called out on it, he denied everything and told me I quote \"if you don't like it refund the game\" then proceeded to spam \"LUL\" to my further complaints. I'm actually surprised I wasn't banned.\n\nI know its early access and the general issues I currently have with the game will be worked on in the near future(will it?). But after my experience with the lead honcho himself, I highly doubt this game will progress far. Infestation: Survivor Stories is a polished masterpiece compared to this steaming pile of shit. (This is the only \"praise\" you'll ever get from me Sergei. Fuck you Artemis. Kill yourself)\n\n[b]To anyone who sees this review, I highly recommend you stay away from this game. Purchasing this game is a crime against humanity and you deserve to be shot if you do so.[/b]\n\n[b]*Edit 20190605*[/b]\n\nHey look, a developer response!\n\nSigh. JOSHUA... JOSHUA... Oh JOSHUA...\n\nAt the very least spend a few minutes writing an actual response instead of lazily ctrl+a, ctrl+c and ctrl+v-ing. \n\nI didn't say \"you wanted to kill me so that you can say you killed a dev.\" To those reading, scroll up to where I said \"I'm actually surprised I wasn't banned.\" That is due to me stringing and combining a multitude of obscenities that would've made Clint Eastwood blush and ask me out to dinner. I guess there is something positive to say about you, JOSHUA.\n\nHowever, since i'm bothering with editing a posted review, I might as well add a bit more information to help my fellow gamers not be lead astray.

The combat isn't horrible, actually it is quite good (considering it is still in early access). There isn't bullet drop but there is damage drop off (newly added). Recoil is there but it's currently bugged (tied to FPS).\nThere are some bugs; FPS drop removes/decreases recoil, the ATV will bug out quite often (move slow, unable to get out if stuck on a rock, etc), there are also some bugs with items such as logging with attachments on weapons will still be attached but not actually on the weapon and issues with the heli and items.\n\nThe really bad part about this game, and my experience with it is the Dev team (specifically Joshua, the creator). While playing in a game on the live server, I saw someone standing still and shot and killed them (as everyone would). Then I got killed by JOSHUA who then looted my body and his friends body (presumably a dev). However, after dying my teammate engaged Joshua pushing him back to a tree where Joshua then teleported away. I confronted him in game text chat, where Joshua tried to deny it, but then confessed to teleporting. I expressed my disconcern for the game due to his actions, he then tried to defend his actions saying he teleported away to test a rock glitch. He got upset and left the server, said I can go ahead and request a refund and that he didn't care. While I felt, before this event, that the game had huge hopes and was a ton of fun to play, the actions of the creator and development team is super disconcerning. If the creator of the game cares so little that he is willing to cheat and doesn't care about it, on public servers, rather then \"testing bugs\" on a private server. Makes you wonder if he really cares about the game and it's future, or if he even cares about other people cheating (which I have recorded and sent to their dev team). \n\nNeedless to say, I would not recommend this game and I would even suggest that steam consider reviewing the publisher and consider removing them from steam, I think that this game will die and become a major out-cry for people who buy it thinking that the game has hopes, when in truth the game will probably die due to the creator not caring anymore. And steam will get flooded with requests for refunds.\n\nI do hate to give this game a bad review, I love playing it and I thought that the dev team being involved with the players could make the game a huge success, but my interaction with Joshua forces me to think otherwise.\n\n\n--\\\\\\-- UPDATE --\\\\\\--\n\nWhile I have tried to play for awhile after my first review, trying to help with the community the game rather then the crappy developer. IcedYoshi asked me to do another review of the game since, as the community manager and from what it appears, the only sensible person on the... development team? not sure what to call them since Joshua has said on many occasions that he is the ONLY developer.\n\nI would say, in the last 3 months the game has made progress in a lot of horrible ways. First was the attempt at implementing a recoil system which caused a lot of players to quit, then they took it away and it made things worse. In total they haven't figured out the gun play for this game at all and have just screwed it up completely now. \nYou can tell by how they just throw \"Patches\" or updates out to try and fix things, but they never actually test it. It probably doesn't help that the only developer cheats when he plays so he never gets into true combat to understand how his \"fix\" is really breaking the game.\n\nIn the last 3 months, the game community has almost all but quit playing, which is totally understandable. In three months, millions of dollars, this game has added weapon skins and a couple of events... no real content. Where are the new maps? new weapons? the missions or tasks? There isn't anything that really pulls you into this game, aside from watching the ONLY developer cheat in his own game and then lie about it. \n\nOVERALL: Thumbs Down! 100%, The current route the game is going and the actions and response of the \"ONLY\" developer (and his team) are not conductive to an enjoyable game. I suggest you avoid this and that steam cuts this publisher off.\n\nAdditional update: Now that the developer (Joshua) has changed his response again, lying about what happened I feel that it goes to show how this 'team' feels about the development of this game. I would remind Joshua that no abusive messages were written in the in-game chat by myself. In truth, we did not know that they were admins as there is no way to tell until you confirmed it in chat and teleporting away from a fight after looting a player that you killed because you had god mode on is cheating in just about every sense of the word. Which, by the way, is in violation of the Value developer community terms of use regarding Conduct on the sites as this would be classed as a \"functionality that may give a player an unfair competitive advantage when playing multiplayer\".\nHonestly, Valve should remove this developer and ban their company from using their product(s).", "timestamp_created": 1559697341, "timestamp_updated": 1606103503, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 206, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815709471702575684", "comment_count": 44, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1590919413, "developer_response": "Hi there!\n\nThanks for posting a review, we accept all criticism.\n\nI use teleport tools to get around the map quicker to check for bugs and other issues.

Guns are easy to find which I enjoy, attachments work and are very plentiful as well. \n\nTHE MAP\nThe map is huge which in some cases is good but it makes playing very boring and lonely. Pvp interaction is pretty rare even on a full pop server. Most of the cities have copied and pasted buildings and contain very little loot making going there an extreme waste of time.\n\nTHE AI\nProps to them for not using zombies and having their own unique thing, but there is very little Ai interaction adding on to the loneliness of the game.\nI didn't even know there were any other A.I other than robots until I was looting and heard gunshots coming from a \"bandit\" that seemed to be the only thing that was in the city.\n\nBASE BUILDING\nAfter rounding up a couple of tools that seemed to be needed for a proper base build I decided to try it out. I feel like this could be easily fixed but WHY is it so hard to find a spot to build a base. Not even kidding I spent almost an hour running around the map trying to find an area to build.\n-\n When I finally found a decent spot to build i placed down the flag thing and got to building. I personally dont really mind the building and individually placing down each base frame but I feel it requires so much grinding to get even a simple 1x1 set up. Traps and Turrets are very cool addition either buying or finding the parts to craft one. Overall its very easy to understand but just really inconvenient in some cases.\n\nEVENTS \nI like the constant events going around the map like Airdrops and Helicopter crashes. It really spices things up and gives the player something to do other than just looting and killing other people. These events provide very good loot and gives a very big challenge to people.\n\n\nOverall id give this game a 6/10 its not the best, but its not the worst either. Fun game to hop on if you are looking for an arcade looter shooter similar to H1Z1 Just Survive (games a mix of Dayz and Rust)\n\nThis is my first real review on a game so if there is anything I could improve please leave a comment.", "timestamp_created": 1635130475, "timestamp_updated": 1635130475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800557553768157959", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100061871": {"recommendationid": "100061871", "author": {"steamid": "76561199084411073", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 909, "last_played": 1664640357}, "language": "english", "review": "its like a free version of rust", "timestamp_created": 1632783482, "timestamp_updated": 1632783482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.775352358818054199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101322675": {"recommendationid": "101322675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180171225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 54241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10468, "last_played": 1703026022}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is super fun if you like dying to people with silent snipers, or being pinched from behind. \nIf you enjoy raiding bases then I recommend this game for sure, just make sure you get LOTS of friends to come raid with you so they can soak the dozens of turrets that will shoot thousands of bullets at you before running out of ammo.\nIf you enjoy getting ran over by cars that are invisible then you will like this game.\nIf you like not being able to hear anything other than the music that you can't turn off every time you enter a city then you will for sure like this game.\nIf you enjoy running out of thirst because you decided to jump a few times for the last 30 seconds you will like this game.\nIf you like pvping from long range and love when your weapons deal much less damage when you are far away and anyone can outheal it then you will like this game. \nIf you like running around trying to find a spot to place a land claim for hours on end on any of your high pop region servers then you will enjoy this game.\nIf you like driving around in a full health car and having a player come out from behind a tree to shoot your car and instantly blow you up you will for sure like this game.\nIf you enjoy numerous building and raiding glitches that are severely exploitable then you will love this game.\nIf you like a designated area where most of the people on the server go to pvp, then you will love this game.

I love the aspects of the games and how they're meant to work, but when those aspects become meaningless because of loophole finding, cheating players it really makes the game unplayable. For example, I joined a server that I had never joined before with a friend of mine, we searched for hours after finding good equipment to place our land claim and start a base of operations for our ever increasing squad numbers. WE COULD NOT FIND A SINGLE SPOT TO PUT DOWN A LAND CLAIM. I am usually a nice and friendly person, but when players abuse game aspects it pisses me off, I believe this should be a HIGH PRIORITY for the game dev's and that they should put everything else to the side until this annoyance is dealt with. Another problem is hacking and toxicity, when players have the ability to shoot you from across the map and then that singular shot insta-kills you, I believe that that is considered a major problem. I have less problems with hacking than I do with manipulation of game rules though, game dev's if you see this PLEASE fix the land claim issue as soon as possible, otherwise this game is unplayable and I will uninstall and leave another review telling players that issues can't be worked out well.\n\nWith Swell Wishes,\nPaul (EvTreeXIVIX)", "timestamp_created": 1633383732, "timestamp_updated": 1633383732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732559740543365479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50893989": {"recommendationid": "50893989", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991317687", "num_games_owned": 598, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1559083553}, "language": "english", "review": "warz at home", "timestamp_created": 1558985428, "timestamp_updated": 1659112220, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.72406005859375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100516420": {"recommendationid": "100516420", "author": {"steamid": "76561199188613002", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 372, "last_played": 1633297086}, "language": "english", "review": "PLEASE OMG PLEASE REMOVE LANDCLAIMS ITS  SOOOO FRUSTRATING> we have to walk and travel miles and MILES to find a little bit of land to claim then we are raided asap.\nit is so easy to get turned off especially for new players, we cant even build a home.\ntake a note from RUST its exciting for its raids and battles, why don't they have land claim ?

Annoying. Its a truly unfortunate review, because its so close to being good.\n\nMost of the stuff i take issue with could just be tweaked, major changes are not needed.\n\nThe Gunplay - Honestly, the best part of this. Though most guns kick too much to use in first person, they work pretty good in third person. The most annoying part of the weaponry is the durability. You can run three or four mags through an ar-15 and nearly be done with the thing, even coming at 75% dura. There is a repair system, and a nearly useless weapon level system, but finding a new weapon is much easier than finding the tools and materials to repair a weapon that does 0.2% more damage. \n\nThe looting - Dear god the looting, tedium at its finest. Most of it is holding e to search crates, and getting the notification its empty. When you do find something, its never exciting. Even looting through military locations, half the crates have a single screwdriver, or wrench, or other redundant tool/mele weapon. When its not loot you already have, or a single water bottle, you might get lucky enough to get a few bullets or a gun, not like those bullets are going to last you long.\n\n\nThe Enemies - The most annoying part, Dayz syndrome at its finest. The most basic enemy taking 5-7 bullets to take down. You could always use mele, but there isnt a reliable way to avoid damage when doing this. The enemies are somewhat unique, Robots that take more damage when you shoot them in the glowing core, right in the middle of their chest. Coming in three glitchy variants. \nRed - The most basic, found everywhere across the map. Taken down with relative ease, and not dealing that much damage. Though when i say \"ease\" I do mean dumping 10 bullets into their chest and hoping that their jagged, super fast movements didn't bob their core too much.\nBlue - What usually would be called the Hunters, or something of the sort. Higher health, much higher damage, spawns only at night (and certain monuments) and barely gets staggered. These things can take nearly a 30 round mag of 9mm right to their core all the while charging you down. \nGreen - The tank. And the most annoying of all. These things are truly tanks, Mega high health, Mega high damage, and an armored exterior protecting their cores. There is no way to solo these things without glitching them. No matter the armor your wearing, they WILL three shot you. They will run just as fast as all the other bots, taking fire from 2-3 people, and NEVER STOP. they will never get staggered, never slow down. The only true thing to fear in this game.\n\nQ : So, how do you deal with these bots? \nA : well, it seems as if the Blue and Green droids cant open doors, so if your looting higher teir areas, most places with doors are safe havens. \nQ : Well okay, but what if i want to kill them? Bring ammo. You think you have enough? Wrong. These things take MAGS of ammo to take down, especially if you want to kill the tanks. \nQ : Well okay, I have ammo, what now? G L I T C H E S. DO NOT take these droids on fairly. Trap them behind doors, exploit their AI so they cant hit you on a table, keep shooting them so they loop in the same spot when they cant reach you. This is true TENFOLD for the tanks. They will kill you in moments, you cant stagger them, and you run slower than them with your guns out. \n\nSo, what do i suggest? well, \n- Increase weapon damage/Decrease droid health. Pvp felt alright in regards with weapon damage, just the droids are annoying.\n- Change looting a bit, either decrease the amount of item crates, or make it so that things actually spawn in the crates. And change looting tables a bit. I don't want to be finding metal pipes in a gun crate, and guns in a materials warehouse.\n- Update the enemies, i'm talking new animations, new path finding, generally a new polish. With the way they move, Its hard to hit them most of the time. Mainly attributed to the fact they don't have a turning animation. All they do is kind of magically pop over to where they need to look, and for movement all they really have is a basic walking animation, and a basic running/angered animation. But even when they have spotted you the most they can do now is walk at you in a straight line and try and \"hit\" you with a janky animation. Its not clear whether they can actually hit you from where your standing, if you can strafe them, or if its always going to hit. There should also be something more unique to the enemies, I've got a few basic ideas.\n\n- the cores instead of headshots is an interesting idea, although it doesn't seem like enough. Maybe instead of just dealing more damage, make it so its an insta kill, but higher tier areas add on layers of armor. You could even counteract this by adding in armor piercing ammunition for the richer players. And for tanks, they already have multiple cores. Slow them down a bit, add in a few extra moves, maybe ranged, and make it so you must shoot out all the cores to kill them. \n\n- You could lean into the robot idea a bit more, Shoot off limbs to cripple them, then move in for the kill. Make different weapons more effective for this. For example, the shotgun isnt great as it is... But if it has the potential to blow off an arm or leg in one shot? Well now, that's great! take an axe to the knee? Maybe it wont chop off a solid steel leg, but it can damage it! Slow robots down to make it easier to kill them. you can go pretty far with this.\n\n- make these things DANGEROUS. Decrease spawns, but make it so any one of these things could kill you. The most basic enemy as it is, well you can just punch it out with your flimsy little flesh arms. These things could be the killing machines they're made out to be, and if you dont come prepared, and shoot accurately, your completely done for.\n\n- Lean heavier on the stealth end, maybe the front end is tankier, but the back has a large core that will stun or kill them. or sneaking up to them with an axe, or a new specialized hacking device is an insta kill. you can even go so far as to add a reverse targeting device. Use that tank to clear out the rest of the monument, or DESTROY YOUR ENEMIES!  \n\nTheres so many things that this game can do to make it great, but its just uninspired. Basic. Tired and done before.\nBut it is playable. Passable for a free game.

One of the biggest issues I have is that it is exceedingly difficult to get anything better than a UMP-9 or a MP5 once you manage to get something like a G36 or one of the 2 types of scars you will get killed by someone with thousands of hours and they'll take everything you own, and your dignity. It has AI in the form of purely melee only robots who you can outrun with ease and cheese them with a buggy so they can't hit you, and it has \"bandits\" that are not worth the trouble finding or doing a Reactor Core event for unless you have a mission to kill them. The game-play is very linear in it's progression until you need to find any of the USBs needed to progress further. The Civilian Bunker Data USB is impossible to find from helicopter crashes (which is the only place I managed to find it) and only gives you access to a bunker that gives higher tier weapons, of which you will definitely lose instantly. The other 3 USB sticks are for one thing called the Crater that give next to nothing unless you get a level 3 access to mine Xoidite-H ore to make the only explosive in the game that does any noticeable damage to structures and even if you get it, it is confined to one server so you can only raid on one server. That's ONLY if you manage to find ANY of the Crater USBs. The only real way to get any of the USBs for the Crater is to buy them from the Survivor Exchange (a player driven economy where people can buy items and sell what they find) for exorbitant prices that are unachievable for the average player. That's only the start, farming for a base is VERY tedious and getting a wood base is easy enough, but getting anything more than that, like a stone or metal base, you have to farm for hours. The only stone/metal/sulfur/copper/silver/gold mining tool is a pickaxe (besides the wood and stone variants) that can be a ground pickup or be found in a box. The servers pretty much wipe once a year, so good luck against all the other multi-thousand hour players who have no life and have had months and months to build up and get gear. Raiding is damn near impossible as I hinted at earlier in the review, with a very limited selection to raid with including Xoidite Explosive Charges, C4, and grenades. Doing 500, 150, and 25 damage respectively with a basic wood wall having 500 health you can see the difficulty in raiding. One of the only good aspects are the 3 modes of transportation, a non-controllable helicopter that travels between the Settlements, a one seater ATV, and a 3 seater buggy. One of the main problems that are stated in other reviews is the extremely low playerbase so i won't go into too much detail on that. \n\nTLDR:\n\nDon't bother unless you have 5 friends to play with.", "timestamp_created": 1691309426, "timestamp_updated": 1691309426, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661682069301605225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102730322": {"recommendationid": "102730322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268930801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5454, "last_played": 1682094942}, "language": "english", "review": "Have big problem with cheathers.

There is a fantastic discord setup with a suggestion channel which shows that they care about the community and their ideas; many of these suggestions have already been implemented in the game!\n\nThe PvP side of this game is addictive as the movement, hit reg, weapons and healing is 10/10 with each weapon being well balanced. This helps to provide some fast paced and intense action followed by relief when you finally get that loot safely stored away. Also cheaters are next to non existent with regular scans and a high end detection system blocking all cheats within 24hrs; i know this is a big issue in other games and can kill the fun in PvP.\nPvE has an important place in this game also as the environment is beautiful and well optimized, allowing you to play in high settings with good fps and creating fantastic opportunities for some great photos. Tip: use a drone, go first person and hide HUD.\nNew events are regularly being added and the map has had some rework to enable players to constantly be in action and make the game enjoyable. ATVs have improved in a HUGE way which is something other games have failed to do, the vehicles can cause multiple issues and perfecting them shows the true hard work and dedication from developers.\n\nThere is already HUGE hype building around this game with talks of base building around the corner and more customization options for your character and their outfit.

Apparently it is possible to clear the pincodes of enemy player's base doors and windows. This renders the game unplayeable, since enemies can walk into your base and take all your grinding profits. The devs dont seem very interested in looking into this, despite multiple players reporting this issue. I uninstalled the game for now, will be back if this issue is completely fixed. \n\nUPDATE END, original positive review below:\n\nNice survival grinding game with the typical friendly, helpful and toxic players in appropriate proportions. The game has still a lot of QOL to be improved, and the tiny dev team is working hard on it. \n\nXera: Suirvival is a chill game for those who like to loot, grind and get kicks from finding the rarer supplies. The tech tree is straight forward and manageable. At first the objective of the game is not quite clear. Yet it is simple, like in any survival game: to live long and prosper. \n\nSo at first you start with the very basic stick collecting and food gathering. After you got the basic tools and weapons you start to feel the need to settle down. You will want to establish a base for protection of yourself and the precious, hard earned belongings. At your base you can also upgrade and mend your gear, as well as craft gear that cannot be found in the world like C4 explosives. To get your basic base and gear set up takes about 10-15 hours gaming time. \n\nAfter a lot of hours and making some battle buddies, you are ready to go out and raid other player's bases. Or you can focus on being a hedgehog and create the impenetrable fortress. Or you can complete the challenges around the map to get rewards like better weapons and armor.\n\nThe game offers sufficient amount of action for those who want to fight.

The case is the same size, but the powder charge, projectile and also rifle specifications differ.

In a rifle chambered for .223 Remington, the round produces chamber pressures upward of 70,000 psi, if going by SAAMI (the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute) standards.\n\nBy contrast, .223 Remington tends to produce lower chamber pressures between 52,000 and 55,000 psi, going by SAAMI specs. Therefore, 5.56mm NATO ammo isn\u2019t safe for use in a rifle chambered for .223 Remington, but .223 is OK in 5.56.

I bought it with extremely low expectations and can honestly say that I was dumbfounded by the quality and attention to detail. \n\nSo what is it? XERA is an open world survival game with PvP and PvE elements. It's primary gameplay loop is similar to that of DayZ, except on a much smaller and \"arcade-y\" scale. The map is generously filled with loot, robotic enemies (Humanoids), and in-game events that trigger periodically over the course of your session. These events add a very \"alive\" touch to what could have otherwise been a very static game world. They are broadcasted frequently through your comm system and add optional (and rewarding) challenges to your session.\n\nYour character gains experience for every action (looting, killing enemies, completing events, etc) and levels accordingly. Players have two \"Base Camps\" that act as HUBS where they can deposit looted items into a Global Stash for safekeeping, purchase/sell items, repair equipment, and pay for a helicopter ride across the map. These HUBS also act as safezones and recharge hunger, thirst, and health levels while inside. \n\nDeath in XERA is not as frustrating as it's predecessors. Upon being killed, all loot/gear is dropped and can be reclaimed within 15 minutes of respawning. Death does not reset your character level, nor does it deduct items from your Global Stash. This system adds a very refreshing \"mobility\" and \"permanence\" to a genre where headshots usually end 15 hours of progress and start you from scratch.\n\nIt performs fantastically too. Only in very rare instances did I encounter frame drops and usually maintained 60-70 FPS throughout. Character motion is fluid and can seemlessly alternate between 1st and 3rd person viewpoints. Firearms are abundant and pack a fun punch against the robotic foes, who often amass in large numbers, especially in the denser areas.\n\nXERA also has an extremely generous crate system that rewards the player with weapon cosmetics each time a level is gained. I typically despise when games implement this, but here, it isn't stupidly obnoxious or greedy. The option to purchase crates is there, but not in your face. Lots of awesome skins are gained just by playing, with the option to even grab some through the Steam Marketplace at insanely low prices. I ended up grabbing 2 or 3 Halloween skins that cost about 12 cents each. \n\nLastly, I cannot praise the development team enough here. They are extremely responsive in forums and Discord to any and all feedback. In a few occasions, they even hopped into my server just to chat and wish me a fun session. As an indie dev team, this communication goes a long way in establishing trust with a consumer. From what I have seen, these guys love what they do, and it shows in their interaction with the players. Hats off to the team.\n\nThe only downside here is the low player base. That being said, the small community that is routinely active is extremely friendly and a joy to play with. It is my hope that more players gravitate toward the game as it continues improving.\n\nWould I recommend XERA? Absolutely. It's a fresh take on the survival genre: One that is not obnoxiously large, difficult, or punishing as those before it. It offers a wealth of things to do and smooth gameplay to make those things enjoyable. It offers themed events (with themed loot) and is backed by a staff of passionate and friendly gamers that love what they do.

As it stands this game is a mediocre PVP sandbox with little-to-no players to PVP with.\n\nMy question to the developers is: Why follow the same path of many failed games before you? Do something to stand out? You have a couple of interesting ideas: the helicopter runs I thought was one of them. The current gameplay loop is quite tedious and does not excite me when most enemies die in 2 headshots.\n\nEDIT: For the sale price if you have some friends definitely pick up the game and have a spin, once there is more PVE content with the bases etc as the developer has responded you'll have a much better time.

It\u2019s unfortunate that you cannot see the end goal for the design of the game. As you mention \u2013 the upcoming content is listed on our roadmap. Although we don\u2019t go into exact detail on all the upcoming features due to competition \u2013 but I can assure you that everything that we work on we attempt to add to the genre, rather than copy. We are always working on ways to re-define the genre and I think that our implementation of base building will be a first for this genre. \n\nAs you also mention, \u201clack of implementation\u201d is just a stage of early access. Everything you mention is being worked on, including skills, base building and more crafting options. We also have a lot of PVE content on its way with base building \u2013 for example protecting your base from humanoid raids.\n\nTo answer your question \u2013 we are not following in any path of \u201cfailed games\u201d. We have always made an attempt to be unique in any way we can \u2013 being the first survival humanoid apocalypse game for one. We have lots of other content which in your playtime (1.5 hours) you would have not come across. Our focus is progression and longevity and levelling up unlocks new content (which you would not have been able to access straight away). \n\nI recommend that you try the game again in Season 4 as there will be more content that will be more aligned with what you are looking for in the game.\n\nThanks again for trying the game out.\n\nRegards,\nJoshua"}, "113366262": {"recommendationid": "113366262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198812174506", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8648, "last_played": 1649137301}, "language": "english", "review": "My husband and I enjoyed the game play and the survival and building aspect of this game.

Agree with others its a toxic environment that stacks everything against new players because they really don't know where to go or the controls and the higher up players can just destroy the new bases and use exploits to take you out in seconds. You can't find out where the bandits are to get past the missions because they rarely spawn. You dont get to keep your seasonal loot if you find it - other people just come and take it so theres no point in obtaining it and everything just gets wiped anyways. You work hard for nothing essentially. There's no good items given in the season to make it worth playing either. If you can't keep it what is the point?!

There wont ever be a wipe, many of us are convinced. If you truly cared about this game and LISTENED to the community, youd have already fixed the issue thats causing you to \"not wipe the game\". Theres people trying to help you, and you wont accept it. Instead, youre milking xcoin purchases to fund whatever alt projects you have going on behind the scenes, while also losing players. (Ill remind everyone here player count has been below 100 avg. monthly players since SEPTEMBER OF 2022)\n\nYou want the instructions on how its done, you know exactly who to contact, and you wont. \nWhy continue to waste time? No, its not the cheaters, its not the duplicators, its not the auto clicker users, its the solo developer who cant seem to put time and effort into fixing lines of code in a game people have cared about for years.

Game is not bad nor good at this point.\nBefore pro's and con's you should know that this remind me the most of Rust, no there is no building feature, there is crafting but it's very poor and limited.\nWhy Rust? You will know first time you get in decently populated server. For example if you enter server with 20 players not even mentioning full server of 40 people, not only that you won't be able to find and loot any weapons but you will be killed on sight.\nCamping kids game at it's best. Maybe developer should implement something like from Fallout 76 that items/npc's respawn on new player entering zone. This way it's very unbalanced, but ok, it's early access so it's forgiven.\nI won't mention any of bugs since they are not gamebraking, but there are, a lot of them.\nAt current state maybe it would be best to play with a friend or two, just to save yourself from unnecessary rage :)\n\n[b]Please be aware that these mentions are just for current state of the game, I may update review on later date![/b]\n\n[b]Pro's;[/b] \n\n+ For EA game is surprisingly running very smooth, never droping below 90fps\n+ Steam intentory cosmetics\n+ Price, I think its fair comparing it to other games of this genre\n+ Potential to be great game\n+ Global stash (very promising feature)\n\n[b]Con's;[/b]\n\n- Global Stash (risk of loosing everything on server wipes,updates etc)\n- Mostly asset stock models in game \n- Lack of assets (like interior of buildings, outdoor, vehicles, items), well lets just say it needs more of everything  :)\n- Map is too small for 40 players playing it at same time, then game becomes shooting practice at live targets.\n- Achievements not working\n- Developer reviewing his own game. ...really dude?! Not cool\n\n\n\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\nYeah you can give it a try for this price and support development, HOWEVER do it with friend/s. It's not very enjoyable alone.\n\nI'm giving it negative review to keep  up the balance, it does not deserve mainly positive reviews at current state, especially since devs reviewed  their own

This would be grabbing supply drops, looting downed helicopters, and clearing these almost like \"outposts\" filled with enemies which then reward you a small bit of cash and 2 supply drops. There's also bunker events which I am yet to figure out, that require you to have a key to the bunker to gain entry and are also timed.\n\nYou will spend heaps of time on this game running around aimlessly looting random things and bringing them back to base so you may bank/sell/restock to your hearts desire. I personally find games like this, to be much more addictive with the banking system, allowing you to bring your gear to any server, and gear up at your hearts content.\n\nThe XP system isn't fantastic, and at this point in time seems quite experimental, as you gain skillpoints but have no use for them yet. Leveling does grant you a few small benefits right now, however, such as opening up some crafting recipes you can make use of on the go.\n\nGun play in this is practically non existent. Wherever you shoot, your bullet will travel instantly, but this is okay in a game like this. It makes PvP a little more interesting, plus makes PvE grinding a breeze when you learn the ropes. \n\nThe character movements are rather lackluster, nothing special, same with the ATV driving mechanics, however do not let this stop you. The game is in Alpha, and as I had stated above, only have the main developer under the hood with a small supporting staff. The idea is here, and I see the effort that's starting to go into the game, so because of this I will be purchasing the game before the f2p weekend ends.\n\nGrab a friend and give it a go, can't hurt to try it for free.\nI will be following the support on this game, hope to see nice things.", "timestamp_created": 1571546399, "timestamp_updated": 1571546611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586527884006500244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52259122": {"recommendationid": "52259122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061328689", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 327, "last_played": 1559226470}, "language": "english", "review": "I dont know if this game has changed but I bought it in hopes it would have everything it mentioned but it was missing A LOT of pieces.

The only way I see this being fixed is if they implement guards like Rust has at safe zones.\n\nReally wish I could get a refund for this\n\nTO THE DEVELOPER - if possible a refund would be great.
