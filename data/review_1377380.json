They just dropped you in world after Char creation and turned you loose.\n\nIt's come a long way since them but I am going to have to recommend against purchase because the game is still to unpolished to be any real fun (for me anyway). I do recommend following it though and in roughly a year or 2 it should actually be fun to play this!\n\nThe issues I had were; \n1) Terrible optimization, it spins my 2070 super to max regardless of the settings. \n\n2) Quest objective map updates, It will spawn a quest point on your map once your there but it wont remove it once you pick up the objective which leads to a VERY cluttered compass.\nPossible Fix: Adjust programming to remove a quest objective from the map once its picked up.\n\n3) Dying is a respawn at base/loss of items which REALLY sucks when your way out from your main base and there is no fast travel. I say this because the first trip out I kill/loot everything so the time passes quickly but the second time out its literally walking for 10 minutes in real life and I am bored out of my skull.\nPossible fix: Have a fast travel to corpse option, have a fast travel option, respawn nearish corpse.\n\n4) Evening/Early morning hours. I find these times to be SUPER annoying. Maybe later in the game you've enough that your occupied during this time but for me I just have to sit around from hour 22 to hour 5 waiting. There is a brief respite of the zombie wave but that's like a in game hour leaving you a CRAP ton of time twiddling your fingers bored.\nPossible fix: have the option to \"sleep\" after the wave waking at the predawn hours of 0500 or 0600\n\n5) Sound track in the game is under whelming. I mean why even have it? I just turn music off and the game improve 10 times imho.\n\nMake no mistake, I like this game and I will continue to play it. The game is truly realistic in some aspects. The dark in this game is a perfect example, it is pitch black cant see a hand in front of your face. Makes it REALLY easy for zombies, wolves, and bears, to catch you unaware. Journeying at night is a REALLY bad idea (Hence point 4). \n\nThe flash light isn't a second sun, the cone on the light behaves very close too, if not precisely, like real life. This is immersive but it also kinda sucks because unless you get a more powerful one later you're gonna have  REAL hard time with nights/interiors.\n\nThe traps hurt you too! REALLY refreshing take here. \n\nIt has a very strong Resident evil vibe which I find to be really enjoyable.\n\nI wish steam had a \"not in early access\" or \"wait awhile\" button instead of yes/no. If you are the kind of person (like me) who enjoys subnautica, satisfactory, factorio, and such you will most likely really enjoy the game with the above caveats being drawbacks and not game killers for you.\n\nNow to be perfectly fair I didn't make it to vehicles and such because after grabbing the polymerchem book I was killed and didn't feel like retracing my steps from an hour prior, So gave up for today.\n\n\nNow I know there is a save function that can avoid this but I (personally) like to challenge myself in these survival games so I only save on my exit thus I create the challenge of \"not dying so I don't lose a few hours of progress\" This is a personal thing and not something I fault the company for I just wish the corpse retrieval was a little easier.", "timestamp_created": 1708539043, "timestamp_updated": 1708539043, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555306196212768555", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159934413": {"recommendationid": "159934413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047850613", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1472, "last_played": 1599697533}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is in early access.

There is no controller support and no indication that there ever will be from the developers. This is an important thing for people who need controllers to know up front! If you want to use a controller with this game you will need to use 3rd party software to do so. The game has no native controller support built-in!\n\n2.) The game is still in Early Access and therefore still unfinished and incomplete. This makes it impossible to get all the achievements right now. It means the game may still have bugs. It means that maybe your game will just crash and fail to run. This game still needs more optimization work. It is very processor and GPU intense. \n\nThough the devs are still working on this, people who don't want the inconvenience of early access problems might want to add this to the watchlist and wait until it's fully released.\n\n3.) Lots of people call this a \"tower defense game\" but I can assure you that although it certainly does have tower defense elements at the core, this game also has many RPG elements as well, such as gaining experience and levelling up, taking on and completing quests, assigning stat points gained when levelling up and finding unique gear to equip your character with.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nThe devs have posted a roadmap which puts the full release of this game toward the end of 2024 if everything goes as planned. \n\nHere is a link to their roadmap post:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/1377380/eventcomments/4041483920927710466/\n\nThe developer have begun holding events where you can win a copy of the game or a DLC.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/1377380/eventcomments/4292565586206308939/\n\nSubscribe to the \"Events and Announcements\" forum for notification of future events.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/1377380/eventcomments/\n\n[hr][/hr]\nThis game turned out to become my favorite game for the past three years. It's so fun to play and so challenging. I initially bought it because it said early access and \"get involved with this game as it develops\". I've never done that before so it sounded awesome. \n\nIt's been an awesome 3+ years play-testing this game. Jackto has been an awesome developer to work with! They genuinely care about the experience each user is having with their product. They read all the user feedback in the forum and they almost always respond to emails.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nIn this game you can loot cars, houses, office buildings and chop down trees, crush boulders and haul all these materials back to a camp where you can build a base. Each night (you can change it in the settings) you are attacked by a wave of zombies that you CAN NOT hide from! They always know where you are and they will never go away! You're in luck though because you can build a lot of different traps to help kill the zombies.\n\nThe zombies. Well, these aren't some Walking Dead zombies that's for sure. Think more like Resident Evil. Some kind of dark, twisted creations crawling out of the underground lab. The zombies in this game are amazing. They are Jackto's pride and joy. These zombies will terrify you. Not at first, the early world zombies are harmless, but the deeper you dive into this world the scarier (and harder) it gets.\n\nThere is a large open world to explore. You can build anything, anywhere but the buildings that come with the map are indestructible. A lot of people use this to their advantage. There are vehicles in the game now that you can use to get around the large map faster. You can build stuff on one of the vehicles and I can't tell you how fun it is to build a ton of storage containers on one and take it out for a day long scavenge. I use the vehicle like a pack mule.\n\nThe game has a lot of customization settings now. You can change your difficulty mid-game so if you think it's too hard or too easy you can go alter the settings in the existing game without having to start a new game. Super convenient. Some of us like to disable the nightly wave and take our time to build then re-enable the wave when we're ready. There's so many ways you can play it and there is also a sandbox mode now too. You can build a base for free and throw zombies at it whenever you want using the sandbox to test it out.\n\nAnyways I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys tower defense games with a zombie element. Who enjoys open world games where you can build anywhere and who enjoys games that present with a real challenge. This game will keep throwing surprises at you as you play. It's very entertaining. :D\n\nThis game now features a robust questing and guidance system. Several NPC characters have been added to the game recently to help assist the player in their objective to survive.\n\nThe combat system was updated to make zombies behave in a more realistic way. Zombies always used to be robotic and systematic but now they are sometimes clumsy and often unpredictable. Also, activity will draw nearby zombies to you so stealth is a tactic you can use in this game.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nJackto does read all our posts in the Steam forum so if you had a message to communicate with the developer you can post there. I can confirm for you that they do read there even if they don't always respond. If you experience a bug you can report it there and expect it to get fixed, although not very fast. Think zombie speed, and no, not World War Z zombie speed :p\n\n[hr][/hr]\nIf you want to see some of the gameplay and screenshots or read about how to play the game, check out my guide where I cover a lot of gameplay basics.

(also dodging zombies, wolves, bears etc)\nNight is when the horde of the undead come to lay waste to all that you cherish. \nThe longer you stay alive in 'game days' the more intense the raid is on yourself...\nThere is also a thin but OK story line about escaping the island.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is the ability to use the pre-fab structures which you can basically meld your base build into - you can more or less build anywhere. \nIn other games of this genre it's generally you can build in the wilderness a certain distance away from pre-fabs and that's it, always felt this made the game world a bit disjointed.\n\nThe game has character XP and levelling incorporating a generous skills tree and attribute system. Armour includes sockets which can be slotted with 'coils' - giving buffs and chance abilities. Both weapons and armour can be re-forged for increasingly better gear.\n\nThe UI is basic but does the job. POV - you can play 1st person or 3rd. The building mechanic is good - snap to or loosely fit, with the resouce requirement not being OTT\n\nThe game mode is quite flexible and incorporates auto and manual saves .

The games needs a scaling option on wave days, e.g. the option to have waves every other day or\neven further apart. Many including myself would like the option of a challenge but with a more laid back\noption. Making the end of every day a zombie wave night is just to intense.\n2. Waves need to be revisited. By day eight the number of mobs and high level npc's are through\nthe roof. This is too much too early and again demands intense game play. Example, I upgraded to a\nlvl 9 grenade launcher and pelted the crowds with grenades doing 280 damage a pop and many of\nthese mobs took five direct grenades before they would finally die. Math? Nearly 50% of the mobs on\nday 8 take 1,400 damage to die.\n\nConclusion - right now even on normal it scales so rapidly that everything feels like hardcore mode.\nThis can easily be balanced to the player through options as 7Days to die does.", "timestamp_created": 1626638537, "timestamp_updated": 1626638537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 112, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895595252513885498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76424713": {"recommendationid": "76424713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003974233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6340, "last_played": 1605305981}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played this game quite a bit, almost 100 hours already, so I feel like I can give an unbiased review. This game is great, but needs some quality of life improvements. \n\nThe good:\nBase building is fairly easy (when you can get the blueprint to fit EXACTLY in the right spot)\nUpgrade materials do not seem to be difficult to find once you know how to get them (except copper ore)\nTraps are a lot of fun to build together (when you can get them to fit correctly)\nExploration is fun, and a little dangerous, until you have a good crossbow and baseball bat\nThe world itself is nicely laid out, a bit small, but that could change?\nNice variety of zombies, animals, and structures in the game. I don't feel like \"oh, I have seen this room before\" every time I go into a building. There are some repeated models, but that is to be expected.\n\nThe not so good:\nZombie pathing - if they do not have a crystal-clear shot directly to you, they will destroy anything you have built. This can make planning an elaborate set of traps frustrating because they will just tear through the walls rather than follow the path you laid out.\n\nLack of resources - once you get later into the game (post day 20), oil becomes increasingly hard to find (if you are using multiple flame throwers). Copper ore can be hard to find if you do not go out quite far from your base and hunt for it. It does add to the excitement, but getting jumped by a wolf, a bear, and 8 zombies out in the middle of the forest with no way to know where you died is not fun.\n\nNo death marker - when you die, you drop all your inventory, except for your equipped weapon.  If you were out exploring and did not look at the map before you died, you lost your inventory, Start over. \n\nNo way to increase trap damage. Every night the horde gets bigger AND stronger, so you need more traps. Since you have no way of improving your traps, you just have to create more and link them together and hope the horde runs through them rather than tear them apart. I have started building on the roof of buildings and it seems to work fine. The zombies cannot destroy the walls or floors, so you have a better chance of forcing their pathing through your traps. It is not fool-proof, but it does tend to work for me. I have seen other people build mammoth bases in the middle of the forest, so it is not impossible, just can be problematic for people starting out.\n\nTraps run out of ammunition - this would not be too big of a problem if some of them were not set so low. Compressor and guillotine have very few charges while others have 100. That means you have to physically run to that trap and add ammunition to it. In the middle of a day 20+ horde, depending on your layout, that may not be possible. So you tend to start using only the high ammunition traps and ignore the others because they are resource intensive.  This can limit your base style or location. \n\nWishlist:\nOther people/Interactions- you are alone in the world. I would like some type of interaction with others, whether it is random radio contacts, left behind messages, something to make you feel like part of the world and have purpose. \n\nInventory stacks of more than 99 for all materials in storage - for the love of God, please make this happen for all items. Let us use research documents and unlock it, but I have an entire chest full of \"pieces of iron ore\" and \"piece of cloth\" and \"cloth\". I still need more than one chest just for all the items and craftables in the game (currently at 10 chests and they are almost all full).\n\nBetter snap placement for the blueprints. I have to fiddle with the up and down, left, right, back up, get the camera just right, in order for the piece to place. Also, the foundation pieces will sometimes \"auto-fit\" a half-space off and leave a gap. When you try to place a trap door or other item that is exactly one floor tile in width, it will not attach. I would be much easier to build if  we had at least two tiles of snap placement from one foundation/floor rather than having to build a brand new foundation/floor for every tile. Currently, I think only the bridge will snap on without an anchor piece. Maybe allow short fences on bridges?\n\nWeather - would love rain/snow, and more ambient noise. It does make it easier to hear ducks, but it is very quiet overall.\n\nCharacter creation/selection for single player game - currently only the woman is available in single-player mode, but you can go to multiplayer and host your own single player game to play as one of the male characters. You cannot [spoiler] find any new clothes in the multi-player game, or at least I haven't and I have ransacked the hospital, subway, and every house between the north and south. [/spoiler]\n\nFinal Impression:\nIt is important to remember that the goal of this game is to escape the island. I am not sure how many people are actually playing to escape, because: [spoiler]you can do that on day 4 or 5 if you really hustled and be done with the game in a few hours. I had all the research and items done on my second play through by day 10 and that was with building an elaborate, completely useless, wooden scaffolding system around a building. [/spoiler] . Almost everyone I know is playing the game like an endurance mode to see how many days they can survive which creates many of the \"issues\" within the game.\n\nOverall, this game is awesome and well worth the $25.00 you can pay now to play it. It is fun, and you can build whatever and wherever you want. I just built a bridge into the top of the water cooler towers for a nuclear reactor. I have a nice trap door at the top of the scaffolding I have not tried out yet, but soon. \n\nI will probably log another 100 hours on this game, easily, and happily. \n \nSupport these guys and give them feedback.

Despite what it might appear to be, it's not an open world zombie survival game. Are there zombies? Yup. Are you supposed to survive? You betcha. Is it open world? Technically. But what this game really is is a treasure hunt hidden in a tower defense game. There is almost no survival elements (apart from a fatigue system that is very easy to manage with basic scavenging), and the point of the game is to find a series of items in order so that you can escape, thus winning the game. If you enjoy trying to optimize your time management or finding the perfect combination in a tower defense, then this game is for you.\n\nI picked this game up because I stumbled across Kage848's videos on youtube the day before it released, and it grabbed my attention as a base building zombie game. I was surprised I hadn't heard anything about it before then, and when I tried to look up information I couldn't find squat. However, for some reason this piqued my curiosity even more and I decided to buy the game and give it a shot. I'm glad I did.\n\nHowever, this game is still rather shallow in it's current state, but what is there is addictive in a way that's hard to describe. The building process is complicated and running between different crafting tables gets annoying, but at the same time you start to remember what each piece needs and stocking up on the required materials. You start to beat the system just like you beat the zombies, and its rewarding to see a base grow after struggling with the initial setup. I couldn't make it beyond night 2 on my first play-through, but once I understood the concept I started over and escaped the island on day 6.\n\n[b]If you do decide to give it a try, here's some hints to get you through the first few hours (since there's still virtually no information out there):[/b]\n[spoiler]- Don't try to build a large sprawling base by yourself, you'll spend too much time and it's not needed. a 3x3 is plenty.\n- a good gauntlet layout is key for large hordes in later nights, but when the zombies come in one at a time you should fight them with your weapon of choice outside your base. save your resources for later nights when the numbers become overwhelming!\n- a good tip for your trap gauntlet (that worked for me anyway), is to build your traps on top of foundations in lanes, then place walls on the sides to box them in and limit wasted shots from your turrets. and don't use doors, ever. zombies get cranky when you start using doors.\n- if you misplace something in your build, you can break it down for 100% of its cost with the hammer. \n- your first priority for research should be your carry capacity, and your first upgrades should be for your resource bag. you're going to fill up very fast and waste a lot of your first two days running back and forth to drop off loot.\n- stop and mine EVERY iron node you come across, regardless of what you're doing. you need a lot of copper in the end-game and its incredibly rare. You're best bet is to try to collect it as you go, starting as early as possible.\n- pick a goal for yourself: if you want to escape the island, you should prioritize at least 1/3 of your day to reaching the items you need to leave. if you just want to see how long you can make a base survive the horde nights, you should spend that time looting as much as possible to keep your stockpiles full. \n\n[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1599123282, "timestamp_updated": 1599123282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 103, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878718256950378418", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79087845": {"recommendationid": "79087845", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995947354", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 35380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17607, "last_played": 1646255340}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, let me start off by admitting that I am absolutely a soft touch when it comes to indie games.  I'll forgive them for things I'd never accept from a AAA design studio, and with good reason.  It takes so much guts to be an indie designer, to go out there with nothing but passion and a dream and make something that other people are happy to spend hours of their life playing.  \n\nNight of the Dead is very much a work in progress, and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise. But, every masterpiece has to start off with a rough draft to begin with before you can polish it up. And that's what we're lucky enough to have the opportunity to play here: A diamond in the rough.\n\nI have been looking for a game like this for a long time, and I'm thrilled to know that someone is building one. Oh, it'll probably be years before it's completed, but that's okay. It's fun now, and it's going to be amazing when they're done with it.  \n\nThe part I find most interesting is that while it's designed as a multi-player tower defense game, they've also included a single-player version that somehow manages to be one of the most entertaining crafting-based survival games I've ever had the privilege of playing.  If the multi-player is half as fun as the single-player, then they've got a really solid core for a good game.  \n\nI'm not even going to go into the bad parts. There are parts that need work, but they already know that. So, let me just focus on the positive parts.  \n\nThe crafting system is amazing, it's so complicated that when I first looked at it I was so confused and overwhelmed I didn't know where to start. But, the game walks you through it, and in no time at all you're building huge mazes of zombie-crushing traps and giggling like a lunatic as you watch an entire horde reduced to foul-smelling spagetti paste. And let me say... I hate traps in most games. I'm very much a hands-on zombie slayer. I never use bombs, traps, grenades, anything like that. I like to snipe things from afar, or zerg rush 'em. But, this game makes traps fun. \n\nThe map is HUGE.  When I went into this, I was expecting the map to be tiny based off a couple of other reviews, but I have to assume those were based on an earlier version.  I've barely found one of the edges so far, and there's a whole FREAKING CITY down there that I haven't even touched yet. \n\nThere are options for different play styles. I hear the multi-player is great, but there's also a solid amount of content for loners like me who prefer single-player.  Want something action-packed? Pick a higher difficulty level and leave the zombie waves switched on - the game will get gradually harder and harder until you get overwhelmed.  Prefer a more peaceful stroll to explore the map?  No problem!  In the last patch, they added the ability to turn off the zombie waves so you can explore and build without being randomly annoyed by grumpy zombies.  \n\nNow, a couple of small warnings if you are the squeamish sort, like me. There is a fairly realistic hunting system, in which you have to shoot or trap birds and wild animals to improve your weapons and supplies, and also for food. It's integral to the gameplay, so there's no avoiding it. There are noises that are pretty upsetting, and you have to craft using the skins, bone, and guts of the animals. I mean, it's all pretty cartoonish so it's not super disturbing, but it did freak me out a bit to start with.  Also, some of the female zombies SCREAM SUPER LOUD when they die, which gave me an unpleasant fright on a few occasions. So, consider yourself warned!\n\nOverall, though?  Stellar game, and it's only going to get better. Well worth the price.  Don't believe me?  I've got a pre-ordered copy of Cyberpunk 2077 coming any day now, and there's a good chance I might leave it a while longer to play this. And I'm super excited about Cyberpunk 2077, so that's high praise!  \n\nOh, and on the off chance the devs read this... guys, you are doing an amazing job.  You should be proud of yourselves.

Came across this gem while browsing the other day and took the plunge. Glad I did, because right out of the gate I'm liking what I see. I'm no game dev but for a 2 man team this is impressive. I'm gonna thumb it up. \n\nFor those curious about the overall state/opinion of the game and what it offers...\n\nGraphics - better than a lot of similar titles currently on offer, such as State of Decay series, Survive the Nights, 7DTD to name a few. I'd say it's a solid 7.5 to 8/10 depending on what settings you configure it up with.\n\nPerformance - extrapolate from here, but I used an I9 10900k paired with a RTX 2060 and got 1440p 60fps stable (with some minor dips when loading assets), this was with <Medium> settings but with <Very High> texture setting. Ram usage was around 10Gb, Vram usage around 5Gb and CPU usage was typically single digits to teens depending on what I was doing. It's worth noting on the medium preset the game looks great. Ultra looks a lot better but the performance decrease wasnt worth it. No crashes among my current play time. If they can shore up some of the optimization it would make my 8/10 score a 9 to 10 score, all in time I suppose right? Some asset popping in is currently noticable when traveling in the world, probably my biggest nitpick here tbh as I am using a Seagate Firecuda Nvme drive. Overall, a solid 8/10 for performance in its current state given the title is in early access. Quick edit: online, unfortunately performance is considerably worse but playable. It's all over the place fps wise when playing online, why is this?\nEdit#2 - adjusting to low, except textures/AA at max matches performance in single player, as of 8.31.20...\n\nSound - I'm somewhere in between 6.5 to a 7 here. Gun sounds could use some work, the zombie sounds are nice and there is enough ambience to get immersed overall. \n\nContent - for day one, there's a lot to play with. There's pve, pvp, single and multiplayer. Go it alone, or get help from others, fairly big world to explore and lots of things to research and craft.\n\nValue - I'm fine with the price, if things progress with the integrity it has launched with up through official launch I think we could have a solid game here for many to enjoy.\n\nFinal overall feeling on the score...\n\n8/10, would recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1598687325, "timestamp_updated": 1598871840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865646004676818848", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76027784": {"recommendationid": "76027784", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966324547", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1476, "last_played": 1600813446}, "language": "english", "review": "Although i didn't play single player i feel this game has a lot of potential.

The game is rather challenging on the higher difficulties.\nBoss Zombie (Tall whitey, Orange Crawley, The Butcher), Mid zombies (Big Bob, White Cracked Head, Military Joe) These are all names that we randomly came up with. (They may have names already) \n- The wave event, Every Night there is a Wave of Zombies.

(Kindof sticks when you want to mark multiple things)\n- Map Coordinates, Trying to pinpoint the exact location when you have to scroll out to see if you are in the right tile is kind of a bummer.\n- Game end. (If you escape the Island, Besides the credits it should give you an option to continue that server).

The basic premise is simple - You have 2 hours real-time of sunlight to explore the world, level up, find gear and survival stuff, and craft a series of traps and your base to prepare for a short burst of horde siege at night. Every night that passes the zombies get stronger during the night wave.\n\nWhile that sounds all fine and dandy, polish and a good user experience are not terms synonymous with this title. The game can be summarised as a haphazard cobble web of Unreal store assets and controllers slapped together to function average at best. The melee system is quite literally one of the worst amongst its genre, utilising what the developers have proudly proclaimed as an innovative animation based extremely hitbox precise method of hit detection. In order to deal damage and stagger a zombie, your melee weapon must physically connect its blade to the target. It sounds great until you realise that animations for using melees are inconsistent. You character might swing an axe left first, then try to do a centre smash, then swing it left. Its such an inconsistent system that the only way to properly melee is to get so close right up in the zombie's face that whichever way you swing you make sure it will touch the zombie.\n\nAny time the server lags for a millisecond, the zombie hits you instead. The netcode is so bad that zombies often teleport and desyncs their positions and you will need around 6-10 hits to kill a basic zombie until you reach the lategame weapons.\n\nVehicles are jank coffins, and the game's APC, despite being a supposedly tanky military vehicle, blows up from colliding into a zombie slightly too fast. We accidentally drove the APC under a ceiling and because we had a flag pole above it flipped our APC and exploded us instantly causing us to lose everything. Fuel is burnt fast and each time you hit a zombie if you do not explode the APC loses around 10% of its health, requiring constant repairs.\n\nThere are some positives to this game, and firstly its the map. The map is done very well, despite using a lot of common UE store assets, they are placed well and from the exteriors it looks coherent, and the map has a lot of vistas and landmarks that let you identify your bearing by just looking at the mountains etc. The interiors are kinda bad though, and its not uncommon for the random gen to spawn furniture at an offset, so the fridge clips into the wall or blocks the door.\n\nThe base building is decent, and is moreso Sanctum style Tower Defence where you build mazes and towers to funnel them versus 7DaystoDie style where you bunker in for an all round siege. The issue is that the early game is too easy, and ballistas are so overpowered they will one-shot snipe almost any zombie from far away. Build 10 of this and you can survive at least your first 40 real life hours of this game even on Hard or higher settings.\n\nQuick fire points:\n-There is a story but its done in just journals that lead you on a goose chase around the map and the ending isn't ready.\n-The skills build system while decent is literally unbalanced.\n-Zombie variety is good and slightly better than other competitor titles.\n-Don't screw around with bears.\n\nOverall its extremely early access and it shows. There is potential for the devs to fix up the issues and itd be a good game, but well... How many early access games that are already 2 years old have ever really been fixed?\n\nSideways thumb, putting a negative for now because you must be masochistic to a point to enjoy this title as it is.", "timestamp_created": 1673435899, "timestamp_updated": 1673435899, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 124, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821825623512268066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77134548": {"recommendationid": "77134548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053776711", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1216, "last_played": 1625807643}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Fun.

I've only played 4 hrs so far but I feel like this game was meant for a player like me, someone who doesn't like bloody knuckle bare bone difficult survival games but also wants to be challenged.\n\nEDIT: Make sure you have concrete walls and foundations for day 6 wave !, incinerator zombies come and fire spreads", "timestamp_created": 1598764317, "timestamp_updated": 1598845449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.817553937435150146", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75042907": {"recommendationid": "75042907", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974870467", "num_games_owned": 4867, "num_reviews": 390, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 524, "last_played": 1598598988}, "language": "english", "review": "The graphics of this game are good.

Traps works automatically when a zombie is around it.\n\nThere is also a research system.

Its too early and real rough around the edges. I can see the promise, but its not worth 20 (or 24) bucks to me as is. Props to a two man studio for getting it this far, but it needs to bake longer. If you are into Green Hell/7 days to Die/The Forest then this may tickle you. \n\nKey points:\n- It needs a tutorial. I don't need hand holding, but dropping you into the game without even covering basic controls is not cool.  A couple slides that say \"Press I to open your inventory, press L to toggle your flashlight, these are skills and here is what they do etc\" would go a long way. I got all the important info I needed from a third party websites getting started guide. \n- The UI is overwhelming at first, and there is scant instruction provided. Some visual cues or highlights on what you need to click and where would help a lot. All of the items/resources icons are too small and difficult to tell apart at a glance. For example, I needed 5 rope and I spent 5 minutes googling how to make rope before I figured out I was in the wrong type of crafting bench. \n- Needs more polish. For example it has auto loot for some things which is great, but when you are swinging an axe/pickaxe/knife at a tree/rock/bush if you are too far you miss which can be hard to eye over the shoulder, and if you are too close you hit the handle on the resource and do not make progress toward collecting it which is annoying. I assume they tried to make this a mechanic to get you to feel the length of your tools to find the sweet spot, but to me it was just frustrating. \n- You are better off scoping out the controls and pulling up the wiki or a starter guide beforehand. \n- The map seems huge and actions like running and dodging cost stamina. If you lose all your stamina and keep doing stamina actions, you lose hp. I guess this is to discourage kiting zombies for too long but its overbearing. \n- Speaking of HP,  you are fragile and easily killed. A single zombie took me down to half hp and the food I could find only gave back +1 or +5. You can make a cooking table and probably stronger food but I did not get that far. \n- Zombies are janky and glitchy much like dayz zombies. They teleport around, clip through walls/doors/scenery and are frustrating to fight. I killed a zombie with a bow and arrow, and the corpse flew into the sky at a million miles per hour and took my arrows with her. \n- Team mechanics need to be refined. Theres no shared team stash and your early game objectives reward you with much needed materials but if you are on a team the game doesnt acknowledge that one of you put down a research bench so in order to claim those early rewards you need to build two of everything which is unnecessary. \n- If you die you lose everything unless you loot your body.\n- Crafting is confusing and tedious. See rope above. \n\nIts not bad, its just not ready.", "timestamp_created": 1622183855, "timestamp_updated": 1622183855, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 350, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803768515586853027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106385422": {"recommendationid": "106385422", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974713479", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 12261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12261, "last_played": 1638850067}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Good but not as good as 7 Days to Die.\"\n\nThis is a fun co-op zombie/survival game. The main downsides are that it's a set map (no random world generation, though it's a big map with many different starting points) and the actual \"game\" -- following the quests to escape the island -- is pretty lame and anti-climactic (\"you win, game over, lol\"). That said, you can just ignore the quests and play it as an endless survival game, which is my recommendation.\n\nIt's really more of a \"tower defense\" game than a true survival game, though. Whereas 7 Days to Die puts zombie killing mainly in your own hands, Night of the Dead is much more about building traps to kill the zombies with. 7d2d also has a high emphasis on looting and questing whereas NotD is more about quickly farming the resources you need to expand your traps with. The hordes are much larger (in every sense of the word) and far more frequent, so creating these traps is really how you make it through the nights.\n\nHonestly 7d2d is a better game all around in terms of replayability and total content but I still give this a thumbs up.

Yes it has \"Open World Survival Craft\" but you need to understand this is a \"Tower Defense\" game first.  \n\nSo I played this game when it first came out and I really liked it.  It had a good foundation to build upon.  Yes it was a bit buggy in spots.  I finished the story then set the game aside for a while.  \n\nI have now returned to the game after the big Electric Update (Dev #5).  \nI have to say I am blown away by what was added and changed in this game for the good.  \n\nThe use of electricity adds a whole new element to how you can build your defenses.  It also adds more of a game play loop to the game.  Some my call it it grindy as you are looking for resources to upgrade your electric stuff now.  However last time I played I got board because I found that there was not enough to do.  So for me this adds a lot more \"to do\"\n\nI do really like the \"Open World Survival Craft\" element for this game.  I think it works very well by day you go out and hunt salvage what you need to build up your \"Tower Defense\".   It becomes a neat balance of \"oh it is 18:00 and I still need to build XYZ but I still need ABC resource should I stay out and look for them or head back and build what I can and hope it will be good enough.\"\n\nAs I said IF you where buying this as a \"Open World Survival Craft\" you might be upset as every night you will be attacked by a hoard of Zombies.  This is where the \"Tower Defense\" comes in.  (Me I like Tower Defense games) If you try to fight off the hoard without defenses it won't go so well.  You need to build them up.  \n\nThe other thing to note is when you first start out the zombies out there in the wild are tough and hard to kill on Normal and up.\nThis is because you are weak and not skilled yet.  later on you will be able to upgrade your weapons, your skills and zombies will become easier to dispatch.  So when you first pop in it is best to avoid them.   Find a nice spot to set up and start doing your \"Survivor Note\" stuff to get the rewards.  Build up a base and get ready Night comes fast on the 0day.  \n[spoiler] When you get your Research Table built.  Take Engineering Graduate > Engineer.    That way you can build your Trap Machines they are needed for every trap you build.

Some difficulty snapping pieces correctly but it is fairly refined.\n\nFighting 7/10\nThe movement of your character feels fairly real and fluid but the zombies act weird sometimes and spaz around.  There doesn't seem to be a big enough advantage for well placed shots.  Head shots should kill most lesser zombies.  I understand juicing bosses and feral zombies but allow me to be a badass with the hordes of regular moron zombies.  Or make it headshots only and add helmets to bosses but 4-8 arrows a zombie is a bit much.  Still fun fights with a sword and shield one v one.  Just add more realism or the fights with hordes become pointless for an individual.\n\nMap 8/10 \nDecent size map with lots of different environments which seems pointless when you are stuck in one location holding down the fort.  It takes the better part of the day to travel and take a large building.  For what the game is, fairly unique cities and small community areas.  Things flow well with trees and rocks\n\nSound 5/10\nThis is the part I really dont like.  Characters overly grunt when sprinting acting winded the second they do anything, not just when low on stamina.  Birds and animals make too much background noise you can kind of lose your mind.  I currently play Movie music as background noise and turn down the game a bit.  Wave hits and im wielding a lightsaber listening to Dual of the Fates.  The sounds just need a big touch up.  A bird screams non stop for the duration of the game and im grunting like im dying meanwhile a snarling zombie can cross a field and run through as forest and hit me in the back like a ninja without a peep.  \n\nAll in all im more critical than i need to be because I hope the Developer reads this and adjusts the game a bit because the game is truly fantastic for where it is at.

It offers a mix of resource gathering, building and direct combat of the survival genre with trap building and maze planning of the tower defense genre and finally you have a light sprinkle of a narrative and end game to encourage exploration.\n\nSo how does it feel to play? Well ultimately time is your currency. At midnight, every night, you will be attacked by an ever increasing number and types of zombies. You need to upgrade and expand your base with traps to deal with these hordes. To do so you gather resources, however unlike other games, upgrading your tools and skills does not give you more resources, instead they take less time to gather. Ultimately as you reach the end game you'll be able to explore more, take down zombies quickly and gather resources no the way. It all seems to come together.\n\nOn the whole, this works quite well and proves to be an enjoyable and entertaining distraction which is open enough that, despite the ticking clock, you can play it the way you want. I would however caution that as the game stands right now, the tower defense aspect is the core gameplay loop and if that turns you off it might not be for you.\n\nWith that out of the way, it's also worth mentioning that the game is very stable. In 50 hours I've encountered minor bugs. The developer has been very active in listening to the community and issued 8 updates so far addressing balancing and bugs with bigger updates planned down the road. Bravo to Jackto for doing Early Access right.\n\nFor the future. I'd like to see some user configuration being implemented so people can tweak the game to their playstyle or perhaps workshop support for that and user made traps. As ever, more content and more polish on the existing content would be great. The narrative quest could also benefit from expansion as currently it's pretty much explore location X and get Y. Some mega bosses, maybe encouraging a temporary base to defend against a special quest horde attack etc would add something more to the game.\n\nFinally, the tutorial does expose you to the trap mechanics which is very helpful. I do however think that it might be helpful to split off the tutorial into a separate mode where you have no resource cost and can experiment more freely. As it stands you can easily find your placement is off or ineffective and you're left demolishing a chunk of your base and rebuilding as a consequence.", "timestamp_created": 1599396729, "timestamp_updated": 1599397287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770165622234344482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144243899": {"recommendationid": "144243899", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983774187", "num_games_owned": 822, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 3504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3504, "last_played": 1692051794}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a very Project Zomboid feeling character creation, but once you drop in you see that it's very much based on 7 Days to Die. The most major difference is that 7 Days is based on building with a blocks system, and this game is not at all. There's plenty of building, it's just different. While 7 Days does have traps, this game has TRAPS. There is a zombie horde every night instead of every week, and the traps you get access to very early on like the pendulum trap will still be helpful into the end game. It's like zombie tower defense. It's pretty fun at first but I admit, it does get a little old having to run back to base every single night just to deal with it. \n\nI will also say, this game is janky. It's early access so that's just going to happen, but on several occasions I ran into floating fire.. as in, a wooden part of a base caught fire, it was either put out or burned down, but the fire just floated there and burned me ever after. There were also many, many times where I would strike a tree or rock while trying to gather resources, and it would just disappear without giving me any.  (I learned later, from a friend, that I could shoot the disappeared tree or rock with a pistol to make it appear again, and it works.. go figure.) This was the most common problem I ran into.  \n\nAll that being said? It's actually good. It needs fixes, it needs more points of interest. It needs more items. It needs a much, much better endgame. (It's not so fun looting a building when you already have massive stacks of everything that drops, and the equipment cabinets aren't special because you already have lightsabers..) The biggest grind is stuff like copper, oddly enough, and LEAVES. Finding a tier 6 weapon means basically nothing once you've already got it, but spending real time chopping hundreds of bushes, trees and rocks is an unavoidable reality. The farming system is also rough.. even when you get tier 3 farm plots, don't expect to really be able to make many beneficial things with it that you couldn't more easily buy or find elsewhere. Meat alone can get you through this game, and painkillers are cheap. Oh I could go on and on..\n\nFor what I payed though, and the near 60 hours I got out of it, and the potential to come back later after a year or two of updates and try it on hard mode or something?

Including some bird & animal hunting, and fishing later for gear upgrade.\n\nYou build stuff like in most unreal engine game. Place a foundation, place some wall/door/window and ignore the roof because there isn't any flying zombies or weather.\nAt midnight a bunch of zombie will spawn in predetermined spot around you and try to reach/kill you. They do not break building as long as there is a open path to you, so unlike some other game, a door is fine to walk in/out of your base, no need for jumping trick and the like.\nSo you build some trap, like in a small maze, and let the trap do the work.\n\nThere is very little maintenance required on normal difficulty if you do it right.\n\nAnd then next day you do it again.\n\nThe map is fixed, and lot of research are locked behind a specific book find at a specific place (the game tell you exactly where), so you can just make a trip, grab one or two specific book, come back home and fill the time left with basic harvesting/gathering/building.\n\nEach night the game is harder tho, On normal difficulty it's totally doable (minus first time first night), and worse case you can change the difficulty setting when you load your save.\n\nAs honorable mention, there is a good variety of zombies (with 4 themes ice fire electric poison).\n\nThen, what's about the \"clunky/misleading/unfinished\" mention ?\nWell harvesting is clunky. It's hard to hit the ressources. Melee hitbox can be super annoying at time, since youur attack is cancelled if you hit something too close (you do nothing), and interupted if you hit something  (you could still hit a zombie and get an interupted animation if you hit a wall after the zombie).\nIt's hard to use most weapon in building. Only the best end game melee weapon is immune to this.\n\nAs for the misleading part, the game doesn't tell you how much a zombie is hurt, how much health he could have, how much your trap damage them ... and there is no creative mode to test it out, you need a specific unreal engine dev tool for that. And talking about said tool is against the forum rules.\nThere is very very little information on the internet so you are pretty much on your own. Want to know if this trap is good or suck ? Well, joke on you, you won't. Want to know if it's better to add +10dmg or 25% dmg to your trap ? Welp. Who know. Wanna know what exactly does stats do ? It could work. Or not. You cannot tell.\n\nThere is also a whole shield techtree & parry system that is somewhat broken. It's annoying to use them in the first place anyway because you need to place the shield on your hotbar (8 slot btw), add a one hand weapon, then draw both one after the other to equip yourself if you don't go trough the inventory. And repeat every single time you want to use a tool to harvest something, or use a ranged weapon. Each type you equip something you lose your momentum and slow down, and need to wait for a second before you can attack.\nAnd anyway you can just dodge instead bothering using a shield.\n\nAnd lastly most (somme are cool tho !) building feel really empty. Some part of the map looks weird/unrealistic. I mean it can be some detail like why anybody would build two lampost in front of each other for a road that can barely fit one car; lot of road have weird sizes; some door rotate around the door handle somehow; some furniture clip into each other; etc.\n", "timestamp_created": 1669559097, "timestamp_updated": 1669559097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746756613254547119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115034993": {"recommendationid": "115034993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259507696", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 387, "last_played": 1655977817}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy 7 Days to Die, then you'll also enjoy this game with larger zombies & different types", "timestamp_created": 1651839745, "timestamp_updated": 1651839745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746063768863677979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156498541": {"recommendationid": "156498541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013786965", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1706471972}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, I am not a professional zombie survival player however I was enjoying this game so far.

After the neverending stream of elaborate zombie-survival clones of the past years, it feels somewhat like a fresh breeze. Judging from the steam charts , a lot of people think so, this game had an incredibly strong launch. and rightly so. There is already a deep crafting system in place, the gamebreaking bugs are at a a minimum, there is a clearly defined ingame goal, and a decent story in place, which creates good incentive to play aka the forest or green hell.\n\nwe've played some multiplayer, about 5 ingame days, and i admit we had a great time already, notwithstanding many little peeves, that might turn off some players who don't manage their expectations. \n\nso what made this play so enjoyable?\n- compared to the holy 7days to die grail of the genre, the fast pace in notd is [i]fast[/i], nice!\n- this is partly due to a very efficient and no nonsense approach towards crafting and inventories. We could spend all of our playtime to exploring, fighting, scavenging, building and defending, which is great for a game genre which tends to create situations where you need to manage your inventories half of the playtime, a wise design choice right off the bat\n- the game has a realistic athmosphere, and the industrial and residential environments are very well done.\n- zombies come in many shapes , forms and characters, some of them are quite challenging\n- medieval siege equipment meets modern warfare: interesting! and bloody :D blood showering exploding zombies right in front of you as a result of heavy ballista impacts.. fire and mayhem through flamethrowers and trebuchet bombs.. whats not to like \n- aleady a convincing implementation of wildlife\n- They now have a roadmap \n\n\nso why would one wait for this zombie game to become more 'fleshed out'?\n\n\n- zombie pathfinding is ...well.. not very good, and their beautiful animations dont weigh up against the jaggyness overall.\n- while the world looks postapocalyptic and the views are quite nice, overall the environment feels cloned and a bit stale. The nature-part of the map needs more love.\n- performance is not good for unreal engine, it seemed to run better on my old potato than on my friends hi-performance rig which is a curious fact. The problem gets especially bad with many zombies around\n- sounds can get annoying, f.e. the chest-opening sound squeak ... \n- collision model and character movement is very rigid\n-the building mechanics are not very flexible,f.e. you cant build a wall on a foundation if a stairs is already in place, or a floor under a siege weapon,... making the order in which yo place things a factor. So you need to spend some time reworking when you try to scale up your build\n- crafting materials need balancing in terms of usefulness.. make sure to have some chests around for unusable objects like all the various bone types...\n- rabbits seem too much of a necessity. We had a good stock of perfectly fine deer skin and such.. but for some reason rabbit skin is demanded for a dozen of things.. \n- character development (through research) is hard to keep track of, there needs to be some character info \n\nit will take a while before a true assesment can be made about whether this title will fulfill al its implicit promises. some of the more obvious issues are the typical ones: gfx performance, multiplayer performance, and the devs seem on top, with almost daily updates, and a quick launch of dedicated server functionality. Other issues might or might not be tackled, depending on how community interaction will take place, the recent release of a roadmap is surely another step in the right direction.

During my playtime I had zero crashes and didn't witness any bugs.  The graphics are great and the game play is fun.  The tutorial could be a bit better for someone that hasn't played the genre before but I would imagine most people that pick up the game know what to expect.\n\nI started my base building at my spawn location right away, I soon realized there were plenty of better spots  but oh well it is my first go at it.  My biggest problem (and this isn't the games problem) is that I setup my traps in such a manner that I did just about as much damage to me as the zombies, so I had to stay in certain spots and while the traps reloaded  it would give the mobs a chance to gang up on me.   It is great imagining how I want to set my traps up the next go around.  I just didn't design the flow control like I should.\n\nI may be wrong as I haven't done any research yet on the game, but from my time playing it is more about letting traps do the majority of the work and you finishing off the few that get through.   The trick of course is to manage to reset the traps as they occasionally will need to manually be reset using one of the many resources in the game.\n\nAs far as the enemies in the game.  It's not just Zombies that will wreck your day, wolves, alligators and bears and all put a violent end to your journey if you are not careful.

(with this being said its forgivable because there are plenty of places that are finished and plenty of resources to gather from all over the map)\nThe faster weapons seem to swing faster than the engine allows for hits to land.

Some of the new stuff includes a greatly increased map size, new gameplay loops like a fishing mini-game and \"coil\" power-ups, and a character progression system. There are new vehicles, which is great because the map is so large now that it takes far to long to run anywhere. You'll find yourself travelling like 50 miles to find a single skillbook and rushing back to your base before midnight. There's so much empty land (I'd really like to see more POI's).\n\nI was hoping for new traps, building pieces or electricity mechanics. However, we got new zombie skins and ridiculous out-of-place animals like lions, tigers, penguins, elephants, ostriches... it's like the devs bought a zoo package from the asset store and decided to use every animal. Come on guys, seeing a rhino run across the highway breaks any immersion.\n\nWhile none of that is game-breaking, my main problem is that it's way too dark indoors. Even inside windowed buildings there's no daylight coming through, so everything looks washed out and grey-on-grey color. The brightness and contrast sliders in the settings don't help, so I think the issues is the shadows and light sources. This game would probably benefit from raytracing since there's so many dark areas.\n\nOverall, I like the 2.0 update and look forward to more.\n\n\n[Original review]:\n\nIt's actually pretty good. It's like 7 Days to Die meets tower defense. Like 7 Days, there are scheduled zombie hordes, base building, electricity and automated mounted weapons. Unlike 7 Days, the zombies don't just attack whatever is in their way to get to you. These zombies will follow any path you create, as long as the path eventually reaches you. That means you can build an elaborate maze of death for the zombies to run through while you observe from a safe location. That's the tower defense part.\n\nThere's lots of different traps, starting with wood and upgraded to metal/electric, like a conveyor belt and a spring loaded plate that yeets zombies off. I like to use the traps that knock the zombies off the maze so they have to run through the gauntlet all over again.\n\nThere is a plot, I guess. But you don't play these for a storyline. This is just good old zombie slaughter. You're gonna hole up in your base before that clock strikes midnight, double and triple checking your traps, closing doors, checking power, and making final repairs. Because when they start coming, all you can really do is watch and hope you planned your defenses well.", "timestamp_created": 1630448448, "timestamp_updated": 1675533744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649010956287384033", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128685980": {"recommendationid": "128685980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304383110", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 6606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1947, "last_played": 1700278823}, "language": "english", "review": "The following is my experience with the game exclusively in singleplayer:\n\nI've played thousands of hours worth of other survival games across console and pc, such as Ark, The Forest, 7 Days to Die, Grounded, etc... this game, in less than 35hrs at the time of writing this, has become my FAVORITE survival game. I am blown away by how much content and depth is in this game. It baffles me that it isn't much more popular than it is, but I think that's partly due to a large amount of the current quality in the game originating from their latest massive overhaul update (A.2.0.0), which just released right before I played the game for the first time.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] HUGE open world. Much, much bigger than most games out there. When I opened the map for the first time, I thought to myself \"wow, this map looks huge\" and I only understood probably about 10% the actual size of it, no joke.\n[*] Persistent loot and resources. As far as I've seen, nothing despawns or respawns (I killed a deer in broad daylight and then came back to harvest it at night and it was exactly where I left it, nowhere near my house) except zombies and animals; They definitely respawn.\n[*] High skill ceiling (or at the very least a knowledge curve) for learning the ins/outs of the game and putting lots of hours into it.\n[*] Challenging combat that rewards strategic decisions and careful choices between fight/flight.\n[*] Day/night cycle has a much more natural feel than most survival games, since it takes 2hrs (default) for a single day to pass (more on this in Cons as well)\n[*] Zombie behavior, abilities, senses, etc are a lot more unique than I see in most zombie survival games. I found myself expecting them to be much different than they really were, leading to some pretty interesting discoveries and experiences along the way.\n[*] Food system actually makes sense and doesn't make you feel like you're constantly tending to a crying baby like most survival games. I think this partly stems from the longer day/night cycle, and it's a welcome feature in my book.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Due to the slow day/night cycle of this game in combination with the choice of visuals, you end up spending probably at least 30% of your time in the dark, barely able to see anything outside of your small flashlight radius, and the only reason I even knew I could turn on the flashlight was because I went into the keybind settings and found it there. EDIT: less than 2 days after I wrote this review, they adjusted the brightness for sunrise and sunset, so the issue about being in the dark is nowhere near as bad as it used to be! It's also worth mentioning I would have known about the flashlight from the game's in-game tutorial but I happened to pick up this game during a brief window of time when there was a bug with the tutorial system, so I wasn't able to experience the tutorial.\n[*] This game is VERY difficult, especially for newcomers. I tried playing on normal difficulty and couldn't survive the 1st night in my base. This isn't 100% bad, but I feel the game doesn't do a good job easing into things for players who are learning.\n[*] Despite having a stealth system, there are certain conditions in which zombies will always know your exact location from any distance. For an experienced player this isn't a huge problem because you understand these conditions, but it's confusing and frustrating when you don't know what's going on.\n[*] Lacking a sufficient base can cause you to lose HUGE amounts of progress with barely any warning. First time I tried to [spoiler] survive night 5, my entire wooden house burned to the ground along with everything inside it (including me lol). [/spoiler]\n[*] Massive storage space hog (70gb).\n[*] Possibility to lose progress when major updates drop.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1671226301, "timestamp_updated": 1673286121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646276116371154785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88270117": {"recommendationid": "88270117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232094960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1615504194}, "language": "english", "review": "Where do I even start.\n\nFrom what I've read, this game came out a year ago. Now, I've played several survival craft games and to be honest, this one takes the crown for literally the worst one. Here's why:\n\n-Hit Registration:\nHoly cow, hitting zombies, trees, animals, rocks feels like actual work. You cant be too far, but you cant be too close to land a hit. Sometimes you'll be at the right distance, and you'll see your weapon/tool hit your target, but it won't register. This made farming wood and stone so awful, and fighting zombies a chore. \n\n-Building:\nBuilding is very clunky. Even the most basic building parts ( wooden walls, floors, etc ) take more than they should. Or at least it feels like it because you only get 2 logs and two branches from 99 percent of the trees. Trying to build your first base into something other than a 4x4 cube will make you cry, because you will spend a majority of your first day chopping down wood. I wanted to explore the city more, but I was scared that if I didn't have a proper base by nighttime, I'd be destroyed by the hoard. \n\n-The Waves:\nI've already stated that the hit registration is bad, but the waves are just pathetic. Very repetitive, easy to dodge. Most zombies can be stun-locked if you have a friend. You don't get much reward from killing the zombies too, other than research material. And if you're new to the game, you're clueless about what research material is used for. \n\n-Stamina consumption:\nNEVER have I played a game where consuming all your stamina will make you lose health. I understand losing health if you run out of stamina in the water, but making me lose health for basic things like jumping, running, and swinging my weapon is absurd. If you don't eat enough, your max stamina and health will be reduced. BUT only some foods will refill your health and stamina to full again. The game doesn't tell you that though. \n\nIn conclusion, \nthis game is not at all worth its hefty price. If you want a zombie hoard game, play 7 Days to Die. If you want a fun survival craft game, play valheim.

Be wary of the overly high praise for this game, I purchased the game based on the reviews and I have so far been disappointed.\n\nPros:\nCharacter Customization: pretty good, you can change pretty much every facial feature but not the body.\nGame Customization: pretty good, there are plenty of sliders so you can set the game up to match your play style.\nLoot/Resources: you will never run out (depending on how you set up your game), in fact, you will have more resources than you have space to store them.\nArmor/weapons: the models for the armor look good (Mad Max style), all armor and weapons are upgradeable.\nBase Building: unlimited (as long as you have the resources), you can build as big of a base as you want.\nBugs/Glitches: very few, the game will stutter on occasion, which depending on the difficulty level you set up could be fatal.\n\nCons:\n\nStory: minimal, there is one story line and no side quests, the story is simple and not at all interesting, basically you find your first journal which will give you map coordinates to the next one, there are 7 journals.\nLandscape and Building:  there are a lot of areas that are not complete, basically just blank space, no texture or detail, some of the assets used to populate the areas don't match with other assets in the area, like street lights that are 3-4 stories tall and electrical posts that are only 1-2 stories tall, sometimes you will come across street lights in the middle of the street and guard rails in the middle of the street instead of on the sides, most of the buildings have no texture or definition, the only thing in them are zombies and loot boxes\nCrafting: Personally I think this is the worst part of the game, I believe I counted around 11 different work benches you will need to make and you will use almost all of them just to make 1 complete item, you will need alot of resources and components, but unfortunately you will never have enough storage space for all the crap you need, basically build a base for all the storage boxes you will need, another for all the crafting benches.  Each storage box has 10 slots, some items will stack, other will not.  In order to progress in your skill tree you need skill books you find in various buildings, most of the important skill books are not very plentiful, you will need to find these skill books to make tier 2 and 3 level items.  The Crafting aspect of this game is what has ruined the game for me, the components needed are realistic but if I wanted realism I wouldn't play a Zombie game.\nReplayability: personally I don't see this game lasting very long, it will be a game that gets boring really fast, because really all you do is build a base and get attacked by waves of zombies every night, like I mentioned earlier there is almost no story, there is no economy (you can't buy or sell anything), there are no other NPC's in the game other than zombies until the very end (if you actually follow the story), playing CO-OP is the only way your going to have any interaction with anyone other than Zombies (and zombies don't talk much).\n\nThis is my opinion of the the game in its current state, if they lower the amount of crafting tables and resources/components needed, increase the storage slots of storage containers and hire a writer than can actually make the story interesting and throw in a few non-zombie NPC's, then maybe this game would be worth the asking price, but if they don't, I just don't see this game having a very wide fan base.", "timestamp_created": 1651518240, "timestamp_updated": 1651518240, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641980648040771484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76090521": {"recommendationid": "76090521", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966538841", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 8113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4502, "last_played": 1684884830}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend this game.

Friends enjoyed the building aspects, but the rest of the game at this point is really, really bad, just bad. I tried to like it, but.\n\nRanged combat was almost passable. Almost. The rifle has to be \"aimed\" and can not be hip fired?!?!? Melee combat is horrid. The mobs don't have collision, they run right through you and hit you in the back before you can turn around. The javelin actually plays quite nice, but only as ranged...you can't stab things with it. The animation for \"opening\" loot is using a knife....even when you have a better tool equipped...IN YOUR HANDS..like a crowbar.\n\nOMG the stamina LOLOLOL I died from holding a spear above my head and running out of stamina. When you run out, it just starts draining your health.How could you think that is a good idea?\n\nSo many bugs. Yeah, I get it, it's \"early access\". That should not mean virtually unplayable. Get the bugs worked out of the base game, get that out as early access and improve from there. Honestly makes me sad because I'm sure that if they are ever fleshed out this could be a decent game. The problem is that is going to leave a very bad taste in much of the audience's mouth and most won't give it another look. \n\nRead more reviews. Make up your own mind.

Basically you start off in the woods and there are zombies about so you are required to set up a base, weapons etc in order to fend them off and survive. Pretty much everything can be utilised and destroyed to create bits and parts needed, from boulders to broken down cars to random objects in abandoned houses. The crafting aspect of the game I reckon is the highlight of the game as there are a ton of things to do and pathways in order to get there. Creating various kinds of weapons and armour is cool and fun to use, as well as creating your base starting from the foundation, floors and walls to the crafting benches needed. A wide range of crafting is there to utilise, as you can also create animal traps for gathering food, or you can craft various melee weapons for hunting and defending. Having made a crossbow is really enjoyable to use, shooting the zombies in the head and taking back the arrow from their undead bodies. Graphically it looks ok to decent. It has some nice details to it but overall it doesnt look amazing I think, though it is decent enough to play on. The performance does run fine though the camera movement is not the best as it kind of moves a bit fast so can be a bit dizzying. Though it is only in early access, it is quite playable and enjoyable so far. Hoping there will be more development in the future to refine and enhance the game as it is. Reckon, it is worth checking out for those into the genre. It is alright to play by yourself but with friends to play it with, it should be more fun as you can build and survive together.", "timestamp_created": 1603040749, "timestamp_updated": 1603040749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.63202965259552002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96004041": {"recommendationid": "96004041", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964460424", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 30127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5469, "last_played": 1685786350}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun zombie game which is centered around building traps for zombie hordes.\n\nThe most important thing is finding a good base spot that is defensible long-term. I can recommend rooftops (big industrial ones, not the smallish suburban family homes).\n\nIt is also good if the spot you have chosen already has a wall around it (a wall that is part of the map, not built by you) with only a single entrance. That way you can keep the giant 3-headed boss zombies at a safe distance, away from the traps you build. They otherwise can wreck quite a lot of your structures before they die.\n\nThen build a trap obstacle course inside the preexisting wall for the zombies to kill themselves. It sounds a bit strange at first but is really fun :D\n\nThe game also has an actual ending. I like that.\n\nIt is a race against time between you exploring the map and finding a certain number of hints and hidden items that help you escape and the zombie hordes getting stronger each day. After a certain number of days they are really hard to defeat even with good defenses. However if you use the time of relative quiet in between waves you can easily explore the map far enough to make it out and win the game before the hordes become undefeatable.\n\nHuge recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1626678713, "timestamp_updated": 1626678713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631733596324920654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124029365": {"recommendationid": "124029365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034932821", "num_games_owned": 1792, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 615, "last_played": 1665965698}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd rate this game neutral if I could.\n\nThe inventory management in this game is extremely annoying, as the player can carry tons of stuff, but even fully upgraded chests don't even come close to a third of the player's capacity. Thankfully, the stack size in chests is higher than on the player's, but you still need tons and tons of chests in your base, and emptying your inventory feels like a chore every single time.\n\nI like the coil upgrade system, where you unlock new perks such as elemental damage if you reach a certain amount of certain types of coils in your equipment. I do wish the system will get a bit deeper in the future.\n\nCombat isn't too thrilling, though really, this is more of a game about base defense, so it's not too bad.\n\nIn its current state, I'm leaning against recommending it, but since it's still in Early Access, I believe the game will eventually get better and fix its annoyances.

A couple years ago, switched to PC and got the PC version, it's way better on PC.  This game gives me the 7 days vibe, the graphics and character models on Night of the dead are way more impressive.  I've only been to two towns and the number of different models is great.  I've heard the desert and snow biomes have even more, can't wait!
