Some random player invites me to join his group. He has a classy British accent and talks about how this group is all noobs and they want to learn the game together. Over the next 2 days he actively recruits as many people as he can. Eventually we have nearly 20 people (about 1/3 - 1/2 of the server) in a massive shared structure in our group working together. We don't mess with buying and selling to each other or anyone else, just producing and sharing as much as we can with the resources the group has and with the specialties we are directed to pick. We rush production to get the first cars on the server and had a dozen to share within a day of unlocking them.\n\nOur glorious leader has me reserve 1 star for an upcoming profession we are currently researching. Once we unlock oil drilling we'll be able to make plastic and have a wealth of new technology available. Within 3 minutes of the research completing, I'm placing 20 oil wells on the oil rich land we scouted out a few days before. I eat a small grocery store to get them up and running with some 24 hours of production each. The next day we have another 30 wells ready to place and I eat a walmart supercenter to queue up everything. \n\nOn the third day I log in and the coastal hub town is underwater, the rain forest has almost completely withered away, and roughly half the crops on the server have gone extinct. The long-time vets on the server had never experienced anything like it and were kinda excited to see if the server could even recover from it. The server passed some laws restricting total pollution production per day and taxing the pollution each person does produce within that limit, as well as a complete halt on carbon emissions until we were within the natural capture capacity of the server.\n\nAs I had never sold any goods, and had the oil drilling, smelting, and industry professions for the group, I had a massive tax debt, a lockout of most of my skills for at least a week, and no way to solve or work around either problem. I ended up leaving the server before I was able to do anything else.\n\n10/10 Would try communism and destroy the planet again.", "timestamp_created": 1708033810, "timestamp_updated": 1708033810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.901788949966430664", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160962259": {"recommendationid": "160962259", "author": {"steamid": "76561199453203794", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1712174094}, "language": "english", "review": "communist minecraft", "timestamp_created": 1710903164, "timestamp_updated": 1710903164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767938673496246338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157737665": {"recommendationid": "157737665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143349275", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 6759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4793, "last_played": 1707986231}, "language": "english", "review": "I made myself rich by selling potatoes instead of myself for once... 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1707253242, "timestamp_updated": 1707253242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754615187644958496", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158820359": {"recommendationid": "158820359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062993902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 41176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40738, "last_played": 1708992538}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to love this game as you can see from the  amount of time I've spent in it.

Lots of communication, collaboration and plenty of time committed by all to the grind. Asteroid done.\n\nDecent game, loved the detail in the environment and leveraging the consequences of your actions against it. Hunting animals to extinction (trout went extinct half way through), pollution, planting more trees, sea level rise etc.. Building your home and functional buildings, upgrading materials, managing a balanced diet, and establishing supply chains with friends.\n\nDown side, it's a grind fest. Unless you tweak the server settings, give you selves more time, faster skill point accumulation etc it will be tough as you are just a cog in the machine. The skills you take may change this slightly and the combination of those skills affects it greatly. So choose wisely. Again, this is from my perspective, playing with a small number of friends on a private server. The skills them selves were not as diverse as I expected but enough to keep us busy as we each covered about 5 or 6 professions in the end, doubling up on a few.\n\nStarting out, it's hard to see a progression path before you. As we started out on a private server with just friends it was easy to communicate and plan what we were going to do to cover professions needed to get going. This also made it easier to play as we knew we could expand (especially relevant to farmers) without random people coming and stealing our stuff. \n\nPoint being.. it's achievable with a few friends as we proved and with some server setting adjustments perhaps even fewer people but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much on a huge population public server.\n\nYou could argue that we missed one aspect of the game, the politics. Honestly I can live without that here. We elected a mayor, enacted laws, held votes, discussed issues and made changes. Things I can only imagine would be a nightmare on a public server detracting from the main objective.\n\nWould recommend the game with the declaration that having completed it I don't know if I could come back to it anytime soon, certainly not with adjusting some server settings.\n\nSpoiler: Completing the objective and destroying the asteroid was underwhelming (I hope they change this).

Every profession contributes to some extent to this needs.\r\nProfessions are really great in cooperation, for example: Hunter supplies cook with meat and buys arrows and building materials from woodcutter. Woodcutter cuts trees and eats from the cook. Cook buys from farmer and makes various food to fullfill balanced diet. Every profession is somehow connected to another.\r\nVisually it is not stunning, but I like the environment. From aestethic point of view to how it is generated.\r\nThe game also improves economical awarness if played on bigger server with another players competing for best prices on the market. So you can experiment with prices, products available, detecting high and low demand of some product, your location also matters - with different impact based on you profession. I like all these well functioning systems. It is satisfying when it works and other players are buying from you - or if things don't go so well, you need to think what to improve, build a road for example etc.\r\nLearning curve is OK for me, and there are a lot of more complex things to do, but most of them are totally optional, which is great. That allows you to learn them on your own pace. \r\nRegarding grind - I haven't felt yet, after almost 100hours. You have options to improve your effeciency in multiple ways, and that leads to less grind for more results.\r\nFace tracting camera is just funny.\r\nMultiplayer, you can join server and don't really need to communicate to normally play, it is up to you if you want to be active in communication or not, you can still buy from shops etc.\r\n\r\nOne minus seems to have your own server. After reading something about that, I don't think that you can simply run server on your PC and be visible for your friends online, but maybe I am wrong. But in multiplayer it is important that time passes even when you are offline - plants grow etc., but can imagine that it can be also like in single player - but when all players will go to sleep, time will go fast forward.

You should wait a few years until they fix it. They promised to do it on release, but i won't hold my breath.\n\n\tHere is how you get wood: hit a tree with an axe until it falls, hit the log to break it into smaller pieces, pick them up and store them somewhere.\n\tThis is how you will do it for the whole game, and you will do it a lot. You might get a better axe, which will make chopping the tree faster, but you still have to chop the log into pieces, which takes a significant portion of your time, and there is NO WAY make it faster. You might get a chainsaw that cuts a tree in one hit, but you still have to make 5+ more cuts. Adding insult to injury, the chainsaw does it even slower.\n\tBut wait, this game has talents! After god knows how many hours of doing the same thing, your logging skills will reach level 6 (provided you picked logging as one of your professions), which will let you choose between two of them: reduced food usage for debris cleanup or a chance (not even a guarantee, ffs) to break up the log when you cut down a tree. At last, we have found progression!\n\tExcept, [i]neither of them actually works.[/i] I don't remember exactly the history of the former talent (because it's worthless anyway), but the useful one has been unimplemented for at least [b]two years.[/b] For extra insult, look at all the new additions and realize that they prioritized goddamn boats over fixing core gameplay mechanics.\n\tYou might think, \"I'll just pick a different profession and have somebody else get wood for me.\" Aren't you the clever one! Well, you're not the only one. Everybody needs wood, everybody buys wood, nobody sells it. So unless you have friends that are willing to do it (make sure to buy them some drinks), you'll have to chop wood yourself, and you'll have to do it a lot. Wait, am i repeating myself? Yes, i am, and let me do it again! You'll need to cut A LOT of trees, during every stage of the game, by design. And it will get old fast.\n\nAnd that's far from the only tedious thing in this game.

Typically that isn't a major problem, as there is multiple people in a profession and being limited to a single profession is only the case on the most hardcore servers. The amount of professions you can take, as well as the amount of claims you can have inside and outside of a settlement depend on freely configurable server settings and everything else is a matter of communication with other players, which is also a key part of the game.\n\nIf you prefer to live outside a settlement we do now support that via the new \"Homestead Support Papers\" introduced in Update 10.1 - these papers are otherwise useless for towns and only allow expanding property outside of settlements. There is also configuration options, especially for singleplayer, to gain area-unrestricted claim papers for each new skill scroll learned.\n\nThe base principle of the game though, is indeed to found a local community with likeminded players, trade with other local communities and together create a society system to collaborate on a grander scale to reach the goals.

I thoroughly enjoyed the interaction with random players and forming trading connections, seeing the world transform. In the best case szenario you'll create a fair and thriving economy where every person can partiicipate with their own skillset.\n\nSadly the game has one maaaaaassive issue. Player retention. It's a niche game and when you commit to a server it can easily eat whole days. And a lot of people are not willing to do that. So they jump on a server, potentially play for 10 minutes and then leave to never return. This leads to a landscape of tents and claimed land which the remaining players can't even get rid off unless you have an admin monitoring the server. \nThen there is a big chunk of players who play 2-3 days and then leave, giving large parts of the game a ghost town feeling. Because they mine/log enough to build their houses but then disappear. On my first server the mayor of the biggest town left after two days himself.\nPlayer retention drops further and further during the server existence and eventually you will have less than 10 or 5 people playing at certain times, possibly on a large planet.\nAt that point it becomes an insane grind for the remaining players as they have to fill all the holes in the economy and makes the world feel very empty. It would be way better if at least there were no ghost towns/buildings all over the place.\n\nOn the current server there have been about 140 people joining at some point and possibly claiming land and by day 7 the player base dropped to about 10 active players. And this seems to happen on every single server, with people hopping on and then going to the next one after a few days or immediately.\n\nFor a niche game this playerbase fragmantation is an absolute nightmare. Instead of having a few big servers with lots of players there is a loooong list of dead or very sparsely populated servers\n\nI'll give a thumbs up as it is an interesting idea and probably fun with the right group of people, i really do enjoy the idea of trying to get to a working cooperative \"society\" and forging connections with unknown players. But sadly the execution and split playerbase makes it hard to enjoy it over longer periods.\n\n\nOn a side note i'd absolutely love a mode where you can't see the entire world right away but rather get spawned somewhere random wiithout a map or global chat. You'd have to set up somewhere and go from being self-sufficient to meeting nearby strangers, interacting and building small communities that eventually clash/combine with other small groups all over the planet. That way exploration would be meaningful and possibly the markets more interesting. You won't know person X is undercutting person Y while selling their goods if you don't know they exist. I feel like that could encourage people to build these smaller networks that eventually connect with each other.

Unfortunately, my time in this virtual ecosystem was marred by an abundance of issues, particularly concerning the staff's heavy-handed approach to moderation and the restrictive gameplay rules.\n\nFirst and foremost, the moderation team seems to have a penchant for banning players excessively. It's disheartening to witness a community-driven game transform into a dictatorship where players are constantly walking on eggshells. The banhammer is swung with little warning, and the reasons provided often lack transparency. It creates an environment where players are afraid to express themselves or take risks, ultimately stifling creativity and the organic development of the in-game society.\n\nMoreover, the stringent rules imposed by the staff are a major drawback. Eco is advertised as a sandbox game where players can shape the world, but in reality, it feels like the game is dictating how we should play. Forced constraints on playstyles and arbitrary restrictions hinder the true potential of the game. It's frustrating to see the potential for emergent gameplay stifled by rigid guidelines that limit the very essence of a sandbox experience. (edited)\n\nThe sense of freedom promised by Eco is an illusion, overshadowed by the constant fear of breaking some obscure rule. Rather than fostering a community of diverse playstyles and approaches, the staff's decisions create a homogenous and restrictive environment, diminishing the enjoyment of the game. \nIn conclusion, Eco has the potential to be a captivating and unique gaming experience, but the heavy-handed moderation and restrictive rules significantly detract from its appeal. If the developers don't reconsider their approach and prioritize player freedom over excessive control, Eco is destined to alienate its player base and fall short of its potential.", "timestamp_created": 1706728706, "timestamp_updated": 1706728706, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522171974182128906", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1706837369, "developer_response": "Hello JackMack,\nplease note that we only run the official servers, any other servers are community run and their administrators are free to make their own rules as they deem fit for their servers.\n\nFor our official servers, as with all our channels, clear rules apply that are both available out of the game in a document accessible easily via the servers' discord channel, hinted at before joining a server and presented to the player with the need to actively accept them when joining a server. The rules are different depending on the server, to accomodate different parts of our player base - as such official server Coast Redwood is a more anarchy style server suitable for those that want a more \"savage\" experience, Dusky Robin is a server focused around more longtime play, Giant Panda and Sea Otter are the default experiences with rules the community agreed on to be necessary for a good atmosphere especially for newcomers and White Tiger uses a special setup of rules to enable its popular unique lite roleplay experience.\n\nUnfortunately, as with every game, rules are necessary to ensure that the vast majority of players can enjoy the game without being disrupted by the actions of singular players acting in bad faith, but players are always free to find and join a server that has rules that they prefer, there is a vast selection available. There is also even community servers that do not have any rules, but in our experience those aren't very popular, as our community as a whole tends to enjoy having a chill and safe play atmosphere.\n\nEach of our rules also state the consequences to be expected for violating them, with exclusion from play being a last resort for the most serious violations and happening very rarely to begin with - most rule violations lead to a personal message or a warning at worst - and 99,9% of players will never have to do with our staff aside of help requests which is the main task they fulfill, as such a heavy-handed approach or \"swinging a ban hammer\" at least for the services managed by us couldn't be any farther from truth. All measures also only apply to the single server a violation happened on. We are committed to ensure the enjoyment, safety and wellbeing of our players and do employ a zero-tolerance policy for user content that contains any form of discrimination, hate speech or similar behaviour - this is the only non-exception case where a player may face a permanent exclusion from play on an official server.\n\nOf course the decisions of our volunteer game masters for the official servers as well as the decisions of our volunteer moderators on other channels can be reviewed on request at support@strangeloopgames.com or by directly contacting the outlined contact point mentioned within the respective rules.

You do have to have others play or the game can't progress because they have to pick other skills such as Logger, Carpenter, Baker, Butcher, and others you need all these to come into play to progress.", "timestamp_created": 1707786695, "timestamp_updated": 1707786695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503759443759918213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160553613": {"recommendationid": "160553613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309014900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1708737792}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing idea for crafting and world building, however in reality the game fails to live up to the expectations set by the hype around the game.", "timestamp_created": 1710467557, "timestamp_updated": 1710467557, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1711493720, "developer_response": "Hello aspen486,\nI'm sorry you didn't like the game.\n\nIf you want to let us know in more detail why that is, please feel free to reach out to dennis@strangeloopgames.com."}, "51140277": {"recommendationid": "51140277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060136985", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 79358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52384, "last_played": 1681583832}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game, I mean loved it. I've log 873 hours on and had a ton of fun. Sadly I have to write a bad review of the game now because of the direction on where the game went. If you read any of the posts on this game prior to the leveling system update, you will see that this game was top notch. I see a lot of people complain now about the game, I too have to agree. \n\nThe game is about economic, law and community building in a block style world. The problem is the devs don't fix the broken parts, they just develop new systems to replace the old ones and if those are broken, they ignore them and add more systems in. Example: the old leveling system vs the new system. The old system was much better even though it was broken. When I say broken, i mean it had a lot of dead ends, useless skills and lack of content. Instead of the devs fixing the system, they rewrote the whole system and broke a ton more skills. If you look at the pattern of player attendance, its clear that after the new leveling system was put in place that players tried it and abandoned the game. The theory behind this is the devs didn't listen to the needs of the players and developed a system built around balancing skill development to support both all day players and a few hours a day players, which failed because it made even more skill useless. The problem was the old system was more balanced to support part time players vs all day players then the new system. Which means the devs created a new system based on the misunderstanding of information and they still haven't corrected the problems with the old system.\n\nA lot of player complain about farming. In the game farming has little to do with the any of the skill sets. The farming skill set only deals with turning raw crops into seeds to plant. The harvesting skill set is designed to increase base value crop yield. Farming itself in the game is based on RL players understanding of how the game operates to grow crops. It was amazing because of the thought process behind designing farms and maximizing crop production. Under the new skill system, all that changed because crops became over abundant and the need for food completely dropped off. This also cascaded to cause cooks and farmers to be useless. First, new biome creation made it very too easy to grow crops and wild crop yields became over abundant. Second, players started burning a lot less energy and required less food. It broke down under the new system to the point that a player will burn about 3k cals over the course of an hour of constant work (a player was more likely to repair a stone pick axe 3 times before they needed to eat) That energy could be replaced with 2 cooked meals or 15 raw crops. Some could argue that cooked food would increase skill point gain, which was true under the old system, but has very limited effect under the new system. \n\nIf the devs had just improved on the problem of the old system then the game would be a lot better now then it is. But like I said, the same problems from the old system still exist in the new system. Skills like paper making have limited function, all it does is make paper which is used to make bookshelves. Its a full skill set that only works with one other skill set to make 2 items that has very little practical function for overall community development. Granted the devs have tried to fix this by adding items from dead end skills into advanced item creation, but because of the limited connection to other skills it still makes the player feel like they have to sacrifice hours of hard work for a skill that does fulfill a critical one time need in the community that has no other real purpose. This has been a problem since the lunch of the game, not enough connections between skill sets or uses for most skill skill sets.\n\nThe real problem I have with this game is it claims to be focused on economic development. Its not! In basic economic development you need the function of supply and demand. Ideally the game concept is one player is going to produce a good that other players will demand. Given the basic set up of the game it does that. A lumber jack will cut down wood and sell it to a wood worker who will make a bed to sell to another player. But that only goes so far. If a server has 25 players then it only needs 25 beds, maybe 50 if players want more SP house value. So what happens after the amount of required beds is fulfilled? The value of a bed and the value of the wood working skill both reach 0. At the start of any map, economies start to boom, players will be competing with each other over customers. They will undercut item values in order to sell their goods and make money. The problem is the demand for an item only lasts as long as players need them. But there are only so many beds a player needs to buy. Because of the cut of housing SP in repeated placement of the same house items, the return on the value of the item hits 0. With beds its around the 4th bed a player stops gaining any real value from placing them. So going back to supply and demand, if you have 25 players in a server its likely that the max demand for beds in that server is 200. After the max number of beds is reached, the demand for them will be gone and whats left over will be an excess of supply that has no value. This causes a problem for long term economic play. You can't play an economic game that has no demand for the items you create. Under the old system, cooked food was the only item that had a constant demand from the players from start to finish. Under the new system, cooked food has very little value and very limited demand. So economic game play fails in the game. The only way to counter that problem is for the devs to place a degrade system in the game. A way for items to break down and rot, that way it increases a demand for players. Why after a year of this being a problem in the game does it still needs to be fixed? This concept did come up during a live stream with the devs, they never gave an answer to solving this problem. This needs to be fixed before players start to return.\n\nThere are a number of other problems the game has, including massive lag issues from Laws and objects. All problems the devs are aware of but disregard. A year ago I would fully support anyone wanting to play this game, but today, I would suggest you wait until they fix a lot of the older problems they haven't bothered to fix. Maybe one day this game will be great again. Until then I would stay away from it. \n\nI really want to have a reason to play it again.

You are totally right, we did put it in with too little polish and kept it like that for too long. A lot of talents are not implemented or have little use. We are going to change this and also adapt profession balance and content in this update. (Hopefully we will also manage to get farming to a better state, but that might rather happen in a later update) Of course, this will not fix all issues, as some issues are just caused by some objects, concepts and professions not yet being in the game (which is one of the reasons it's early access) which would be required to make other things useful, though. For example paper milling. It's a totally useless skill now - but it will have a lot of use when you see how it will integrate with all law and government stuff later on.\n\nWe are also aware of issues with economy in a lot of cases - but do also know of cases where it works pretty well. A degradation system is something we thought of and we already do have a concept for upkeep for machines. We would love to implement all that stuff immediately, but unfortunately our resources do not allow to do all this in no-time. We need to set focus on some specific things at for the very moment this is - as you have also noted - performance. \n\nI'd love if you took another look on Eco when the first parts of 9.0 have rolled out.\n\nDennis\n\nCommunity Manager"}, "42133324": {"recommendationid": "42133324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114856202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1233, "last_played": 1626578929}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game. It\u2019s complex and deep, and I really, really enjoyed learning it and planning out economic strategies in various server worlds. \n\nSo why the thumbs down? Because it\u2019s extremely boring and frustrating to actually play. The game has a difficult and fundamental contradiction: it can only succeed if a server finds a community of thinking, analytical players who are nonetheless content to spend >80% of their in-game time in mindless activities. You move through danger-free environments to resource blocks, hold the mouse button to harvest them, and pick them up individually to carry back to a storage or collection area. Then just repeat\u2026forever, as far as I could tell. Moving up the tech tree to new kinds of resources doesn\u2019t alter this basic pattern.\n\nExploring the economy of a new world and planning how you can contribute is fascinating. You can tour potential neighbors\u2019 settlements, skill trees, store items and locations, and consider the local terrain and biomes. You evaluate crop yield areas using the world map and cool analytical tools. You plan your skill point investment accordingly. This part of Eco is pure gold. But once you actually start playing the game it\u2019s impossibly boring work. It feels like \u201cShoveling Simulator 2019\u201d. Why not just shovel in real life? It\u2019s more rewarding and just as entertaining.\n\nI hate writing this because I really do love Eco\u2019s concept and it\u2019s a beautiful world. But the contradiction between intent and gameplay experience is just too stark to ignore. \n\nThe game developers, whom I salute for their bold vision, seem focused on adding to the tech tree depth. But the game\u2019s problem is not tech tree depth\u2026it\u2019s the core gameplay experience, what you actually spend your time doing while playing the game. It breaks my heart because Eco should be fantastic.\n\nI love strategy games like Rimworld (550 hrs!), Factorio (294 hrs), Crusader Kings 2 (403 hrs), Europa Universalis (223 hrs), and XCOM: Enemy Unknown (150 hrs). Eco belongs on that list, yet I\u2019m giving up after 20 hours.

But don't be fooled, you don't have to git gud or compete with anyone. The aim of the game is: all people on one server are interested in helping YOU, as their own success depends on it.\n2. Servers and folks are extremely nice. You join a server and you are free to do anything you want, though soon you'll want to stick with others.\n3. There are TONS of things to do/craft/research/construct in this game, though you WON'T be able to everything at once. You see, this game is sorta roleplay style - you want to be a carpenter? Start with chopping down timber, Later you'll level up enough to learn how to make boards from lumber.\nWant to be a cook? A farmer? A hunter? A mason? Sure! One step at a time. You learn while you do.\n4. You still can do lots of other tasks like cooking, mining, building, plotting, etc. Though you won't get XP for that (but you still need to do that), cause you need specialization. See above.\n5. People on server are your strength, after all - you all have a common task. So you want to cooperate, offer your skills & take part in building/creating/researching stuff. \n6. There is economy, positions ( prime minister, logistics, banker, etc) community shops & bunch of other stuff that makes the gameplay reaaaaaaaly complex.

There's always something to do and something to discover.\n-  Do you like Minecraft, where everything is constructed with blocks?

They are pretty unique and play differently (of course there is overlap. They aren't COMPLETELY unique)\n2. They are all needed\n3. They require different time commitments. The no-lifers and those will limited time are on equal footing\n\nI tried 4-5 servers and would play 2 or even 3 at a time in order to try everything out. Unfortunately all of these servers failed in that they had to be restarted or were taken offline or were unstable.  This is a part of ECO that I feel that devs should look into. With collaboration being so important, grouping up with random players and admins can lead to frustration and wasted time. Especially when so many people are needed to collaborate and play daily. This may simply be unavoidable in this genre however.\n\nQueue my current server\nI decided to try to take on a more public works focussed role and not be as selfish or worried about getting housing points or just picking a profession and hoping it helps the community.\nThis time I decided to start building roads and getting individuals connected.\nI welcomed newcomers in a friendly way and helped them to learn the game.\nI encouraged everyone to communite and post objectives.\nI didn't do a single thing for myself during this time besides have a space where I could craft.\n\nEventually folks started moving to an area I designed the roads to intersect. \nI then began to develop this area more and other individuals started to move shops in and so on and so forth.\nI continued to provide incentives and be a friendly team player and this area continued to grow.\n\nToday we have an actual town setup with stone roads connecting all parts of the town. The roads extend far North,South,East and West and connect residences to the town. \nWe have a working capitlist economy going, with a global currency.\nWe have a working government with 3 branches, including Public Works, a Treasury, and an Environmental Protection Branch. \nEveryone works together without doing the typical \"no one owns anything, hive mind\" BS that is typically required in collaborative games.\n\nThe one thing missing is actual laws, but hopefully the devs will get that sorted over the coming weeks.\n\nI feel that I've figured this game out and I see what the devs envisioned when they designed it. \nThis is is all about working together, not necessarily in the traditional \"lets all consolidate resources\" kind of way, but in a \"I need to be useful and provide good/services to the community\" kind of way.\n\nThere are definitely some beta gameplay kinks and bugs but I've confident those will be worked out.\n\nDevs - Thank you so much for bringing your vision to life and allowing us all to play this wonderful game.\nIf you need any critiques / input I'd be glad to help share.\n\nI like forward to my server (hopefully) destroying that meteor before 30 days is up.

Even with its current problems (which I will get to in the second half), Eco is a one-of-a-kind game that offers something not currently available, and also does it with a great design in both graphical style and gameplay. However, read the second half of this review if you're thinking of a purchase.\n\nSo what kind of game is this and who is it for? It's a game about paving the untamed wilds and forming a civilization, complete with an economy. If you're the kind of player who likes to tear down a jungle and turn it into a city, this is a great game. The pacing is slow compared to something like, say, Minecraft, but it's faster paced than other games in the genre like Wurm Online.\n\nI'd say there's two halves to this game: one is the actual digging and construction, and the other half is working with other players (sometimes total strangers) and forming an economy. And this second part is where a lot of people are leaving negative reviews, but I think that they're missing the intended experience: if your whole world goes to shit and nobody cooperates, that IS the game. You did not have a failed experience. Just sit back and laugh at the drama.\n\nNow, that being said, be prepared to throw your expectations of other people out the window. Otherwise, you're gonna have a bad time. No other game has got me swearing at my neighbours and fellow players more than this game. Many people are selfish. They're greedy. They hoard all the resources for no reason. Sometimes everybody's prices are completely insane. At least in a game where people are shooting at you, you know who your enemies are. Well how about a situation where you're selling a whole ton of building materials for the lowest price on the server, and your neighbour is complaining that nobody has any building materials for sale. So you remind him about your fantastic stock and prices, and he just goes \"oh yea i forgot about that\" and then continues to not buy anything from you for days, weeks, ever. Why does he not buy anything from you? Oh geez who knows, man. Maybe it's because your house is bigger than his and he's jealous of your success. Maybe he's a total dimwit. Who knows, who knows. But that's Eco. And yes this is a real thing that happened.\n\nSo that being said, don't run into this expecting to experience the cooperation of a Utopian society. You'll mostly want to just burn the whole world to the ground and everybody in it. But my advice is to stick it through until a server dies and then move on to the next one, because all servers offer a completely different experience. One server I was on, nobody was buying what I was producing. Another server I logged onto had 5 buy orders of 999 for it. It completely depends on who you're playing with, but at the same time, not knowing how the economy is going to develop is part of the fun, as well as trying to adapt to those weird conditions.\n\nOKAY NOW ALL THAT BEING SAID HERE IS THE SECOND HALF OF THIS REVIEW:\n\nAt least one of the coders at Strange Loop Games lied on his resume. Parts of this game code are absolute HOT GARBAGE. I have never played a game that is as badly programmed as this one. I can not stress how badly this is coded, and let me get into the details.\n\nSo first of all, the game now uses more than 7 gigs of ram while running. So if you've got 8 gigs of ram and you also run windows? SOL. Okay, strangely high requirements, that's not so bad. But get this: the more stockpiles on a server, the slower the game runs until it becomes unplayable. Yes, that's right, stockpiles. A pile of stuff that just sits there. Oh no, it shouldn't do anything until you access it, but for some reason only the guy who coded it knows, the stockpiles are actively thinking about something constantly because the more of them in a server, plainly and simply, the worse the server runs. They don't even have to be near you to slow things down. And being a stockpile in a game about industry, you need them. The more stockpiles you can have means the more efficient your business can deal with the logistics of storage, but also the laggier your game gets at all frames. It's like every frame the game draws it needs to ask all the stockpiles if they're feeling okay, first.\n\nOkay let us continue. When you cut a square of grass, the FPS drops by 80% for FIVE SECONDS following the cut. It's like it has to consult ALL THE GRASS IN THE CHUNK everytime you cut one piece of grass. Why does it do this? Gee I don't know, only the coder can tell us.\n\nWell the game runs bad, so you turn your resolution down. Well guess what? It's not really rendering the lower resolution properly. It's actually taking that resolution of 1280x720 and STRETCHING THE IMAGE AND RENDERING IT AT 1920x1080. I have never seen a game do this. It blows my mind. So in order to get the actual performance improvement, you have to turn down the native resolution of windows, and then boot the game into the lower resolution. Again, I have never seen a game behave like this! It's scares me! What kind of madman programmed this mess and how did they even get it to do that? To further perplex the user, if you don't turn down the native resolution of windows, not only will you not get the performance improvement of the lower resolution but every once in awhile the game will hang for 20 seconds and randomly switch your resolution back to 1920x1080 without asking. what?? how??? huh????\n\nDo you want to turn off graphical features like light rays coming through the leaves from the sun? Well too bad, because the game switches them back on after 3 seconds. Why? OH MY GOD I DON'T KNOW WHY!\n\nOne time I was dragging a piece of plant seed from a stockpile to my backpack, and when the game hung on a frame it showed the entire view window had the graphic rendered over it at full screen with 50% transparency. WHY? Why would this be a thing that happens during the process of dragging an icon from one container to the other? Why would it choose to render it at fullscreen at 50% transparency for a frame? Just to make it run slower?\n\nOkay so continuing, there's a new bug where when you mine stone, about up to about 30% can lag out, disappear, and rain down on the surface above your mine. But what I've come to realize is that while this happens with granite, limestone, and sandstone, it does not happen with shale. How can the code for 3 rocks be so different than 1? Did they re-code the new stone types from scratch?\n\nIn the new version they said they were going to increase visibility and optimize chunk loading, and now the chunks just don't load for anybody. You can move along at a walking pace and you still have to wait seconds for the next chunk in front of you to load. Yes that means you can't see further than 5 feet in front of you (if at all) when you're exploring the game world. This didn't happen in version 7, and now, with what they call OPTIMIZATIONS, nobody can render chunks properly anymore.\n\nI used to think I was the only person with the graphics turned so low, but every screenshot from every person on the server I'm on, all 6 of us who are left after 25 stopped playing, are running the game at the lowest graphics setting at resolutions equal or lower to 1280x720.\n\nOh yea and to top it all off, the new version has a big ol memory leak. Have you heard that word since 2003? Oh wow do memory leaks bring me back. I thought we were done with them but no, here's a blast from the past. Enjoy restarting your game every 30 minutes as it gradually begins to hang for up to 20 seconds or longer.\n\nOkay so all that being said, with all the bugs present and the current code being an absolute enigma of steaming dog-doodoo, this game can be fixed and it can be fixed in 6 months if they get a new lead coder. It's still in early access, and the actual gameplay design and graphical style is like a 9/10, okay.", "timestamp_created": 1550417792, "timestamp_updated": 1550417792, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1378, "votes_funny": 172, "weighted_vote_score": "0.908670723438262939", "comment_count": 106, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1551095131, "developer_response": "Hello Hercules Rockefeller,\nwe are aware of and sorry for the performance issues that update 8.0 introduced.\n\nWe are a rather small team of passionated people working on this game and doing our best to make continuous improvements on the game.

If you were to take a statistical analysis of all the yes/no reasons I give you, they come up positive on the whole.  But whether YOU should get this game or not depends, ultimately, on how social you are.\n\nI want to tell you about that, but I'm going to tell you about the game itself first so we can get that out of the way.  I want to give you a framework of context, because I am a generous soul.\n\nYou, and some arbitrary other number of players, are on a planet.  In 30 days, an asteroid is going to smack into the planet.  That's bad.  You collectively have 30 days to invent and implement sufficient technology to zap the asteroid away.  You'll do it in a Minecraft-y voxelly world, where you can dig up rocks, chop down trees, plant crops, hunt beasts for meat and skins, and so forth.  You'll build yourself a nice little home.\n\nYou will invent technologies to let you dig fancier rocks with better tools, plant and harvest more crops more efficiently, build better houses, process animal bits better, and so forth.  So nothing new there, right?\n\nBut the first catch with this game is a much closer eye towards realism.  Above all else, most every action you take consumes calories, and if you run out you can't do anything.  So you need to eat, and your diet needs to be well-balanced if you want to make the most of it.  You passively earn XP over time, and the rate of XP gain is based on your diet quality and the quality of your home.\n\nSecondly, the state of all the critters is tracked, so if you extirpate all the capybaras or brown birds in one area, that's it.  They're extinct.  Trees take a few realtime days to grow back, and if you log an area to oblivion, you're out of wood.  Burning wood or coal or smelting metals releases pollution, and that air pollution is tracked.  The tailings (waste) from smelting has to be stored away somewhere or it will contaminate your water and kill off all the fish and make it hard to farm.  This stuff just doesn't go away.\n\nThirdly, ground takes up volume.  Yes, you can carry a lot as a player, but you need to empty your pockets on occasion.  Once you put rocks or dirt in a stockpile, it takes as much space as it did natively.  So waste management and landfills becomes kind of a big deal.\n\nYour ability to build new tech is based on that XP gain, as I wrote above, and on a typical server, not one person can specialize in everything.  You need to do a lot of divide-and-conquer.  You'll need to... ugh, talk with the other players on your server.\n\nBut if you're not able to come to an agreement, you can set up a barter system.  Or even your own economy and monetary units.  Or contracts.\n\nAnd so we have politics.  That's the real core of the game.  There's a whole legal system, where laws can be proposed, methods of enforcing or implementing those laws can be managed, leaders selected, and so forth.  The game runs a separate web server where you can log in to track these things.  Heavens, you can vote if you want.\n\nSo on a larger server, things could be run democratically.  The people may have collectively decided that a certain region of the planet is fit for strip mining, and pollution may only occur at Sunday between 12:00 and 12:15, or whatever.\n\nNow, none of this spoke to me.  So when I played it, I nominated myself as the grand hierarch, the dictator that would make all laws and promptly effed off to play space golf.  The players made a kind of communistical collective and, after about six days, had had enough and went on to play other games.  I wound up saving our planet myself, though I made a hellblight of a continent in doing so.\n\nSo, in the end, here's your summary:  If you play this game with strangers, you're going to butt up against politics, weirdos with strange notions of \"economies\" and trying to find a useful niche for yourself so you can trade, like, artisanally-hewn rattan deck chairs for space pizza and plate glass windows.  And people who take politics seriously may be campaigning or otherwise annoying you.\n\nIf you play it with a few friends that you get along well with, the politics are virtually inconsequential and what you've got left is a bit of a shallow game that's slow to play.  It's basically a Minecraft-oid, but the house-building and farming never moved my wife that much.  She didn't find the house parts especially attractive, though it's a central part of the game itself.\n\nAnd if you play it alone?  Umm, well, unless you tweak the server settings, you're going to be hampered a lot, and then it's just Minecraft with an awful lot of chores bolted on.  I tried it once, I wound up wizarding myself up a whack of stuff and amused myself for awhile by building a freeway a third of the way around the world before I stopped.", "timestamp_created": 1655576445, "timestamp_updated": 1655576445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 144, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90287470817565918", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40968566": {"recommendationid": "40968566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052279159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 21900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7665, "last_played": 1661808421}, "language": "english", "review": "I do recommend this game, it is fun to play, there are lots of ways how to specialize, interact with other players and it is really really obvious how dependend everyone is on another.

If you expect that it is hard with people that actually DO cooperate the game is very easy and you will have a hard time breaking the planet for the fun of setting a friends beach cabin under water due to rising sea levels.\n\nJust follow the three basic rules to not destroy the planet.\n\nDo not chop down all the trees at once and clean up all the stumps and branches.\n\nJust produce the amount of iron you need for research and stick to stone tools until you have the Blast furnace that doesn't produce tailings in the process.\n\nAvoid producing anything that isn't crucial until you hit max efficieny in the related skill (which is fast)\n\nWhy should anyone do this? Because you actually get rewarded when you do it.\nTrees will just regrow without you doing much to promote it (sometimes annoyingly fast when you plan to build there) and the branches also yield a resource you will need plenty of. The blast furnace doesn't produce tailings, so you dont have any toxic blocks you need to get rid of or that alternatively transform wherever you put them into a toxic wasteland. But again you get rewarded for the lazy option since doing nothing is still less annoying than dumping toxic waste mindlessly into the next river. Skilling max efficiency also rewards you even more. On highest level you make 5x more items out of the same amount of raw ressources, and since you cant carry a mountain worth of stone in your pocket like you can in minecraft it again promotes lazyness.\n\nSo while the social working together, economy and \"getting along with other people\" part seems to work fine and gives you interesting stuff to deal with, the ECOlogy part is not really that well designed currently. Don't go on a deforestation spree and you would have to work really hard to get all the ressources to built all the factorys and run them in order to actually make a visible dent into the ecosystem\n\nThe game really needs more ways to actually get short term gains on cost of the environment, like burning trees down (CO2 emission) for fast land clearance without having to invest as much time in the cleanup.

Despite a brief tutorial on basic survival, the game has such a large (and still growing) amount of game mechanics, meta layers and complexity, that it takes good 20-40 hours to just grasp the core principles. On the other hand, the game has no strict goal for an individual player. If you join a successful  server you might not need to do much besides doing menial labor of mining or chopping down trees to help stop the global meteor threat. And this combination leaves a broad space for replayability as in any given playthrough on a populated server you will only be able to do a tiny subset of professions, that are required for achieving the global goal. In that, I think that this is an almost perfect implementation of sandbox game concept.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that this game is extremely biased towards social interactions and multiplayer. While you can technically play it solo or in a small group on a private server the world of ECO would feel dull and empty without the constant conflict of interests of different player groups. This game is definitely not for you if you want to just play something when you have 30 minutes of free time as on most occasions you will have to interact with other players and wait for them to react. Have you just set up a shop with freshly mined stone? Be prepared to wait for some hours of real time for someone to decide that your stone is a good deal for them and pick it up from your store. Do you dream of becoming a business owner and making a factory, that would employ half of the server's population? Same story here - the players who would do the work for you have their real life schedules and timezone differences, so do not expect things to start rolling the same moment you've placed the working party invitation. A typical work party completion time is 8-20 hours. Now, the game does good in providing tools such as contracts to make the interactions as asynchronous as possible, but interactions are mandatory and downtime for you is inevitable. Some work on these tools is still ongoing as the game is under heavy development in regards of meta layers such as global government system.\n\nThe social life also brings a lot of troubles with large organized groups of players having extreme power over the server's economics. The private servers are operating on \"as is\" basis and frequently lag, go offline or suffer from inadequate administration. This often results in servers dying out long before the meteor hits. Setting up a government and negotiating a global currency is almost a full-time diplomatic job intertwined with extreme amount of programming of laws using in-game law configuration language. \n\nHowever, if through all of these challenges you will manage to find a good server with a static group of core players who keep playing no matter what and good administration (have a look at the official White Tiger server if you are still looking), you will be rewarded with extreme amount of player-generated content such as:\n- Building megaprojects such as planet-wide high speed road network and sprawling power grids.\n- Hauling goods around the planet to make profit and keep the economy running which rivals the economic depth of such renown economy simulators such as Egosoft X-series. \n- Participating in endless legal debates and shaping the rules of the world around you by the power of voting.\n- Organizing your own group of players, who would go together through many cycles, working your group's megafactory, that spits out high-tech products on the markets to build your economic domination over the rest of the server.\n- Having lot's of fun, trying to survive the anarchy and political crysis periods as well as global sea level rise when your industry takes too much of the planets resources. \n- Attending a player-organized court session?\n\nP.S.

Eco is about forming a fully fledged government so that you can manage a desert amusement park and challenge your neighbors to platforming challenges and obstacle-filled low-speed races. Eco is about starving in the woods as you sneakily chop down your neighbor's trees, because you really need that softwood accent wall in your new home, and you didn't quite sell all of your tomatoes yesterday, and you won't eat them because they taste \"horrible\", so you can't afford to buy the lumber, and you'd rather starve than eat that crap, and...\n\nEco is... like nothing else out there, really. \nEco is also a job you do for fun. \nRead up before you play, join a high cooperation server, interact with fellow weirdos, don't be greedy, ask many questions, bake 1 million pies, fail together, and enjoy.

Would you like to recommend this game to other player?\n\nYa, I mean I probably should, eh. I've bought 7 or so copies by now enticing various friends to play with me.\n\nWhy did I start playing Eco? \nWell I don't like Minecraft graphics and have you ever tried building a vehicle in Minecraft? So the art style and graphics were definitely the big pulls. I really like the depth of the simulation they are striving for including factors such as economy, society, pollution, and more. I feel like this is a great game that can also help show these things better than just teaching.\n\nAnd these features are really neat but truth be told, most of my hours have been spent on servers playing by myself or a small group. Because I just want to build cool things most of the time. And yes, the society and economy are great, until someone intentionally or accidentally negatively affects someone else's gameplay with griefing, stealing, or such. Or they got rich and so buy all the fancy items to slightly increase their xp gain while noone else can get any.\n\nSure these are within the societal and economical, governmental, features built into the game, such as passing laws. But like, I have to live in and interact with society and do all that shit. I don't wanna relax by formulating a law, running around to rally supports, or file a police (admin) report. Others do enjoy that and more power to them. I mostly just want to do my own thing.\n\nBut that's the great thing. You can go to official servers, go to White Tiger to truly get into the society, government, and such. Or other non official. Or go to a long term. Or go to a 15 day challenge. You could even host your own using SLG servers from in game or another provider.\n\nAnd man, there are some pretty cool mods. You should try them out to change your gameplay if and as desired.\n\nI do like that the devs and SLG try to give the tools to players to customize their experience and settings instead of forcing a single play style.\n\nIf you need me, I'll be fishing my powered cart out of the ocean.\n\nP.s.

This game is a time commitment, you'll have to play hours and hours a day to see results that are tangible.  As a individual player you can not accomplish most stuff yourself, so you have to interact with people but this results in slow grinding which is quite fun to a point.  This is great, except that the servers (most, and the active ones) have 30-day time period cycles.  This means that every 30-days the servers are reset, and ultimately this wipes any progress builds anything that you have progressed.  In reality, for attempting to build a civilization this results in shallow aspects.\n\nSecond:  Shallowness.  The game feels quite shallow at times, YES it has alot to do.  But when you are restricted for days to one skill or set job it becomes quite repetitive really fast.  For example, mining you can only MINE and process the ores for a long period.  In order to level and unlock things like smithing to be able to use the ore you mined, you'll have to eat a balanced diet and build a fancy house.  These all take hours to do, and just compound with this.\n\nThird:  Lag.  These servers are horrendous to play on, and its not even playable at times.  When you break blocks, they'll reappear sometime multiple times.\n\nFourth:  Glitches.  You'll be driving your new fancy steam truck, then all of a sudden fall through the world teleport across the map and appear with no truck.  You'll walk back, only to realize your steam truck is at the bottom of the ocean.  You can't pick it up:  It's loaded with cargo.  You have to manually dump it out, then try to move it.  It's not bad, but its a 30-minute ordeal and just after happening more then once will make you absolutely livid.  \n\nFifth:  Civilization.  This I feel does not help much, but in general most of the laws just don't make much sense.  For example, a law that restricts you from dropping \"tailings\" a byproduct of making metals.  They cause pollution, and you have to bury them to prevent its spread.  The issue:  Servers institute hard laws, they are not optional, you can't break them.  Ultimately, they prevent you from experimenting and even experiencing many aspects of the game.  Since these rules HARD prevent you from doing many things, it makes the gameplay quite restrictive. \n\nSixth:  Pollution.  Yes it affects gameplay!  But, since most servers are played by dedicated players who have played the game for thousands of hours, you'll never get to experience the effects of it.  You'll never get to destroy, or even partially destroy the ecosystem.  \n\nSeventh:  Performance.  This games performance is absolutely dreadful.  Even on Low graphics, with a i9-10850 and 6700XT I was unable to get above 25FPS.  I get that there is ALOT of things actively going on, but everyone I talked to had similar issues with performance.  \n\nEigth:  Motion Blur.  Something I have never thought I would need to write, there is no way to turn off screen motion blur, and it becomes quite vomit inducing as you have to constantly move as you are mining, carrying resources, and more.  I found myself having to position my cart and character in a way that I didn't do it or I would get nauscious.  Edit to this statement:  Someone did inform me that there was motion blur toggle in the former UI, but I did not see it in the current game UI.  \n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, this game fails to allow people to create a civilization that is able to experience the games core functions.  It's dedicated community restricts the ability for people to experience many of the mechanics.  I want to love it, but there's so much that needs to be done to make it what it can be.", "timestamp_created": 1649739840, "timestamp_updated": 1650941100, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 170, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875713169574737549", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129385131": {"recommendationid": "129385131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023853954", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 108847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108847, "last_played": 1662597107}, "language": "english", "review": "**Warning: Wall of text incoming**\n\nAs can be seen from my play time, I have done this game to death. I've explored all routes, from a lone wanderer to an administrator on a server that regularly surpassed the officials for activity. I've played all professions, along with inventing my own (who says you can't get by just as a buy/sell fiend?). I've built and overthrown more governments than I can count.\n\nThis game is truly unique. Because the world is open-ended and players are dependent on each other, it acts as the ultimate sandbox. Everything requires collaboration, there is a complex economy, and an even deeper legal system that pushes the threshold of what's possible in a multiplayer game... You can regulate everything from littering to how often bad words are used in chat, all democratized by default. Couple in good 'ole fashioned internet anonymity, and there are infinite combinations that can come out with each run. You can play the Samaritan or the profiteer. The despot or the revolutionary. The world really is your oyster. And no matter what happens, it all resets in a month, so there are no permanent choices.\n\nHitting the victory condition is straightforward. A well-managed group of 5 can do it in a week. But that's not where the challenge is. It's always been balancing competitive personal interests with common server goals. Everything can go completely off the rails when you're playing with internet randos, but if you're able to get all those bodies to eek over the finish line before the month is up, there really is no more feeling more fulfilling. I can honestly say that of all my gaming experiences, 4 of the top 5 most satisfying occurred in this game.\n\nSo why the neg review? Because after uninstalling myself, I have come to realize that everything I said above no longer applies. Not because the game has inherently changed, but because the people playing it have become so utterly toxic.\n\nSince this game occurs over a 30 day real-time stretch, you can imagine that some people get heavily invested... But I don't think outsiders realize just HOW invested the core players have become. I have seen everything from shouting matches to grown-ass adults crying. Literally, crying. These types of meltdowns can of course kill a run, and if everyone has spent weeks to get there, then losing out in the eleventh hour because the last smelter threw a tantrum really... just... sucks. \n\nAnd this is where the game has been worn into the ground. Not only are the Eco core that invested themselves, but they've become so jaded through so many failed runs that they've built up their own versions for how a run \"should\" be conducted to maximize your chances. Should a server not align with their vision, they will take their ball and go home. The more this game stagnates, the more ridiculous this behavior has become.\n\nA perfect example of this came after the advent of the cost calculator plug-in. It is simple enough: you plug in the cost of basic resources and it'll calculate the total cost for all intermediates and final products, adjusted as tech progresses. When this was first produced, it made for a nice handy tool that players could use to help manage their shops. These days, it has been adopted as a cudgel by the Eco regulars. You just made a fancy sofa and put it on the market? You better have run it through a cost-calc because if you didn't and your server has 50 actives on it, then 10 of them will have run it through a spreadsheet, and they'll order you to change your price if it's different from theirs. Failure to comply will start with snarky comments, but will get more vitriolic from there. \n\nOh, did you think this game involved you managing your own shop? Not anymore. Market inequities create production inefficiencies, which has the potential to kill a server long-term. Is any of this true? Not really, but the Price Gestapo *feels* like it might kill the server, so they'll quit preemptively if you don't adhere to their standards. \n\nYes, this really happens... All. The. Time. Not even the official servers are spared this chicanery, and it is only one avenue that level-headed players have their own spent time held hostage.\n\nFrom an administrative perspective, we've always had to balance server conditions / rules to woo the most players. This marries player needs as well, because they'll self-select into servers that have the best chances of succeeding, and those are the ones with the highest numbers. Common sense rules like \"don't be racist or wall your neighbors in\" just come with the territory of online gaming. \n\nHowever, that was years ago. If you want more than a dozen people today, you'd better set a pre-built government, mint a currency to start (fiat too), draw out the road districts, establish price control on starting goods, and install a dozen mods. Don't forget Big Shovel. If you forget Big Shovel, a flood of folks will demand it on Day 1 before rage-quitting. All of these steps almost guarantee a meteor win, but that is now the only path that the Eco community has been conditioned to accept. No challenge or risk, just a stale victory.\n\nMeanwhile, the owners of these servers have only become more toxic themselves. They have developed their own script: micromanage all aspects of players' lives to ensure that it's impossible to fail. That drives the most numbers, after all. Don't expect to be able to run for office or build your own commune though. If one of these admins senses that the game is being played outside their control, they'll do whatever they can to shut you done, often using the thinnest veneer of justification to delete weeks' of your life.\n\nA unique game where you pick a world at random and have a wonderful adventure is long since gone, replaced by a perpetual revolving door of tryhards bitterly complaining about prices and pollution, all under the thumb of control freaks drunk on their own power. Any attempt to adjust this dynamic will be met with derision. A distilled, uninteresting victory is better than none at all, and any who do not agree are to be shunned, shamed, or banned if necessary. The Devs are asleep at the wheel, convinced that this is all part of the plan as they roll out content at a snail's pace. \n\nAll of this does nothing but drive people away. Returning players like myself can only stomach a couple weeks before disappearing for a year, and new players tend to bounce off in a day. Being berated about your price of nails is hardly a fun way to get introduced into a game.\n\nAnd yet, if you ask these same core players what they think the future is for Eco, they'll gleefully launch into flights of fancy. This game's gilded age wasn't years ago, but just on the horizon. It really will be the next WoW killer. So long as everyone just listens to their ideas, we'll all be led to a promised land!\n\nThis might sound ridiculous from the outside, but you have to view this through the eyes of the Eco faithful. They've invested thousands of hours chasing the high of a successful run. They've seen the light! If only the rest of the world would do the same, it could be so much greater for us all. Never mind that most servers these days are indistinguishable from modded Minecraft. It has so much potential to be tapped!\n\nAt the time of this post, there is a 24 hour peak of 1600 people. A year before, it was 1700. A year from now, it'll be a 100 less, with the survivors even more unhinged than their predecessors. \n\nThis environment will never get better, but it can keep getting worse.

Though to be honest, it's not always a given that experiences are as pleasant as they have been, are, and continue to be for me.

I mean every possible way you could make progress slow and grindy, the developers have thought of it.  It is like they are super geniuses of grindy mechanics and have woven this brilliant tapestry with many layers fabricated from pure grind.   Its not any one thing, but a bunch of mechanics woven together.  It is truly epic.\n\nLet me put it this way.  In minecraft you chop down a tree and get some blocks of wood.  1 wood turns into 4 planks which in turn turns into 4 sticks.  So from 1 wood, you get 16 sticks.  This game takes the opposite approach.  Let me give you an example.  You would think an iron ingot would not be too hard to acquire, but you would be dead wrong.\n\nFirst off there is a large tech tree of items you need for privilege of actually making said ingot, but lets talk about resources assuming you have all these machines made just so you can make an iron ingot and upgrade from stone tools.  First you need iron ore to turn into crushed iron ore.  You need 12 iron ore, to make a single crushed iron ore.  You then need to wash this crushed ore to turn it into cleaned (concentrated) ore.  It takes 5 crushed ore to make one cleaned ore.  So now we are up to 60 ore needed so far.  But then to smelt it, you need 2 cleaned ore, now you are up to 120 ore needed.  Now to be fair, this yields 3 ingots which is 40 ore per ingot, which is quite ridiculous.  Now to make that iron axe or whatever tool you want, you need 5 ingots.\n\nDoing the math, now lets see, you need 200 ore for ONE very basic iron tool.  Also, you will need to repair it with multiple iron ingots.\n\nThis is just one example of grind, resource grinds.  \n\nThen there is the fact that the play can't carry very many items.  Things like dirt you can only carry ONE of.  Wood and iron ore, you can carry 20 of.  You also can't carry more than one type of these bulk items.  IE: You have some dirt, you can't pick up a rock.  Or you have some rocks, but you can't pick up any wood.\n\nThere is a cart, which you can drag around which you can store multiple types of things in.  Its not too hard to get, but even that is super limited because the cart can't go up hill.  You need to build roads and ramps if you want to go up hill.   This game doesn't have any real flat terrain.  Everything is either up hill or down hill with the exception of small patches of ground that are on the same level.\n\nSo we now have one kind of logistical grind, the in ability to transport and carry items you need LOTS of.\n\nNow you want to use a cart, you will need ramps.  Early ramps are made out of dirt.  You need to fill some stockpiles full of dirt to craft ramps.  Normally you can put 20 rocks/wood/ore or whatever in each slot in a stock pile.  But dirt, for some reason can only have 5 per slot.  You need a lot of dirt to make a lot of ramps.  More grind for no good reason.\n\nLets not forget to talk about trees.  I have been playing this game for 17 hours are the time of this review and not a single tree has re-grown.  Yes I have planted them into the ground.  The reason is that they do not grow for like 4 REAL days.  Not game days, but 4 actual server up-time real-world days.  I have been playing single player so with 17 hours of play time, not a full game day has passed yet, let alone 4 of them.  \n\nThen there are skills you need to unlock.  I am not talking about talent points which enable you to use the skills, but I am talking about the ability to unlock a skill so that you have the privilege of spending a talent point.  It has some crazy tech research tree you need to do for every skill, which generally includes a lot of resources, adding to the grind.\n\nOh, to make matters even worse, many machines need to be in a room, like an anvil, or a kiln, or whatever.  These things do not work outside.  This means you need to build a house which uses a HUGE amount of resources considering how many logs need to be chopped then turned into hewen logs which then are turned into walls, floors and ceilings.  You also can't pack these machines into a single house unless its huge because they also have some kind of space requirement which is much bigger than the actual model.  So you may place a few machines in your house and they all stop working because some mystical machine volume of space was violated.\n\nThen there is your xp rate which gives you talent points so you can like mine stuff or grow food.  This is based on a balanced diet and how big and how nice your house is.  You earn this xp every real-world game day.\n\nAnyway, I hope I have given you a taste on the truly insane grind of this game.  If there was a nobel prize for making grindy games, I am sure the devs would have easily won.\n\nThere is so much more grind I didn't even touch on.  Its a shame because the world is very nice to look at, and the premise of the game is really cool.  The game design has been poisoned by tapestry of grind.  Maybe one day the devs will pull their heads out from their asses, and will re-work the game design.  Currently, only hard-core players need to apply.  This game will never be a main-stream game and will always cater to a very tiny market of players.\n", "timestamp_created": 1600911524, "timestamp_updated": 1600911524, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 175, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.872369587421417236", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84560492": {"recommendationid": "84560492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040663831", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5692, "last_played": 1695163779}, "language": "english", "review": "94 hours in just over a week, ggwp, didn't like living a normal life anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1610469250, "timestamp_updated": 1610469250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 62, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86916428804397583", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137374001": {"recommendationid": "137374001", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990168161", "num_games_owned": 953, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 37933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18333, "last_played": 1708968327}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished my first full playthough of the game.

My husband and I played it through to victory. With only 2 of us playing, the pollution aspect of the game was minimal (mostly the wet tailings and water/air quality during metal processing). We enjoyed building our industry areas, farm lands, luxury houses, and commercial areas. We also built an awesome capitol building. With the 2 of us, most of the buildings were just for looks - not really needed, but we had fun being creative. My complaint is too few decorative objects. For example, I built a restaurant, and other than tables and chairs, there wasn't much to show off the dining area. Also, a hotel - I'd love to have things to decorate a lobby other than a couple potted plants and couches. Maybe a reception desk, paintings for the walls, etc. Different size tables. Items to put on tables. Being able to put items on top of rugs (an option to make different colored rugs/carpets of the various types). Just little things that would add to the decor of rooms. \nThe grind is real. Everything you build takes a ton of harvesting. We actually enjoyed that, and I really loved the logistics of finding places for everything and putting raw materials in the various needed locations to be processed. We ended up building massive amounts of the large lumber stockpiles and often had them filled to the brim. We actually also liked that there were so many different pieces that were needed to make each item.

But I can't. Let me tell you why...\n\n...first of all : the game itself is really good! It has decent graphics, there's a ton of stuff to do and you can build whatever you come up with (as long as you keep an eye on not destroying the enviroment too much). \nThere's a tech tree with lots of stuff to learn, an RPG like skill system, survival mechanics, vehicles, industry, farming, hunting...it's basicly everything you could want from this genre.\n\nThat being said it's not meant for \"smaller\" groups of players, let alone for solo play. Yes you can have a dedicated server and yes you can make adjustments to the game's rules to some extend (greatly reducing the grind). But many mechanics, like goverment, laws, taxes, guilds and so on, don't make ANY sense with up to 8 players. You need far more than that. And if you're like me, playing with a \"small\" group, you'll miss out on all of these features. This leaves you with well...another \"minecraft clone with benefits\" I guess? If that's your thing, good for you! Otherwise, maybe don't waste too much of your time here.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game IS good. As long as you're willing to play on a highly populated server and therefore sticking to that server admins rules. For some this might be a good thing, for me it's not. At. All. \nI see where the devteam is coming from and what their goal with Eco might be, but all in all it does not seem to work out for me. Maybe it'll work out for you just fine.\n\nI would love to give this a \"mixed\" rating, but Steam doesn't have that, so I'd give it a Metacritic of around 6/10. Maybe get it on a sale, the two hour refund policy won't let you see what this has to offer. And as long as you can bring quite a lot of friends, this could be really good.

No IT IS NOT INTENDED as single player and you are missing the intent of the game if you only play single player. \n\nI played a majority of time in single player while I wait for my family back home to get the game (im stationed TDY at the moment), and had a great single player experience.\n\nThe game runs perfect on my laptop and is very stable. I encountered a few bugs like getting stuck on a tree (you can just type /unstuck and it will fix it) and a few minor things, but nothing game breaking yet. \n\nThe graphics are very well done and the atmosphere is wonderful. I was walking through the woods and a buck ran down the hill across a beautiful waterfall; things like that happen often as the world is teaming with life. \n\nProgression is great and even though I KNOW I WONT SINGLE HANDEDLY SAVE THE WORLD.... I am impressed with how much you can really accomplish in a short period of time. \n\nMy favorite part of the game is it really feels like you are part of an eco system. When you chop down a tree you make a mess, when you fire up the furnace you are polluting, when you hunt and gather you really feel like you are taking from the planet. Even in single player you can have an impact. \n\nBuilding is fun and can be complex. There are tons of crafting options and I don\u2019t think I will explore them all before I inevitably die in a fiery global catastrophe, but I\u2019m going to have fun trying :)\n\nThings you can do in single player:\n-Hunt, fish, farm, chop trees, mine,\n-Clean up your mess\n-Build, craft\n-Watch the meteor get closer and closer\n-Have a whole world to yourself and have fun!\n\nThings you can do in multiplayer:\n-Enact laws, develop a community, become the leader\n-See a world dynamically develop\n-Get disconnected from the server over and over (Mostly FIXED AO06MAY) \n-Have a chance at destroying the meteor\n-Have a blast\n\nYou will enjoy the game for a time while playing single player, but you will eventually want to join a community. I agree this isn\u2019t a game you will want to play alone for too long. I am excited to try this out with my family and maybe even on a server when they work out a few more server bugs... \n\nSo again... If you want to play single player, this is a lot of fun and you can still have a great experience! Just count it as practice for when you join one of the communities later on \ud83d\ude0a\n\n<<<MULTIPLAYER REVIEW>>> \n\n (Most disconnect issues FIXED AO06MAY2018). I still get disconnected, but not as often.\n\nI purchased the game for my family back home, and we spent all day trying to connect. I finally gave up and rented server space (I have never done that before, It's kinda cool) and we were able to play together. My favorite thing to do is watch my wife hunt elk and buffalo. I'm not sure why, but it's fun to see her chase down game with a bow and then go cook at the campfire. She's a better cook in the game than back home!\n\nSo, even with a rented server I had lots of issues\u2026 disconnect every 10-30 min, falling through the world, not being able to interact, etc. The devs hve been very active, releasing updates just about every day since launch.\n\nEven with the issues, I had a blast playing with my family! We built a log home and are working on upgrading it now. It is amazing how much there is to do and how fun it is. \nThe Dev\u2019s are very active so I expect the server issues to be fixed soon.\n\nUPDATE 06MAY2018\n\nI have spent 1/2 my time in Multiplayer and about 1/2 in SIngle Player. I have to say I enjoy them equally. Multiplayer: it's a blast to carve out a spot on a planet and be a part of a community. However, I dont like how the owner of the server will wipe the server and start with a fresh world, especially after updates. Just when I get settled in and start having a lot of fun, its gone.

One thing you have to keep in mind: It's an EARLY ACCESS GAME. Yes you can stumble upon a few bugs, but they won't make the game unplayable. (I personally had problems with fishing and when chasing animals they seem to turn into \"headless chikens\" making it hard to hit them. I hope the animal AI gets reworked at some point)\n\nIt's perfect community environment. Trading, specializing in different categories (farming, forestry, tailoring, smithing etc.) and co-operation to advance in technology. If your server/game is set on high co-operation you'll see that getting skill points may be quite slow, but that is the factor that forces you to specialize in something and work together with others. \nLow co-operation on the other hand earns you skill points a lot faster and you can do everything solo, but you don't have to...\n\nThere's a complex environmental system. Hunting too many bisons for example may lead to their extinction. Too much CO2 from machinery and factories will lead to rising temperature and so on.. \n...but players can propose laws to limit these things. You just have to experience it yourself.\n \nThis game is getting updates. I've seen the schematics and plans on Eco's FB and It's great to see that they're adding cool late game machinery and vehicles and also improving stuff that's already in game. They have a vision and know what they want to achieve. At the same time they listen to the playerbase and appreciate all the feedback.\n\nIn conclusion it's [strike] a bit pricey, but in my opinion, [/strike] worth it. It's better playing it with friends or you can join a server and find other people to play with, but singleplayer experience is also enjoyable. (I suggest starting in  SP first so you'll get the hang of the game and understand the basics) There's in game tutorials aswell.\n\nIf you have questions you can leave them in comments.", "timestamp_created": 1519987256, "timestamp_updated": 1579222258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 581, "votes_funny": 170, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85712432861328125", "comment_count": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91510621": {"recommendationid": "91510621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038986415", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 672, "last_played": 1620267139}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing offline, or even in small groups appears to be discouraged.

The pieces are all here for an active rp game with survival aspects but it requires a community of people or a decent group of friends, that of which i do not have. The servers are dead and youre forced to go solo and this causes a creative block as everything you need to make a modernized base is locked behind a \"Specialization\" or a blueprint which is much to costly. The only challenge of actually surviving is the hunger and your diet actually matters which would be cool if every plant and animal is never around when you need them, you can farm but guess what, you cant grow anything with out the farming Specialization making this game hard to love. When, or if, the community kicks into high gear and server are more active then i would recommend this game, but it pains me to dis on this game. If you do have a group of people you plan on playing with then buy the game but if youre solo id wait for a sale cause its really not worth 30 dollars at the moment.\n\nOf course if you feel my review is bias or incorrect then feel free to leave comment with your side of the story but this is from my play through.\n\nI should note that I haven't \"beaten\" the game so theres probably a lot of game content that i didnt see, but it most likely didnt effect the community server i played on.", "timestamp_created": 1557661716, "timestamp_updated": 1560985007, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 101, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851492524147033691", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1557813890, "developer_response": "Hello DeadPixel,\nthanks for your review.\n\nRegarding the servers - did you try to play on one of the official servers or on one of the servers the bigger communitites offer?

Could it be that the server you were playing on restricted the farming possibilitites via a mod or a law?\n\nFeel free to add me on steam if you would like to chat about that or send me an e-mail to dennis@strangeloopgames.com.\n\nDennis\n\nCommunity Manager"}, "87906065": {"recommendationid": "87906065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012295331", "num_games_owned": 1012, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 13816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13306, "last_played": 1667872358}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish there was a maybe, but because I have to choose, I get to choose no.\n\nThe game itself is fun, with great promise, except the dev choices ruin it entirely.\nEco is based on cooperation, something that never happen in any servers if you are not part of that little group of friends. They will trade for free between them, become self sufficient, and do not buy from outsiders. Meaning that if you join a server, you won't have get enough skill to be self dependant and you will waste your time.\nEach servers start with a huge amount of people, and once a few of them claimed the best plots and start stomping on others, everyone else leave after a few days. And then that closed group  of friend who know each other stay.\n\nThe game feel like a full experience at first, but the more you play, the more you discover broken mechanics, bugs, and poorly made dev choices.\n\nHere a few example:\nElevator, introduced years ago, are still not synced with other client, so if you go down/up, your friend side of the elevator will not move, causing everything and everyone on it to just glitch all over the place from ghost physic collision.\n\nRemove the group coop and grinding, and the end game can be reached within a very short time. Basically, most of the game depend on where to find the ore, and slowly grinding your way to get enough part to build the laser. Which really is extremely short, just gated behind a group grind span upon weeks.\n\nThe more you tech up, the less you have things to do, it's obvious the end game is nearly featureless.\nAs a minecraft like sandbox, the game fail to offer, once you check the \"best build\" promotional posts, there isn't much left to do, other than mix and match.\n\nThe physic is all over the place, vehicle suffer from that the most as you will spend more time struggling to flip them over than drive them.  A tiny bump on a ditch will send you flying, a single square hole will get you upside down, moving dirt and block will collide inside you and send you flying in the air. You will warp through block and elevators.\n\nThe animal AI is the most dumb thing I have ever seen in close to 30 years of gaming, the animals will spawn anywhere in proximity, on places they shouldnt be, such as mineshaft, house roof, on top of your stockpiles, something sideway in the air, and 10% of them will run into you and bump you away, even a small rabbit will move you as if you did not had any weight at all.\nTry to work ? you will be bumped away missing your block placement\nCheck a menu ? the menu will close up as you were bumped away from your station\nmining a tunnel ? they will spawn inside, collide you through the wall and you will warp up the surface\nStand there checking what to do next ? They will glitch under your feet, lift you up above them and start spinning you clockwise\n\nover and over and over that you will progressively become a vegetarian and kill them all. because plants at least doesn't infuriate you by pushing you away all the time.\n\nTheir report system bring you to a website, that show 1.5K issues, where most of them are not solved.\nFor example, go to your Skid vehicle, go to third person, and your scoop ghost placement will glitch. Making you unable to use the vehicle. My friend tested it, it happened, my other did, same. But the dev said they were unable to reproduce the issue and just didn't care.\n\nAsk suggestion like everyone else in the forum ? be told to use mods instead.\nThey do not care about your opinions, this is why most of the fan base left a long time ago, any google results are all from 2018, when people cared.\nA lot of your issues, bug, and inconvenience will results on google from knew issue from 2018, with no fixing.\n\nTheir trello was also abandoned, with to-do things like husbandry, and other neat features they won't implement. A lot of comments about people being hyped for things that will never happen.\n\nThe simulation is actually very terrible, for example, leaving a cart of tailing 70 block underground will cause ground surface pollution as if your dumped your tailing on the surface, but placing it on the ground at the exact same place will fix the issue.\nGrass will continue to grow, so does plant from dirt patch under your road, under your ramp.\nPlace blocks on top of grass block, they will forever remain grass block.\nThe water physic is non existent, even the very early version of minecraft have a better water AI.\nTutorial commands will give you outdated information about your vehicle\nNo information about using your calories with CTRL and ALT, as you have to figure out yourself\n\nAfter more than 200 hours in this game, i started to have wrist pain, from spending 80% of my time if not more, moving slots of items toward other slots of items. You end up dealing with hundreds of stockpiles, moving them all over the place with zero feature to move alls tack from one stockpile to another.\nThe dev want you to use vehicle for that, which does not filter what kind of item you want to select, and glitch all over the place.\n\nIf anyone tell you they have no issue using the wonky vehicles, they are certainly in denial or learned to avoid the bugs from happening by entirely changing their way of handling the vehicle, which is even less fun that watching paint dry.\n\nAlso, Big Rigs easter egg ? pressing S and D on your Skid will start making it spin on itself faster and faster and faster. Though, it seem more because of dev incompetence than a joke.\n\nIf you are into struggling to play a game having to deal with other players working against you, doing the same task for weeks, then be my guest, the game is a bit more fun solo or with just a friend, but then again, remove the grind and there is not much to do other than being a slow paced glorified minecraft builder.", "timestamp_created": 1614967463, "timestamp_updated": 1614967463, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 214, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.8507651686668396", "comment_count": 37, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1621069606, "developer_response": "Hello Chelsea Chamberlain,\nI'm sorry you ultimately didn't like the game.\nYour post is very long, hence I'll only answer to some specific things you mentioned.\n\nRegarding the cooperation it seems to me you probably simply haven't found the right server for you yet. Every server is different and there are RP and high collaboration focused servers out there, there even is official server White-Tiger for that. You cannot even win White-Tiger without a effort of the whole playerbase. Of course there is also servers that do not have a focus on collaboration at all - Eco can be played in a lot of ways and that's fully intended. The design around Eco focuses on specialization of players - but a server can simply throw skill points at the players to nullify that if it so wishes.\n\nIn regards to the elevator issue, that is a known issue, but such issues are usually low priority, hence issues with higher priority are fixed first. Minor desyncing issues that do not prevent usage are not a top priority in EA to fix. We've been a very small team of not more than 15 people total (all professions) until not long ago, only recently we were able to expand our team. Eco is a very sophisticated, complicated and simulation heavy game - and to satisfy the expectations of players we need to constantly work on new features as well.\n\nThe end game not being in the game is due to the game being in Early Access as well - one ties to flesh out stuff leading there, before doing that, as it would base on all the stuff before it. Randomly inserting endgame parts would only lead to one thing - more issues. Noone wants that.\n\nPhysics issues are known and the worst of them are fixed in 9.3. For the occasional truck accident, we got /freecar that will bring your vehicle upside-down again. The animal AI is dumb as it is currently completely reworked, since Update 9.1. It's not fully functioning currently, as the rework needs more time than available from Update to Update. Animals pushing you is a recently introduced bug that will be fixed.\n\nAs for your skid steer issue: To fix an issue we need to be able to clearly reproduce it. We cannot fix an issue without it happening to us, knowing what leads to it. Our QA will ask you to provide everything you can to make us being able to reproduce, but if we ultimately can't we cannot fix the issue. Such cases have always been either extremely rare issues or issues due to modding or other client issues. I, personally, cannot reproduce your issue either - that doesn't help. So it only happens in very specific circumstances and if we cannot get those to happen we are unfortunately dependant on the users experiencing the issue to provide a reproduction case. We cannot use up multiple hours per rare issue to find the rare reproduction case, that would block QA massively. Especially if the issue is a minor one that only leads to an inconvenience as the few reports I have heard about that issue say that reentering the vehicle makes it work again. (If your issue is different, I have no more reports of it at all, just making it rarer) Not being reproducable doesn't mean it isn't there - it simply means it doesn't happen for us and we cannot fix it until a reproduction case is known. That has absolutely nothing to do with us not caring - we can't do the impossible. As soon as we have a reproduction case, the issue will be taken care of.\n\nIn regards to suggestions: The suggestion forums can be seen by every player and every player is able to put their own opinion into your suggestion. If that remark was made by a developer it simply means that your suggestion will not make it into the game. We receive countless suggestions and we aren't even able to implement all the ones we really like - but there is things that will never make it into the game, PvP or Player Death for example. For such cases, using or developing a mod is the right answer as we do not want it to be part of the base game - but we give you the ability to mod such things in, if you really want. We even offer source code access to those sophisticated people that want to support us for a small payment considering what you get in exchange.\n\nThe trello is outdated for a long time, it was replaced by a roadmap on the website in 2018 and has again been replaced by the Eco Tree in September 2020: https://play.eco/#tree It contains all major features we want to implement. Animal Husbandry is one of that, which I regularily confirm on all of our channels, by the way. I don't even know how you found that trello, it hasn't been advertised or used for more than three years. Old information somewhere? Feel free to reach out to me via dennis@strangeloopgames.com, so I can fix that.\n\nThe simulation issue you mention is none. You are trying to exploit the system, storing your tailings in much smaller space - we don't allow that, hence tailings in vehicles do always pollute no matter where. Tailings storage doesn't work like that in real life, so you pretty much try to circumvent the simulation and we make it impossible to do so. That's fully intended.\n\nWater physics are indeed non-existant, as it's not an implemented feature yet. We plan to do more with that with boats. But currently there is simply no need for it - the whole water part of Eco is not really advanced. One thing at a time.\n\nLack of information in a EA game that changes massively each update is absolutely expected and normal. Additionally, in opposite to other games, Eco as an educational game wants you to figure out stuff yourself. So while we will explain UI elements and basic game mechanics in the future, we'll not tell you the details of how stuff works. You're supposed to find that out yourself. If that is not an activity you like to do, our community is always helpful to help you out on all our channels.\n\nStockpile management expansion is being worked on, as you're totally right, thats totally wonky for everyone with more than one. But you can use SHIFT + DRAG to drag all items of a specific type to another stockpile and CTRL + DRAG for ALL items.\n\nDennis\n\nCommunity Manager"}, "40016337": {"recommendationid": "40016337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006531153", "num_games_owned": 586, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_forever": 1123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 823, "last_played": 1546494392}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been following this game for year and a half now and it finally arrived on Steam. I spent few hours reading and looking around to figure out if I would buy it or not. \n\nEco is meant to be played multiplayer because many features don't make sense in a singleplayer game. However, I wanted to make my first steps at my own pace to have a chance to understand the game, discover mechanics and try the different roles that the skill trees have to offer. I was worried that it couldn't be achieved playing alone and I'm glad to say I was wrong. The devs made sure the skill point earning rate was incredibly increased for people playing alone so they can access all the skill trees. It doesnt mean you'll unlock everything in 5 minutes but you have a chance to slowly work your way to the top of all trees which is super amazing if you want to have a look at everything at least once. Eventually, joining a server would be the thing to do if you want to get the best of Eco but making baby steps in singleplayer is more than doable and enjoyable.\n\nFor an early access game, so far I dont have major complains to do. Everything seems to work fairly well, I had no major bugs nor crash that prevented to enjoy the game. Sure the game doesnt have all features yet... but since the first time I took a look at the game (around a year and a half ago), they made decent and serious progress. I dont feel they are the kind of devs that will run with your money. So I decided to make the big jump and buy it even if I'm not super into early access games.\n\nGraphics are cool and many mechanics of the game are awesome. The farming for example, is far more sophisticated than any other games I played. Growing stuff is not just about plowing a square of dirt, planting something and waiting a day for it to grow. The fishing is great aswell. You can use either fishing rod or fishing traps which I absolutely like because you can catch fishes without being forced to fish 24/7 with your rod near a river. The hunting is fun awell and well paired with a very in depth cooking skill tree.  \nIt's pretty awesome that you have to research part of the skill trees so you're not able to unlock everything in no time. The grinding though is not awful and boring. You have to grind a bit to progress your skill trees and research new skills but it's not requiring an indecent amount of time and ressources. It's pretty well balanced so far for EA game. Again, all this is in singleplayer only as I didnt try the multiplayer yet.\n\nI think the most interesting thing about this game is the main objective of the game... preventing destruction of planet by a meteor... without destroying the planet yourself in the process... cuz yes, species can disappear. Killed all the hares? Well no more hares. You're screwed! It requires players to care of not just mindlessly overfarming every ressources but only take what they really need. Gather more often but less to give the species time to spread else they'll disappear forever. Make sure to replant trees cuz no, trees don't magically grow everywhere like in minecraft! I mean it's super amazing. And you have to mind about all this while rushing to prevent that meteor from destroying the planet. GG!\n\nIf devs keep going, it'll be a great game but also a very nice educational tool to show people that getting all kind of fancy technologies to live longer will be useless if we destroy the planet by the time we acquire them.\n\nI dont recommend this game to people that hate all sort of grinding  nor to people that want super realstic survival game. IN this game, you can't die. Animals wont try to eat you by night either. You just need to manage your food intake to earn as much skill points as possible before planet destruction. But it's not a game where you'll die constantly because you can't find something to eat. It's all about quickly building a civilization as optimally as possible to destroy a meteor and make sure the planet is safe and healthy at the end.", "timestamp_created": 1518403229, "timestamp_updated": 1518403229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850396394729614258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51004686": {"recommendationid": "51004686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198429536119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 21839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7415, "last_played": 1703728620}, "language": "english", "review": "After about 100 hours of playing, I am still a little on the fence with this game. The game play is good. I really like the concept. And the developers are actively working on upgrades, and fixes (All pluses in my book). Also, the point of trying to advance the worlds civilization and technology to stop an asteroid from destroying the planet, is a great idea for a Minecraft style game. However, I find that virtually all the servers I have attempted to play typically disappear after about 6 to 10 days.\n\n          Considering the long arc of skill training for the game, this can be a serious problem. The smaller servers are typically player based, and as such it is hard to begrudge someone who has issues pop up that preclude them from maintaining playing. But the smaller servers are the ones where you would find a comfortable number of players to make interaction manageable. The larger servers tend to be overrun with players who do not always have a community based play style. Or just crowd you out. So I prefer a smaller tighter group to play with, that allows for more freedom, and better community interactions.\n\n          To really get into the game, you need to play about 3 days, to basically get up and running as a character. The skill progression for a standard game takes about that long to have enough skills to make gathering resources, and building a home work. Otherwise, the waste in manufacturing items, is unsustainable. Which is the point of making the game collaborative. You can't get up in enough skills to do it on your own. Which makes solo gaming a grind hell if you wanted to play that route. But playing with other people is still an option, so it tries to allow for a variety of player styles, which I like as a concept. Even if in this game, playing alone would eliminate a lot of what would make the playing of it fun.\n\n          I recommend this game for the game play. However there are some issues with regards to finding a decent server to play it. And that you may find that one day when you try to log into that one world you had put a lot of time into, you discover to your dismay, it is no longer online.

It has many of the features I'd hope to see in other multiplayer survival games for over a decade now - intricate cross-dependent crafting, land claim and management, dynamic world, dedicated professions. They even have several innovations in how they've designed a use of food to fuel calories that are spent as a currency/resource for the generation of labor in crafting benches. Interesting stuff!\n\nUnfortunately, all of that dies in the minute-to-minute gameplay of the early game. In our small community of five players, we were blocked from early game goals by some sharp cross-dependencies. You need a butchery to cook food to advance cooking. Three different professions. The way skill progression is doled out, you each can only get one of those per real life 24-hour period at start. So, in the first 2-3 hours of play, you are blocked by the requirements from other skills.\n\nWhat do you do instead?  Gather rocks. Cut trees. Gather rocks. Cut trees. Harvest plant fibers from weeds. THe same thing you do in ever other survival game, except here with costlier recipes, slower harvesting, and harsher weight management. Some of those features have interesting level ups. For example, you can only carry one chunk of dirt at a time to level or re-shape terrain. But if you have a carpenter make a cart, you can move lots more dirt. That advancement feels great. But it's one of the few actual early game wins that you feel. Advancement is trapped by incredibly grindy and slow work that leaves little reward.\n\nWhen we saw this, our community (hosting a private server) did what we always do. We went to increase the rates on our server. Except there are only about six server settings . Documentation is lacking. The \"official\" wiki is out-of-date. It's nearly impossible to understand what the settings do. Even after we found out how to increase experience and skill gain, and gave the game another day, we were bored with the minute-to-minute play. Too little advancement early and it quickly became a calculation of DAYS of real play time to hit even mid-game goals.\n\nContrast this with a game like Satisfactory. Early game, you progress very rapidly through the goals of harvesting minerals, setting up basic automation, and unlocking new recipes. By mid-game, there are expensive tiers, but those are comprised of doing the early game stuff, except more and better. You always have interesting things to do and re-optimize in building and growth. \n\nAlso - the world is round (cool) but locked to a size (uncool). Exploration as compared to a game like Minecraft, with infinite generation, is really low. This games does NOT scratch an exploration itch past the first few hours.\n\nEco is just harsh, grinding labor from the onset with hard blocks if you don't have a large community playing.\n\nThere's so much of this game that we would LOVE to love. But right now, I cannot recommend investing time in this game unless you don't mind very very heavy unmitigatable resource grind in the early game. \n\nWhat would make us give the game another shot?\n* RE-worked early game with a lot more to do and lessened burden on cross-requirements\n* Better player models / variety. The \"undead stare\" from the player models kills any desire to community build\n* Some kind of more infinite world gen, or something that would make exploration more interesting\n* Animal interaction / behavior needs to be less spastic. They are just everywhere, all the time, and feel more like clutter than anything I would want to conserve/preserve. We actually joked about deforesting the trees just to get rid of them\n\n\n*", "timestamp_created": 1627005853, "timestamp_updated": 1627005853, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 190, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842552542686462402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119963240": {"recommendationid": "119963240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016204477", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 67530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2022, "playtime_at_review": 39519, "last_played": 1713800170}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2611 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2611 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10", "timestamp_created": 1659481121, "timestamp_updated": 1659481121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 110, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838637888431549072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54829956": {"recommendationid": "54829956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013361027", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 6972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6756, "last_played": 1695622437}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel like I should address some of the negative reviews I keep seeing. \n\nEco is an excellent game! A more mature version of Minecraft with a focus on technological development and camaraderie. It has some surprising realism. Most of the negative reviews are the community servers; there are many that will have a bunch of people mucking about, making a mess, and not working together to solve the game-ending crisis. I find this quite funny since we face ecological and environmental ruin in the real world, and similarly; no one seems to care. I don't think this is a negative mark against the game but it's something to keep in mind. This game is best played with friends especially if you want any hope of actually progressing towards an objective.\n\nThe building and tech progression in the game is very fun. Resource gathering can be a chore early on, but as someone who enjoyed mindlessly mining in Minecraft; I found it to be enjoyable. Things can take a lot of time, but this is configurable when you host a server. You can play a game that lasts a month of real time, or a week, or a day -- whatever you tweak the exp/skill rates and meteor impact time to. Because of the skill points and specializations; you can play with a massive number of people who need to coordinate their professions to be able to achieve success, or play with a handful of people with a higher skill rate who multi-task several professions as needed.\n\nThe game runs alright, but some lower-spec'd computers may have a problem.

The game is meant and was created to be a cooperative journey with an entire server of players; however, many players form into groups which share resources among each other and more or less shut other players (solo players, specifically) out of their ecosystem. Groups that share resources are at an unequivocal advantage to solo players or groups smaller than themselves, and by shutting off trade to the larger server, or worse, trading resources at an immensely lower price than solo players could comfortably handle, they harm the entire server's economy and incentive to continue playing. A result of inter-group 'communism' is the entire server population being neutered early on due to lack of motivation or collaboration through trade (groups are largely self-sufficient, especially early game.), this lack of motivation is firstly felt by solo players who already have nothing tethering them to a server, and then secondly by smaller groups who are either left in the dust by larger groups or have nearly no one left to collaborate with. The somewhat competitive economy simulation is what I enjoy most about this game, and unfortunately, I find very little of it in most server's because of self-sufficient groups.", "timestamp_created": 1704432377, "timestamp_updated": 1704432377, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.831486225128173828", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1704448538, "developer_response": "Hello Dekeomi,\nwith Eco being a game around founding a working society with players from all around the world with different opinions and playstyles to collaboratively prevent a catastrophe affecting everyone equally the experience naturally always also depends on what players do.

At 147 hours in and walking away with catharsis I haven't felt in years, let's start.\n\nEco is a 3D game based around block/voxel dynamics, similar to the Minecraft-genre, focusing on resource collection, processing, and the building of structures and items. There's no combat, as it seeks to be a large, co-operative experience of players against an impending doom clock of a planet-killing meteor. The exact settings can change; I played on the default 30 day timer with a group of 3 regulars and 4 irregulars. That is 30 real days, not ingame.\n\nThere's a lot to unpack with this game. \n\nFor one, the resource gathering and processing is simple and tedious to its core. I'm talking \"Click to mine dirt, click to drop dirt, click to mine dirt, repeat 500 times for a basic road\". Logistics is a valid concern at all steps as well. You must locate, build a transport route for carts/vehicles, acquire resources, process onsite or at a location, then if necessary, secondary or tertiary processing for a finalized product. As one goes up the tech tree, the more complex the intermediate steps become, but with the menial labor aspect of it constant and unchanging for the majority of the game. Repeat this for upwards of five or more resources, and you start to imagine some of the regular problems.\n\nEco is 'intended', or built towards, individual players specializing in certain job fields. This is as much an artificial limit as a pragmatic one--you only gain X amount of skill points over a time period of hours, then days and weeks. Now factor in doing the various, hours-long labors certain supply chains require. 'You' cannot do everything; a community of cooperative players is required. In this, Eco reveals its true MMO-like nature, and what everything else is bent toward servicing: social dynamics. \n\nWith an actual in-game government, complete with constitution, political offices, currency minting, and all the trappings of real life, Eco gives you what you could experience by walking outside, from inside your house. By engaging with fellow players and navigating the bubble economy of fake money and personality, you can contribute toward the goal of winning the game, or suffering in some kind of simulated mirror of real life. The tagline 'a game based on the tragedy of the commons' is, at the heart, what Eco wants to be.\n\nWhile the idea is intellectually interesting, the execution and pursuit of it is a willingness to self-inflicted calvinball that only a particular kind of player will desire. It could, arguably, serve as a 'life simulator' style game, with Minecraft-like principles bolted on top. But it does demand a large community of, probably, at least 20 or more players to truly thrive and explore these ideas. Small groups, or irregular players, will basically circumvent this design to play the actual game itself.\n\nI do like some of their designs in actual gameplay. Linking work tables together, large self-working construction orders, transportation and stock management, are all done in a fairly sane and fun, at least initially, manner. The creation of your own workshop and providing for others is itself fun, but becoming a fake money wage slave is an inevitable fate. My small group resorted to communal behavior as a result, and the entire spectrum of government and civilization at large wasn't needed or used. Hence, our play experience is most likely very different from large servers.\n\nI very notably only felt the game came alive for fun in building and doing work at the 'end game' tech tiers, where large construction options became available. Of the 147 hours we put in, we spent 20 hours in end-game before rushing for a win and escaping our unwitting bondage to Eco. If that sort of freedom and power had been available at the start, it would've been massively more fun. Not the banging rocks together and moving dirt--so much dirt--for literal hours every day just to have a house or mining quarry. I do not accept the 'recruit more people to move dirt for foundation/roading' as a fun incentive or good design, personally.\n\nThe game itself also suffers from serious performance problems, though that can eventually be resolved. The chief one is a recurrent memory leak that eventually nosedives framerate and performance into single digits. Frequent restarting of the client to experience regular performance, and then watch it die in front of our eyes, was a daily theme. Multiple different machines didn't report any success at even the lowest graphic settings.\n\nThe art style is itself simple and based on modern Earth principles; so what we know in this world we can expect to see in Eco's rendition. The music exists but I cannot think of anything that stood out to me. There's no story or anything, as any attempt at guidance is left to player tutorials. The UI is okay but seriously lacking in functionality that alleviate player tedium or storage management. What is there 'works', but I frequently wished for features the likes of Modded Minecraft consider standard. Shift+Click for instant movement from one inventory to another, for example, works in some screens and not others. Mass inventory movement doesn't exist and good heavens there is a lot of click+dragging. So much click+dragging.\n\nSpeaking of the environmentalism aspect of it: there isn't much, but that may change in the future. You largely have ground and air pollution, but only certain mid-to-late game facilities produce that stuff. You manage it by polluting and then stopping before global warming happens for the most part. Any semblance of healing or repairing nature, maintaining sanctuaries, etc, is just not there. The game seeks to punish you more for having to use industry to win than to create some kind of ecological balancing act. Frankly it is so forgettable otherwise I'm shocked it's as thin and vestigial of a feature as it is.\n\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nEco is a very particular kind of game that masquerades under a skinsuit of another game. If you go into it for the 'environmentalist Minecraft' idea, it will quickly run into problems providing an experience. If you go into it looking for social communities, interactions, the drama thereof, built around the skeleton of a game, you can potentially get a lot more out of it. I am not kidding when I say this game works better with more players--the more there are, and the more regularly they play, the better this will side of it will perform. It is unironically an MMO-game in terms of its social commitment and requirements at such a scale.\n\nUltimately, my take away from Eco is that many of its ideas are neat, some of its executions are novel and improvements in the builder-resource genre, but it sacrifices too much upon the altar of social dynamics. Once a community agrees to an optimal form of resource flow toward progression and 'winning', the assumed interactivity it relies upon essentially vanishes. All that is left is resource gathering, transportation, processing, and then constructing buildings for our workshops/eventual death lasers. Considering how much of a slog that was, I cannot imagine it being any more enjoyable having to deal with people who may not, necessarily, want to work with me or be a good social experience in the first place.\n\nTrying to imagine being actively sabotaged when creating progression-needed items/buildings about sucks the soul out of me, if I'm honest. 'Social pvp' has its place and perhaps I am not the sort of player Eco wants to invite in, ultimately.\n\nEco would have to do some serious revision to the core design of its existence before I'd ever feel comfortable recommending it.

Soloing is harder but not impossible in some instances if the economy on the server is looked after and the people planning it are intelligent. If you like boundless, creativerse, minecraft etc you might like this, if you like the cooperative aspects of those titles.\n\nA small map server or community is fun and I would highly recommend this game for a weekend lan party, with sped up skillpoint gain or a tight clan that play together.\n\nA large map server or community suffers from some serious gameplay problems however, some people have talked about them in other reviews and I will try to cover all I have observed.\n\nIn a large world. Get there early, in the center of the city on day 1 and you'll always be far more priveledged than those that come later. I often find myself browsing the server lists looking for a new larger server starting for this very reason. For servers with crafting XP on, players who play more can maybe catchup, without crafting XP you're even more stuck. However crafting XP makes everyone a jack of all trades eventually and hurts the economy a bit more, it also vastly benefits those that play a lot of hours.\n\nA certain amount of all this is logical if you think about the progression in other games. Here though, it's taken to the extreme. Players mint the currency, whoever does this and their friends are rich. On a large map location is everything, and whoever is closest to the center is in extremely advantageous position. Laws passed benefit cleaner technologies later on, whereas new players are still struggling and paying large bills from the laws to catch up. New players don't have the skill points to keep up with the demands of a end game economy, so they get stuck. Money gets in the hands of a few players, and new players struggle to get any.\n\nAll of this is reduced the smaller the player numbers and the smaller the map size, to be a non issue if you get to maybe 5 friends playing together, or a clan maybe, then it'd be a really fun game. However the larger the map or playerbase on the server the larger this issue presents itself. As for solo play it is hard work, takes a long time, as eco takes a long time, it is a game about cooperation. That said for the die hard soloists they can enjoy themselves certainly, just expect a long game.\n\nNow obviously the elephant in the room is that the admin can do anything he wants, it is his server, so finding a level headed fair admin who isn't too trigger happy is key. Finding one who will keep the peace, and the game world running, without cheating too much and not ticking the community off in the process. It is not a position for everyone certainly and some servers are going to be a nightmare because of this, while some a fun place to play.\n\nIn a game where the players can set laws on everything, the same applies. If you've got in an intelligent community who generally aren't jerks to each other, you'll probably have fun, if not the experience will suck.\n\nAs for the graphics sound etc, its all okay. Nothing really jumps out at me, for a voxel game its pretty good.\n\nOther gameplay notes. Pollution has the effect described, ground pollution needs more sources than it currently has imho, it is a very temporary effect. Air pollution works okay, water pollution doesn't seem to do a whole lot oddly, so dump your waste and polluting industries out to sea. Make an artificial island there and job done. Just balance the CO2 with trees. Skillpoints are critical so do some heavy research on what is needed by your server, what is bought and sold for example. Then check if crafting XP is on, if it is on taking a couple of skills to massproduce materials will net you a lot of XP.\n\nThere are some serious falling through the world issues still and lag around hills at times, disconnects etc, all the marks of an alpha and quite buggy at times.\n\nOther Suggestions: Large maps could badly do with boats, this might reduce the impact of distance for new players at least, joining an established larger server.  Laws need some condition on inactivity for example, to remove coin and plots from inactive players when the law is passed.\n\nOn balance I am -just- at not recommended, and a reviewer wishing for a neutral thumb as always in these situations.", "timestamp_created": 1527693779, "timestamp_updated": 1527699652, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824444234371185303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1527707146, "developer_response": "Thanks for the thoughtful feedback.

I go into Minecraft with a goal in mind, something specific I want to build, and once it\u2019s built, I\u2019m done. I\u2019m a goal-oriented gamer, and while I can come up with my own goals, my interest only lasts as long as those goals do. That\u2019s why Eco seemed so interesting to me, being a very Minecrafty game with a very conspicuous goal. And it does both quite well, for as long as the ramshackle game built around it can hold up.\n\nEco places you on a lush little planet full of forests and oceans and teeming wildlife. Unfortunately there also happens to be a meteor in the sky that\u2019s going to land rather destructively in 30 days. By cultivating the land, researching new technologies, and building your way from the stone age to modern times, you can save your tiny world from calamity. However, progress comes at the same price it does in the real world. Forests can be clear-cut to barren wastelands, furnaces can blacken the sky, and all your lovely wildlife can be hunted to extinction. There\u2019s not much point to saving the world if you\u2019re just going to destroy it yourself, so progress must be made carefully and responsibly if you\u2019re going to succeed.\n\nThis real-world grounding is a cornerstone of Eco right out the gate. That 30-day countdown to the meteor impact is in real-time, for example. Thirty days after you start your world it will be devastated, so you\u2019ll need to get right to work. The ecological simulation is detailed all the way down to soil viability for different crops, air pollution heat maps, and specific nutrition counts and costs for every food and action in the game. Do not let the blocky graphics fool you, because if you thought feeding yourself in Minecraft was a pain, Eco expects you to prepare a whole menu for yourself while monitoring your impact on the flora and fauna. There are a dizzying number of moving parts here, and while you don\u2019t need to recognize them all to get started or even succeed this sort of detail is integral to the game experience.\n\nEven the basic mechanics of felling trees and building structures are blown out into complex processes. If you want to build a log cabin, for example, you obviously need to chop down some trees. But when the trunk hits the ground it needs to be chopped into smaller logs that you can carry. These logs need to be carried to a crafting bench (or stockpile connected to a bench) and hewn into usable logs. These, at last, can be placed as blocks to build your home, except anything larger than a tool (like blocks or stones or logs) goes into a special holding slot that can only hold ten or so of that object. Extrapolate this out to the many kinds of bricks and tiles and materials that make up realistic-looking structures, and you can see how much more involved building a simple house is here than in comparable building games.\n\nIt\u2019s all in the name of progress, though. Important stations for cooking or crafting or research must be placed in an appropriate room. Ultimately all the fiddly rules and crafting in Eco gives it a genuine purpose and a nod towards realism, something that loads of people have modded Minecraft heavily to achieve. Plus there are vehicles and complex machines to look forward to in the later stages of progress, along with some rather revolutionary ideas like a web-based law system that uses a basic scripting language to let you set laws for your world. You can also track economic exchanges once you develop money and the means to build little stores, so those with the patience to build up their society will find a very deep and detailed simulation to kick around in.\n\nYou can attempt to stave off the meteor yourself, but honestly Eco isn\u2019t really designed with that in mind. Skill gains (for research and crafting) are scaled for a single player if you start an offline world, and with enough patience you can tech up on your own to victory. It\u2019s just going to be a long, tedious road of swapping skill points around and building an entire compound of smelters and sawmills alone. Fortunately the game has a very active community right now, and players are quite welcoming and willing to help you understand what you should be doing. Many servers turn the meteor off entirely and set alternative goals for their worlds, so if you\u2019d rather build a great society than battle a rock from space you have that option as well.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of promise in Eco already, and loads of systems to dig into and master, but not without their drawbacks. Like many Minecraft-ish projects this one is significantly unpolished, with long loading pauses and hitches when interacting with the world. New terrain is extremely slow to load so don\u2019t expect any stunning vistas until you give the game a few moments to catch up to what you\u2019re supposed to be seeing. There are plenty of conspicuous bugs too, like some spots where blocks won\u2019t place properly and instead will stack infinitely on a pre-existing block. And despite the handy tutorial missions there are plenty of features that are never explained and must be sussed out on your own, like how to link storage to benches (which is essential for crafting with larger materials).\n\nEco is a rough product right now, but one with plenty of depth and opportunity for those willing to work for it. It\u2019s very much a game made for folks who couldn\u2019t enjoy Minecraft without mods, folks who needed that additional complexity and purpose to build with. If you\u2019re not ready for that kind of commitment it might be better to wait this one out until the edges are all smoothed out, but there\u2019s plenty to dig into now if you\u2019re so inclined. With loads of features and technical options to developing your world, to say nothing of an actual purpose to your work, Eco is definitely one of the more promising sandbox builders out there.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Here is your game, Eco.  This game is a global voxel-based ecology simulator where, in its base form, players must use the land and resources to create a device to blow up an asteroid that will collide with your planet and destroy all life.  You start off as a player in a virgin world full of plants, animals, trees, oceans, and all of the beauty of nature, and you must take resources in order to accomplish the life-saving goal.  In doing so, however, players need to also be careful to not destroy the planet.  Everything, such as deforestation, pollution, and wildlife populations is interconnected and upsetting this balance too much to achieve your goal will destroy your world from ecological disaster.\n\nAnd on this front the game provides amazing visual feedback.  Land becomes barren if you cut down too many trees.  Wildlife becomes sparse.  Wild foods will stop growing, water will turn muddy brown.  There are lots of signs that things are tipping in the wrong direction here.\n\nIn doing all of this, players also have individual wants and needs.  Food and housing are required to advance your character to the point where he can research and build these things, and players that have the better stuff will advance faster.  \n\nBecause of this, greed can set in very quickly and you can have a hierarchy develop, either through positive impacts like stronger leaders emerging, or negative impacts such as greed and corruption wanting some players to have a bigger slice of the pie.  To counter these impacts, players can vote on laws that prevent certain actions, such as cutting down too many trees, leaving trash around.  Or positive reinforcements such as rewards for good behavior like chopping tree stumps to allow new trees to grow in its place.\n\nThese are the mechanics of the game, but do they work?\n\nThis amount of collaboration sounds great, but it is a double edged sword.  When it works, it is one of the best and most fulfilling experiences there is.  When it doesn't work, it is a mess of trolls and me-players cutting down all of the trees, taking up all of the space, no roads, nothing.  Playing the game like this will exhaust resources extremely quickly, and joining in when the world has become a hell hole with no way to even make your place in it can be a miserable experience.  Latency is also an issue.  The game behaves incredibly poorly with high latency, even moreso than Minecraft or any other game.  Physics become bugged, you can teleport to different parts of the land without reason, and you're given no feedback.  The game will tell you when there are huge spikes, but it is a very negative experience when you end up on a bad server.\n\n  In addition, it's very difficult to join in on games at later stages, beyond Day 10 perhaps (unless they are smaller servers).  Not all servers are newbie friendly as well, and while most people are welcoming to new players, there are ones that require high collaboration and won't welcome newbies, limiting your choices even more.\n\nIf you buy this game, buy it knowing that you might go on 5 straight servers that either are laggy or where the worlds are a mess, and that because of how hard it is to find a server.  You might even waste a couple hours on a server before you realize that you want no part of it.  If you do not have friends to play this, you'll have to be patient.  \n\nI am going to continue recommending this game because of the effort from developers and the sky high fun factor when everything works.  It is an amazing educational experience, has parallels to real life, and you feel like a true part of the world you are in and a responsibility to do your part in maintaining balance between achieving your goals, those of the server, and not screwing up the planet while doing so.", "timestamp_created": 1520161258, "timestamp_updated": 1552868554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815099358558654785", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40212898": {"recommendationid": "40212898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055780740", "num_games_owned": 5601, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 1965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1965, "last_played": 1520606104}, "language": "english", "review": "[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7871885/]Follow our curator page:[b] OCG-Curations[/b] if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nEco is a Dig, Craft, Build style of game which adds some new mechanics to the mix to create a fresh experience. The depth in this game is insane which allows player to put a lot of time into exploring the game\u2019s systems. These complex systems also promote teamwork from players as they work to destroy a looming asteroid. The attention to detail and polish that this game already has shown me that the developers truly believe in their game. \n\n[h1]Game Breakdown[/h1]\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\nEco follows the usual gameplay loop of a Dig, Craft, Build game in that a player collects resources to build items so that they can progress to the next tier. Unlike other games in the genre, Eco takes a new, realistic approach to survival.\n\nWhen collecting large resources such as wood or rocks, a player must pick up the resources they have prepared for collection which fills their hands. This makes the player unable to perform tasks unless they drop the resources or store them at their base. By making resources more time consuming to acquire the player puts value into these resources, which is the theme of the game.\n\nThe player must be careful when collecting resources or using technology. Both of these actions can create pollution which in turn will make resources more difficult to collect. Entire species can go extinct. For example, when I joined a server I claimed a plot of land away from the rest of society. My base was next to another person\u2019s base who hadn\u2019t logged in in a while but had obviously been collecting resources. Wood drops trash branches around when a tree is felled and the entire biome was scattered with this garbage. This caused most of the biome to be devoid of food bearing plants and trees, making the game much harder. After I cleaned up the mess, the forest started to recover and trees were no longer as scarce. In Eco, it is only by living responsibly with the land that one can be successful. I thought that this is a unique concept that works very well when turned into a game.\n\nWhat happens if one player wants to slowly destroy the plant around them despite the rest of the server wanting to live responsibly? That is where the law and government system comes in. Players are able to write laws which they then send into the government panel. Other players then vote democratically on the law. If the vote passes, the law effects the world. The law system is powerful and surprising customizable. It can even be used to enact server laws such as \u201cPlayer who haven\u2019t been on this server for more than 2 hours can\u2019t create laws\u201d.\n\nOverall, this game is surprisingly fun and does a great job of teaching players about how ecosystems succeed or fail.\n\n[u]Sound:[/u]\nThe sound in this game is great. Sounds represent the actions the player is performing crisply and believably. The workbench making noise constantly while working can be a little irritating, but I think it is trying to convey that progress is often a noisy event. The soundscape is beautiful and serene as the player can hear birds chirping and wind rustling through the trees. The sound design makes this a great relaxation game.\n\n [u]Music:[/u]\nThere is music but it is hard to notice as it blends well into the rest of the soundscape. The songs are relaxing and help the player get really immersed into the world. The music uses a lot of piano arrangements and will occasionally throw an different instrument into the mix.\n\n [u]Graphics:[/u]\nThe graphics are a minimalistic, polygonal style. The game does still have an element of its predecessor in it since it uses a cube style to portray the world. All of the visual are great and are easy to distinguish from one another. The menus can create a bit of clutter, but that is because the player will often look at many different menus such as the map and inventory simultaneously. \n \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[u]Pros:[/u]\nFresh, New Mechanics\nGreat Immersion\nFun Gameplay\nNice Visual Style\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\nLots of Menus\n\n[u]Rating[/u]\n[b]9/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1519012721, "timestamp_updated": 1528119747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812343239784240723", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79413481": {"recommendationid": "79413481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060270669", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 4411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4411, "last_played": 1603808748}, "language": "english", "review": "Eco's a strange game that shows some promise. The idea of managing an ecological collapse and creating your own government does sound good. However, Eco's problem is that it approaches everything it aims to touch with the worst possible approach.\n\nEco's approach to pollution ends up... barely having an affect, and not having an effect on larger worlds with less players. Trees always suck up more carbon than a typical group of players could produce - resulting in little to no challenge on larger worlds.\n\nOf course, what you pollute with is also troublesome. Eco's approach to industry and logistics has few high points. There's no means to get something to auto-process - you have to nurse it whenever a \"work order\" is up. In addition, automation-wise, there's no challenge either - you simply teleport things between stockpiles and machines. Although i'm not expecting Factorio here, i feel there should be a bit more challenge.\n\nEco's government is sold as a high point but definitely one of the low points. On the server i played on there were several cases of laws... simply vanishing, with their effects not stopping with them. \n\nBesides that, the laws bely a very basic understanding of government. Making a law to stop something just literally stops you from doing it - just a popup saying \"Wait, that's illegal!\" You can literally just legislate away pollution - something anyone who's spent even a moment looking at any enviromental disaster would laugh at.\n\nEco also really fucks up if it wants you to simulate industrial development. There's no domestication of animals, and no trains, either - both major drivers of development. Boats have been \"In The Works\" apparently, since 2018. Although Eco bills itself as trying to recreate real civilization, an Eco-optimized civilization will look nothing like one. There's no incentive to split up into towns or settle near water.\n\nHell, there's not even really an incentive to do the government subgame. On a larger planet with a smaller group, you couldn't pollute if you *tried.* \n\nOf course, Eco has some bright spots. I don't think any other game has shown just how much of a difference between shoveling and using a machine, for instance. The graphics are beautiful, too.

It'd make an excellent educational tool for kids. One can learn about setting up a government for instance. The self-organising economy also teaches bunch of marketing and selling skills. I really like building stuff so I keep playing it.\n\nHOWEVER, the execution of the core concepts are faulty in almost every aspect.\n\nThe code is utter garbage. Even after two years the client has leak(s) that cause the game to run slower over time. Depending on how much you travel in the map (seems to exacerbate the issue), your initial 60 FPS will be 20-30 FPS in 30 minutes or so. Restarting the client \"solves\" this. This is my most major gripe with the game.\nOf course other bugs accompany this. (Random example: placing a waterwheel sometimes turns in the wrong direction.)\n\nSpeaking of water: water physics is super basic. They use an inconsistent floodfill algorithm with a distance limiter. Your only choice to build canals or any such fancy stuff is to use the aquaduct brick block, but that only transmits shallow water coming up to your ankles, looks ugly. If you exceed the distance limit, water just stops there...\n\nAnimals are extremely wonky, they move around with an incredibly artificial feeling to them. Many times they float... You do not feel like you are in a living, breathing environment but like a bunch of wooly drones surround you. Trees are okay, although when they planting them in the wrong terrain they suddenly disappear instead of dying off. But that is minor.\n\nBalancing professions has been an issue when I played online. This might have been improved since, for instance farming (and fertilizer and food related stuff) has been buffed. Since then however, the default world generator puts up SO MANY edible plants that it becomes once again useless profession. In my solo playthrough I spent maybe 15 minutes collecting food which still sustains me in the fourth day without much sleep. That is customizable but only on a dedicated server by editing files afaik so your casual efficient player will not farm.\n\nGraphics, well. Not great, not terrible. A consistent style, although of course as an indie game it is not first priority. Performance is rather bad, with a GTX 1060 6GB card you cannot set it anywhere close to the maximum - especially render distance is what I'd really want because the world is really pleasant to look at, the world generator creates such interesting details.\n\nHowever, the UI looks distasteful and there are basic issues, like you click the work button, a popup appears in front of the button before you can click it again. Luckily you can just alt+click on a table to fill it with work calories, just using it as an example.\nUI also feels laggy, for instance reordering stockpiles. It just isn't feeling good.\n\nTechnical stuff aside, it is a really grindy game. You spend a significant portion of your time gathering resources (mainly stone and wood). Until the endgame where you can build bobcat excavators and trucks your single tool for mining is a pickaxe that collects 4 stone/ore in one swing. I mean, it does not collect it, you need to do it as well. For a reasonable size house with top level masonry skills you need a couple hundred. You also need to transport it of course. At least now they buffed ore mining so ores spawn in veins instead of randomly (and you have tools to search for veins), that was a very welcome change. Even like that, you'll spend a great portion of your time in a quarry.\n\nAnd of course being a collaborative game if you play alone you lose over half of the content in this game.

You're given an idyllic little world to settle, and a looming apocalypse to encourage you and your friends to ruin it, guilt-free, by rapid industrialisation. The idea is to collaboratively find a balance that allows you to save the world whilst still having a world worth saving. \n\nA model for human economics, it encourages specialisation, the division of labour, and the development of a complex economy, with each player doing their part. Unfortunately, many jobs, and therefore many person-hours in the game, are INCREDIBLY tedious and with little or no scope to automate/bootstrap your way into a fun experience.\n\nMy experience of play in a private server (I hosted, I played for maybe 15% of the hours I logged) was broadly positive, but largely for social reasons. We kept playing this due to sunk costs- this was the game we had all bought, so this is what we played together. Frankly we would have enjoyed something else more. \n\nOf course, as a group of people who knew and trusted one another, we were missing a key element of the game as a socioeconomic model, which is how to maintain productive relationships with other players and communities as we work toward a collective goal. Both myself and my partner tried some online play on apparently beginner-friendly public servers, and found other players unhelpful and guarded. As I can't play every day, and certainly not for hours every day, I found myself quickly left out of the fate of a world dominated by more dedicated players. As your capacity for work in-game is only limited by your ability to find more food, I discovered that the middle classes are effectively modelled as one man with the stomach capacity of an adult elephant. Whilst entertaining, this isn't actually fun game-play unless you're the elephant. \n\nIf there are big changes that fix how miserable some roles are to fill, I will be willing to try ECO again and reassess my position on it.

In Eco your home is looked at as an actual home.  It needs to have everything that would make a home a home.  Floor, walls, roof, etc...  This makes building something more challenging and thus more rewarding.  \n\nThe more intriguing aspect of the game is the impact players have on the ecosystem and economy.  As you chop down trees, fewer trees grow back.  Planting trees is more difficult as they need a specific environment to grow.  The game made me think about how many trees I was chopping down, and where I was cutting them down.  Instead of just systematically chopping down all the trees nearby, I ended up trying to spread it out.\n\nThe economy is another aspect of the game that can impact how you play.  In the beginning there really isn't any form of currency so everything is done through a trade and barter system.  Once you build a mint and create a currency, things get more interesting.  Now each player has money, and this is where a more social economic game comes into play.  You end up with some more generous players, and some greedy ones.  It's interesting to see it play out.\n\nThe downside to the game is the lack of variety and things seem to all funnel into a few key professions late in the game.  Every home is built with the same few materials, and all the furniture is identical.  Same style and colour.  At this stage in the game if you don't have enough players it feels extremely grindy as you end up doing no more than gathering resources.  Mainly mining for ores and digging up clay.\n\nOverall the game is quite enjoyable I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Minecraft or other building style games.  Although this one has no threats (I'm not counting the meteor as a threat) or death.\n", "timestamp_created": 1577809045, "timestamp_updated": 1577809045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801640689373016357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138138397": {"recommendationid": "138138397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148074076", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 45603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43626, "last_played": 1702669799}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to preface my review by saying, do not play this game solo, you might find some enjoyment in it but the heart of this game is in the multiplayer experience either alone or with a friend (or two).\n\nIt's a brilliant, really special and highly ambitious game that's hard to even compare to other games. The amount of memorable experiences, playtime and enjoyment this game has delivered is easily worth the price. But in my view it has 2 major foundational problems that kinda relate to each other and make each other worse, you'll start to notice the more time you play...\n\n[h1] Eco's Community [/h1]\nAt the end of the day this is just my opinion and my experience but Eco's community contains some of the best and some of the worst people, a single bad admin can ruin the experience for everyone even in a server full of amazing people. This game demands a lot of socializing and a lot of time from you. That sounds like a bad thing but it's actually a huge part of what makes the experience so special. The major downside however is that the community in such a socially dependent game has to be really strong and aside from the bad apple in the bunch, Eco's community is split between what they want from the game which flows into the second and main point...\n\n[h1] Eco's Identity [/h1]\nI believe that Eco has some very creative and passionate devs with a vision of what they want the game to be and this vision is really unique and special. The problem is Eco's community creates a huge divide in this vision, they insist on pushing the game further and further towards being like any 'survival, basebuilding, minecraft clone' on steam. Eco from a game development standpoint is facing a lot of challenges that a casual member of the community doesn't understand, the first major one is this is actually a very niche game, it's 'minecraftiness' brings in a lot of new players who quickly realise its not minecraft and leave. The active player count in a game like this is vital to the experience, so when players expect all these different things that other games implement just fine, it actually ends up harming the game and the community.\n\nHere's an example, mods. I love mods, I mod out nearly every game I play because it generally improves the experience. Eco has mods too, but eco also has a tiny playerbase that all want very different things.. So when there are 500 different servers and 80% of them are modded, it really splits up the playerbase all over the place and harms the experience of the game. In nearly any other game this wouldn't be a problem, there are plenty of server options, people can tailor their server however they like but what this game really needs is to reinforce one playstyle and design the game around that. \n\nThe problems that this game faces are very core problems which need total mechanical changes, I think they're really moving in the right direction with upcoming releases that will have a hugely positive impact on the game. But the devs really need to just double down on their decisions and fulfill their vision of the game even if 'the community' doesn't like it.\n\nEco is not minecraft, eco is some entirely different beast that is really about humanity at its core. Players hate restrictions, they want freedom, they want to move fast and they love vanity, they don't realise that those restrictions are actually what make the game so rewarding. I guess what i'm saying is directly to the devs, believe in yourself, believe in your ideas, your vision for the game is sound and stop caving into player feedback that slowly destroys what makes eco special.\n\n[h1] Now for my player feedback [/h1]\nPlease, please move development resources into the memory leak that has plagued our experiences forever. I love this game so I deal with it, but it probably turns away so many players. I love the entire idea of settlements and culture, I think this is going to be a huge move forward, it's super reassuring to see such a fundamental change even knowing the community will probably revolt at first. \nMy biggest desire for the game that will really transform it is to re-evaluate the 'exhaustion limit' idea, that was a wrong move in the right direction. I don't think players like hard limits and I think the solution to the problem has to be built into the game mechanics not just a server option. Something that changes the way energy intake and expenditure works for players I think is necessary for the economy and the enjoyment of the game. Part of what really deters players from servers is the players who happily spend 10+ hours on the game every day and absolutely demolish other players. They are putting in more work, they should be rewarded more, but what actually happens is casual players have no chance and don't get to enjoy the game at all. My proposition was to essentially bank up calories with a gradual intake rate, so over my course of active play while eating foods im generating something like 10000cal per hour (depending on their diet). but if an offline player stocks his kitchen up with foods he will eat them while offline, banking maybe 4000cal/hour, that way, when that player is offline for 10 hours, he can come back online and have plenty of calories to spend, while super active players NEED calories, they will actually bother to pay players for their labour and labour will become a seriously valuable resource while fairly stunting the insane progress of super-active players. (proposed intake rates are just examples, it would need to be balanced)\n\nAnyway, in summary, buy the game and play it online, it's hard to express the kind of unique experience you will have.

This game is meant to be played with quite a few people, meaning even cooperative play with only 2 or 3 friends isn't the optimum way to play it.  You can't even compare the single-player experience to playing Minecraft alone because, again, this game is not [i]designed[/i] for solo play.\n\nWith that said, you are certainly able to give it a go solo, but realize that you will be missing out on a large portion of the game by doing so.  This also answers why you need to be online when playing, even if you're playing solo.\n\nNow, as far as the game goes.  I can see the appeal of this type of game and certainly think that if you find the right server you could have tremendous fun with it.  Assuming you can find the right server full of players actually working together and putting in the effort, your experience will likely be quite positive.\n\nHowever, this requirement on playing with others is also where the major downsides come into play.  You'll have to find a server where people are actively playing (remember the countdown to the apocalypse) and actively cooperating with each other by producing and trading/selling goods.  This means that there has to be one or more people attempting to coordinate things in order to make sure things progress smoothly - especially as new players will need some hand-holding too.  Also, with no NPCs at all to speak of, you are [u]completely[/u] reliant on other players to do their part.\n\nMost people I know won't have the time, inclination, or patience to play something like this.  They simply don't like being so reliant on others to make sure their gaming experience is enjoyable.  For them, this is a hard pass.  The game also isn't for anyone that doesn't like playing with strangers.  If none of that bothers you and you find a good server (try the official ones), then you'll likely enjoy this.\n\nAs a result of the variables it isn't fair to limit a recommendation to a simply \"Yes\" or \"No\" in my opinion.  As noted, for some this will obviously be a pass while for others a must-have.  However, as I am forced to pick one or the other, I'll have to go with the fact that I personally wouldn't have the patience to log into a public server to play this day-after-day, while also finding it too difficult to find enough friends willing to do it on a private/local server.

Eco is a Minecraft-style game where you work together to destroy an asteroid due to impact in 30 (real) days, but all your activities (like cutting down trees, building factories, hunting for food) generate pollution, cause animals to go extinct and raise sea levels. The small, dedicated community is extremely passionate, and joining one of the official servers is a must, if only to experience what the developers intended the game to be (large communities with laws, elections, roles, economic competition and districts). I can still vividly remember the towns built on servers long dead, and the players who spent every waking minute building them.\n\nThat being said, I think what I am in love with is what the game COULD be. It has grand ambitions, and has already delivered a few of those ideas, but it still falls short. It COULD be this great cooperative experience of working together to advance, but not destroy the planet in the process. It COULD be a great societal simulator where laws and elections are satisfying and meaningful. It COULD be a challenging balance where it's easy to permanently disrupt the ecosystem to a point of no return.\n\nHowever, there's a few things holding the game back from really being a success outside it's small, dedicated player base. Firstly, it needs lots of balancing - the asteroid is FAR too easy to destroy (usually destroyed at about 10-11 days into a server), making it a complete non-threat. The game also HEAVILY favours players who join in the first few hours of a new server and dominate a particular skill tree by playing for 14+ hours a day in the first week. And the pollution caused by industry activities is so localised, and weak, that in all my time in this game over the past few years I've NEVER seen the sea levels rise (and that's meant to be one of the worse consequences).\n\nSecondly, the UI is still difficult to learn, despite many improvements over the past few releases (including tutorials), particularly the whole laws/elections/voting interface. This has the effect of most players (except for a dedicated few) not getting too involved in debating or writing laws, or voting in elections (in a server of around 100 active players, it would be typical for less than a dozen to be ACTIVELY involved in debating or writing laws).\n\nFinally, maybe due to the above issues or maybe just life, most players will play heavily for the first few days of a new server and then never log on again. For a game built around depending on each other and cooperating, this can be incredibly frustrating when a player who makes something you need disappears. It creates a cycle of:\n\n[list]\n    [*]Search for and join a server less than 1 day old\n    [*]Play like crazy for a few days, have loads of fun\n    [*]Can't move to the next skill ladder into player X makes something\n    [*]Player X hasn't logged on for a couple of days\n    [*]Only log on to keep your store updated and/or projects going, while waiting for player X\n    [*]Log on to a completely dead server, decide it's not going to happen\n    [*]Search for and join a server less than 1 day old\n[/list]\n\nAll in all, the game has SO MUCH potential, and I look forward to future releases if these things are addressed. In summary, I would recommend this game if it was on sale, and you had a group of friends to play with who were equally patient or forgiving of the balancing issues I mention above.", "timestamp_created": 1623394736, "timestamp_updated": 1623394736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.79464036226272583", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114952157": {"recommendationid": "114952157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039009716", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 670761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8422, "playtime_at_review": 455980, "last_played": 1713744404}, "language": "english", "review": "7600 hours in and i'm still playing...", "timestamp_created": 1651695032, "timestamp_updated": 1651695032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794427990913391113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68597709": {"recommendationid": "68597709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018622879", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3853, "last_played": 1588744216}, "language": "english", "review": "I've sunk about 30 hours into one single player game and what I've found is that the game is filled by nature with tedious mechanics. I find the grind somewhat enjoyable, but it is reasonable to understand why someone would be turned off from it when the game requires you to spend dozens of hours just moving material. \n\nThis problem is mitigated to an extent with multiplayer. There the focus is on creating a community that leans on each other, as each person is restricted to being a specialist in just a few fields. The idea is that you will produce goods for other players to purchase from your store and use as they see fit, be it creating more specialized goods or improving their houses. Multiplayer is clearly the ideal way to play the game in my opinion, however it also comes with the anxieties associated with actual commerce as supply and demand is important to remain wealthy enough to remain a factor in the development of the game. \n\nSpecialties are tied to various books that when right clicked produce scrolls, these scrolls in turn enlighten the user to a new specialty allowing them to take on a new field. Most specialties have a clear flow. For instance you have a [Logging] specialty. It allows you to cut down trees more efficiently both in calories spent and the amount of chops. You can then take [Hewing] which allows you to turn the logs you've chopped into building components, which, as you gain more skill, reduces the cost of the recipe both in time and materials. Specialties also have recipes that require either the knowledge of them or having spent a specialty point on them. In single player you receive specialty points at an accelerated rate, where as in multiplayer you receive them at a normalized rate. This encourages trade and having a focus on a particular set of specialties in multiplayer.\n\nMultiplayer also has an interesting mechanic in that there are server wide laws and the ability to denote a universal currency. Some instances I've seen is a tax on cutting down trees, which you can recoup the cost of by clearing the resulting trunk and debris. These mechanics also lend themselves to abuse. Part of the game is balancing industry and progress versus the environmental impact of needing to rip up plants, slaughtering animals, chopping forest, and so on. There are byproducts produced by some crafting, in particular smelting, that are direct poisons to the environment if not handled correctly. I've read stories of servers where someone gets into control of the mint, over printing currency and controlling the market, then there is the instances of people just lightly hiding previously mentioned byproducts in holes around the world, killing it slowly. \n\nIf you made it this far, you might wonder, what is the goal of the game. Its simple, stop a meteor that will annihilate your world in a set amount of days using lasers. Straight forward as far as goals go, but in order to get those lasers, you'll have to go from sticks and stones to iron tools and brick buildings, then even further to modern construction equipment such as excavators and bull dozers to acquire enough materials to both build and power these laser arrays. All of these goals are acheived in realtime. Thankfully it can be sped up in singleplayer, but in multiplayer it is likely disabled.\n\nTl;dr: Game is fun, but grindy.

Considering the time investment required in this game, it's an EXTREMELY frustrating experience. \nAll the interesting gameplay of governance, democracy and law making is thus rendered void as its overriden by the presence of admins with full powers partial to their proteges and their own interests.\nIn all the servers i've tried i found such cartel invariably controlling government, city center, currency, how things are organized, and all the core economic jobs (so all the fun parts of the game). \nIf you're not part of that popular group you can only stay at your place playing a tiny role of grinding resources for their profit as trying to do anything more significant will invariably lead to their hostility one way or another.\n- By allowing servers to run custom settings and mods, its hard to find a vanilla server matching how the game was designed to be played.\n- Too many servers for too few players means they all go inactive after a few days.\n- Some servers can disappear from one day to the next because the admin got bored, or decided to restart it in some different way and you will lose the dozens of hours invested in it.\n\nIf you add up all these factors, and the time you have to invest in each game, it makes it very unlikely to find a reliable server. \nHere are a few examples:\n- In 110 hours and 5, 6 trials i just ended my last attempt by getting instabanned for claiming a terrain that a popular player (who turned out once again to be the admin) had decided to use for himself seeing how convenient it now was after i had just spent time terrassing it and building a road to it. I was immediately told to let him have it or be banned.\n- In another try, we played on a server where one of the 'popular' players was caught red-handed cheating by another player. Because he was part of that popular clan, he got his ban reverted into \"just a warning\" by the admin because surely he deserved a warning first... Seeing this, we gave up on that server and left.\n\n\nThere is nothing fun in these experiences and in the end you realize the game just leaves you frustrated and bitter, and that all the ingame political systems are just a charade.\nIt is, in a way, a very accurate \"Democracy Simulator\". \nWould not recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1589744327, "timestamp_updated": 1589744553, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 110, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790414154529571533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1589930124, "developer_response": "Hello Ronchiporc,\nthanks for your review.

We do also offer an official server that does that, called White-Tiger.\n\nThe official servers do run the official game mode, despite White-Tiger. The 30 days time to meteor hit is rather a recommendation that can and should be changed by server admins regarding the amount and skill of the players that play on them. The 30 days were arbitrarily set back when Eco was first developed for use in classrooms, as those typically played Eco for exactly one month - but only during school, not 24/7. So a shorter time to meteor on public servers with way more players playing way more is very fine. Adaptions to configurations are actually required to have a good time for everyone as both player count as well as cooperation and \"skill\" can vary a lot depending on the server. Hence, Eco provides possibilitites to do exactly that and we even recommend to make use of them.\n\nEco actually has no strict way it's meant to be played. It's actually meant to be played however you wish and with full intention we made Eco very configurable. Every server offers a different experience and a lot of servers prepare great pre-established government and economy concepts that they've worked out over several cycles together with their resident players. This is interesting for a lot of players, especially those that rather not want to take part in legislation and economy creation. It's not necessarily abuse and those server typically explain their system in ingame-rules and on their websites. I'm not sure if you played on one of those, though or if your experience is from a server that did not have a established system but admins still controlled government.\n\nIf you feel that the way you want to play the game is underrepresented in the game, consider opening your own server where you create the experience that you want to have. Probably other people are interested as well :)\n\nAnd while i sure feel your frustration about servers, in my experience these servers are not nearly the majority. It's an issue every game with servers has as well and where we can do little. We cannot tell admins to keep their servers up forever, they are paying for it. It's their servers - their rules. Hence, checking out the bigger communities and getting to know these people, the admins and residents and their rules is ever a good idea and maybe you find a nice community you want to be part of :)\n\nDennis\n\nCommunity Manager"}, "73223620": {"recommendationid": "73223620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033893091", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 10257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5450, "last_played": 1696861049}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically real world Minecraft, where harvesting, farming, foraging and making things have a direct impact on the world.

The dev's have added so much more content and bug fixes. There's more jobs now, the map is bigger (if you want it to be) the job's themselves are a lot more fun, they've incorporated the oceans much more thoroughly, and everything runs a lot smoother. The review will stay negative because of server stability. I played for around 15 hours before making the new review, and I couldn't play for longer than a hour at a time before servers went down for at least 30 minutes - 1 hour each time. There was nothing I could find on their social medias stating a maintenance, but I didn't check if they had a discord in all fairness. For full transparency, I tried 6 different servers and every single one of them had this issue, and the server admins all stated it was a long standing Eco issue. I would be a bit more forgiving if I knew the dev's were focused on what a lot of people would consider a game breaking bug, but instead it seems like they sunk a lot of time into creating avatars for each character, who's facial features can be captured in real time by your webcam to show what movements your face is making. Not only does this cause constant errors that crash the game... but it's honestly useless. My face isn't making some crazy movements while I bust rocks or cook veggies. Seems like the dev team doesn't have the best time management and Eco's priorities in order.\nUpdated Review:\nDev's have been putting in a lot of time for bug fixes and new content. If you are thinking about playing this game solo, your enjoyment will be determined by the server you choose. Make sure you browse the different servers to find the one you think best fits what you're looking for. Luckily I found an awesome community that has made me change my review to positive. If you are going to be playing this with a few friends you are 100% going to need to change server settings and turn some xp and craft times up to keep a steady level of fun. The only real negative I have about this game is that there are still no trains. Over a year ago the devs had the players vote on what should next be added to the game. Every single month the players voted for trains... and they still are not implemented or been talked about.\nOld review for reference:\nEco used to be an amazing game. I really enjoyed it to the point where I've paid for multiple servers. I had countless hours played with my friends and family on this game. I also liked how involved the devs were with the community as well as how transparent they were with what theyre working on,\nAnd then everything changed with their updates. I used to be able to play Eco with a max of two other people, and have vehicles by the fourth-ish day of relaxed grinding. With the state the game is in now, it would take us well over two weeks of harsh grinding, eight hours a day, to achieve the simplest of vehicles (a powered cart).\nTo earn a skill point needed to specialize a specific skill (which is an absolute must with how high they cranked up material costs), you need to be on a server for at least a day (we played for no less than 5 hours a day and still achieved only 1 skill point every 20 hours). To get that skill point, it was around 100-200 experience. After a few levels, the needed xp for one skill point jumps to 1600xp needed. Simple 8th grade math will show that this is just absolutely ridiculous.\nIt seems the devs dont want players to achieve many specializations and only focus on a select few. For the rest of the skills, they would want you working with the rest of the players on your world to create either an Utopian bartering economy, or a capitilists dream world of utilizing stores and banks to achieve the materials you arent spec'd into,\nUnfortunately, Eco does not have the player-base for a system set up like that (the highest I've seen lately is 4 people in a public server). So what that means is, by them making a game dependent on multiple people in a world, without having the player-base for that, they have essentially killed off any hopes of new players buying the game and sticking around long enough to not get that sweet Steam refund.\nI hate to say this, I really do, but save your money and dont buy this game.

After all those hours I feel more frustrated by unrealized potential than glad to have played it.\n\nMy main complaints:\n- Poor optimization. The game takes a lot of time to load and has problems with memory leaks and lag spikes. Map chunks load too slowly and often bug out, not loading all items properly. It also has a lot of other smaller bugs.\n- Unreasonably high required specs for a game with its primary focus on social interactions and community building. You would have a really hard time getting your friends with older PCs to play it and they're not going to enjoy the FPS. The high price and lack of good sales play into that too.\n- A lot of the content feels lackluster, unbalanced, and unfinished. There are professions that do almost nothing, professions, that are really important but only in some stages of the game, a perk system with non-choices (you are always better off picking one over the other), and some perks just not working at all, furniture that is objectively worse in its stats than other furniture despite being cheaper to make, I can keep going.\n- Abandonment and group monopolies problems. Those are probably really hard to fix but it would still be nice to see them addressed in some way. The smaller servers look post-apocalyptic after around two weeks (and not because of global warming).\n- The political and contract systems need more work. For example, they should allow us to export and import laws/contracts. Also, add even more possibilities for them. For example, I don't think there currently is a way to pay/get paid for electricity or start an auction.\n- More transportation and automation options would be very welcome, at least in the endgame.\n\nIt has some really robust and customizable systems and some things are executed really well gameplay-wise, so it gives me hope that in a few years, I can write a positive review.", "timestamp_created": 1693615813, "timestamp_updated": 1693615813, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 102, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780621707439422607", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40035205": {"recommendationid": "40035205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035690089", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 5097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1987, "last_played": 1642126733}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey, I dont usually write reviews for games but I feel like this one deserves it.

Not only is it a learning experience but its the type of game that will make you lose track of time, forget to go to sleep and nearly starve yourself. \n\nEvery choice you make in Eco has a consequence to the eco-system. Remember all those trees you cut down to build your house? well, you forgot to replant them and now your planet has no way to produce oxygen and remove carbon from the air. Remember that mine you dug under your house to get stone from? well, now you killed all the plants in the area that had roots that relied on that soil you dug up. Eco requires you to be 3 steps ahead at all times. Every resource you decide to take from your planet, you better replace it with two others and pray to God that only one of them dies during its growth cycle.\n\nThis kind of system might sound extremely tedious and at first I thought the same thing... Until the Mayor on our server created a law and organized players to make a last ditch effort to save our planet. We spent hours planting every seed we had collected over the past week and within a couple days, our planet was back to a living, breating eco system. The animals came back, the ground turned green again and we learned from our mistakes. This game brings people together and teaches you a valuable lesson about life.

The concept is great, and even the gameplay is pretty good. However... even in \"early access\" (couple of years now) there are some things that need work still. \n\nFirst, the time-based leveling is ridiculous, especially on small servers / solo play. Work hard for 12 hours? Cool, you still have 15 hours to wait before you can get the skill specialization you need to progress any further because you need 3 specializations to be able to make iron tools. I understand that the game is meant for co-op, and I'm sure it would be better if you and some friends could divvy up the specializations. Cheat codes took care of that for me, though I hate to do that.\n\nSecond. Systems aren't done. That's understandable in Early Access. However, the Devs are talking about what to do with endgame stuff before finishing what they have. For instance. Farming. It's great if you setup on the shore of a lake or river and keep your farms small. But there are currently no water-based physics of any sort in the game. Dig a ditch? Nope. The water will stop flowing a few blocks in. So much for irrigating farms in the survival game where everything you do runs completely on the food you eat.\n\nThere is more that I dislike about the game. Like I said though, it has potential if the Devs focus on getting the existing systems done before branching out. I'd like to re-route a river. Shouldn't be an impossible task in a game where the goal, currently, is to divert an asteroid to keep it from hitting the planet.", "timestamp_created": 1618085483, "timestamp_updated": 1618085483, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 96, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778533935546875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1618148319, "developer_response": "Hello Jaxyl,\nthank you for your honest review :)\n\nThe time based leveling has been toned down at the last rework of the skill system to only make the general progress tied to time (but still being very influencable with food and housing), while the actual progress in your profession is tied to doing stuff related to that profession.\n\nWe do not plan to change this as this is a method of ensuring that players do not skill too far ahead on servers, which is one of the biggest issues in Eco currently, which you probably have already read in many other reviews that talk about exactly that. Removing the time limitations would make single players on servers totally unable to compete at any level, not providing for a pleasant play experience.\n\nNontheless, servers can configure the skill gain and the same can be done for singleplayer. We do offer multiplicators for the speed of your skill gain, the experience cost of skills as well as for the speed of leveling up in specialties and the crafting cost and crafting time of recipes. We do also offer some basic defaults for specific numbers of players, but fine-tuning those depending on the playstyle of the audience of the server (or yourself for singleplayer) is always a good idea.\n\nIn regards to the endgame we lately announced Eco Infinite which will be a long-term development focus, we will still refine and polish existing features, but there will now be a big focus on making Eco viable for longer term play, which is another issue that many players have outlined in reviews and on our channels. We deem it important to tackle that issue as it is relevant to the vast majority of the players and hence very important.\n\nIt is correct the game does not currently have water physics, mostly because those are always a more sophisticated part of development and also for the fact there is no inherent requirement for it currently. Water physics, at least very basic ones, is something we want to look at later down the road and might play a bigger role as soon as we introduced boats. For irrigiation you can use aqueducts, by the way, those are made with brick stones.\n\nWhile I do understand the temptation to shape the world as you would like it, for example by re-routing rivers, that is a very minor part of what Eco is about. We feel like tackling a major issue with longetivity that affects everyone is something we need to do with priority.\n\nDennis\n\nCommunity Manager"}, "60634708": {"recommendationid": "60634708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128126647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1709559733}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is like that mining game that everyone knows, but with a story,  an endgame, more realistic load capacity, and ecosystem damage system.

At first I thought the roads and buildings might bring a good task for the community. I also like the room/xp system.\n\nAt my first run I learned a lot of course. But it felt like I had to do everything on my own. I spent a lot of time on building a road to the city, and later managed to moved to the city, but that didn't changed anything game experiencewise. Players had a lot of rescources. I didn't feel like I could contribute to the community even in some noob way. I didn't even see a proper community. Some players traded and talked, but the destructuion of the meteor, or polluting the environment wasn't importaint. I think the whole fragile environment feature is exadurated. Trees grow slow. That's it.\n\nOn my second run, I started in the city center. I wanted to figure out farming/cooking, because it looked a legit bussiness. By the end of the game I achieved what I wanted, but I still didn't felt any need for cooperation, any major community decisions, or any community achievement. Everyone building their own little buildings - I must assume through horrible grinding - and the roads and the meteor is handled by a handful of players.\n\nMaybe I didn't get to the best servers. Maybe there are other ways to play this.
