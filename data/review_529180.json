I previously had a lot of hope for this game but development has stalled out.\n- Cautiously would recommend if you get it on sale, like base building/harvesting, and enjoy collecting cool giant pet monsters. I would go in with the expectation that it has some janky mechanics that will probably never be fixed.\n\nPros:\n- Open world survival game, go anywhere on the map and do what you want.\n- Tame any creature in the game as your animal companion (panthers, dragons, boars, goblins, elementals, treants, imps, etc). It's very satisfying when the ground shakes as you and your buddies bring down a huge creature with rope arrows. This mechanic is very similar to ARK.\n- The world is gorgeous - seriously one of this game's best features. The map is hand crafted and every biome feels different.\n- Build a custom base anywhere. I particularly like that you can even get access to the building materials used to create the beautiful capitol cities you see in the screenshots.\n- Magic - Elemental magic is very satisfying. This is something ARK really doesn't have that this game does. I'm especially fond of the huge explosion you get from casting fireballs. Shapeshifting is cool. You can transform into a wyveryn and take to the sky, or maul things as a panther.\n\nMixed\n- Crafting system is ok - weapons, farming, building, cooking, spell crafting exist but without significant depth to the system.\n- Resource gathering is balanced for teamwork on official servers. It's meant for a group of players to pool their efforts for taming powerful creatures, building high-tier structures, etc. Similar to ARK. This is a pro for some who want a real house/guild/tribe experience. However, resource gathering can be very grindy for solo players. I would play on a private server with gathering/taming multipliers if you are a lone-wolf player.\n- There is a decay time on structures so that after several days without logging in structures will disappear (it scales with the durability of your structure...straw, wood, iron, etc.). This is designed to prevent structures of inactive players from blocking resources and choice build locations. If your guild has at least 1 active player it's not a big deal, but it can be frustrating for solo players. Again, playing on a private server without this function may be a good a good solution.\n\nCons:\n- Trolling players may stomp your constructions on public servers\n- long loading times to get in-game even when installed on SSD\n- initial learning curve for new players is steep\n- PvP, creature aggression, and structure HP needs balancing\n- Weird and janky physics particularly around the bigger creatures\n- NPC and town mechanics are pretty sparse (although vendors/trading is in vaguely place)\n- Not much in the way of storyline\n- Essentially permanent early access at this point", "timestamp_created": 1509294034, "timestamp_updated": 1613251782, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.908883094787597656", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94815098": {"recommendationid": "94815098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116103912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 176662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 176662, "last_played": 1625107426}, "language": "english", "review": "      DO NOT give this company your money or waste you time on this game.

I tried it again, just to confirm. It is in the exact state it was left in years ago.\n\nOriginal 2019 review: I waited for months to review this game, and would really like to be able to recommend the game, but I cannot because of the devs.. The game itself is a good game, or it could be if the devs cared about it. It is full of frustrating bugs, that have been there from the beginning, with no response from the devs on an ETA for when they will even be addressed. The bugs are getting worse with each tiny, pointless update too.\n\nBug reports get you nothing but automated messages saying they got the report, and then the next day, another automated email saying the ticket is being closed because they have had no response from you. What!? You put in the ticket, they never respond, and in 24 hours it is closed? Yep, that is right, they don't even seem to want to hear from players.\n\nThe game has an evolution system for a few of it's creatures. It is broken and buggy, to say the least. It can take days for them to evolve, if they ever do, when it is only suppose to take hours. There is suppose to be a glow on the animals, to show if they will evolve or not. Most of the time, it just does not even show. When you do see a gold glow, which is suppose to mean 100% chance they will evolve, 90% of the time, you go through all the work to trap them and keep them safe for nothing. They will just sit there for days and never evolve.\n\nRendering in the game is a nightmare!!! The game will let wild and tame animals through walls and floors when buildings are rendering. This means when you trap an animal to tame it, you have to have someone with the animal 100% of the time, to keep the building rendered. Without someone there, any time anyone goes to the trap, there is a good chance the animal will escape when the building renders. With it taking a stupid amount of time for them to evolve sometimes, this means players have to sit at the traps in shifts. The rendering issues also mean you will often have to tear apart parts of your base to get tame and even wild animals out of foundations. It also means that when flying past a building, make sure you are far away, because if you have another flyer on follow, it can get trapped in the building as it renders.\n\nWhen you are in any inventory, if you accidentally hit A or D before the inventory window closes completely, whatever your mouse was on last, will get dropped or transferred. They set the drop item key to D and the transfer item key to A by default. Changing the binding in settings doesn't work. The A & D keys still drop and transfer even after you rebind them. If the item is dropped while the windows is closing, it doesn't just drop at your feet like normal. It goes flying through the air and vanishes. It can cause you to lose some pretty valuable items. Why on earth they would bind movement keys to do other tasks too, is beyond me.\n\nTame flyers constantly slide forward. You land your tamed flyers on a roof or in a building, and every day they will move forward a little, until they fall off the roof, or run into a wall. Since none of the flyers can back up, this means you are constantly having to fly them up and around to repark them. It is a little thing, but losing your hard earned 120 wyvern because it moved into the wall, then on rendering out of the building, just to get attacked and killed by a wild gryphon, is frustrating to say the least (and yes, I had that happen).\n\nWith all of these game breaking bugs, and many many many more, what have the devs been concentrating on for months? Other games for one, but on this game, they have been focused on player transfers. Most of their very small player population is on private servers, which do not even allow transferring. The only reason for players to even transfer is because of the questing system. You cannot do the necromancy line at all on the old map, so have to transfer for it. The new map sucks, to put it mildly, so no one wants to play on it, but most of the quests are set for it.\n\nThe old map is nice and big and open, perfect for building, and has way more animals to tame, and more to do. The new map is tiny, with very limited building places, no flyers, and hardly any animals to tame. The only things to do in the game are tasks (quests), tame, and build. They made the quests for a small, crappy map that limits building and has very little to tame. How on earth does this make sense to anyone?\n\nThen you add to all of this that in 2 years, and multiple dev teams, many promises have never been met, and are now not even being talked about at all. Players were promised code updated to the current ARK model, so we would have breeding, and all the same code as ARK, like being able to turn off collision and recolor animals with code. None of that has ever happened. They have also never released a proper dev kit so modders can't mod properly for the game.\n\nThe game is a great concept, and I really really wanted to see it finished, but now have no hope of that happening. Snail Games seems more focused on other games. I currently have 2 servers, one for each map. The server with the new map, I just have so my players on my other server can try it if they want. My server with the old map use to be busy, and it was a lot of fun, despite the bugs, but people are leaving the game in droves. They have lost all faith on the devs, and are tired of the bugs. The game also has no longevity because you run out of things to do pretty quick. Once you build your base how you want, and tame a 120 of every animal you want, there is nothing else to keep players playing. I pretty much only play anymore so I can be on to monitor when players are on my server. Once the current players I have get burned out on the game too, I will be switching my servers to another game. There are just not enough new players coming to the game to keep it alive at this point.\n\nSnail Games is well named. They have taken far to long to do what little they have done with the game. They effectively ruined any chance of this game ever being what it could have been. Had they spent more time on it when it was busier, and showed players they cared, they could have had a very popular game with hundreds of thousands of players by now. Instead they are allowing a good game to die simply because players are tired of waiting for them to do something with the game.", "timestamp_created": 1570531919, "timestamp_updated": 1699907072, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 154, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894521057605743408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42667102": {"recommendationid": "42667102", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996022418", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 75049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72192, "last_played": 1565643220}, "language": "english", "review": "This game isn't balanced at all, the grind is long and unrewarding, toxic players love to grief the newbies who have no way to fight back.  Reminds me of ARK before it's release.   They also eventually plan to implement cross-server transferring which essentially killed ARK, yet this game pretty much died with the release of Conan Exiles.  Nerfing the flying battleships and easier ways to break into manor was essentially the final nail in the coffin.   Many exploits and bugs that veteran players use to constantly keep their grip on their servers.   The three race thing sounds neat at first yet is basically useless, what large guilds do to lock down a server is simply split into 3 guilds, one for each race then essentially lock down the vendors and the altars used to make myhtical feed.  This prevents new guilds from establishing a foothold.   So basically it's a Tri-Fecta Super Guild that lock down a server and constantly raid new players who are trying to learn the game or fight back.  \n\nOnce a player does grind to 60 and build a tripple layered Manor base though, there's pretty much no way to break into manor.   So new players can't obtain the resources to raid the vet players, even if they wanted to and could, it would be a painful grind acquiring the weapons and tames needed in order to break through multiple layers of manor, by then a server usually dies and only at most 1-10 players even bother on an official pvp server.   \n\nThere seems like a lot to do, yet there isn't a healthy community around anymore to do that with, so the game gets pretty much boring and stale when compared to other survival games.   Why not just play a single player survival game if you're gonna wind up on a dead server anyways?     \n\nMost people lose interest because there's dead manor bases everywhere and there is no real pvp, only at most PvDoor.  \n\nPerhaps if this game took a page from Conan Exiles book and implemented a pvp system in which you can pvp tames and people at any time but structures can only be damaged at a certain time say 4 pm est to 11 pm,  that way the midnight-early morning raiders are at a disadvantage when raiding casual western gamers.\n\nThat way you could weaken the strength of buildings back to how they were and restore balance and pvp to an otherwise dying game.   Explosive pots and Catapaults that are operated by multiple people would be helpful in rekindling the spark of interest in this game as well.\n\nThis game had the potential to be better than ARK and Conan but it doesn't seem to be improving at a pace that could compete which is disheartening but perhaps in the future someone will remember the good ideas from a concept like this and implement them in a fantasy-based survival game.\n\n\nI've played on three servers, either the game is too easy or too challenging based on whether or not your guild is situated already and has the means to easily break into everyone elses base, even then it's a hollow victory because the server usually dies due to short lived fun on both sides.   \n\n\nMagical combat is nonexistant and everyone usually does a cookie cutter stat allocation, same spec.\n\nMelee combat is stale and smart targeting is not a thing, your character swings and does no combos, very similar to ARK, atrocious combat system.\n\nTaming is painful, though not a horrible as ARK, it's damn near close,  acquiring the feed for mythical tames takes a long time and sometimes something can easily go wrong and you literally waste days of grinding due to wasting feed on a mythical tame, thus demoralizing your guild even further.\n\nThere is no faction pride whatsoever, no incentive to team up with players of the same race, very disappointing.\n\nI had high hopes for this game, but the spell is broken and I did meet some cool players on a few servers but for the most part they have all left for greener pastures, me as well.       \n\nI concur with another reviewer that all servers should be wiped and y'all go back to the drawing board of rebalancing the entire game and make this game more casual friendly, stop catering to the people who've ruined this game for so many others with their toxic elitist attitude and listen to what used to be the vast majority of the playerbase, and improve your game based on their concerns, rather than adhering to the egomaniacs who wanna keep their pixels and rare mythicals they ez-mode tamed back in the day when it was easier.  They've pretty much chased off all the other players and killed each and every server, ocassionally check in once in awhile and scare off any new player, thus locking down a server and keeping it dead,  If you've played ARK, this is nothing new.    \n\nConan was similar but the buildings are invincible until \"raid times\" has at the very least given newer guilds a fighting chance.\n\nThere's a big difference between a pvp game being too easy, challenging, and impossible.   As it stands now, to experience the full content of this game in it's entirety, on official pvp servers, that seems impossible if you're new.  \n\nIt would be wise to assess other survival games that have a higher population and consider some settings that would give new players a fighting chance.\n\n\nI used to love this game, but now I hate it....       As it stands now, I'll check back in a year or two and see what's changed, yet I highly doubt anything game-breaking or substantial will be implemented anytime soon that would make me want to play this with my friends.   Most likely it'll be some cutsey holiday content with more useless vanity stuff or bugs that allow players to exploit into other peeps bases and popcorn all their stuff, just because...

We have lost dozens of tamed mounts by falling through the ground or a mountain or a rock and any number of other losses that have been related to game stability and bugs.

The show stopper though is having structures and resources disappear after as little as 72 hours of not logging into a server.

I work professionally in the game industry, so, this review will be from the perspective of my experience in both game develpment and playing Dark and Light. I am NOT a developer from Snail Games, nor have I ever contributed to this project.\n\nFirst thing I must point out is that this game is \"Early Access.\" Generally, this means that the game is not ready for release and you can expect performance issues, lack of \"optimizations\", many bugs, and incomplete systems. However, you are given the opportunity to purchase the game at a lower cost than an actual release, able to help guide the direction of the game and its systems, and are helping the developers find game-breaking issues so they can be fixed.\n\nNow to review the game itself!\n\nThe game is very much similar to Ark in the following regards:\n\n      1)  The overall art style, including shaders, and visual effects (outside of the introduction of magical elements) is nearly identical. I would not be surprised if many of the assets (technical and physical) are ported directly from the Ark project. This is not a negative. The ability to reuse assets within a company is a logical and necessary component for decreasing development costs. Not every game has millions of dollars available to support long development cycles with large teams.\n\n      2)  The game is survival-based, again nearly identical to ark. The resorce collection system mirrors Ark nearly to a fault. I ask, why create a new system when the one you have experience with works well?\n\n      3)  The srever issues experienced in Ark is mirrored in Dark and Light.  The main issue with this is not the game engine (i.e. UE4). These issues are due to the resource collection choice for this game and the actual networking code/system that both Ark and Dark and Light use. UE4's network architecture was designed for lobby-based networking with less than 50 simultaneous players. Additionally, UE was originally designed for FPS games - whose systems are much lighter and less resource intensive than MMO, RPG, or Survival games. \n\n      If the server is authoritative, the server must process all collisions. Ark and Dark and light have an enormous amount of collision detections happening. Nearly every object is interactable with collisions; rocks, trees, plants, animals, people, etc. That is VERY demanding for a server. When you add latency, the server can easily lag behind player movement and force tranform updates resulting in \"rubber banding\" effects and stuttering. \n\n      One other point here - with the sheer amount of objects being tracked by the server, frequent server saves and \"cleanup\" is required. This means that you will regularly experience sudden drops in frame rates and increased stuttering. Additionaly, as you enter areas with higher a higher density of players and objects (including player build-structures, developer created structures, NPCs, etc.) you will definitely experience lag. THe server is processing a LOT of movements, rotations, collisions, and item/inventory updates. \n\nArk comparison conclusion.\n\nThe game is similar to Ark. This cannot be denied. However, the game hass refined  and transformed that experience into something that, in my opinion, stands apart. Here are the things that are much different:\n\n      1)  The skill system is no longer entirely point based. Gaining experience is divided between two synergetic systems; character and skills. As you gain character experience you gain character levels. Upon reaching a new level you get to spend points in character (physical) abilities (i.e. Attack, Stamina, Focus, Constitution, Weight, etc.).  However, character level translates to skills in one simple aspect; They open up higher skill ranks that you can train. To understand this, let's look at the skill system.\n\n      The skill system is a return to the \"learn by doing\" systems introduced by games such as Ultima Online. As you perform actions, such as combat, taming, harvesting, and crafting, tou earn experience in specific skills. Some action may provide experience in multiple skills. Each skill can be \"leveled up\" independent of character leveling. Each skill level, or \"rank\" gives you a new ability or item that becomes craftable. \n\n       Each skill has a max level of Rank 8 - if I recall correctly. However, skill ranks are unlocked by character level, so, in effect, character level limits how far you can train a skill. Personally, I do not agree with this approach, but it is not a bad system. \n\n      2)  Dark and light has introduced factions/races. Instead of individual \"clan/guild\" wars, there are also faction wars as well. The game encourages cooperation within factions, though not requiring it, with the looming threat of opposing factions. This also gives rise to territorial disputes, etc.\n\n      3)  Fantasy setting with mystical creatures (rather than dinosaurs),  spell, melee, and ranged combat styles. The introduction of magical abilities gives rise to a whole new dimension in the Ark-like survival game.\n\n      4)  RPG elements such as NPC merchants, factional cities and town, and limited questing. The game is creating a world for you to be engaged with while maintaing much of the sandbox feel that Ark gave.\n\n     5)  Factional based crafting. This is not a huge aspect, but when a developer takes the time to provide aesthetics  to help you feel more engaged in your faction choice, I consider it a very huge bonus. Each faction has specific structural building components that reflect the ideals of their race. For instance, elves are more attuned to nature and unlock structural components that are more ....earthy and natural. Dwarves are more rugged and attuned to stome and metal, and their structures reflect this. Humans tend to be more industrial and build mainly for structural fortification rather than any attunement to the natural world.\n\nGameplay-\n\nFinally, I must say that the style of gameplay that build/craft style survival games introduces is the same throughout the genre and not slpecific to Ark or Dark and Light. Games like H1Z1 Survive, Minecraft (in some ways), 7-Days To Die, and Rust also suffer from player \"trolls\", griefers, and the influx of \"international\" raiders. The game is not responsible for this,the people are. I don't believe that it is fair to criticize the integrity of the game, its development, or the gameplay due to the social/gameplay actions of the people playing it. Obviously, the game would be more enjoyable without these people, but playing public servers comes with these \"side effects.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the game is very good for what it is. I cannot negatively criticize a game because it is not the type or \"style\" of game I enjoy. The game is well done for its development stage, and if the frequency of updates and fixes continue the way they are now, I am sure that Dark and Light will mature into a great game...for those masochistic gamers like me.", "timestamp_created": 1502564708, "timestamp_updated": 1502564963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 434, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878286004066467285", "comment_count": 35, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37011659": {"recommendationid": "37011659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024006689", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 29712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16401, "last_played": 1539482362}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay and graphics are great!\nIts a \"survival\" game but its really easy for survival per se.\nThis is mainly a taming/building game.

The game is out to the public in it's early stages so the devs can get the public to help them test, find bugs, get suggestions, as well as get funding to do those things (game development takes time and money people, sorry you can't just get whatever you want for free.)\n\nFrom what I've played so far, I can say I really like what I've seen so far and it seems this game has good potential. I played a lot of ARK and some Conan, but ARK got too techy for me, I hate guns and tech, and their Primitive mods are buggy and make the game load so much slower so it's hardly even an option. And Conan was meh. The magic is really neat in this game and I can't wait to level up and get to play with it more. I've encountered a few bugs and crashes so far, but again, that's to be expected in Early Access.\n\n(will edit and add more to the review once I spend more time on it tonight)\nedit: So after playing for several more hours, building a few small shabby (thatch for ARK players) houses and having them stay up for about a day it was pretty nice and chill. I love how leveling up the skills work. It's not just you level your character up and get skills points to dump into whatever you choose, you have to perform certain tasks to earn exp for each skill tree to unlock more schematics. I do kind of think some things are spread out too far, like the bedroll at level 10 when you kind of need it to replenish focus (I know the inns/rentable houses were supposed to do that, but as of now they do not). I tamed a sheep and a boar and bought a horse from the town's stable, unfortunately all of them are currently deseased thanks to two r00d PvPers (eh oh well). All around pretty enjoyable so far, with about what, 12 hours in? Graphics are nice, and the view distance is really nice too. I can see player houses farther off than you ever could in ARK (at least I think so, it's been a while since I played ARK, but I do remember having to get fairly close to see buildings). Only particularly annoying bugs I've come across so far are : Rented rooms aren't working atm, if anyone in the vacinity melees or uses a spell/weapon it seems like that sound effect plays for you at the same volume as if you were doing it, sometimes the melee sound keeps going, and the occassional crash.

The community has been very patient with this early release game while the Devs made many changes and many excuses for bugs. The list of bugs is very long. I was though super excited and hopeful when I learned of the new DLC. Alas, like other updates for new content, it was released too soon and not at all balanced. The testers made it clear the game was not ready but like the community, we were ignored. As such the base game is now broken, literally as of this moment all weapons and armor are at 0 durability. Mean while our manor bases have 10% of the health they used to, turning this into a PVP only game of grieving as no one can sleep without being potentially raided in Manor in less than an hour where as before we had a few hours of protection at least. While many players have let Snail know this isn't how they want to play, snail has ignored us and doubled down insisting this makes the game better. I went from having hope that old players would come back (and due to no marketing 95% didn't come back) now even the dedicated players are looking to leave. Most of the streamers are talking about leaving the game as well. I could go on and on about why this is currently not worth playing or buying when just a bit ago I was the games biggest fan. It takes a lot for me to lose hope but the Devs have finally broken my spirit as well.\n\n Update: Indeed after a few days the durability was fixed and finally the teleporting was as well. Of course while many waited with their bases being 5% of the HP they used to be defending them and putting in more defences was rather futile. \n\n As for the Dev saying they \"fixed the HP\" does that mean you had them \"broken\" this last year and didn't bother to fix them? Lets not insult our intelligence here. I have whiplash from the super high HP to the Chaos server HP stats.... come on now, you can't go from super high to Chaos stats and then call it \"balanced\" as you clearly know this is chaos. If you intended chaos.... well.... that isn't really balanced. While I could start a server, why should I have to do that when I put 1000 hours into a base I thought was worth 12million HP only. Seems like you can't be trusted to be balanced actually. I some how created a habit playing this game and like the community so here I am playing. I am just not going to be recommending it to anyone right now. Basically this is ark stats now, might as well play the new ark Map when it comes out next month.

Sometimes skeletons spawn inside your house when you are offline and destroy your chests with valuable items. Shield, towers or other defense can't prevent it. So at any moment you can lose random stuff, sometimes very valuable.\n  2. It's impossible to use summoning stone on your pets if you've already done it and lost these stones. I lost them due to bug 1, among other things skeleton destroyed the chest with summoning stones containing my pets. All stones dissapeared and the game does not allow to make new, so all my pets can't be ressurected now which means they will die soon.\n  3. Traveling from one planet to another can completely destroy your character. That happens to me. Game crashed during server change and my character dissapeared from both planets / servers.

And for the short attention spans in the room, let's simply say this isn't worth your money and the game has no long-term potential.  Buy it and play it for a few weeks if you want to get a taste of a fantasy version of ARK, but do not expect anything in the way of proper game development or commnication from the dev team.\n\nHere are a few of my main reasons for the review.\n\n1) Lack of forward motion. The game has seen only small improvements since launch.  It is a beautiful world with great animals to tame, but it's largely the same world I signed up for when it first released.  They added two half-assed dungeons that are incredibly buggy and short/boring.  They added an airship that was a disaster at launch and continues to be so.  With the exception of that and maybe 3 new animals, there's simply no new content in this game. What's saddest about this is that they've actually prioritized new content OVER fixing existing issues. This means  they're actually prioritizing new content and still managed to squeak out barely enough to warrant a handful of announcements.  The game is almost exactly where it started.\n\n2) Quality Assurance - Patches notes are missing. Patch notes are wrong. Huge changes and nerfs happen with no documentation.  For people who spend 100s of hours building bases to defend, random changes that hugely affect security should be communicated and are not.  Any feature with a degree of complexity, you can guarantee will be launched as an entire shitstorm (the mobile air fortress was guaranteed to be a complete nightmare and delivered on that assumption spectacularly).  You can make the argument that we ARE the testers in an EA game, but considering there's no feedback loop and almost no communication, it's pretty hard to make a case that we're actually helping people.   \n\n3) Communication - I want to make this a long entry but I'll try to make it a short one. I've never seen a development team treat their community so poorly.  Patches released without notes (some of them completely game-changing).  Patches released with incorrect information.  The entire forum communication takes place with a single guy named SG_Erebus who usually posts 5-7 times a week, and as of the writing of this review, has not posted in over six days. That means the ENTIRE community forum had zero dev posts in six days.  Good communication is the only thing that can save a game like this, and these guys can't even do that.\n\n4) hacking and bugs - the exploits are rampant. I know that happens in an early access game. But this is what is inexcusable: First, some exploits have existed since the beginning.  They simply never got fixed. The exploits that did get fixed were never communicated, which means we have no idea if some of our tactics are bugs, exploits, or simply playing the game the way it should be played. Secondly, developers rarely give anything even a basic test before implementing. So it almost feels like developers are handing exploiters new material.  Exploits that allow someone access to the inside of your base should be treated as a near-emergency, but you can't even get your ticket answered. They'll routinely ask for video proof (do people really have this? Who's sitting in their base recording video for 24 hours?).  \n\nSo, why did I spend 4000 hours playing a game Im reviewing so poorly? Simple. I had hope.  I saw a beautiful world and some fun systems, I had a blast raiding people and getting raided and learning how to master the game. But i saw the player numbers dropping. I saw servers die. I saw developers stop commenting until there was nothing left but a shell of a community and nobody steering the ship.  That, coupled with the fact that nobody wants to lose 4000 hours worth of buildings, tames and chests, and you have a recipe for \"let's just keep playing and see if it gets better\".  \n\nThis game took thousands of hours from me.  Don't let it do the same to you. Know exactly what you're getting into.   The very last thing I'll say is that somewhere near the middle of my play, I acknowledged that this game wasn't going to succeed.   It was a near inevitability.  Then, something worse happened around the 3000th hour. I realized this game SHOULDN'T succeed.  As much as I played it, I could not root for a team that treated its players and its code so badly.  If the world is fair and just (and i know, it isn't), developers who write bad code, don't show vision for a game, and ignore their community will always fail.  Dark and Light gave us the illusion of potential, but they do not have a team capable of delivering.  Do not drip-feed their life support by purchasing a copy.

The game is tough and forces you to work hard to fight the environment, unlike a lot of survival games that have a negligible PvE experience resulting in rampant KoSing just to have fun. The skill system is much improved over ARK's, with no skill points to spend you can truly master everything if you put the time into it. The map is huge and beautiful, teeming with diverse fantasy wildlife. Personally, the game runs great for me. Everything set to high/ultra and staying above 60fps\n\nThere are issues with the game. Namely, many people seem to be having serious performance issues. There is also some lag when harvesting resources which makes the game frustrating at times, like when you just want 1 wood but have to spend minutes waiting for the server to catch up. The game also suffers from the experience gap that ARK had where if you're a high level, you can just easily stomp over everyone lower than you due to having flying mounts, way better armor, and top-tier spells. Luckily, it seems like because of the difficulty of the game compared to other survivals, high level players are more willing to help you than hurt you. Overall, I highly recommend Dark and Light if you enjoy survival or fantasy games; it had a solid launch and is full of content, but still suffers from many of the problems that Early Access games tend to have (server lag, optimization).", "timestamp_created": 1501007219, "timestamp_updated": 1501007219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 204, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.827186465263366699", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37843819": {"recommendationid": "37843819", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969764027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 24038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21135, "last_played": 1665800447}, "language": "english", "review": "I put quite a few hours into this game but ultimately ended up leaving it for Ark.  Having never played Ark I started in Dark & Light.  Absolutely loved it at first until I started to progress.  \n\nI quickly found that official servers were not the place to play the game.  I started out on about 10 of them.  Finally settled on one and then three things made me leave.  1.  Kept getting offline raided by a Chinese house that would destroy all tames and steal everything I had in my small wooden house.  2.  Taming took FOREVER.  So combine those two things and the game was unplayable for someone who has a full time job and plays games as a hobby.  3.  They introduced a 72 hr auto decay feature which basically means if you don't log on you lose everything.  I lost everything over the Labor Day weekend because I went out of town.  Very poor design decision by the devs seems like they only want unemployed kids with no life playing their game.\n\nWent to an unoffical server and spent the rest of my time there.  Server admin and community were awesome but ultimately they could not fix a completely broken game.  Loading into the game takes forever, panthers & creatures from meteors one shot you even with the highest tier armors.  Tames bug out and disappear after patches.  Building snap points are horrid.  I can handle this knowing it is  EA but after camping the forums and watching the Devs not address game breaking bugs and instead continue to introduce more broken content it just got to be too much.  \n\nUltimately I moved onto Ark and found that Dark & Light is basically an older version of Ark with far less features and way more bugs.

I was surprised to see many Chinese playing on the server (maybe half of the people online).\n\nThe newbie area has no NPCs, because the Chinese guild, BDLX (search for them on the discussion forums - apparantly they are on many of the US servers), wipes out all NPCs. They do not respawn. I've only seen one NPC in the game, at some kind of travel tower that doesnt work.\n\nThe mobs have no rhyme or reason to where they are found in the game. This means mobs spawn in the newbie dwarf city and high level creatures roam right near where you first spawn into the game. There are no NPCs for you to train the mobs to, since they are destroyed by players (in our server's case, the Chinese guild). You will notice some bunny looking mobs with levels ranging from 1 to 120 randomly in all areas, along with sheep frolicking with dragons, unicorns and ice wolves, anything you can think of just randomly thrown around on the map. You cannot tell what level a creature is until you are already right up on it (probably agro) and the fight with the mob is very different if it is lower level than if it's higher level... extremely different - even for the same creature. There is no \"higher level\" area where you know to find higher level mobs - again, they can spawn right in front of your very first login point. \n\nThe terrain is prone to bad geometry that you can get stuck in. There is no way to get unstuck except to kill yourself. This is worse for any creature you have tamed (which takes 20m to an hour from my experience). If a creature you have tamed gets stuck, it has to be left. If you are high level, you can create an item that will allow you to summon it (but this take a lot of materials that aren't just easy to obtain). In the time I played, 3 creature tames were lost this way.\n\nThe collision between you, one of your tames, and an agressive mob can leave all parties involved STUCK inside of each other. This happens very frequently. If you are stuck in a mob, you cannot move and will likely die. The same for your tames.\n\nThe melee within the game is wonky. If you use a sword, you have two attacks - one with left click and one with right click. The left click is a weak single swipe, while the right click is a dragon ball Z roundhouse swipe (I guess). When you press right click, your toon actually starts the animation about 5 feet behind your starting position. It is almost impossible to do any type of melee efficiently this way. It also will aim you in any direction but the one you want to swipe at. Many times, once you have pressed right click, when you go back to left clicking, the right click action will continue to be used. This must be a bug, but it isnt fixed. The other weapons in the game involved in melee are similar. The bow is the only weapon that did not have issues.\n\nMagic in this game is crafted, meaning you craft what they call a schema. WIth a staff equipped, you equip a schema, such as fireball. As you use your staff to cast your fireball, the schema loses charges. It will break in the middle of a fight, and you will have to craft another one if you want to cast fireball again. These break very fast, so don't think you will be just using a lot of magic. Also, you have a magic bar that goes down when casting magic. However, this almost never runs out because your schema will break beforehand, or you will die. I havent been in any long fights where mana was an issue, even though I crafted potions with a 3 hour rot time in case I did run out of magic. Using magic also makes your focus go down, meaning you need to eat flowers <boggle>. So, when you use magic - your schema loses charges, your magic goes down and your focus goes down. Magic does do good damage to other players, in general though. Many of those Chinese greifers would one shot me at low level with a lightning bolt. Oh, and there are only a few spells.. maybe less than 10, and many of those are upgrades of lower level spells (fireball 1, 2.. etc).\n\nBack to the BDLX guild, I'm not sure if they are from other games, but they have made a few servers that I know of unplayable. There is no region lock, so the US servers appear to be preferred to asian players. There is significant langauge barrier, and so far, I just see that they are hostile.\n\nVideo lag is something that is horrible. I have over the minimum requirements to run the game, and even on medium settings you will have screen freezes for more than 10 seconds when travelling into new areas. Sometimes swinging around too fast to fight a mob will cause you to freeze mid battle. When you are unfrozen, the mob has already had a few swings - which makes fair PVE difficult. On medium settings, the textures look bad (you can see some of my screenshots - I tried taking most at high levels, but many are medium settings).\n\nVerdict: I could not recommend this game in its current form, and I am not sure about the company and how willing they are to fix some of the things that make the game unenjoyable and unplayable.", "timestamp_created": 1501662749, "timestamp_updated": 1501663601, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 355, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.802078366279602051", "comment_count": 35, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96617334": {"recommendationid": "96617334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109064566", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1501121749}, "language": "english", "review": "How is this still early access they are no longer developing the game or even looking at the game?", "timestamp_created": 1627628365, "timestamp_updated": 1627628365, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.799672603607177734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33682712": {"recommendationid": "33682712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017287003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 10636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1181, "last_played": 1508081692}, "language": "english", "review": "They're alot of negative reviews for this, almost stopped me from purchasing.

I downloaded the game this morning and attempted to log into my regular Archos server so that I could transfer my character to the new DLC. I was unable to log into my normal server for 30+ minutes, and then finally learned that the character transfer wasn't even enabled yet.\n\nSo just to get a taste of the new DLC, I created a new character on a PvPvE server. Within an hour of playing, it's quite obvious that this is not a regular PvP server, as straw doors have 650 health. A wild level 40 bear broken into our straw base in a matter of minutes. Frustrated with having to start from scratch on a server that is chaos, NOT regular pvp, I decide to go back to my regular Archos server.\n\nUpon logging in, I notice that my gear is all broken. A full set of epic balefire gear, legendary long sword, legendary frost blade, legendary glaive, everything. I trigger death to repair everything that is soul bound. Nope, that no longer works. Great, so now I have to run a dungeon to repair the armor and gear? I guess I'll go get some extra gear I had saved. Nope, every piece of armor and weapon in every chest in my base is broken. Great, so I can't even run the dungeons without making new armor.\n\nNo problem, I'll grab some blueprints and craft some armor. Annnnddd..... ? The newly crafted gear is broken. What about my firestorm II spells? Yep, 100+ of them all broken and requiring 6 chaos essence to repair each one. And I can't farm new materials because ALL OF MY TOOLS ARE BROKEN.\n\nWhat is going on with these devs? You spent MONTHS working on this DLC while ignoring the horribly bugged original game.

I\u2019m addicted already! I\u2019m only a lvl13 right now, but that will change soon enough. I have been focusing on the tasks right now as they open up more, new and different skills, items to create and building materials needed for gameplay.  I have also learned some no no\u2019s too, like don\u2019t eat too many flowers for focus as I became a goblin, lol. \n\nLook I\u2019m a 51y.o. gaming nerd mother, lol and I am a positive person, by nature, so I personally don\u2019t pay attention to negative comments about games, as I am a true believer that negativity is contagious, and if you don\u2019t have anything nice to say you should keep your negative comments to yourself. Plus this game is still in the development stage, so there are bound to be some problems. No game I\u2019ve ever played was issue free. Many games have updates, due to bugs and snares when new things are added. And delays on loading times is more often than not due to servers that can\u2019t keep up with the amount of people accessing the game at the same time during certain periods of time. \n\nI am looking forward to leveling up in this game. The graphics are amazing, the creatures I\u2019ve had attk me thus far have been incredible, scary and high leveled. The creatures I\u2019ve killed thus far are 2 goblins, at once. They kinda tag teamed me, but I beat them down, the golden sheep and 2 skeletons, all during my first 12 hours of gameplay. The wraith from the lake was a different story, that one kicked my butt, lol I died 4 times as each time I was collecting my body, running into town helped with killing him. Harvesting with different tools reaps different products too. I\u2019m still learning just like the game, and I look forward to growing with the game too. \n\nWell that\u2019s about it for now.

Giving them money (like I did) is a mistake. Here is why:\n\n1) The game is largely the same as when it started. There were small improvements.  They never had a clear plan or direction. This was a classic early access title with a \"wait and see\" approach. And instead of improving the map or fixing bugs, they launched a brand new map, almost out of nowhere, which was just as buggy as the first.  There is no one at the helm guiding this team.\n\n2) It is clear at this point that Snail hires contract teams to come in and add a little to the game. This is cheap labor, hiring programmers to come in and patch a few rough spots or add a little new content. The result? Some things that were never broken get changed, some things that have been broken since the beginning don't get touched, and no one on the team actually plays the game or knows about the past mistakes/issues.  They occasionally rework a tame or system that was never really an issue to begin with, while cheating and hacking is still a very real threat.\n\n3) The customer support has two speeds: non-existent (for months we'd submit tickets with no response) or incompetent.  A friend recently reported an issue and was surprised to actually get a GM response.  She asked where his base was located. He said \"Do you know where the Dwarven city is?\" She said \"No\".  There you have it, folks.  GMs making very big decisions who haven't even spent 2 hours in the game understanding the very basics.  \n\n4) The official forums have been down or non-functional for over a year.  They've gone on record saying they were trying to fix it and didn't know how.  This is obviously a very silly thing to fail at getting right, but the steam discussion forums are your only option. Most of the time there is only one \"moderator\" of the forums. He does not work for Snail, he just works for free because nobody else will, and while that's noble, he's also randomly a jerk to people, plays favorites, and has no real structure or rule about why he does the things he does. Randomly if you're lucky, a developer will pop in for a second and comment on something. At times there have been huge, game-changing or game-defining responses buried in a thread somewhere instead of posted publicly. To re-iterate, there is ZERO communication that happens directly with the player base.  The forum mod is a volunteer and the developers (who we rarely see) are contract workers. You will never really talk to an employee of snail games.\n\n5) Patching. This is a game where you spend hundreds or thousands of hours acquiring materials and items, then trying your best to defend them vs attacking players.  Patches frequently happen with no notification, literally getting a message that the server will restart in 5 minutes (or no warning at all). When you log back in, the patches can be completely game-breaking. In addition to huge changes with defenses (imagine if all of your defenses were turned off when the patch went live), there have also been random issues where people's bases were completely vulnerable after a patch with no rollback or correction.  Every time the server restarts, you have to worry that everything you've done in game is vulnerable to being raided and stolen.  Getting beaten straight-up is part of any game like this. Getting beaten because one guy logged in to new patch notes 2 hours before you did is NOT the same thing. \n\nThis is why these developers do not deserve our money. Vote with our wallets and vote with our time. I failed because I spent both my money AND my time on this game.  Do yourself a favor and don't play this game if you have standards for the way you're treated as a player.

Some of the bugs in game have been there over a year, yet no acknowledgement and no answer if they plan on fixing them.

ARK stole all the thunder and it makes me sad cause this game will be mostly ignored from fatigue regardless of how fresh it truly is.\n\nPro Bits:\n- You can imagine the basic ark frame slapped on Skyrim / Dungeon Seig mechanics where you level up skills by doing activities related to it and combat that feels more dynamic than arks ever will.\n\n- Your character levels are for stats only like Diablo and a basic requirement for some crafting, wood at lv 20 even if you are lv 3 woodwork ect.\n\n- The World is fantastic..... Ark is flat in comparison as the Dark and Light world feels more like a chunk of planet than some stitched together bioms.. Huge trees, floating islands and some of the most curvy hilly land you will every lay eyes on.\n\n- Spells... Polymorph saves lives <3 Cast Bosts of elemetal magics and transform into animals.. the only time being a druid was fun outside Blizzard games for me.\n\n- The Gear!! Some of the complaints are regarding the falling through the floor, this is because it happens once in a blue moon but gear is crucial in this. you fight and partake in combat more than most other survivals... it feels very RPG and loosing an item you found in a meteor drop can hurt and item recovery is more often a thing here than other survival games.\n\nand so much more.... it's hard to explain with all my hours in ARK I hurt to think this game existed even in it's current form.\n\nCon bits:\n- (in it's current state) Not many tiers of weapons and gear and Lv 50 you have unlocked all if not most of the stuff at least.\n\n- it's early development so bugs and stuff (on a side note it is less buggy now than ark was with tripple the time in development)\n\n- Leveling skills can feel grindy if you can't figure out the best tools for the jobs like daggers for hide and spears for bone and so on. ARK has lazied me up to just Pick and Axe and you can't just do that in this game.\n\noverall it has some hiccups but handles like a real RPG with ARK paint on it..

They just were not so good at implementing it and fixing issues. A lot of negative reviews of the game stem from the old development team.\n\nThe new development team is doing a great job so far in cleaning up the game and fixing all the glitches, bugs and issues they inherited.\n\nFull Disclosure, I like Knights vs Dragons, Good vs Evil, etc so this appeals a lot more to me than Ark Survivor Evolved ever did right from the get go.\n\nDark and Light has a story line that is simple easy to follow and user friendly. Ark had a convoluted story that included dinosaurs, dunebuggys, a Super Wooden Raft that could hold gigantic amounts of building materials, building pieces and weight. It allowed for Chain guns and missile launchers to be used vs dinosaurs. The story of aliens toying with mankind putting them into an experimental world of dinosaurs just seems like it was after the fact trying to tie it all together.\n\nLack of a water craft seems a bit odd to me since the game allows for an air ship that is well done and very user friendly. Needs an option to lower it to the ground for loading and unloading though.\n\nThe Monarch Crab Mount is way too large. Its fun to stomp around with though. Could be half the size and still get the job done.\n\nI like the over all balance of the animals and monsters and those that can be tamed and made into Mounts.\n\nAm curious why the developers didn't allow the Yeti to be able to jump or leap as a mount.\n\nWould like to see the Crocodiles from Ark added to Dark and Light. They'd fit right in with the game theme. Besides, it gets tiring always being attacked by Piranha fish in every water body in the game.\n\nWould also like to see \"no collision\" with the ground for building pieces.\n\nThe flying mounts are all unique in their movements, turning ability, usefulness to the game, etc. Job well done. \n\nWould like to see more barding armour available for all the mounts instead of a few like the Vicious Hyeena, which by the way is an enjoyable mount to ride into battle.\n\nAll in all Dark and Light is a much more enjoyable, believable, user friendly game for me than Ark Survivor Evolved was.

They now have individual skill leveling so you can learn recipes and magics using certain tools, weapons, or magic more making progression feel constantly rewarding (but also a grind).

Game needs some more optimizations like Ark did in the past but still very playable.\n\nThe game needs an overhaul with monster spawns, and the level of the monsters early on. Not fun as a new spawn leaving a town ready to journey/hunt and running for a while as there aren't really any nearby monsters to the town and when you do find something to hunt is a little LVL-100 Owl that destroys you. Upside you get to keep your hot bar and equipment so your not at a total reset.\n\nThe combat needs to be overhauled as well as magic is a must have and any time I used melee with shield and blocking big attacks still feels underwhelming and would often just use magic to save HP and time and used my sword to collect meat and bushes/trees for string instead of its intended use for combat.\n\nPast some very glaring issues there is a gem of a game here and makes it all the more sad to see it abandoned.

STAY AWAY from this game at all costs! The developers don't care about the players and the suffering their garbage game is causing. The game had/has potential to be great but the developers are a joke and never add any new content and never fix any of the endless bugs and exploits.\n\nI lost everything on a max level character on a PvP server to Chinese hackers and exploiters even though I had massive base defenses. I had multiple of each of the supposed strongest base defenses and they had all of my stuff by the time I got back from work. I won't say how they did it to protect the players that are still suffering playing this game on PvP servers. The developers didn't do anything about it and gave a canned response about being sorry this happened to me, have a good day.\n\nI started over on a PvE server and the problems continued. I have had multiple bases full of gear and tames disappear in a blink of an eye. If for some reason you can't log into the game you will instantly lose your lower tier base. I found no way of knowing what happened to the tames because the game is not user friendly at all regarding things like this.\n\nYou will not have many places to build because players with claim all of the land by placing columns everywhere which will not allow you to place any building structures. I have a jackass that placed Stone columns all over the area around the Dwarven City and guess what the developers won't do anything to stop it.\n\nThe most recent issue I had which prompted me to write this review is I was not able to log in to save my lower tier base (stone) in time before it decayed. I was standing in the open field all by myself where my original base was located. Everything was gone including 3 max level flyers and multiple other useful tames. I went to my main Dwarven Manor base which I recently started to move into and everything was there except the one tame I had living there was gone. This tame was my refrigerator Ice Element where I kept my expensive Mythical Feed as well as other rare feeds ($250,000 gold value if bought in shop). I don't know how he would have just disappeared so this is a prime example of how buggy this game is. The developers didn't give a damn when I contacted them and gave the usual canned response. They were unable to explain the cause of these issues. Just clueless about their own game is all.\n\nThe game is full of hidden spots to get stuck in and you will never get out without killing yourself. The whole back half of the Dwarven and Elven castles are death drops into the bottom of the map. Half of the tames are under the map and I have actually tamed a max level tame under the map.\n\nI could easily go on and on about the problems with this game but I have said far more than I wanted to. The bottom line is the game is very broke and the developers will not fix any of it. I really wish they would sell the game to a better established company because I really like certain things about the game.

I love the concept of the game, i love the world, i love the enemy design, i love all the different magic types, but..\n\nMy god, it's so, so horribly executed. It's no secret this game is dying, with a bit of luck, you'll find a server with more than 10 people on, but in some cases you won't even find a server with 5 people on. \n\nThey released a DLC, Shard of Faith, even though the original map is full of broken things. In the vanilla map, you either spawn as a human, elf, or dwarf. Depending on this choice, you spawn in a different part of the map, in a kingdom relevant to your race. Once spawned, you wander out into the wild. But oh no, what's this? A grim reaper and some undead have spawned right outside of the kingdom, instantly attacking you and killing both you and the guards of the kingdom. With a bit of luck, the enemies are defeated. If not, they'll kill the guards and LITERALLY WALK INTO THE KINGDOM KILLING EVERYTHING. If you're extremely lucky, you manage to make it out into the wild. Well, that's great. But now there's a ton of wolves, hyenas, and god knows what else around you. Oh that's fine, you think. You'll just walk around them. Well.. no. These enemies are INCREDIBLY hostile, ALWAYS faster than you, and they can detect you from miles away. \n\nOne of the only ways you'll escape from your prison you call a kingdom, is to buy a horse. The problem is, horses cost a different amount of money depending on their level. So if the stables don't have any low-level horses, you're forced to punch about a billion barrels to accumulate a large amount of money to buy a horse. But god damn you if you play as an elf. The horse stables for the elves are placed in the most ridiculous place ever. You have to go through a mountain, which is swarming with griffins. Now, ladies and gentlemen, griffins are hell in this game. They can attack every microsecond, and they're very fast. 80% chance that you won't even make it to the stables in the first place. And it's highly likely that if you DO make it, there's some sort of overpowered PoS monster guarding it.\n\nSo, after you've spent about 5 hours grinding coins, and have died around 50 times trying to get a horse, you finally have one. My god, is it beautiful. Finally a mount that can keep you save while you run into the wild. Well, i really hope you don't accidentally bump into a guard. The first time i got a horse, i spent hours to get it, only to accidentally bump into a guard. And flip me, they hold a grudge. They got so mad i accidentally bumped into them, they decided to KILL MY DAMN HORSE.\n\nOkay, okay. You've finally made it into the wild. You're building a little house, and everyone is happy. Well, now you need to grind for wood, thatch and stone. That takes long, but okay, that's common in these types of game. Now, even in the beginning areas of the game, some enemies are incredibly high-levelled, and they will ruin your life for days to come. You finally tame a creature, but alas, a level 100 hyena detects you from 50 meters away, and they kill it within a second. \n\nThere's also a kingdom system, where you can register to become a king. The only problem is, the feature isn't finished yet. Nobody can sit in the Throne cause you can't even sit, and if you do become a king, there is literally NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO. It's a broken, unfinished system. The kingdoms have a lot of random buildings in them, and you can even hire houses if you don't want to live in the wild. This is another problem, the houses you hire cost a lot of coins, so you'll spend hours grinding coins just to live in a house for 2 days. It's literally worthless. A lot of the buildings in the kingdoms don't even work correctly, as you can LITERALLY WALK THROUGH THE WALLS. \n\nI'd tell you about the DLCs, but i've yet to play it. I've been putting it off just so i don't disappoint myself. \n\nSorry this review was long, but here's the small TL;DR bit.\n\nThis game, conceptually, is incredibly fun. But it's execution is.. pathetic. If you thought the ATLAS launch was bad, this is 100x worse. There's spelling mistakes everywhere, broken bits of code are abundant, the combat is crap, enemies are unbalanced, the game is incredibly buggy. There is SO much wrong with this game, but the developers just don't care. It's a shame, because if the developers did care, and they fixed the game, it would genuinely be a very fun game to play. Please don't buy this.\n\nP.S: I originally had a script for how i wanted to write this review, but i gave up on it and just wrote the review reflecting how i felt about it as personally as i can, which is why it's written so horribly.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1565698750, "timestamp_updated": 1565698750, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765774130821228027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34098400": {"recommendationid": "34098400", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973554597", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 17752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9434, "last_played": 1592220310}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: For those asking, QA = Quality Assurance, which is the official title of most Game Testers and other people who find and track bugs in games. They're paid professionsals--game developers--who help to ensure that released (live) games are as free of major issues as possible, [b]and[/b] help ensure betas/alphas are at least resonably playable so that players can provide useful feedback.  \n\nDISCLAIMER: \nIf you don't understand the situation between Snail and Wildcard regarding DnL and ARK, go educate yourself. There's good reason this is an \"ARK clone\" and it has nothing to do with Snail stealing anything. I mention ARK in my review but Snail's relationship with Wildcard played no part in my decision to not recommend Dark and Light. Below I judge DnL/Snail on their own merits with references to ARK for context only.\n\nREVIEW:\nThe status of \"Early Access\" does not absolve developers from all responsibility for game-breaking bugs. Early Access does not give developers license to treat their players like QA.  \n\nSnail is currently sitting on the wrong side of the above two statements.  \n\nThis game is in early alpha and is not nearly up to the quality one [i]should[/i] expect of an early access game. Do not buy this game unless you want all the pain points of being QA with [i]none[/i] of the tools and advantages available to actual, professional QA.  \n\nThis game is gorgeous. This game is huge. Exploring the map is breathtaking... and infuriating. The current state of the engine means it cannot load the game assets fast enough, and the game will stutter to the point you'll be unable to play for anywhere from several seconds to many [i]minutes[/i] while it catches up. In the meantime, you can only hope a creature does not come by and pick a fight while you're essentially helpless. And when you die, you lose everything including (probably) your mount, just like in ARK. Expect to start over from next to nothing repeatedly, possibly daily. It doesn't matter if you're an experienced player, the bugs [b]will[/b] kill you.\n\nLike ARK, creature models' collision is not a box or cylinder, but the actual model itself (or a low-poly version). Swishing tails and flapping wings will cause your character to rubber band, get stuck, and otherwise provide constant obstruction that would be comical if it weren't so damn infuriating. Same goes for dead creatures, which have both ragdoll physics and collision, leading to runaway physics simulations that can bring entire servers to their knees when a corpse goes ballistic and \"explodes\" into a mess of flashing triangles. Even if that doesn't happen, you'll often be prevented from getting close enough to harvest a corpse by all manner of spines, horns, and hilariously contorted limbs.\n\nIn short, this is a big beautiful game with so much potential. I actually like it better than ARK. Or, more precisely, I like what it could be. And if Dark and Light's only major issue was lack of content I could get behind it. Unfortunately, the developers want to treat their players like QA, instead of like players. Bugs which are causing players to quit are not handled with the urgency that they would be in a live, released game. Live game or not, they still have real-live (and paying) players who aren't going to wait around a couple of weeks for critical issues to get fixed.\n\nSince I already bought the game and sunk in 160 hours, I'll keep an eye on it and update my review if the situation changes.", "timestamp_created": 1502180371, "timestamp_updated": 1502313621, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 407, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765388846397399902", "comment_count": 45, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51123746": {"recommendationid": "51123746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048144392", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 36800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28154, "last_played": 1637488780}, "language": "english", "review": "Dark and light plays like Ark and Atlas but is set in a fantasy world.

This creates a sense of diplomacy if the server community works along.(read my experience on this on the bottom.)\n\nHalas i fear that the development team made an error when they created two different maps. This divided their player base making sure none of the server reach above population 10 (as far as i've seen) Nowadays i play singleplayer as i do not find a decent server to play on.\n\n\nWhat makes me return to this game everytime:\n\nNot long after the game came out i remember that the Dwarven king was the last Monarch to be put into the game. As luck and smarts would have it i became the first Dwarf king of my then RP server. However i used this position to gather all the Dwarven houses to a meeting and name their leaders as counsels of the Dwarves. Every week there was counsel meeting and the first one was a war meeting. The Dark-elves (sub-faction of the elves) have been harassing the colonies in the elf lands after one of the colonies tried to tame a unicorn (these we're sacred to the elves in this server). I do not recall the number of counsels but the debate became heated. I myself was an advocate for patience and a meeting with the King mage who ruled the Human lands. The largest Dwarven house who was one of the effected colonies opted for full on war. Before a decision was made i was overruled and outvoted by that same house, they took their seat on the throne casting down the counsel and starting the war on their own.\n\nThis memory will always be my favorite on this game. \n", "timestamp_created": 1560019843, "timestamp_updated": 1560019843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762622237205505371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63630918": {"recommendationid": "63630918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084335166", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2166, "last_played": 1542341078}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has been abandoned.", "timestamp_created": 1581881893, "timestamp_updated": 1581881893, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761608421802520752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33769046": {"recommendationid": "33769046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045111055", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2452, "last_played": 1513301425}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel like a lot of people don't fully understand \"early access\".

While this is true, there is a difference between \"buggy and needs work\" and \"unplayable\". This game unfortunately falls under the latter category. \n\nSingle Player mode works beautifully with very few issues, but the moment you go into PvE or PvP:\n\nThere are devestating issues with de-syncing of both players and creatures. This renders combat nearly impossible, especially in PvP - it's pretty difficult to hit a target that's teleporting around while you're teleporting as well. The combat in this game is simply not viable. Creatures that are meant to aggro you don't necessarily. They will sometimes stand there, not realizing they're being stabbed to death. When they do aggro, they will teleport around (sometimes into the air if they are a creature that has jumping capabilities), and your hits will miss the majority of the time unless you use ranged weapons. Harvesting their corpses is even worse. They will appear to be in one location on your screen but due to the de-syncing could be anywhere, which means when you're trying to harvest you have to swing blindly hoping you'll hit the creature, wherever it may be. Because of this, the bigger creatures are much easier to harvest (you're more likely to hit them) while the small creatures like rabbits and sheep are usually impossible.\n\nCombat against players is worse. You can stand point blank in front of someone and both swing punches or swords repeatedly (on a pvp/Knight server) and take/deal zero damage. \nCreatures and other players are no threat currently.\n\nI haven't even attempted taming yet, so I don't have any input on that.\n\nGathering from resources (trees, rocks, plants) can be problematic as well. You gather very slowly, perhaps obtaining 1 item every 5 to 10 hits, whereas in single player, each hit gives resources. \n\nAll of these problems do improve when you move away from the spawn points and towns, but they're still very much there. \n\nI would call the game nearly unplayable in its current state, unfortunately. I had high hopes for this, as someone who thoroughly enjoyed Ark Survival. These issues need to be fixed. \n\n\nOther cons:\n- forced 3rd person mode - this is a matter of personal preference. I greatly prefer first person view in games like this. The scenery is so beautiful, but it is cheapened by the awkward, somewhat jerky, odd animations. I feel that the character models don't fit in completely with the style and look of the terrain so it looks a bit strange and displaced. The characters move somewhat stiffly and I'd very much enjoy a good view of everything in front of me instead of always seeing my character off to the side. Camera angles also seem a bit weird.\n- Some of the sound effects (I played as a human female) are just atrocious. The 'dehydrated' sound effect is a constant spamming of a horrendous groan. When hungry, your stomach rumbles continuously. I think the sound effects need to be less spammy and some of them just need to be completely redone.\n- You can drink water from anywhere, including the sea, with no repurcussions. This was the case in Ark as well. This isn't a huge deal, but it really cheapens the \"survival\" aspect when you can drink salt water for hydration or get your hydration instantly filled from rainfall...why not introduce some sort of water filtering system & rain barrels?\n- I had heard that the map for this game is huge - bigger than Ark's. I don't know whether that was an official statement or not, but regardless, it's not true. I was greatly disappointed when I realized that. The map is around the same size as the maps in Ark, if not smaller. It's still an okay size, but when you have a lot of people playing, land-grabbing with pillars/foundations, and building huge houses and castles, you run out of room quick (and the game lags much much more). On PvE, there's no room to build. Already. I had to go far from town to even find a place to set down my campfire. \n\nOn a more positive note:\n- The game is beautiful; exploration is marvelous!\n- Building is quite good. It works similarly to Ark and has similar issues with placement - sometimes it's a struggle to put a ceiling in, for example, and you have to keep moving around to get it to snap. But overall, the buildings look nice, and it's very enjoyable\n\nI haven't given up on this game. Almost all of the issues with it can be fixed. I hope that they are fixed sooner than later. I would hate to see this game turn out to be like Conan Exiles. \n\nIf you want to play this game single player only, I'd say go ahead and get it now! \n\n**EDIT/UPDATE:\nAccording to several comments (I have not tried myself), servers with very small player bases also work fine. It seems that official or private servers with moderate to large player bases cannot handle the load. This needs to be addressed and hopefully remedied! \nEnd of Update**\n\nIf you want to do PvE or PvP, just hold off for now. Wait and see what the Devs do about all of these problems. I can't recommend the game to anyone hoping to PvE or PvP right now.

I was debating whether or not to give it one because this game is simply unfinished. It has been unfinished for a very long time. However, I still think everyone who enjoys Ark should give this a chance. I greatly prefer this game's Knowledge and Questing system over Ark/Pixark's engram system. You can unlock anything and everything by simply performing whatever actions are required to level up your Knowledge, and leveling up said knowledge results in permanent boosts to specific stats. It equates to training your character.\n\nNow, let's talk about all the reasons why I was about to give this a thumb's down.\n\n[h1]Crashes[/h1]\n\nI got into this game with two friends. All three of us have encountered crashes of some sort. They don't happen very often, which is a godsend, but they can cause some severe inconveniences. They tend to happen at the worst possible times, and when you crash, your character will remain logged in for about 5-10 minutes until the server realizes that your account is not actually connected. During this time, you'll be unable to log into the character. This means that whatever you might have been fighting at that moment will be free to wail on your soulless body for 5-10 minutes.\n\n[h1]Lack of Development[/h1]\n\nThis game is being developed by a small team, and updates are few and far between. Their primary focus is Ark. From what i've heard, the team working on this game is currently in the process of redeveloping the game from the ground up. This is going to take [b]a very long time.[/b]\n\n\n[h1]Bugs[/h1]\n\nIt's full of them. Those who have played Ark are familiar with the weird and wacky bugs that plague the game. Dark and Light is 100x worse. There are constant 3D modelling errors in this game which cause a ton of weird artifacting problems and what appear to be slendermen coming at you at high speeds. While harmless, they can still be very distracting. I've yet to encounter any bugs which severely effected by ability to play the game.\n\n[h1]Split Worlds and Migration Woes[/h1]\n\nThis game features two different worlds. My friends and I wanted to start training up Flying Mounts as soon as we possibly could. The problem is that the world we chose had absolutely no flying mounts. In order for us to tame and train flying mounts, we needed to Migrate to the other world.\n\nThis causes a few issues. First the other world has different enemies and none of which are considered elites. This means that all three of us had a number of quests in our quest logs that couldn't be completed anymore because those enemies don't exist on that world. We would need to migrate back to the original world to complete those quests and reap the skill / quest rewards. \n\nThere are several knowledge trees that can only be completed on the world we started on. They have good rewards, too. The migration between worlds, while this doesn't sound too bad, can result in a couple of potential serious issues. Issue #1: You can just randomly lose items that your character had. I lost a crossbow upon transferring and had to make another one. That's not a terrible problem, but if I had lost a higher level item, I would have been irked.\n\nIssue #2, which is way more serious: Sometimes the migration between worlds can fail completely and you will simply lose your character. We received this warning from someone on a server that we were playing on. Thankfully, none of us have actually encountered this bug, but it [b]can[/b] happen. \n\nIf it does happen, that character will be completely gone if you didn't download a copy of it to store locally. You'd just be hosed out of it permanently and you'll have to say goodbye to your character that you may have spent 100's of hours building up, and the dev team can't restore them.\n\n[h1]Maps[/h1]\n\nSo this game features a map system that I do find to be very interesting, but there's a major problem. The map is a type of spell which you need to create. It's a single-use rune.\n\nUnfortunately, the map is very small and it's not at all helpful. Remember how I mentioned we migrated worlds? Well, sometimes the map would show us in the middle of nowhere just outside of an island on our original world.\n\nBecause of these problems, doing away with the Map Runes in order to replace them with a dedicated map screen would be significantly more helpful. Please, [b]PLEASE[/b] do this, Ark developers.\n\n[h1]All races are at war with one-another[/h1]\n\nAs this says. If you're a human, you'll only be welcome in Human settlements. If you're an Elf, you'll only be welcome in Elf settlements.\n\nWhile it is possible for a Clan to feature characters of different races, you'll be horribly inconvenienced since each member can only enter their own species' settlements without getting attacked by its residents. Each race is also located in different regions of the map and it's not exactly convenient to to meet in the middle as things can get very dangerous the further away you have to travel.\n\nIt's best for you and your clan to all commit to one race, no matter what.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis game is worth a play but there are a huge wealth of problems that need to be addressed.", "timestamp_created": 1598207553, "timestamp_updated": 1598208245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75551372766494751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33769326": {"recommendationid": "33769326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054518090", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5413, "last_played": 1580347023}, "language": "english", "review": "When reading reviews, please take a look at the amount of time played.

Havent seen a load screen past joining server load screen. Also its EA so you can and probably will at times have problems loading in or joining a server, give it a couple mins and try again. Now onto full review for now, ill edit or add more when I progress further in game.\n\nMe and my buddy picked this game up yesterday and popped in on a PvE server unofficial. Both picked elven, grinded out some quests, broke some barrels, sold some stuff. Wandered out, died. Wandered out again, built a house. 3 Friends join in, We have a house going on now. Tamed a sheep, sheep dies to panther. Tamed stag, dies to treeant. Tamed a boar, ran away from panther. Tamed 2 more stags, and shoved them in our house. Said hello to our neighbors. Killed a few reapers. Got a scythe. dropped and picked up scythe until we got too house because it was 200 pounds. Wield it. Dreamed. Began grind to be able to use it!\n\nAll in all tons of farming building and grinding like all others except you have to use the skill you want to level and learn things for. Teamwork is advised on servers for bigger tames, but it just makes it fun. I dont really see much bad with it and the direction but like all EA needs some work. Servers stress some and yada yada, its all you read from people they dont speak of the good lol. Anyways none the less me and my buddy think its a great game, and will be an amazing game in the future.\nBest thing to compare it too is ark due to sister companys and same engine, but in my opinion its kind of better then ark. Runs smoother on launch for one, tames are more interactive (could use a different way then feeding trough or a different way around others bases like the troft being able to place closer). The map is pretty cool, its a spell and projects a large map with an arrow to show where you are. 3 races. 3 citys.

My thatch hut shakes as some unknown monster brushes up against the side.  It is raining and dangerously cold, even inside. Outside the hut's protection would be much worse.

If I don't light the fire I may very well freeze to death before the night is over, but if I do light it then my hut would show up like a beacon in the blackness, potentially attracting hostile players.  \n\nI light the fire.  A raider would have to deal with the monster in the dark before they could even start on my walls.  My ice bolt spell can inflict massive damage if i get the drop on the enemy. My terror shifts to confidence.\n\nI'm thirsty.  Should have gotten water before nightfall.  My house is hidden on a cliff that overlooks a river.  I can make it to water in about a minute.  I wait until i hear the monster move behind my house and run out the front door.  I can only see about 20 feet in front of me with the light spell.  The foilage below the cliff is so thick the decent can be dangerous even in daylight.  \n\nI make it to the river and retrieve water.  Upon my return i am startled by fast footsteps in the dark.  Panther, of the 12 foot long variety.  I panic.  I know that such a beast is deadly in daylight, but in the dark...  I run inside and lock the door.  \n\nThe hut shakes as the beast tears into the wall.  It won't last long.  I sneak outside as it is distracted and  unleash my magic on it from a distance.

Despite that, there are a few things the dev's should look into, or maybe are looking into already, I don't know, and I do understand that this is an early access game. \n\nSo. Let's start from the beginning, with the negatives. The loading times. They need to improve. Seriously. There is no reason any game should take 10 minutes to load, especially on an SSD.\nNext up. Character creation. For an early access game, the character creation is impressive, but please for the love of all that is holy make a button or something that pauses the character during creation. They move around so much it is really hard to create the perfect looking character.\nOn the topic of character creation, colours. Whilst the colour options are adequate, I would like to see more. Maybe instead of a slider, implement a colour palette, so that players can be specific with skin/hair/eye colours.\n\nMoving on. Starting towns. They're supposed to be starting towns. Forgiving for newbies. First time I got into the game, I walked out of town and had a level 112 reaper chasing me. I ran away, somehow, and I thought I was safe. Only to get a level 82 deathstalker chewing on my ass. I know this is supposed to be a survival game but come on.\nWyverns. Yes. It shouldn't be easy to capture/tame every creature. But to have to rely and hope for a glitch to occur just to capture a creature makes absolutely no sense. I would suggest some form of content to the game. Traps. It would remove the reason/need to glitch just to capture a creature and add more content to the game.\n\nEvolution. Elite beasts. Great concept for harder endgame content. If you're playing with people. You have to be within render distance of an trapped elite beast for it to evolve, its not really the best solution, especially for players that prefer solo play. Perhaps instead of a rule binding a player to the creature's render distance, or forcing them to play for longer due to fear of their captured elite beast despawning, maybe make it harder in another way. For example special conditions under which the elite beast has to be placed in for it to evolve. An example could be a special type of item that has to be placed inside their trap/pen that allows them to evolve? Or simply extend the total amount of time needed for them to evolve whilst removing the constriction of having to be within render distance and online.\n\nStackable items and stacks. Why does every item stack to a different amount? Why not just have everything stack to 200? or 100. Whatever. It's just really annoying, though more of a trivial thing. Must be my OCD acting up. Also, may I suggest implementing a button that allows you to drop all of the same item? Right now we only have 'drop item' which drops that item or it's stack, or 'drop all' which drops the entire inventory. Maybe have a button like 'drop [item name]' so for example if you have 8 stacks of grass in the inventory it would be 'drop grass' and it would drop all the grass in one click?\n\nPlacing items in towns or near other player homes/COLUMNS. Ok maybe in towns is going a bit far, but the whole no placing items near other player constructs is REALLY aggravating. Official servers get populated, and players randomly place columns to 'mark' their territory. The problem is, when another player attempts to tame a creature, they can't place the troughs because someone put a column down. Fair enough, no building near other player houses/constructs, but at least make troughs placeable. I can't begin to count the amount of times I downed a creature and...wait...why can't I place my troug....Ah...column....Fix it please!\n\nOther minor things. Some steep hillsides the character slides down and takes damage. Understandable. Sometimes, the character slides down and takes no damage. Sure it makes it easier on players, because they can shortcut, but its a glitch and glitches should be fixed, right? Oh, and bonfires.....you added an item into the game, which a player generally unlocks fairly quickly...except that item takes 2k wood, 1k straw and 200 sulfur. I doubt any player below level 60 will be able to carry that in their inventory. And even then, they would have to have focused all their skill points into carryweight. Either lower the resource amount needed, or make it so that bonfires are crafted in a workbench. Thanks!\n\nDon't misunderstand me. I'm not asking for the game to be made easier (at least in most cases), it's just a few things mentioned above don't make much sense and should be fixed. I also understand that this game is in early access, so these things are bound to change...hopefully.\n\nNow, other than the things mentioned above, this game is definitely likeable. Personally, I enjoy the game very much, and I've been having a great time with my friends playing this game. \n\nThe combat is fair, to both the AI and the player, other than the whole level 100+ around beginner towns thing. Despite a fairly small choice of weapons, each weapon that IS in the game, feels unique. From the charging of the bow, and strain visible when overcharging, to the slightly longer reload on the crossbow. The speed versus the slowness of the sword to the two hander. All very welcome in a 21st century RPG. The spells, and more specifically the different staffs are somewhat underwhelming, as there are no rewarding visual changes to the spells if of different levels, and the staffs upgrades seem underwhelming as well, with little to no damage boosts. Hopefully that changes.\n\nMovement, when not over-encumbered feels lightweight, though not too speedy, as a player can still be caught by faster creatures.\nWith a variety of skill trees, playing in a group is very beneficial, and fun, as each player get's to take on a specific role and focus on it, with the ability to also spend time in whatever skill they feel will be useful. Teamwork is satisfying and rewarding. Singleplayer might feel a little challenging at first, especially with all the different skills to master, and are needed to survive.\n\nVisuals are amazing, for a game in it's early access stage. Character models are vastly superior, in my opinion, to those of ARK, especially male models, which are less blocky. The game does seem to be a bit darker than most games, with no way to change gamma setting, other than through the command console. The game also has one feature which is completely missing. First person view. Hopefully, that is implemented soon. \n\nI still have alot of the game to play, alot of content to cover and discover, but these are the blaring points that I felt needed to be made.\nI would happily recommend this game to anyone who is looking to buy a survival game, especially with its competitive price. \nI can't wait for the game to be fully released, with its major glitches/bugs fixed, and alot of new content.

I picked a low pop public server and started a character. Haven't had a griefing incident yet. You can rent a room in town to keep some stuff safe. Literally takes 5mins of smashing barrels to make enough money for 1 days rent. But you'll want to get out of town and start building your own home, which is where it can get difficult.\n\nYou'll get pwn'd by monsters if you walk out the gates at level 1. Do the tutorial. Punch some bushes. Build stuff. You level pretty fast. It's why I went on an official server. I wanted to see how default settings were.

I haven't out run a wolf yet (well, sometimes some trees and a bit of serpantine! can help but, they're faster, as they should be). Unless you're SURE you'll be pwn'd, turn and fight.

The game itself is hard enough to warrant simply playing together as a team to survive what the game will throw at you.\nI am more or less writing a recommended review because so many people are saying this game is bad, and poorly constructed or a clone of ARK. But the fact is, you do need to play the game for more than an hour. I would recommend 10 hours is a minimum to give a solid and reliable recommendation for a game.\n\nThe game was developed by a company that is partenered with the company that developed ARK. So you will notice similarities in the GUI, text boxes, and some of the bugs.The taming system is similar to ARK as well, but remains different enough to be its own system and much more interesting to achieve.\nWhen the game was first released there were a few hiccups, and so many people gave bad reviews for the game. Since that time the game has had several updates fixing problems and there does seem to be a steady flow of bug fixes coming in every patch. Many of the reviews given here are no longer relevant. As well as many people having computers that simply aren't capable of running this game.\n\nThe game is very nice graphically. Much more different to ARK's graphics. Things look realistic and the extent of animations makes the game much better than other games.\n\nThe magic system is deep and requires a lot of work in order to accomplish higher tiered spells and rune casting.\nSimilarily the skill and levelling system is different to many other games and requires people to gather lots of resources in order to 'remember/learn' how to do something. \n\nThe map is a little buggy, the dwarven city I spawned in first has many graphical glitches and makes things look like they are falling into the floor or are floating above it. It seems fairly rushed in some regards. The rest of the map is very large and very interesting. The only other map problem I have is the inability to climb some fairly shallow surfaces. Sticking to the pathways helps though.\n\nWhilst not for everyone, this game does not truly support a minimap system. You have to know and learn the lay of the land. If you go on an adventure away from home, it's best you remember how to get home. Whilst there is a minimap rune you can craft, it can be difficult to see out in the open, at day time, and on a surface that isnt flat. But otherwise it is very cool looking and fits perfectly with the magic theme. \nI would suggest the developers add in a map system that allows players to chart the land themselves. Then perhaps be able to buy sections of the map from the major cities in the world. (the dwarves, humans and elves.)\nI am quite a fan of learning where things are, and not having the minimap permantly showing or available. It makes things real and enjoyable. As you level up in game, your knowledge of the land increases and so you learn where things are and what the world really looks like. I like it, but it isn't for everyone.\n\nIn terms of lag. The game is running a rendering system for entities which is too difficult for itself to handle. Whenever you go into a populated area, things do need a moment to load, and there can be a steady pause of lag. Most people complain about the game freezing for minutes at a time, this is simply the servers inability to work with a limited rendering system. Once the rendering system is fixed, things will be much smoother. For now, a simple fix is dont sprint into a city, just walk at normal pace and most the time, things will load at just the right speed.\n\nThe loading screens of the game have an animated screen and so whilst the game is loading, the loading screen lags due to lack of resources. Most people will have an issue with loading screen, but its simply a bad idea on the devlopment part.\nI have also seen some people have an issue with the 'Epic' level of settings. For some reason, this game will have stutters and lag on high end computers if the settings are set to their highest. Simply turn the settings to high, and it will be cured. \n\nI should also mention that being an early access game, optimization will not be at its best. Most games will not fix optimization issues until they are at the point in which they plan to release the game. Optimization is best done after the majority of content has been added to the game. This being said the game runs near perfect for me (occasional issues when walking into highly populated areas.).\n\nSo far.. I like this game, and I hope my long review of how things currently stand will help some people.\n\nI'd rate this Early Access game 7.5/10. It is early access. So you should expect it to be a work in progress. Early access can take a while, but the developers want constructive criticism and support to improve the game. Thats the purpose of it. \n\nGet the game, give it a chance, and you might just enjoy it.\n\n10th August 2017\n\n*Update*\n13th August\nThe developers have relased a patch which is saying to have fixed many of the loading issues people were having early on in the games release.

Summon the Elite Overseer. Proceed to get annhiliated. My mouser is still fighting it. Keep running back. The level 96 Elite Overseer wasn't even halfway dead. Big mouser dies. My clothes are broke. Satyr illusion is broke. Not a big deal.\n\nFast forward a week later. Took 3 of us to kill an Elite Kasha trying to get saddles for other people on the server. Several bear deaths. Ok now im getting a little miffed. This is the second big Kasha i've lost and 3 over lvl 100 pretame bears. Little much for a kasha tame that can't even solo the beginning elites on its own.\n\nBase built again. This time on stilts so nothing can spawn inside and destroy things. \n\nFourth Strike.\nFind yet another 116 bear. Tame it. Level it up some. I'm 42 now. Bear has 4k health and 300% melee. Can't get quest updates on mounts.  Go into satyr illusion. Try elite overseer again. Died pretty fast. Bear is still fighting. Get lost since there is no map- If you wanna call that rune of guidance a map when it does work-Thats freaking laughable.  Bear dies. Armor broke. Satyr illusion broke. Can't progress any more till i kill the elite overseer for 2 quests now. Try gorgon illusion and kite Overseer around. Ha yeah right. Killed again. But at least i got the bear saddle back.\n\nFifth Strike.\nFind 120 bufo. Spend 45 mins knocking it out since a spectre and werewolves spawned in the area. Finally chase it down and it drops. Go to place a trough. Nothing around me... Get message no structuring in the area. Can't place trough. Can't progress on questline.

So I decided to write one since those lovely reviewers don't allow comments so I was not able to convey to them as much. Thus they will be unlikely to correct them ever. \n\nQ: Is the game or development dead? \n\nA:So before I ever played this game (or heard of it for that matter) I understand it was not coming along well and by and large was basically abandoned. Then along came Snail games USA who purchased the IP for this game along with Studio Wildcard and the ARK IP. This game since that point is not dead. Also post Snail taking over is when I there my hat in the ring for this EA project. To be clear if Studio Wildcard had taken over I would NOT have done so. (Short answer: No)\n\nQ: Does this game have DLC (while it is in EA)?\n\nA: Yes and no. The overhaul done when Snail took over change the game a great deal. They released this update as \"[i]DLC[/i]\" for free to those that have the game, and that is what you get if you purchase it today too. They called it \"Shard of Light\", and it basically marks the ARK\"esk\" overhaul done after the Snail takeover. So really there is no shady DLC scammery going on here. It's not ARK/Studio WIldcard selling DLC for $20 for an unfinished game. \n\nQ: Would I recommend this game?\n\nA: Sure I would, it's like a more polished ARK with incredibly detailed and interesting monsters of sorts instead of dinos. The crafting is very different but the building is more or less the same as ARK. You will also see similar radial menus and other details that if you were not already aware would lead you to believe a lawsuit could be a thing. Of course it won't as the ARK IP is owned by Snail. The only issue I have is that I cannot host a game, so I am relegated to playing SP, or I have to be subjected to public servers otherwise. Something I am not keen on to say the least. I truly hope they implement this in the same way it worked for ARK. That is why until this point I have not written a review. I was waiting to tell all my friends to get a copy until such a time as this was available. Presently (21/02/2019) it is not. However the price was reduced today. It's not on sale, just reduced. \n\nNow if you have issues with bugs, or anything else that is part and parcel with a game being developed. Wait to play this if not buy it.

Whilst in some of teh other survival games i mentioned i crashed or was dcd from server every hour or so. \nDark and Light seems pretty stable to me, as i guess shoudl be expected being based off ARK. \nI really didnt enjoy ARK at all and Dark and Light is suprisingly way more enjoyable than i woudl have thought before buying the game.  \n \nIf you are reading this then im sure that means you have interest in this game. My advice is to ignore the posts on reddit and in steam anyone whos been around gaming for a whie knows that people will just post rage about a game for teh stupidest of reasons.  If you are a sencible person you understand what Early Access games are and what to expect from them and i say just go for it and buy the game you will definatly get your moneys worth. \n\nThere are a few annoyances with the game such as panthers / desth stalkers which can pretty much 1 shot most people and come out of no where but hey you gotta survive i guess.  \nThe taming is super fun.\nOh i forgot about Goblins!!! \nI wont spoil it but they are not as cute as they look stay away from their whacky sticks :)", "timestamp_created": 1511440303, "timestamp_updated": 1511440303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727941930294036865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82933527": {"recommendationid": "82933527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031271204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1608701540}, "language": "english", "review": "This is ABANDON WARE - - - THIS GAME SUCKS - - - DON'T Buy it. \n\n   I got it as a gift and it is not worth the time I wasted trying to play it for free, The bugs that were in the game in 2016 are still there, the last patch in 2017 added new bugs.
