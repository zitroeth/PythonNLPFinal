(levels are up to 400)\n\n\n\nPerk system:\nThe gist of it is that as you do stuff in game (crafting, killing, discovering, consuming), you earn perks which give your character ''buffs' in terms of harvesting stuff/food/water caps, wep damage etc etc.\n\nYou can make some perks permanently stick, some will be lost on death, depending.\nThere are different tiers of perk.\n\nI really think the perk system is the biggest missed opportunity for this game to shine because you have absolutely no way of knowing what actions will unlock what perks, so until someone data mines the game, its just random stabs in the dark.\n\nYou can spend perk points (practice points, no idea why they arent actually called perk points) to increase the tier of your ''saved perk'' slots so you can put rare perks into them.\n\nHarvesting resources:\n\nYou can harvest different things using different tools from the same object.\nSo hitting x thing with a knife yields something different if you hit the same thing using a pick axe etc etc.\n\nThere are a wide variety of different resources to gather, sometimes this is interesting, other times its just obviously tedious and annoyingly done to make you spend more time running back and forth from one place to another to generate items to make more items to do simple stuff, for example the most basic healing item in the game:\n\nYou need three items to create it, one of them is a cactus like material, you already find this in the initial starting area, but no, apparently that one isn't good enough and now you need to go to the desert area to get the same item (except now its got the word desert in front of it) to be able to make bandages.\n\n\nTech tree:\nYou gain tech tree points by ''discovering'' things/animals/stuff, which just means you see a rock and your character is too dumb to know what a rock is, so you ''discover'' it and bam, now you recognize what a rock is and have some points that you can spend on unlocking technology.\n\nSo then you can unlock a campfire, a bottle, tools/weapons/med items etc etc.\n\nThe tech tree has two major problems:\n\n1. Its basically the same thing after the bone tier, just called something else and more annoying to get.\n2. The actual game play loop around it is just time consuming and not fun, ill explain in detail below.\n\nTech tiers:\n\nStone\nBone 1.5x harvest rate, higher durability (compared to stone)\nMetal  - higher harvest rate/higher dur (compared to bone)\netc etc\n\nSo to make a stone knife, you just need a small amount of basic materials.\nTo make a bone knife you need to kill certain mobs to get the materials and you need to pick some stuff up.\nMaking a metal knife requires a lot more work as you have to go to a particular area to get metal which has environmental damage and stronger mobs.\n\nSo yeah, you could go get the mats to make a metal knife, its interesting the first time, however, the amount of time needed to make a metal knife vs making a stone or bone knife (overall id say bone is the tier you should stop at unless you have easy access to higher stuff) just isn't worth it.\n\nYeah you will harvest slightly more but thats irrelevant, cause the mats you farm respawn in a minute or two anyway and you can definitely make like 10 stone or 5 bone knives quicker than you can make one metal one, so overall you're going to gain more mats in less time by not making the higher tier item.\n\nAs you go along the tech tree, there are some different items that give you damage buffs and do a few other things that arent exactly the same, but none of it really enhances game play or makes a massive difference in how you interact with the world to make it anything to really care about.\n\nThe game seems to try to get you to explore the environment and find more efficient ways to interact with it by developing tech around that, which I think was a great idea, but poorly executed, both because of the obvious cookie cutter gear repetition and because interacting with the environment feels super plastic and fake.\n\nMy final point on the tech tree is this:\n\nYou're doing exactly the same thing at hour 1 to progress through it that you're doing at hour 10 and hour 20, the only difference is you may take slightly less damage from mobs/do slightly more damage.\n\nCont'd in comments, check last pages, from questing upwards", "timestamp_created": 1588692365, "timestamp_updated": 1588704795, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 871, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.922440290451049805", "comment_count": 90, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1589823249, "developer_response": "Hi!\n\nThank you for such detailed and structured feedback.

Bye Bye game! Enplex, next time listen to the players instead of the guy with the money that doesn't know anything about MMO's or gaming in general. Maybe next time don't sell off a great game because you get greedy!! \n\n\n\nhttps://steamdb.info/app/1239430/graphs/\n\nFirst off let me start by saying I have tested this game for almost 2 years. I purchased the game on steam EA, I even got the commanders pack because of how much I was looking forward to getting back in the game! \n\nSTOP RIGHT THERE!! \n\nThe game is nothing like it was in testing! So many of the game mechanics are now different and no one can explain why.\n\nBuilding and workbenches in your base was something you could do on day 1 in testing.\n\nNow you have to raise your account level to unlock things like PVP, respawn points called cocoons, and basic t1 buildings. To gain account experience you are doing the same 10 quests over and over again till you get enough account experience to get to the next level and the amount of needed experience gets more and more so you may be doing those same 10 quests 3 rounds, or find a quest you like and do it like 50 times or something. BORING!!\n\nThere is no team or group play like promised! The servers only hold 200 players but as you can see by the link at the top, there is barely over 50 players so you are alone mostly. The peak 24 hour player base as been dropping by 15 each day. Today it was 122 for 24 hour peak player count, at this rate, the servers will be dead in about a week or so.\n\nThe big patches are pushing out stuff that is already in the game, they held it back from EA to save it for some production of sorts to show they are making progress on the game. NOPE Patch notes from January of 2019 shows that the repair kits were already in game. I know, I used them, they were working just fine. So why claim they are just now coming out with repair kits ?!?! Odd, don't you think?\n\n[quote]New Features\nDurability feature deployment\nClothes, armor and weapon will have durability scale now. This mechanic will add the atmosphere of survival to the life of our colonists. The players will have to take care of their equipment by fixing worn out equipment with a special [B]Repair Kit,[/B] you\u2019ll find it\u2019s recipe under crafting menu.There are several types of Kits depending on the type of an item you want to get restored. It\u2019s highly important to stock up a sufficient amount of Repair Kits before leaving for long and dangerous journey.[/quote]\n\nhttps://pzonline.com/news/patch-0-04-02-2\n\nSo according to multiple online gaming mags and websites a Massive Multiplayer game is several thousand players coming together on linked or common server structure to share in the same experience. This game does NOT do that. Each 7 day cycle when your character, base, equipment, inventory and boost WIPE! You start over on a different server, or could be the same one, but if you wanted to go over to your buddies server, there is some kind of steam trick that the DEV team was told about via inviting through the friend invite, OUTSIDE of the game, and using a steam trick to get to the same server as your friend.\n\nSo no grouping or team play, not even massive multiplayer with total strangers.\n\nI had such high hopes for the game, it WAS a ton of fun during testing, but my guess is the money was running out, they needed to buy some time so they cut the game in half as far as mechanics and features and rushed it to EA at currently $29.99 for the base game. Going to cut expenses, push out patches of stuff that is already in the game but being held out, and showing a lot of propaganda hoping to suck in some more players to raise a bit more money before the vapor ware hits them right in the backside.\n\nI don't think the company has much time left, according to early news they had roughly 60 employees working, according to LinkedIn they are currently at 18. The company is getting smaller, the player base is is leaving every day and has since EA launch just 13 days ago from this post.\n\nThe game right now is a playable alpha at best with probably around 10 hours of total content. I wouldn't give $9.99 let alone $29.99 for this game. I don't see this game coming back. It's terribly sad too, I have almost 2 years and $40 in the game. Time and money I won't get back.\n\nIn closing, don't buy this. Have a look at Stars End or some other scifi survival game. This is not one to get.\n\nWe as players need to stop buying EA games and force the game companies to go back to OPEN BETA for large scale testing instead of us paying for crap!!! \n\nTake Care!!\n\n\nPZ Team  [developer] Posted: May 24 @ 7:42pm\n[quote]Hi!

As part of these founder's packs, there were key things that we would get for supporting the game early.  Closed Beta Testing was one.  While we had access to the game, we were also asked to complete survey's about game play to improve the game.  I participated in both - giving my best effort (and my time) to help.\n\nAs we got close to Early Access release, Founders (including me) were asking about one of the benefits - a head start.  This was originally framed as several days but turned out to be one day - May 4th.  I finally got my key, converted it to a Steam key, processed everything and launched the game.  Everything is going more or less OK and I grind out several hours of gathering, crafting, leveling of skills, etc. \n\nI go to login on Early Access release day and the servers are down.  People are complaining, but I have done enough EA games to know stability can be an issue.  I finally get in and ALL of my \"head start\" has been wiped and my character reset back to the beginning essentially negating nearly every benefit and all of the time I spent the day before.  The Discord admin advises me to open a support ticket.\n\nSo, I open a support ticket and after 5-6 emails, they finally understand the issue.  Now I speak/write fairly good English; however, the support people are Russian, so things do not translate very well.  After conveying the issue, their response was essentially \"too bad, thanks for your money, have a nice day\".  No effort whatsoever to resolve the issue.   No effort to make things right.  Nothing at all except \"I've sent this to the developers so that it doesn't happen again\".\n\nI have to say that I am absolutely stunned at how this issue has been handled.

You die, have to respawn a long way from where you died. You then run back just to die some minutes later. You run back again... rinse and repeat. What is the actual purpose of this game other than frustrate the player? I mean, Conan Exiles was much more polished when it was released and you know what? That game was fun to play. This is not. If you need to spend 24 hours a day crating and gathering things just to surive you feel like no progress is being made.\n\nA typical scenario is this. You need to gather 200 Thorium. It takes you about 10 min to get there and you mostly make it without taking damage. But all creatures and the environment wants to kill you. So just as you get there your water, food and band aids will quickly become depleted. So you manage to gather 20 resources before you have to head back in order not to die. You run back about 10 min, but instead of heading back out, you now have to spend an hour trying to replenish your food, water and band aids. It's such a waste of time this health management. It's without question 80% of the game just trying to keep yourself well stocked.\n\nSome quests wants you to kill 100+ enemies for meat but you can hardly even survive more than two-three encounters. On top of that you can't go without water for more than 15-20 min before dying but you have a flask for that. Combat is disconnected from your character. There is no feeling at all, no impact. Animations are mostly bad. When jumping it looks like you're taking a dump in mid air while floating on some invisible jelly. I don't know, maybe it's low gravity or something?\n\nCrafting is something you have to earn, but it's hard as hell and require resources that you will probably get 10 hours into the game. The NPC's and quests are just dull. \"Hello, here's a quest. Go fetch.\", and your off. Nothing is really explained.\n\nMaybe this game will get slightly better in the future but i wouldn't hold my breath. If 80% of the game is resource gathering, this won't hold for long since it's not fun. So right now, what it lacks most of all is the fun factor and the sense of progression. You play for hours and you get nowhere. You don't get stronger, your stamina doesn't increase, you can't run faster or jump higher. \n\nIt's released as early access but there is no way it should have been released at this point, it's simply too unpolished. Thank god this game was a gift, else i would have felt really cheated. Did i mention all the bugs and dropped frame rates going from 50-60 FPS to a steady 15 FPS... no?\n\nThere is a serious issue with early access games in general and this title shows it all to well.\n\nEDIT Response to PZ Team:\nI usually do an initial review after playing a few hours and then another later on. If a game hits me as negative right off the bat, it really sets the mood for my review. This one is based on pure frustration from the lack of polish. I'm not saying you guys don't know your job. But you need to realize the difference between a game that's rough around the edges, but fun to play -- and one that is just quickly pushed through the door in order to get the revenues going. It will actually hurt you more if your game is in this state because it will give rise  to negative feedback.\n\nMaybe 6 months from now this game will be better? Only time will tell.\n\nEDIT 2:\nAfter playing it for 11 hours i've had enough. The game start off hardcore and you have to complete quests and stuff in seven days which is really hard. But if you die too many times you turn into a Void creature. At this point you have to stay alive for one hour -- but if you die again -- you are screwed. All your progress is nullified and you have to start a new character from scratch.\n\nI mean, this is the most punishing game i've ever played. I just lost 11 hours of game time, so i can comfortably tell you that the game is now uninstalled. I cannot stress this enough...\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!", "timestamp_created": 1589569371, "timestamp_updated": 1589786091, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736750423908233643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1589572585, "developer_response": "Unfortunately, you got such a negative impression of the game.

I haven't given up on it, but let me list why I am currently not playing. I never got past the pve stage because I just got frustrated with the game, but let's cover the positives;\n\nPros:\nGreat concept, \nGreat design, game is beautiful and the soundtrack is amazing.\nran pretty good for me.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential, but here are the reasons I have stopped playing;\n\nCons:\nThe biggest and most glaring problem with this game for me is KEYS ARE NOT REBINDABLE. The current version of this game has fixed keybinds, and the keys for combat on a standard qwerty layout are AKWARD to me and make combat more difficult than it should be.\n\nIt's Super Grindy. Buckle up, this game is heavy on resource gathering and sometimes it's a real hike to get what you need to complete an objective, and if some of the resources are rare and you are stuck waiting for what you need to respawn, and when you need 200 of an item and the game spawns 5 at a time in an area, you can be stuck waiting for a while. I can imagine this is only more difficult in a pvp setting.\n\nSome of the biomes can be frustratingly brutal to traverse and since the game is an mmo, there is no difficulty slider to make it easy to learn and/or just expierence the game.\n\nHydration is important to the point it's annoying. Clean water is critical and scarce. You can build and carry multiple flasks, but heres the caveat, if you want to heal you have to keep your hydration and food levels constantly high to the point where for me, it's almost distracting.\n\nCrafting med kits is so stupid. In the safe zone you have to convert/combine materials on various devices. For the most part this is easy to do and you can walk away and esenttially let them cook and do other things and come back and grab them. Plus most items don't take that long to craft....except for medkits....they take 15 minutes each and you have sit there with the crafting table open for it or the time will reset, meaning if you want to craft 4 medkits you would have to sit for an hour with that screen open. I find this dumb, I don't know if this was intentional by the developers or an oversight. To me it makes no sense.\n\nThis was a hard review to give because I really wanted this game to be good, but right now it's just a dissapointing grindfest.

I'll start with one thats game breaking for new people. Its a combination problem of resources and the tech tree. The first time you will be able to actually heal yourself is somewhere close to the middle of the tech tree. So you have to progress a decent bit before you can survive more then 2-3 fights. This leads to players dropping their items everywhere on death that can't be picked up because its automatically a PVE server. I thought that it was great idea till i saw how much random crap everywhere. Health can regen without medkits but only if you basically have your thirst and hunger bars basically completely full. The resource to make a med kit is found in the desert and take 20 of it to make 1 measly medkit. annoying when your picking up 5 at a time while trying to fight off tunneling sand bugs that inflict bleed damage and are absolutely everywhere. so its not uncommon to have to fight more then one at a time. you might think well it would be easier if maybe i had better gear or maybe i just sucked? i had the best weapons, armour and tools at this point in the game. only way i kept myself alive to even make it to this point was medkits i got from the commander pack.

It seems like it would be up my alley, but it is worse than hollow.\n\nWhen I opened the map my frames drop down to unplayable levels, and I can't seem to get a solid fix for that. A driver update helped slightly but not much. \n\nTo speak to the gameplay itself. There is nothing here folks. Like really. People who compare the combat to darksouls or last oasis are drunk frankly. Hits have no contact with the target, the dodge system feels like an after thought, blocking doesn't really help and when you do your items lose so much durability and you still take damage... Durability I may add, that you cannot repair in anyway. \n\nProgression is totally meaningless. You have to grind hundreds of items (meat for ex) from mobs that drop 1-3 at a time and you have to use some of the meat to heal so that means you need even more. Not mention if more than two of these mobs gang up on you, you have no reasonable means to fight back. \n\nEven the higher tier weapons break quickly and do barely more damage than their lower tier counterparts. Making any sense of achievement feel hollow. Lots of people say it doesn't hold you hand which is fine, but frankly I don't think it/the developers would even know how to provide meaningful tutorials for the deeper intricacies of the game. \n\nGiven how aweful the combat feels vs NPC the eventual PVP with players is bound to feel just as bad. (If not be even more rage inducing because now those stupid gather quest mats you grinded for hours will be gone too) There are no directional attacks either. You just do jump attacks (which are pointless for the damage they do vs stamina they cost and leave you vulnerable after) or  forward dash attacks which send you though the enemy and have no collision what so ever and again cost more stamina than they are worth. \n\nMeaning that most of the time you will just be left clicking over and over adding an occasional dodge, and a block when you are too lazy to dodge. You might as well have clicked the target to auto attack like any other MMO for what good it does. \n\nItems are heavy, but you have no meaningful way to figure out where all the weight in your pack is coming from. Most things seem like they are only 5kg a stack but somehow you are still overweight.... too bad you need insane amounts of things in order to make the mats required for these items. \n\nCrafting requires stations you have to walk (5-10 minutes) back to the hub inorder to craft using stations you must do grindy quests to even unlock... Only to sit in front of these stations afk for another 10 minutes waiting for the leather to craft so you can make an armor set. \n\nOne of the first new biomes you are expected to discover is the desert. There is a desert armor set used to let you weather the heat there.... Only it doesn't work properly so even with the desert armor you can barely start to set foot into it before you are dying of the heat, while being attacked by random spiky burrowing creatures that you can neither block or dodge fully. (you can partially mitigate the damage) These burrowing creatures have such terrible hit boxes that you can't even land more than one hit on them per each of their attack cycles meaning that combat is more a chain of tanking dmg and hoping you don't agro another than anything remotely requiring skill. \n\nThe UI and inventory management is terrible. Things often won't stack on their own and while this is something I can see being fixed later, it's also so simple there is no reason it couldn't have been added now. \n\nDid I mention you can't rebind ANY of the keys for any ingame actions? That's right in 2020 you can't add your own keybinds or use those fancy side buttons on your mouse. \n\nI honestly haven't been this unimpressed with a game in a long time. \n\nGo play Last oasis for 1 hour and come play this and compare the combat systems alone. It's a world of difference. \n\nI wish I could say positive things about this game but I really can't.", "timestamp_created": 1588925404, "timestamp_updated": 1589148051, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61350780725479126", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1589147462, "developer_response": "Hello, LezLuna!

The servers are NOT stable in any way shape or form right now as it is EARLY ACCESS. The game feels clunky, unoptimised (as of this moment) and alot of the content seems as if its locked behind level walls....... what is that BS. For E.X level 5 you need to be to unlock MAIN STORY MODE...... level 2 for PVP.... so on and on. With that being said you cannot even earn XP as of this current moment..... SO WHAT THE FU*K is the point in playing it until it is stable enough to actually play??\n\nThe devs posted on their discord and i quote \" for anyone that paid $50 $80+ for the founders pack (and so on) ARE NOT receiving their items on steam so we would like you to REFUND your purchase on XOLLA\"............... like what????? So for the people that paid over $50 for this game are getting scammed out of their items that they were promised a few years ago when they funded/supported the game but then again atleast they are issuing FULL refunds. The way i see that is they used players to fund their game and then scammed us. It seems like it has been rushed and no effort, love, attention has been put into this game. What a shame i was looking forward to playing this with my friends.\n\nAll in all as its an EA game just now 2/10 for my first adventure into this world. I would however say i will be returning in the future when the game has been worked on for a little bit longer and had its issues fixed but as of now i would not recommend this game to anyone in its current state (IM SORRY DEVS).", "timestamp_created": 1588771038, "timestamp_updated": 1588771745, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574559390544891357", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1589177560, "developer_response": "Hi!

It's been in development several years and barely changed except some meta stuff devs invent to keep players interested.\nI've tried to gather cons but I've never finished because playing this game makes me sick. Here are some.\n\n[b]UI:[/b][list][*]UI is very bleak. You barely can't read it against bright objects.[*]Most UI interactions don't have any sound, graphical or animated representations. It lacks any feedback.[*]UI is organized and function wrong and un-intuitively. In you open menu it also contains drop-down list controls on the right side of the screen. Each of these UI controls function differently. Some overlap the main UI window with information, some drop down a sub-window, some change whole UI-screen layout. Some do absolutely nothing. So basically you can't guess what UI-control does from its appearance.[*]UI has lots of bugs.[*]UI lacks a crosshair but interactions with objects require you to point your view at them. When there is a lot of items close together it's a pain to select one of them.[*]Dialog UI overlap reply options over dialogue texts. Barely readable.[*]Being in a dialogue doesn't lock your movement. So dialogue UI doesn't receive mouse input at all. Very questionable design.[*]When pointing at some object (a big rock for example) there is an interaction hint that says to press LMB to attack. It is misguiding because it does nothing unless you have specific tool equipped and stand very close.[*]Using items in your inventory have a cooldown. But cooldown isn't displayed.[*]NPCs don't have any indication that they have a quest for you.[*]Switching an item using hotkeys doesn't have a sound or animation. It has a cooldown but it isn't shown.[/list]\n[b]Graphics:[/b][list][*]It's poor and out-dated. Low-poly, low quality textures. Primitive visual effects.\n[*]Visually the game is overloaded by meaningless objects and decorations. But all objects in the game lack details. They look crude and bleak.[*]The picture color is disgusting. Its bleak and motley at the same time. Color coding is nonexistent.[*]Graphics in the game lack any kind of style or general idea. It's just a disorderly garbage.[*]Tall grass hides resources and enemies and you can't see anything while in it.[*]No character customization.[/list]\n[b]Animations:[/b][list][*]Animation is horrendous. It basically doesn't correspond to any action. Character floats over the surface shuffling his legs. Especially it is most evident while sprinting. Character skids on a surface like he's pushing something heavy in front of him.[*]Jumping is just flying higher in a strange pose.[*]Combat animation doesn't give ANY information on a process of a fight. Whether you get hit or place a hit it you won't know. It doesn't provide any feedback.[/list]\n[b]Movement:[/b][list][*]Sprinting is barely faster than normal running but drains a lot of energy.[*]Energy recovers way to quickly making all this energy system a terrible nuisance.[*]You can run on walls. You can jump on walls. Some times your character will slide off the slope, but it's hard to say which slope will make you slide.[*]Sometimes you can walk up the slope sometimes you won't even knowif it looks passable.[/list]\n[b]Level design:[/b][list][*]Though it sounds silly but the world map was designed before the game was designed. That's ridiculous. The game lived through several redesigns but the map stays the same. It's a legacy asset that dragged through changes as a burden. And the burden it is.[*]Quests in this game revolve around a single point of interest on the map - the Hub. Making it a heavy traffic area. So the hub is littered with corpses and all area around the hub is littered with player built objects.[*]Some places are awfully designed. Like Alpha Kvar nest. You will waste a lot of time to understand how to get out of there. It seems the only way to get out of there is to abuse wall running/jumping. But then you will see that at the end it's blocked by invisible wall. Very bad design.[*]When you cross a biome border the temperature will change instantly. Like one step and it's 30 change. There are safe places but you won't know how to identify one.[*]Most of the map is empty.[*]It takes a lot of time to get anywhere. Destroys any intention to explore.[*]Lots of low level enemies that agro on you makes it difficult to travel.[/list]\n[b]Network:[/b][list][*]It lags heavy. In combat it's very difficult to understand what is happening. Damage registers seconds later after hit. Enemy animations are late and sometimes just aren't displayed.[/list]\n[b]Progression:[/b][list][*]Most of the things don't make sense or are unexplained. The progress is based on learning new things and completing quests.[*]You have no idea where else to get more technology or practice points. Somehow I got 76 tech points and I don't even know why.[*]Perk system is just a lottery where you have no idea what you're doing and what's happening. You just get a perk from time to time. There are perk requirements but developers think it's a good idea to keep them in secret. So much effort to make gameplay less reasonable.[*]Why only 5 perks allowed? Who knows.[*]You can't build anything until much later in to the game. You have to use crafting station in the Hub.[*][First craftable backpack is worse than the one you have from the start (and you can't lose it on death).[*]Most resources you need to progress you have no idea where to get.[*]It takes a lot of grind to get you anywhere. It seems OK in a PvE game but in PvP you will lose everything and will have to grind again.[*]There is a strange account progression system which hides most game features from new players. It says you have to get 200 point to get to level 2 account. I've spent 3 days in a game it is still shows 0 out of 200 points. But in game it said I've unlocked PvP mode (which is a lvl 2 feature). Beats me how this system works. Looks like you have to play the game from start over and over. Which is boring.[*]You won't get more health by levelling. You can slightly increase your health by assigning a perk. But the effect is not worth it.[/list]\n[b]Combat:[/b][list][*]Some attacks (Yutt poison spit) is unavoidable.[*]Some attacks are not visible enough to detect them and don't have an audio clue.[*]It is not clear where your attack will land and why you've missed an attack.[*]Some times enemy is immune to attack even if it is visually in attack range (e.g. a short while after dodge).[*]It is not clear whether combos are more effective than single hit or not.[*]There is something called \"Finishing blow\" but I have no idea what it is (learned about it form a perk description).[*]There is no clue at which point of animation your or your enemy attack inflicts damage.[*]Your attacks make no visible impact at all. Final hit produces nothing, no sound, no animation.[/list]\n[b]Survival:[/b][list][*]There are no survival except that you have to drink every 2.5 minutes and eat every 10 minutes or you'll lose your passive healing.[*]In some regions there is a danger bar which fills slowly and when it's full you start losing health. Moving away or in some shelter will quickly drop this danger bar.[*]Healing items are useless. I've barely noticed the effect.[*]Higher level food is useless. It restores more than you need to gives no buffs, but requires high lvl resources which are hard to get.[/list]\n[b]Story:[/b][list][*]Pretty generic. Space ship from Earth crashed on an alien planet. The Earth is totally forgotten then and won't ever bother you again.[*]There is a generic explanation why you can respawn. Because aliens.[*]The only somewhat unique concept is the Voids. But it's not used mostly.[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1589779611, "timestamp_updated": 1589779654, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555010139942169189", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1589797673, "developer_response": "Hey.

In fact, of my group of friends I'm pretty sure only one person even ended up on the same server instance that I was in.  There's no server browser, so it's basically pot luck as far as I can tell.  Even once you've managed to find someone there's very little you can do together at all initially, which brings me onto my main gripe...\n\nIgnoring the obvious question of why a multiplayer survival game should have the core game locked behind MMO-style quest-givers, the first major quest you get is tedious.  You need to loot a specific type of corpse that only spawns in certain areas, and once looted disappears.  The problem is that everyone on the server has the same quest, and is trying to loot the same corpses in the same places (only one person can loot it, then it vanishes).  You need to complete these quests or you cannot play PvP, or basically do anything fun.  Frankly, I had lost patience by the time I completed it (which took what felt like forever) and was given even more grindy quests to do.  Add in creatures that are too powerful for you to defeat on your own (and no way to formally group with other players) and it just becomes 10x worse.\n\nFinally, the combat feels clunky, awkward and unresponsive in its current state.  While you're spamming away left-clicking to attack an enemy your character will frequently continuing the attack animation long after you've stopped clicking (leaving you stuck for a fraction of a second longer than you'd want).  The dodge mechanic is a nice addition, but the melee attacks refinement for sure.

I bought the founders pack and tested alpha so I have more experience than most with this game. I had so much hope as I love the survival/open-world/MMO genre. Here is the problem. Nothing is actually that fun in the game. In other MMO's it's worth grinding to get better gear so you can unlock new abilities, mounts, etc. You are grinding to unlock more interesting mechanics that increase the quality of game play. In this game you do un-fun things, to reward yourself with more un-fun things, to go to do more un-fun things. Run up to monster, attack twice, dodge, attack twice, dodge. Get 20-30 meat, run back buy more food. Rinse and repeat. This is a cookie cutter survival game where the only uniqueness is actually a hindrance to game play instead of an addition. This game is just a grind that has no sense of community or attachment to the world around you. I already payed so they already got me, but don't let them get you. Watch one video you will see you've watched them all.\n\nAlso, how is this an MMO? Nothing you do relies on the multiplayer aspect and there is one class that specifically does melee damage with nearly the same animation for each of the whopping 4 weapons. My biggest problem with this game is that it isn't even CLOSE to what it tried to be and that was consciously not made clear before release. Game tout's PvP and territory battles when that will not be here for YEARS (If the studio really even plans to try to rectify this). \n\nThe mobs do not drop anything interesting, there is no sense of surprise in this game. Each monster drops the same thing everytime, no RNG, no rare loot. Just grind to craft everything and then watch durability before you need to go make another because they run out very fast.\n\nJust another studio that probably tried their best at the start, realized how hard it is to make a good game. And then went down the path that most studios do. Make a sub-par game and try to make up for it with marketing and community. No community could save this game.\n\nIf I've learned one thing. It's how to spot games like this in advanced and not get excited. Good games have trailers with actual game play and have dev-blogs that go into the actual game.

Look at Last oasis and Conan these are games that had horrific launches and atm... are doing well because there combat and core gameplay loop was and is fun. This game doesn't know what it is or even what direction its going. The quest are fetch quest which in itself are not bad however... there is one turn in area... for the whole map from what I've seen in the early game and no fast travel... why the fuck would you add a stam and weight system for a game that is a walking simulator and not give the player base some kind of hearth or tele home? The food and water system is so brutal I would rather play Ark's scorched earth DLC than this.

There was never a significant update to warrant it. I enjoyed the hours I put into it, and 50-odd hours for the 20-ish quid I spent was fair I think.\n\nIt was never properly developed/supported and the grind to finish a run got boring fast. Looking back I'm amazed I played it as much as I did.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review:\n\n\nIt's an Early Access game, people seem to forget that. I definitely like it.\n\nI imagine the folk complaining about it either don't understand the concept of early access or really suck at dodging. There is a chunk of running, but it's a survival game, and part of the fun is planning your expedition and learning from your mistakes. If you just want to be hand-held through an \"I win\" experience, you're better off elsewhere. \n\nI've really enjoyed it so far. The progression is interesting, and more complex than just craft up from area 1, then move to area 2 etc. I felt it was pretty balanced in terms of difficulty, each new mob you fight is initially \"omg!\", but with some better armour/weapons/tactics for each they become manageable. \n\nThe questline is relatively basic so far (but fine for an early access game), and the only real grind I hit so far was the 200 Thorium and 150 meat. They could nerf that a bit but at least the meat drops with bones which are very useful!\n\nCombat is good fun and rewards skill, although it's not clear why you might choose one weapon over another. E.g. the spear has the lowest damage, but no obvious advantages. If people are struggling with combat, they could add some tutorial encounters to teach dodging.\n\nThe look and feel of the game is surprisingly polished. No ability to remap keys yet, no character customisation etc. To be expected at this stage, but the core gameplay is solid.", "timestamp_created": 1588894747, "timestamp_updated": 1682550535, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534866452217102051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_positive": 173, "total_negative": 395, "total_reviews": 568}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwjs+n7EpoYC": "Mon Apr 22 23:49:11 2024"}}
