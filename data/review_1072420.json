I played the demo, bought the game the second I hit the end of it (something like 14 hours in), and never looked back. \n\nThere are many annoying little things in the game, particularly with the placement of items like blocks that need to be oriented in a certain direction and sometimes having trouble getting a room to register to complete a quest, but none of that dampens the joy from building something and having villagers come rushing over to clap and cheer and shower me with hearts. The game is so cute, and so satisfying. If you like being able to build on your own and concoct your own creations, you can do that (though it can be a bit restricted during the story line parts of the game). If you're like me and you like the idea of creating your own designs but then realize you have zero architectural skills, then you can still get the enormous satisfaction of completing a big blueprint that is laid out for you by the story. \n\nYou get to build grand structures, go on grand adventures, and build up a grand community on your island. The game has enough town building mechanics that you really feel like what you're doing and building makes a difference and you feel like you are truly effecting the world around you and also benefiting in a reciprocal nature for being engaged with it. And the writing is really good for a game like this! I found myself laughing many, many times at some goofy NPC dialogue that was actually meant to be funny, and there is a late-game interpersonal conflict and little mystery that I found myself genuinely emotionally invested in. Usually in games like these I'm just trying to get past dialogue to get to the next thing but I read every word of this game. There are scenes that are WAY too long, where you can't speed up the dialogue, and those SUCKED, but even then the writing wasn't bad it was just the fact that you had no control over the timing. \n\nMy biggest complaint is the tedious combat and the seemingly endless aggro range the enemies have. The combat does not feel dynamic or satisfying at all, there's no strategy, just a bunch of sword swinging. This would be ok if you weren't constantly mobbed by enemies while you're just trying to explore or have some fun fishing. It is a big complaint, but at the same time wasn't enough to ruin my overall enjoyment of the game. \n\nLate game is really fun. The world opens up and this is where you can really go nuts building your own designs all over your island as you wish, even terraforming the land to your liking. There's loads of optional targets to hit if you are goal/achievement driven, like me. There's even a few small extra islands to explore! Just doing the story line took me about 60 hours, so the fact that I have AT LEAST another 10 hours of fun, optional game play left is incredible. This game is 1000% worth your money.\n\nKhrumbul Dun is the absolute best level, imo. It is the crowning jewel of the game. \n\nNow I'm just waiting for DQB3, baybee!!!", "timestamp_created": 1707538520, "timestamp_updated": 1707538520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673123419284820557", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158017386": {"recommendationid": "158017386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030304437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2045, "last_played": 1691436255}, "language": "english", "review": "Minecraft with good plot and designed as single player.

But I often found they're really bad at [i]teaching[/i] you how to make your own fun within how their gameplay operates, especially if you're not naturally inclined for that kind of creativity.\n\n\"You can do anything!\"\n\"Okay, but what [i]can[/i] I do? Give me a few examples.\"\n\"[b]You can do anything!![/b]\"\n\nSee what I'm trying to say?\n\nThat is why I could never get into Minecraft: I would putter about with it for a day or two every few years and then just lose interest because I had no idea what to make or what I [i]could[/i] even make. And yes, there's extensive tutorials online, but I consider it a failure on MC's part that players have to teach each other how to play it to get the most out of it.\nEven Terraria, which I played a lot more, I never actually finished until Journey Mode was introduced, cutting down a lot of the busywork. But I rarely if ever spent time actually building anything save for NPC housing, and after exhausting all the bosses and unlockables there was nothing else to do for me.\n\nAnd that, instead, is what Builders 2 is extremely good at. [b]It gives you stuff to do.[/b]\nIn a sense, the main story is essentially one long tutorial for the builder part of the game. Instead of overwhelming you by emptying the toybox at your feet, request after request, goal after goal, it eases you into the building and shows you what you can put together, all while providing an addictive \"just one more mission\\request\" gameplay loop. It gradually introduces the items and buildings you can make, providing a jumping board for your first attempts at creating stuff on your own. Also the tools you get as you progress are basically unlockable QoL updates to make more complex builds easier and less tedious. I would've killed to have some of this stuff in MC.\nAnd even outside of story progression, you get plenty of optional goals you can take on or leave for later, going through the game at the pace you prefer. Do I move on to the next story chapter or stop and near-literally smell the roses? I haven't checked out that island yet, let's see what materials I can find there...\nThat the story, simple as it is, provides some nice emotional stakes to go with the building is just icing on the cake.\n\nNow, for the bad... if I had to name anything, it's the rather clunky controls (the fact the A button is context-sensitive will drive you nuts sometimes) and how the adaptation staff was extremely dutiful in removing any remotely Japanese term. Also if you hate dad jokes you will [i]detest[/i] this game, but that goes for most Dragon Quest titles, really.\n\nSo yes, this ended up being kind of a long one, but there's my opinion: if other builder games bounced off of you, do give this one a try, especially if you find it on sale.

It has like 15% of the game in it. It is huge. You can easily sink 50+ hours into if you are the creative type. I think I had just about 40 hours and it is technically my second playthrough. \n\nThe game play area is divided into primarily 4 islands. 1, the Isle of Awakening is kind of your \"base of operations\". You get full access to everything you have unlocked in the story there to do whatever you want with. The other 3 main islands are story islands. Each one has a unique story behind why you have to restore the island to its former glory with your magic builder skills. After you complete each story island, you come back to the Isle of Awakening and have a series of quests to integrate what you unlocked/learn mechanics wise into your main island. The demo has the full first story island up until the very last quest so it has a significant chunk of the game in it. \n\n[b] The Good[/b]\n\nThe game is a great creative sandbox/town builder and it has a halfway decent story. I have never really played the other Dragon Quest games, but it feels like a classic questing ARPG where you are given a series of quests you have to do to progress mixed with a sandbox builder like Minecraft. There is also a ton of town building aspects. You can create blueprints and have your villagers build them, make farms, set up shops and other things for your villagers to do to keep themselves happy while also making some useful stuff for you. \n\nThe game also runs way better than it did on the Nintendo Switch. It is so nice to be able to way around with more than 20 FPS. I also flew through so many things on the first island I remember being painful or taking forever because of the higher frame rate. \n\nThe game is also made by the same guy that did Dragon Ball, so if you are a fan, you will love all of the references. \n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\n\nThis game is a console port. That is clear in some places. Locked FPS cap of 30 or 60. Some of the controls are bit weird (not nearly as bad as Dark Souls, but still kind of janky). Some of the textures are also pixelated as it looks like they were never scaled up for higher resolutions (I am only playing on 1080p, but the Switch version was 720p, I believe). \n\nThe game also used Denuvo according to Steam. I know that is a hard nope for some people. I am not sure if have just not played a bunch of games with it or not, but Denuvo has not really affected my performance at all. My CPU (i7-6700k) runs at < 15% pretty much consistently and I am not noticing any horrible FPS drops. \n\nThe \"multiplayer\" is also pretty bad as well.  The full game and story itself is not multiplayer. Only a very limited subsection of the game is. You can open your main Isle of Awakening for others to join and play with you, but you cannot do your story or go to any of the 3 main story islands while \"online\". There are some other things on the island that just do not work either when online.

It's easy to look at it and dismiss it as some Dragon Quest-skinned Minecraft clone, but it's so much more than that. \n\nFor me, the core appeal of this game is the town-building aspect, which I felt they greatly improved in this one (vs. DQB1). It scratches the colony sim itch for me, but in a way that's more relaxed and less punishing. Your game isn't ruined if you don't build a specific lineup of facilities, but your gameplay is vastly enhanced if you DO build them. With new QOL additions like the magic pencil, which let's you create custom blueprints, it's even easier to set up multiple towns. The interaction with citizens and monsters is almost Animal Crossing-esque, too. They will regularly say and do things that make me laugh out loud, even after 100+ hours of playtime.\n\nThe weakest part of this game for me is the main campaign, which you must complete in order to access a TON of unlocks. It's incredibly dialogue heavy in a majorly \"quantity vs. quality\" sort of way, and by the end of the campaign I was beyond ready to be finished with it. I'm saying this as a long time Dragon Quest fan--the story is cute enough, but it's given much more screen time than it's due.

It gets harder and harder to see how as new games come out that improve on its designs, and Dragon Quest Builders 2 makes one of the strongest cases for an alternative. There are so many things I can do in this game that I will miss dearly if I try to return to Minecraft, enough that it really just makes more sense to remain in this colorful, adorable world. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be done with the story or the building anytime soon, and the more time I spend on both, the more enraptured I become with them.\n\nYears ago, a legendary builder roamed the world and taught people the joys of creation. Since those halcyon days, though, the Children of Hargon have swept the land and undone nearly all of the work that lost hero did. Preaching destruction and subservience, the Children allow no building to stand and no spark of creativity to flourish in their presence. But you don\u2019t care about that, because you\u2019re a bright-eyed builder with the world at their fingertips! Left shipwrecked after a strange storm with the mysterious Malroth and the impetuous Lulu, it\u2019s up to you to build shelters and services, brainstorm crafty solutions to problems, and befriend the forlorn people of the world to restore their long-lost hope. The Children of Hargon won\u2019t just let you ply your trade without question, of course, but you may find yourself surprised where some of them fall on your works.\n\nThe story of Dragon Quest Builders 2 is built out of the framework of the original Dragon Quest 2, imagining a world where the original three heroes never came together and Hargon\u2019s minions were able to run amok. While the monsters and music will be immediately recognizable to fans of the classic RPG, the story is very much its own thing and offers plenty of surprises, especially if you recognize the name Malroth. Story is also one of the biggest strengths this game has over its peers in the free-form building and survival genres, because it is very much full JRPG fare across five huge plot-driven islands. You\u2019ll meet all manner of eclectic characters, brought to life with charming animations and top-notch localization, and complete quests that are mostly focused on building things and finding resources, rather than battling. The main story is easily a 60-80-hour engagement even if you focus solely on progression, with plenty of heartwarming moments and cute twists.\n\nCute is absolutely the keyword for this one, and one glance at the screenshots should show you that much. The modern Dragon Quest style of round, colorful Toriyama art gives the entire game a friendly, inviting feel, and the writing absolutely follows this lead. You\u2019ll still have moments of drama, but the tone is always quick to bounce back with some snappy lines. This dovetails nicely with the pace of the gameplay as well, which is loaded with clear directions for simple tasks that have really no time constraints whatsoever. You\u2019ll always know exactly what you need to do for a quest, with absolutely no pressure to do it until you feel like it. And that fact that you\u2019re raising barns and growing crops for these quests grant them an entirely wholesome feel that never fades.\n\nThe constructing is the cornerstone of the gameplay, and is another place where DQB2 outshines many of its peers. At the core of the experience are hundreds of blocks, decorations, and tools to make convincing fantasy towns and castles, all easily sortable in your massive, massive inventory. Placement and interaction distances are generous, especially in first-person mode. Your tools are incredibly powerful for constructing and demolishing, including a hammer that can clear up to five-by-five cubes of space and a trowel that can swap blocks in a flash. On the plot islands you\u2019ll need to harvest the resources you need but back at your hub island, you can embark on scavenger hunts to randomly-generated islands to unlock unlimited basic resources like wood and stone. This above all else really streamlines the creative process as you progress, and encourages massive amounts of creativity when customizing your home island.\n\nQuesting and building provide rock-solid pillars for this whole game to stand on, leaving little to really complain about. Probably the biggest limitation to note, especially for folks coming in from Minecraft, is that you\u2019re not building in a limitless world. Your hub island is where you\u2019ll really do all of your free building, and even that comes with quests to guide you. You can certainly build on the plot islands but you\u2019ll be even more constrained by plot concerns and limited resources. Building specific room and structure types, defined by size and decor, can also be difficult because they requirements are often obscured until you stumble across them. Some require unlocks from later in the story as well, and considering you\u2019ll be unlocking new blocks, decoration, and even abilities across the entire game, it can be hard to tell when it\u2019s safe to buckle down and build the city of your dreams.\n\nReally these are gripes borne from how massive and robust an adventure this is. It\u2019s an ideal marriage of building, survival, and RPG elements, and comes with important evolutions of each aspect. The building has so many options and conveniences I don\u2019t know how I could ever go back to Minecraft, honestly. And whenever I get tired of building bars and aqueducts, there\u2019s always more charming story to sink back into. Everything is so cute and inviting that I\u2019ll never grow frustrated with any of it, and there are few games that I feel so relaxed with. Fans of Dragon Quest and building games alike will not be disappointed with Dragon Quest Builders 2, and it\u2019s polished enough that newcomers to either will surely be pleased here.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

First - there is an extensive free demo available. Go try that out first. You'll be introduced to the \"core loop\" of the game in the demo, so you do not have to rely on reviews alone. That said, the full game successfully builds on itself with unique tools, engaging NPCs, and a compelling story. It took me a little over 100 hours to acquire all Steam achievements, though that was at a bit of a leisurely pace.\n\nCons? No voices, and there are several points where you'll get frustrated by the \"slow dialogue\" prompts that are unskippable. The building mechanics and tools can get a little goofy, so you'll have to get used to the controls a little more than you might expect. Unlike other games where I would classify these issues as oversight by the designers, in this game I almost view it as a \"I wish they had worked on these more because it would make a great game even better.\"\n\nPro-tips (or at least Platinum tips) to maximize your enjoyment: Let the story prompt you to build things as you progress. There are moments where large portions of the map are re-purposed for the story, and it will forcibly remove any prior work you've done in those areas. Build to your heart's content after that chapter wraps up when there are no more surprises to worry about.\n\nFor achievement hunters, the most time-intensive achievement involves the pet breeding. Start that early because there is an in-game time requirement that you can passively work through while doing other things if you plan appropriately.\n\nFinally, do not hesitate to pop open the Wiki and look up room requirements and the like. There are a lot of undiscovered room designs even after completing the story, and if the game was meant to hint at those outside of the direct story quests, I never discovered them.

I enjoyed the first Dragon Quest Builders, but this sequel outshines it in every way. It starts off deceptively basic and with characters that may seem more annoying than endearing, but they really start to grow on you, and the story and steady sense of progression kept me intrigued and looking forward to what was next. Each of the story islands is unique and plays out very differently, and the central hub you return to between story islands really helps tie it all together. The best part is how everything manages to feel so alive. Characters will eat, sleep, work, chitchat, etc. If you  build a field, they'll farm. If you build a kitchen, they'll cook. If you build a bathroom, they'll... use it. No, this is not a game for people who hate building in games, but that should hopefully be obvious from the title. If you do enjoy building, though, even just a little, this game has so much to offer. (I would say the building requirements to progress through the story are fairly light, though you are also offered an incredible amount of creative freedom if desired.) Memorable characters, interesting story, loads of crafting recipes to learn, randomized islands to explore and harvest, citizens to gather, rooms that actually serve a functional purpose, farming, fishing, pets, tamable monsters, optional goals that reward increasingly useful building tools... there is SO much content in this game. It took me 65 hours to roll credits, and there are still so many optional goals left for me to complete, islands to unlock, recipes to learn, and building tools to earn and use.\n\nIf I had to complain, the combat is very simplistic and a bit clunky (no dodging or blocking), and for whatever reason, there is a certain type of dialog that pops up and pauses the game for an extremely long time, though luckily this does not happen often. Also, there is QUITE A lot of dialog to click through, which may annoy some people. \n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed my time with this game, and I'm definitely not done with it yet. Hope to see a Dragon Quest Builders 3 in the future!\n\nEdit: I wrote my original review after rolling credits 65 hours into the game. At 123 hours now, I just completed all the achievements, and there are STILL things left for me to do, not even counting the pure creativity of building all the things I'd like to build now.

Yes it does live up to the name. This games demo is bigger than most AAA full games. After my time in the demo I had to purchase the game. \nHere's my pros and cons in bullet form\n\nPro\nSingle player campaign is massive\n\nStory is nice with ups and downs as well as funny moments. \n\nArt style is really nice (very much Nintendo rpg style) \n\nAmount of items/building blocks is huge\n\nNPC have functionality and will help build/Farm/craft as well as help defend \n\nMaps are very big with many places and secrets to find\n\nCons \n\nControls. As a PC user that uses Mouse and keyboard over controller it took some getting used to and I really can't use a controller. \n\nCoop is only available for the free play island so you can't play the story together and even that Is hit or miss. \n\nGame is very text heavy so alot of reading and not voice acting so be prepared. I sometimes found me getting bored with reading it so would get through it quickly and missed somebits that held me back a little. \n\nPrice. This maybe me being a tight arse but I find that PC games are starting to become the same price of console which I find difficult to come to terms with after decades of quility games at good prices. \n\nFinal thoughts \n\nDo I think the game is worth the price? Oh god yes I was reluctant at first but the game time and enjoyment make it worth every penny. \n\nIf you enjoy games like, stardew valley, Minecraft, animal crossing, and harvest moon its worth a go. \n\nThe story keeps you wanting more as every mission and quest leads you to learn and unlock new items/rooms/abilities\n\nI'm having a amazing time playing this game and hope that they add to this game later or consider a number 3 that would go on my wish list. \n\nHope you find my first ever review helpful but like I say give the demo a go it's free and if you choose to buy the full game you can carry over your demo progress as the demo is unrestricted with no time limit of the  first island/chapter from the full game", "timestamp_created": 1577063849, "timestamp_updated": 1577064143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661343157291412354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86059742": {"recommendationid": "86059742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114946893", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1612603066}, "language": "english", "review": "Totally unplayable due to the, \"tutorial save\" issue.

The game recognizes the idea of a \"room,\" which is a space surrounded by walls including a door. Rooms can have purpose, like \"bedroom,\" \"kitchen,\" or \"barn,\" if the room fits the requirements. I.e. a bed, a light, a chair, and a sign gives you \"private bedroom\" belonging to specific villager.\n\nThe problem is the rooms aren't really important enough. Yes,  you can make eating and sanitary facilities for your villagers, and your villagers will use them, but they don't really need them. This isn't the Sims. The villagers are perfectly content to starve, sleep in the open, and wallow in their own filth, and it doesn't matter. The only real benefit of proper rooms is you get Gratitude income, which you need to progress the story, but that's about it.\n\nThe story requires that you build specific rooms to advance, but you needn't do that again in later villages, or in the post game. It also occasionally requires that you build something according to a blueprint, with every block in a specific space. Blueprinted structures often look nice, but they're less satisfying to build because you must do exactly what the game wants you to build.\n\nSome parts of the game require that you build huge structures, but then the game takes away all the challenge by having the villagers build it for you, and usually supply the materials. Your participation in mega-projects is often just clicking \"OK\" to accept the quest.\n\nThere's combat in the game, but it's extremely rudimentary. Mostly it's a matter of wading in and swinging your sword until the enemy is dead. As the game progresses and you get more combat-capable followers, your participation in combat becomes minimal to completely optional.\n\nStill, there's a lot of story stuff to get through. You have four major areas you have to complete, each of which focuses on something different. The first island is all about farming, for example, and the second one is about mining. \n\nFarming is something that persists through the entire game, since you personally need food now and then even if your villagers don't. Mining, unfortunately, ends with the 2nd island. After that, the game gives you a way of obtaining infinite coal, iron, and silver without exerting any effort or employing any miners.\n\nThe post-game is pretty close to being Creative Mode. By that time you've unlocked infinite sources of most materials, so you're just building stuff to look pretty. There are optional goals like \"build this room combination,\" but few reasons to build those combos other than getting the achievements.\n\nI love games about building, but I want the buildings to have a purpose, and be part of a more complex system, where you end up setting yourself all sorts of intermediate goals using the \"village builder\" system to accomplish long term goals.

Buckle up kiddos, I usually write sorta lengthy reviews. Some with a grain of salt, and some with knowledge as a graduate game developer, and I try to spin some humor into it so it's not about as boring as sitting through AP Calculus with Ben Stein as your teacher. \n\n[h1] What is DQB2?? Since it's not MINECRAFT??? [/h1]\n\nDQB2 is a Dragon Quest game at it's very core. Dragon Quest is a JRPG series that has existed since the classic Nintendo Entertainment System (Phew, old I know), and it is in some regards just as good as the Final Fantasy series (It's almost like Square makes both those titles...) except Dragon Quest tends to be a bit more on the mature side-- don't get it twisted, this isn't an Adult game series, but the series as a whole does have rather suggestive themes and jokes thrown in. \n\nSo what is DQB2? It's a series based on Dragon Quest's world and lore that revolves around a young builder lost in time so to speak (TRYING NOT TO SPOIL PLOTS... I'M SORRY). The principle plot is that the evil High Priest Hargon has emerged again and has conquered the world, using his servants, \"The Children of Hargon\" to enslave the good townspeople and to brainwash them into thinking that building and creativity is the worst sin possible. You as the young apprentice builder must rise above those lies and remind the townies around the world that building isn't nearly as bad as Hargon's teachings say by showing them through example. In terms of plot and lore, play Dragon Quest 2, this game happens a bit after that time period. \n\n[h1] So, what makes this game GREAT?? (aka not Minecraft) [/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*] If you are a true DQ fan, you'll love the references and the iconic equipment, spells, and monsters to slay from the main series. \n    [*] True to an RPG, your builder does level up and progress as the game goes on (mostly by killing enemies), leading to more advanced equipment crafting, combat abilities, and ways of breaking blocks. \n    [*] You can in a way gain unlimited materials to build with by doing the Explorer's Islands; basically do a scavenger hunt that won't take but about 10-15 minutes (less if you have a good monster friend) so that you can build truly massive projects. \n    [*] For the graphical art style chosen (cell shading), it looks fantastic. \n    [*] About a dozen UNIQUE monster types to tame (Unique meaning non-reskins or similar in ability), each able to do different jobs you give them. Don't worry about taming monsters in the beginning. You unlock that later (around mid-game). \n    [*] It has NPC's that you will eventually learn to either love with a passion or hate with all your guts. (Looking at you Lulu). The NPC's eventually start to DO something when you show them the true power of building instead of laying around and making Squidward noises. \n[/list]\nSo those are the good things (pretty much all of them anyway) that don't make this a clone of MInecraft. Now let's go to the Bad Side... and also some on how DQB1 did SOME things better.\n[list]\n    [*] DQB1 had a better equipment functionality. With more options to customize your character. Granted DQB2 has TONS of stuff to keep up with, DQB1 was more focused as an RPG than a sandbox builder game.\n    [*] DQB2 while has a great story, it's really, REALLY straightforward. You'll realize a LOT of the game within about 30 minutes to an hour of playing. DQB1's story is sorta similar but it takes you a second to figure things out.\n    [*] For an RPG, you are super limited in customization. There's no particular skill trees to specialize in, and combat, outside of a few bonus abilities you learn from your buddy Malroth, is VERY tame because you don't have the ability to specialize into anything.\n    [*] Eventually the mobs start to become complete bullet sponges and the base raids spawn really quickly-- sometimes so quickly you barely have time to build. Even when you have the best equipment for that particular area (Including from elite monster rewards) they still take WAAAY too long to take down. Late into Moonbrooke is where it REALLY starts to get tedious. \n[/list]\nThat's most of the common negative tripe of the game. Here's some of my personal nitpicks:\n[list]\n    [*] Post-game feels incredibly empty. No more quests, no more side quests, no more monster attacks on the base, nothing else to really liven it up outside of a few more Explorer's Islands to collect from.\n    [*] Your main island can only hold so many NPCs. It's really quite a small population considering you get 3 zones to build in. I wanted to make a giant city, but it would feel so empty without enough life inside.\n    [*] The NPC pathing can get really dumb. I remember making a 3 stories tall main castle building for the Cerulean Steppes and the NPC's couldn't quite work out how to get out of the dinning hall I built on the 3rd floor. So they just gathered in one spot and slept in one giant clump on the floor. (This is where I just broke down the prefab and made my own... I implore you to do the same once you reach post-game)\n[/list]\nSo after about a 5-6 minute read, you now know basically everything there is to know about this game. I will probably make a general guide on this game soon so you don't have to scour the internet on very small bits of information. \n\n[h1] I give this game 8.2/10. It's very good, but not perfect.

Unless it's just about free building with your buddy (coop feature available after you finished the first story island). You can't take any items you got on the island with to your world, you can't get achievements, you can't register new items, you can't travel to islands (only to the building island).\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nI completed the game around 68 hours (including farming, grinding, building). I finally platinum'd the game on the same time I'm writing this review. The damn breeding waiting time took a long time because I never fed my cats or dogs. Only started doing this in post game.\n\nAnyway, this game is damn addicting and I'm not stopping any time soon. So many blocks and so many different things to build. I hope we'll get a Dragonquest Builders 3 with even better QOL changes. Currently it's really comfortable and easy to build and destroy. Couldn't say the same to DQB1 (didn't play but also don't want to touch because from what I read, building and limits are a hassle).\n\nThis game also has a building limit of 100 rooms per island, limited access to storage chests, drawers and other storages. Limits on the amount of people you can recruit, too. They should remove all limits or increase it even further.

Most aspects of this game are done in the form of a checklist, from story mode to the individual Tablet Targets and the item checklist on individual Explorer Islands as you pursue an infinite supply of particular resources. This type of gameplay allows for a player to learn what the game is capable of without being forced along a linear line in this otherwise sandbox-y game.\n\nPros:\n- Quirky characters in a quirky world\n- Story gets more interesting and engaging the longer you go on with it\n- Amazing creations and simple ones can both serve similar functions, meaning it's all in your hands\n- Over a hundred different rooms you can create with many different jobs your villagers can perform within them\n- Recruitable monsters that serve different functions than standard villagers\n- Online functionality allows you to visit offline versions of other people's creations and even create blueprints of various works to put on your own island if you see something you really like!\n- Collecting resources is easy and won't require an entire day out of your life to do so; the game even allows you to get an infinite supply of particular resources. Post-game even allows you to acquire items you've collected before but may not have enough of.\n- Incredible variety of decorations and blocks to place\n- Fun story-mode boss fights that offer a departure from the standard combat\n\nCons:\n- The story can drag on, especially with large amounts of repetitive dialogue\n- Action buttons on the controller conflict with each other, meaning you'll likely talk to someone when you mean to place something\n- Occasionally in the story there is unskippable dialogue that remains on screen for far too long\n- What is considered a \"room\" has requirements that may minimally limit your imagination\n- Multiplayer isn't fleshed out enough despite the trailer advertising cooperation with friends. This is a singleplayer game overall.\n- Combat is simple and not very fun outside of story-mode boss fights. It's not terrible, just boring.\n\nOverall, DQB2 allows you to create a world uniquely your own after you've overcome some fairly minor or even enjoyable hurdles. All of the things I've mentioned in the cons are really minor compared to the overall experience and if none of those were deal breakers for you, you're going to have a fun time exploring your imagination in this game.

If you're enjoying that you'll obviously enjoy the full game, and your save loads right from the demo game so you continue exactly where you left off in it.\n\nI usually am not that into certain kinds of JRPGs because the main characters so often act like grade school children.  In this story the characters were actually fun and interesting, still quirky and silly yet serious enough to feel like what you're doing matters and have the world be enjoyable overall.\n\nThe story isn't perfect or anything, most of the time it looks like we're being offered a choice as far as the story goes it's a false choice, you can't actually say no in places where you are expected to say yes.  You have freedom of choice when it comes to building and later on where it goes to where NPCs and monsters live, but the story is linear without choices even though it pops up choice screens quite often.  I don't really mind that much but I don't get why they give us the illusion of choice if we aren't really going to get one.\n\nStill the overall story did intrigue me right from the very start.  It was hilariously different and didn't take itself that serious while still feeling serious.  The builder is a great main character even though they don't get much story (it's *you* in the story so I guess they didn't want to take that feeling away from us).  We get to do minor character choice designs including gender and a few things which is really nice.\n\nI really wanted to play a building type game and saw the demo for this one and figured I would lose nothing trying it out.  I'm so glad I did.  I haven't enjoyed a game this much in years, especially a single player game (the single player story mode is approximately 80-90 hours long without even doing extra building and without counting going into multiplayer).\n\nYour building options will keep growing as you progress through the story and there is a lot of interesting and cool stuff you can do there.\n\nI'm not driven by single player games often, I don't ever get through games that take this long to play through their stories.  I give up after a few hours.  The fun of the story and building etc kept me stuck to this game all the way through.  I normally am hoping games end after 10-15 hours so I can get through the story and actually finish the game.  This one I would have been fine for probably a few hundred hours.\n\nNot to sound too much like a broken record, but definitely get the demo if you are interested in the game.  It has a huge amount of content and as mentioned carries over into the full game if you buy it.  There really is no better way to see if the game is for you than to get their huge generous demo.\n\nSome people seem to have an issue with the price.  This is a new PC game with 80-90 hours of story to play through before even getting into building for fun or multiplayer stuff.  It's detailed and beautiful and each island presents a new different way of doing what would otherwise sort of seem like the same kind of thing.  They did a great job of giving you quite different stuff to do along the way so that you switch things up a lot and don't get bored.\n\nIt also comes with all the DLC you had to buy separate on the console versions.  The fun and huge long story really make the game worth the money.  I've zero regrets and no issues about the price at all after playing the game.  It's just pure fun in a way I haven't got to experience a while in a game.\n\nI don't normally do pro and con lists, and 98% of the game is really pros.  I did have a few issues I wanted to bring up however:\n\n1 - You can carry so very much stuff in your inventory soon into the story that it can get hard to find stuff you are looking for (even though when you click to sort it they get put in a kind of order).  They could and should have added a search box for your inventory.\n\n2 - The few times you can't move the text forward yourself, it goes painfully slow.  I don't know why they gave it that much time.  It's like they wanted to make sure people who were just learning to read and had to read very slow could read it over to themselves about 30 times to really get what it was saying.  It's a big irritation that I hope they will change up in the next ones if the game continues to get sequels in the future.\n\nThose few cons don't take away much about the game.  I am full of things I'd like to see in sequels including getting to play the main quest co-op and not just do the building co-op, but overall this was one of the most enjoyable games I've played in my entire life.\n\nI normally like more \"realistic\" RPGs but this one was a great mix of the quirky stuff and just being outright fun to play.  I was actually able to get lost in the story a bit.  They did a great job developing a lot of the characters and giving them their own personalities.

I don't know why this is but if you have this problem buy borderless gaming on steam and launch in windowed, force fullscreen in BG, and it fixed for me and ran perfectly otherwise. I also recommend this if you have games with vsync issues. \n\nI think this is a really neat game.\n\nTechnically this is the first Dragon Quest I completed and I really enjoyed it. To the degree I bought all the other games on steam (which is only two spinoffs and one other game, but good start. I think this has really quality to writing despite being Dragon Quest Minecraft. It is very guided through the story mode but I found the story mode enjoyable enough so this wasn't obnoxious. I read the credits and it seems like the creator of Dragon Quest was in a Supervision position for this game and I think based on the writing I can really tell a lot of time was put into the story. It isn't a life changing earth upending plot but it's better than a lot of jrpgs I've played. I think the translation has a lot to do with that, it's very dry British humour and I think it contrasts the tropey jrpg archetypes and setting perfectly. \n\nCombat isn't great but it does have good forward progression. You're almost always unlocking something or other while working towards goals, be it better equipment for terraforming or new blocks and accessories. Progression feels satisfying and yet, if you don't feel like progressing, there's always something else you can do. I also found the different parts of the story mode added a good amount of gameplay variety and gave me Little King's Story vibes at some points. \n\nThere's basic survival, farming mechanics, town building mechanics, army/trap management and all kinds of little bits and bobs. The building itself is also very satisfying. Outside of linked blocks being obnoxious to make look exactly as you want, you can build a basic room in less than a minute with really intuitive block laying mechanics in first person mode. I think that's one of the strengths but it takes awhile to get a decent amount of things to build and this game doesn't have a \"creative mode\" when you launch it.\n\nAlso I think this game is really pretty, and I'm sure assets and designs are shared between this and the main Dragon Quest games but you do end up with a surprising amount of character and enemy variety for what is basically a town builder. \n\nSome things that bother me: The combat is terribly simplistic. Like actually one button. You can't even really block attacks despite shields being an equippable, so you have to scurry away when an enemy winds up. Even still, there is a decent variety of enemies and a few bosses dotting maps that drop extra goodies so there's enough forward momentum to keep it interesting.\n\nThe camera isn't very good. I think it has all of the aspects of a good camera but it can't go through blocks so it will randomly zoom in or out depending on how it gets caught on scenery. Also some advice: If you insist on putting roofing on houses, make the ceilings high so the camera can deal with it. Also the field of view is really bad in first person and ruined a few of my snapshots. Speaking of, the snapshot camera also can't clip, it makes getting many many shots much more difficult than it needs to be, usually my in game screenshots wind up better.\n\nIf you want a game that is a bit more structured than minecraft but offers a decent amount of block variety and building freedom I'd pick this up.", "timestamp_created": 1622519851, "timestamp_updated": 1622519851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.63895946741104126", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91063441": {"recommendationid": "91063441", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992030206", "num_games_owned": 3076, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 23324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23092, "last_played": 1624686006}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to recommend this, but I can't.

This game is so charming and fun, super addictive!

The first couple hours are tutorial'y, but after that it gets really fun, and if it scratches your itch, there's SOOOOO MUCH MORE in the full game. \n\nPC Performance: It's MUCH better than the Switch version, running on pc at 60fps, but is locked to 60 so no unlocked fps, and some weird stuff happens with the GPU Usage if you use the Windowed or Borderless mode, so stick to full screen till they fix the other modes.

It's a theme park ride, a tour - you will not so much as take a step outside of the carefully laid boundaries of your \"building\" experience, or be swiftly reprimanded and refused permission to progress. I've never played a game that keeps such a firm grasp on your hand for so long, to the point I was anticipating and expecting the next thing they would tell me to do before I even got there.\nThe writing is a complete joke, as I expect from Dragon Quest, but the peak of it is the game's incessant teasing of your partner's \"true nature\" and how he must awaken to it, in the form of unskippable floating text which hovers for an eternity per line before automatically advancing (no other dialogue in the game auto advances and there is no toggle to allow it to). This tedious \"god voice\" dialogue only gets more frequent and longer as the game goes on. It wouldn't feel so wasteful if they didn't thoroughly explain to you at the very start of the game that your buddy Malroth is in fact the Master of Destruction, but since he has amnesia they keep pushing it on him until, I suspect, he becomes the final boss or something after you're done building.\nEventually they drop all pretenses and rip away all control from you as your character is captured and thrown in a prison, enforcing slow, menial repeated tasks and identical dialogue for days while exposition is passingly thrown at you. This entire sequence ends up having no bearing on the rest of the game once you escape, which was really my final breaking point.\nI don't want to play it anymore. I'd rather pretend I never played it. But since that's not an option, and I got the game to build with friends, I'll probably end up trudging through it and see if it gets better by the time it hits free build mode.\n\nEdit: So yeah, that's exactly what I did. Verdict: no, the main progression of the game never gets any better. The third leg of the game introduces a base defense aspect with traps and chokepoints, but again, this is all done for you, and half the monsters aren't stopped by your defenses anyway, so it feels flaccid. Due to plot contrivances you also lose access to your destructo-buddy for the rest of the game so the molasses-paced god voice can convince him he's evil, making the already tedious combat take even longer as you lose both his raw power and your huge aoe team attack, which they eventually compensate for by giving you command of a squad of NPC soldiers to literally play the game for you.\nAnd once you get home and prepare for the finale of the game as you're warned of a point-of-no-return trigger? Grab something to eat, because it takes exactly as long to get through as the last leg did, marred continuously by odd side-jobs and fetch quests. It's not like there's anything you have to be worried about leaving behind anyway, since the game has strict level caps per area and you literally invent alchemy to forge the tools you need to build the final project, with superior weapons and armor simply dropping from scripted enemies.\nIn the end, [spoiler]it's one of those games that puts you in a spaceship and makes an on-rails shooter of the final boss, like Kirby or Devil May Cry, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't effectively a playable cutscene as your attacks are frequently rendered null so you can magically add new powers to your ship, while each time you take lethal damage you're automatically repaired. [/spoiler] You save the world, credits roll, you get your buddy back, and bam, you're now free to build whatever you want. Your clear reward is a recipe for an ultimate hammer, the ingredients of which including materials you've never seen up to this point.\nGood luck. See if you can complete all the remaining build objectives like \"make 300 farmland tiles on these rolling desert hills\" and \"build 25 room types that nobody will tell you the composition requirements of unless you look up a google doc in the steam community section, which is also slightly incomplete and might catch you off guard that a Reception Room specifically requires an unlocked furnishing called a Wall Hanging, as opposed to any other item in the 'Wall Hangings' section.\" You might even get rewarded once in a while with a hat or a completely useless copy-paste tool that physically places the bounding box on the ground and counts from the inside corner rather than the outside, making it impossible to copy rooms without knocking out the walls. But hey, these extra-curricular activities on your island are the only thing you're able to do with friends, so you might as well make the most of that.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm not the kind of guy who can slap-bang together a beautiful mansion in Minecraft. I just go with the flow and hope I'm making something good. So maybe me and this game were never going to be a good match. But the constant vice grip on my wrist combined with the miserably plodding pace that it pulled me forward really dulled any hope I had that I was going to enjoy this game about dragons, questing, and building. I've been enjoying embellishing my castle that the NPCs intentionally did a very poor job of constructing before the game ended, but I wish it didn't take fifty hours to unlock it all. Only stuck to it because I had friends around to keep me company as I spiraled into this abyss, but it would have been nice if they could actually play through it with me, and not simply parallel to me for us to meet on the build island at the end of it all.\n\nLook, just play Minecraft.
