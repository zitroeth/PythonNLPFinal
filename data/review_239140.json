The game's hauntingly beautiful soundtrack sets the perfect tone, while its horror themes keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.\r\n\r\nThe storyline is captivating, with engaging characters whose fates you genuinely care about. The DLC, \"The Following,\" seamlessly expands upon the base game, adding even more depth and excitement. It's a worthy addition that enhances the overall experience.\r\n\r\nPlaying with friends elevates the enjoyment to new heights, making every moment unforgettable. However, reaching the highest level and mastering all skill sets, especially the Legend Rank, can feel excessively grindy. Despite this minor setback, the game's rich content ensures you'll always have something new to discover.\r\n\r\nIf you're tired of run-of-the-mill zombie games, Dying Light breathes fresh life into the genre. Whether you're facing the undead alone or with friends, the heart-pounding action never ceases. And if you find yourself lacking companions, fear not; the vibrant Dying Light Discord community is always welcoming to new and seasoned players alike.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dying Light delivers an exhilarating experience that's worth every second of your time.

[/url][/b][/code]\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\nOk so, games where you forget completely what your objective was supposed to be due to getting distracted with its own gameplay and just roaming around are absolutely awesome. Dying Light AKA the Vertigo Simulator just so happens to be one of them. You can completely ignore quests and instead go apeshit, killing every zombie in the open world, much like I myself did before doing the quests! I suggest completing them however, to start leveling up and making combat that much cooler. I keep laughing my ass off when I climb high buildings, then grapple the zombies and throw them off. I then watch them fly!\r\n\r\nWhere Dying Light shines, is definitely on the gameplay. It has the perfect recipe: responsive parkour movement, and zombies. The cherry on top is the punchy feeling of melee combat. Crane feels very nimble as we control him. And I have to mention how well optimized this game is, despite the graphics being pretty high quality!\r\n\r\nThe story is where it drops the ball. I wouldn't say it sucks exactly, since you do feel motivated and truly understand Crane's feelings and actions. Things are justified, and the environmental lore is not too bad either. Harran feels very much alive, like there used to be an actual thriving city before chaos struck. However, it's nothing to write home about, in essence. It's your average Far Cry-esque plot, with a villain, people you're supposed to root for, a reason is given to hate this and that character, etc. Everything is there, but it's not incredibly well written.\r\n\r\nThe Following DLC manages to have an even worse story than the base game, with poorly written characters, and nobody's personality is expanded on. The whole plot could be summed up to two or three sentences. Again, the gameplay is to be celebrated here: despite parkour being one of the selling points of Dying Light, The Following cuts down on it and instead has us explore the countryside, with significantly less opportunities to climb stuff, but gives us a pretty cool buggy to drive instead! Running over zombies never gets old, and it's a nice breath of fresh air.\r\n\r\nHellraid is a strange DLC, to say the least. It's a totally separated short story that looks like a Skyrim quest mod more than anything. The \"Mostly Negative\" reviews for it here on Steam speak for themselves. Terrible DLC, that feels like a boring hack-and-slash fest. Even though this game genre is absolutely amazing, Dying Light does NOT pull it off well. One of the worst DLCs I have ever played, despite having a bit of fun.\r\n\r\nThere's a Co-Op multiplayer component in Dying Light. Personally, I didn't enjoy it too much, since the game is now pretty much dead. Every player is either AFK on the pause menu and doesn't acknowledge your presence at all, or just runs laps around a safezone, or kicks you instantly. Zombie invasions where people \"invade\" your lobby and have to attack you while playing as a night hunter is too unbalanced to be fun. The concept sounds great, but once you start getting stomped by players with 3k hours in the game while you want to play the game at your own pace, you'll realize it's poorly executed. Dying Light is best played entirely as a singleplayer experience. Plus, seeing other players ruins the immersion entirely, since the story is about YOU, Kyle Crane, being the best runner in The Tower capable of everything, and having someone else just throws that narrative point right out the window.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to achievements, it's where the game gets EVEN worse, and it hits the fan... As a committed achievement hunter for 5 years at the writing of this review and 55 finished games on my belt, I declare Dying Light the WORST completion I have ever undergone. The vast majority of them can be obtained solo and pretty easily. Some are extremely difficult to pull off, but doable, shall you put on your try hard shoes. But the ones that require the cooperation of other players towards the same goal, and the ones that directly need RNGesus' blessing are the equivalent of waterboarding torture. Trying to accomplish and/or organize anything with the VERY few people playing a dead multiplayer game is a terrible endeavour, and I'm referring to the \"Together Till The End\", \"Polyamory\", \"Harran Athletics\" and \"Lucky 7\" achievements. Relying on pure luck and exploits is also an idiotic move from Techland, when it comes to the stupidly named \"Homo Homini Lupus Est\" achievement, that is IMPOSSIBLE to unlock once you advance enough in the main story, and the only mean to farm for it is by using a famous exploit.\r\n\r\nDespite all these negative points I've listed, Dying Light remains one of my favorite games of all time. This game is incredible in what it does well! I expect to put more hours in it in the future, long after reviewing it, since it is permanently up for revisiting for me!

That is how scary this game is. \n\nMechanics: I really enjoy the parkour system and the chase sequences. Really like the use of guns and melee weapons in the game. Grappling Hook was the most fun Tool In my opinion x)\n\nGame-play: This game is a real thrill seeker if your into that, really intense and gets scary at night. That is the main factor i really enjoy in Dying light 1. Story is quite good, i would not say its as good as dying light 2 but i still loved It. I really hope Techland gives dying light 2 \"The Following\" DLC like in this game, when they release DLC 2. This was a really good aspect of the game as a continuation to the main story. I think that kyle crane's voice actor was really great too!\n\nOverall it is a 100% recommended to play this game! And its Sequel Dying Light 2 Of Course :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1711349211, "timestamp_updated": 1711454217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

no other game of better value than this one when it's on sale with all it's DLCs.\nThe graphics are astonishing, which is very surprising for a 9 year old game. What is also surprising, is how low your specks need to be to run Dying Light. My previous laptop was the 2013 MacBook Air with 4GB of RAM, but even it can run it pretty well (on low settings) There are a few minor issues, but i will talk about them later.\nThe story is just simply beautiful, even somewhat addictive. Combined with the Following DLC, you'll spend a minimum of 50 hours completing the game (this is not considering achievements).\nOne of my favourite things here, is the music. It works brilliantly with some game scenes, adding tension to night/fight scenes, or adding beauty to a panoramic scene.\n\nOk, time for negatives.\nFirst of all, I would like to point out that when you are playing on a mac that is bellow the M2 chip (M1 included), the game will randomly crash for some unknown reason, causing you to loose progress since the last finished mission. Techland, if you are reading this, please do something about it, because game crashes every 10 minutes are unacceptable.\nAlso, after completing the Bozak Challenge DLC, [spoiler] the bow you get is weak, and in my opinion, it's firepower should be doubled at least, for there to be a point of playing the DLC at all[/spoiler].\n\nConsidering all I've said, I think DL is one of the best games ever created, so I recommend you to get it.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1706649133, "timestamp_updated": 1706649133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157171039": {"recommendationid": "157171039", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013805536", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1689, "last_played": 1710548246}, "language": "english", "review": "its fun", "timestamp_created": 1706599114, "timestamp_updated": 1706599114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157167145": {"recommendationid": "157167145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252295444", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 3184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3184, "last_played": 1706469830}, "language": "english", "review": "Zombies!!!", "timestamp_created": 1706592841, "timestamp_updated": 1706592841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157144317": {"recommendationid": "157144317", "author": {"steamid": "76561199316308649", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1389, "last_played": 1681128693}, "language": "english", "review": "Dying Light, developed by Techland, is a mesmerizing and intense open-world survival horror game that seamlessly blends elements of parkour and brutal combat in a zombie-infested urban landscape. Released in 2015, the game has not only stood the test of time but has also managed to evolve and captivate players with its engaging narrative, dynamic gameplay, and stunning visuals.\n\nThe heart of Dying Light lies in its unique day-and-night cycle, which significantly affects gameplay. In the daytime, players navigate the expansive city of Harran, utilizing the protagonist Kyle Crane's parkour skills to traverse rooftops, scale buildings, and outmaneuver the infected hordes. The fluidity and responsiveness of the parkour mechanics contribute to a sense of freedom and empowerment, making exploration a thrilling experience.\n\nAs the sun sets, the game takes a drastic turn, plunging players into the perilous world of night. The infected become more aggressive and dangerous, and the city transforms into a hauntingly atmospheric nightmare. The fear-inducing night cycle adds an adrenaline-pumping layer to the gameplay, forcing players to make strategic decisions about whether to face the challenges head-on or seek refuge until dawn.\n\nThe storyline in Dying Light is compelling, weaving a tale of survival, betrayal, and the search for a cure amidst the chaos. The characters are well-developed, and the voice acting is top-notch, drawing players deeper into the post-apocalyptic narrative. The game also features a robust crafting system, allowing players to create weapons and tools from scavenged materials, enhancing their chances of survival.\n\nCombat in Dying Light is visceral and satisfying. The variety of melee weapons, coupled with the ability to modify and upgrade them, provides a diverse and customizable combat experience. The inclusion of parkour elements in combat allows for creative and dynamic engagements, adding a layer of strategy to encounters with both the infected and human enemies.\n\nVisually, Dying Light is stunning. The decaying cityscape, detailed character models, and atmospheric lighting create a visually immersive experience. The day-night cycle is complemented by weather effects, adding to the overall realism and ambiance of the game.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of Dying Light enhances the replayability, allowing players to join forces with friends or other survivors in the seamless co-op mode. The Be the Zombie mode also adds a unique twist, allowing players to take on the role of the Night Hunter and invade other players' games.\n\nIn conclusion, Dying Light is a triumph in the survival horror genre. Its seamless integration of parkour mechanics, intense day-night cycle, engaging narrative, and visceral combat make it a standout title. Whether you're a fan of zombie games or just enjoy a heart-pounding adventure, Dying Light is a must-play that continues to shine years after its initial release.\n\n\n\n\ngud gaem", "timestamp_created": 1706561432, "timestamp_updated": 1706561432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159144190": {"recommendationid": "159144190", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067786235", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 6195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6195, "last_played": 1704389917}, "language": "english", "review": "Much better than second version", "timestamp_created": 1708777883, "timestamp_updated": 1708777883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522523701190948486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160351457": {"recommendationid": "160351457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987422350", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1449, "last_played": 1710281872}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome experience, I recommend buying!", "timestamp_created": 1710191798, "timestamp_updated": 1710191798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163129271": {"recommendationid": "163129271", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970395722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1635, "playtime_at_review": 1646, "last_played": 1713476457}, "language": "english", "review": "Dying Light presents an open-world zombie survival experience with light RPG elements. Assume the role of Kyle Crane, a generic shaved head, gravel voiced, special military operative air-dropped into the zombie-infested city of Harran, tasked with reclaiming stolen viral sequence technology that has ravaged the city.\r\n\r\nNarratively, the game falters. Scenes unfold in a manner reminiscent of COD, with characters shouting their intentions while your protagonist remains muted or providing only meaningless contributions to the conversation. Tonally, the story's mix of dark main plotlines and whimsical side content creates a jarring experience. The main villain's cartoonish motives and underdeveloped allies fail to evoke any real feeling towards the events of the story, leaving the narrative feeling disjointed. \r\n\r\nOn the gameplay front, Dying Light is quite good. Explore a vast playground teeming with diverse zombie types, navigate dynamic day-night cycles which change your approach to the world, and utilize verticality to your advantage with extensive parkour and  climbing mechanics. Combat emphasizes strategic movement and risk management, though significant repetition sets in with time. Quest design suffers from monotony, primarily revolving around mundane tasks. The abundance of uninteresting side missions contributes to a sense of bloat, reminiscent of Ubisoft titles. Dying Light features a perk-based progression system akin to Skyrim's XP progression, rewarding strength and agility actions with skill upgrades. Weapon crafting adds depth, allowing players to modify and upgrade weapons with unique attributes. However, the durability mechanic introduces an element of risk to encounters (love it or hate it, I'm personally not a fan but I recognize that it adds strategy and risk/reward to the combat). Multiplayer enhances the experience, offering drop-in co-op functionality. Despite its flaws, playing with a partner can amplify both the positive and negative aspects of the gameplay.\r\n\r\nDying Light provides a somewhat enjoyable experience when played casually with friends. However, those seeking a compelling single-player narrative or immersive zombie survival or RPG may find better options elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1713476762, "timestamp_updated": 1713476762,

Graphics look very nice even with today's standards (game is 10 years old btw !!), game has a distinct look to it, the lighting is AMAZING at all times, the sunrise/sunsets create a whole vibe and watching the daylight fade away will always make you uneasy and nervous while looking beautiful.\n\n2. Parkour is a great concept for such a game and it works very well, lots of paths to take and traversing the city will never be boring. When night falls and the evolved ones come out, if you get spotted it becomes a sort of horror race to the safehouse, be fast or be killed, no other option. Climbing higher buildings personally terrified me cause i don't like heights but the rush of running on rooftops for your life is rare to find in most video games.\n\nThose two are the main attractions to the game imo but don't be fooled, it has a lot of other great stuff that are just not as amazing as those two, like the story or the multiple crafting recipes that expand your playstyle, or the lil ways the game helps you have more fun (reaching the tough-to-reach ledge, hit the tough-to-hit headshot, never disrupting the gameplay for small nitpicks if you so choose) or the fact that it has multiplayer at all\n\nCons :\nthe 25+ dlcs are too many dlcs but they are mostly cosmetic so it's kinda fine, enemies in higher difficulties do more damage to you than you do on them and it can make some sections tedious but i am also not good at the game xD, bugs here and there\n\nAs you can tell, i really like this game and i highly suggest it, almost no other game like it exists, it holds up marvellously even 10 years later and the days are cool if you like scavenging/parkour and nights in it are definitely worth experiencing if you like horror.

Before I even get into the game itself, the company added a giant screen you need to get past first that tries to make you play their second game (a worse game). We are constantly getting Steam update postings for their other game from stupid single player to four player board games, to events only in that game, etc. This game appeared to be their money maker and instead of doing anything this with - they are using this game as a billboard for their second game that nobody wants to play. And my issues don't even include them selling out. So my No is because this company isn't to be trusted anymore.\n\nAs for this game: The no applies because they have so many blasted editions with DLCs out the wazoo. Get Hellraid for the OP weapons, but the rest don't really matter. Get Definitive, I don't even know why Enhanced still exists. It got annoying playing with friends and we all think we have all the DLCs but for some reason they are missing one here, one there, and it makes tossing weapons in an emergency impossible. Also, people need to know to turn view distance off, set it to 0. It does nothing and we can still see as far, all it does is destroy the CPU. Something they completely ignored.\n\nAs for gameplay: I WOULD recommend this for the gameplay. While it's overly simplistic and the non-stop spawning gets annoying (stupid ferals/infected/criers), the weapons feel satisfying and the parkour is great. Sometimes the invisible walls suck, but otherwise it's really fun. Music is okay, the story is okay except for a few exceptions that I'll put in spoilers:\n[spoiler] The forced love story with a character I didn't care about, and the sudden change to psychic powers and the mystical world of dreams out of nowhere, that was stupid and pointless. We needed no more motivation to do what we were going to do. [/spoiler] and the ending. I REALLY wish they had put more thought into it, [spoiler] stupid pointless QTE. Out of nowhere. Climbing the building was a pain, but the ending was such a let down. [/spoiler]\n\nIgnoring the ending and the other thing, the game is overall very fun. So if it weren't for the annoying company behind it then I'd for sure recommend this. It was fun for the base game.

For those who have said that Dying Light's day/night mechanic is not what they thought and that time doesn't actually change in the game clearly haven't played past the intro missions. The first two missions are obviously there to get you started, so they're not going to thrust a timed day/night cycle before you get the hang of the environment and the mechanics, and thus in the intro missions, time does not change if you don't progress the quest. Past those two missions, day/night becomes very real, and incredibly terrifying. /endRant\n\n\nGameplay:\nI'm sure it's been said before, but this is what Dead Island should have been. Everything from the parkour to the combat just feels incredibly fluid. Running around is great fun, and jumping into abandoned houses and exploring/finding loot is constantly fun. And this is where I got caught in my first night phase. I was running towards my objective when \"oh look another shelter, let me go secure it,\" then \"oh look there's an air drop nearby, let me go grab it,\" then again another shelter nearby, on top of random houses and zombies (sorry, \"biters\") to loot, and before I knew it, I got my last radio call telling me I should get to a shelter quick (mind you, the Tower warns runners a few times before nightfall to get home, but I just have to keep scrounging for loot). I checked my map and realized I was pretty damn far from the closest shelter, so I just booked it. This is where freerunning gets exciting. With how seemless and smooth it is to run around/through buildings and across rooftops, the run to my shelter didn't feel annoying or like a chore, but more like a challenge to find the smoothest route (very similar to Mirror's Edge). Long story short, night fell, I shat my pants and crouched my way from rooftop to rooftop, listening to the horrifying screams of the nighttime biters as I eased my way into my little shelter. I've since tried to go out at night and see if I can tackle a nighttime bonus objective of a quest, and I can tell you, as of right now, I am definitely not prepared... but I'm damn excited to finally face the challenge.\n\n+ Fluid, seemless parkour\n+ Combat is fun\n+ Enemy AI is surprisingly smart\n+ Terrifying and exciting night cycle\n+ Scavanging every nook and cranny for loot\n\nCharacters:\nSome characters are well-performed while others just aren't. Gazi's performance, in my opinion, is laughably bad, but I began to think that it may have been intentional? And Rahim... he must have played a lot of Jak and Daxter back in the day, all he needs to do is dye his hair yellow. Brecken, Jade and Lena are among my favorite so far, with Lena reminding me a lot of Cassandra from DA:Inquisition with her hair and accent. Overall, characters are decent, and that's all that really needs to be said, so far at least.\n\n+ Some interesting characters\n- Some poor performances\n\nTechnical:\nGraphics are gorgeous, and surprisingly undemanding even on my single GTX 970 with everything cranked to max and at 1920x1080. Though many report a huge framerate difference by changing the View Distance option, I can barely see much of a difference in-game with that option set to half or max. The only issue I've noticed is that very very rarely, when you're fighting biters with melee weapons, the game randomly hitches, then continues normally. It only happens in combat, but not often enough to be annoying and that might just be my system. Overall, everything looks great, and the graphics and effects are wonderful. For an ugly game, the visuals are surprisingly beautiful.\n\nSound:\nMusic is great, but my only comment is that the music that plays when you're outside has one part where a random singer begins to chant, and I swear it scares the crap out of me every time. Bashing biters with blunt weapons sounds very satisfying, and you can tell when you've hit the right spot, while hitting the chest is usually a muffled thump. I've yet to get a gun though (I've spent a lot of time just wandering around so I'm not too far into the campaign) so I can't comment on that. Also, make a little bit more noise and you'll hear bone-chilling screams in the distance of the more agile biters coming to get you. Very satisfying sound work overall.\n\nStory:\nI haven't gotten far into the story so I'll hold off until I've completed it to fill this section.\n\nI basically wanted to come out and say how much I'm enjoying this game and to tell people to ignore the false statements about this game and give it a try.

Below is a review of the single-player campaign (I don't play multiplayer so can't comment on these elements).  Hope it helps you. :)\n\n[h1]What is it?[/h1]\nDying Light is a superb open-world game (a mix of survival, first-person action and RPG) where the citizens of Harran (a fictional place in Turkey) are becoming infected with a rabies-related virus.  Your task (as protagonist Kyle Crane) is to locate research regarding a cure on behalf of the Global Relief Effort.  You join a garrisoned band of survivors in Harran and take on the role of one of their 'runners' (people who carry out the dangerous work of gathering supplies and carrying out other requests on behalf of survivors) as a guise while you try to infiltrate and locate a wanted man and some vital data.\n\nThe game's large, open-world environments are incredible - set in the slums of Harran and (later) Old Town - both locations offering a different style of parkour.  Your movement will be a mix of running, jumping, using a grapple hook or sliding down cables.  Oh, and the odd swim!  The parkour is fluid, easy and not over-fantasised (it is not beyond imagining that a fit and strong man could perform the moves the game offers).  The campaign itself is of good length and enjoyable, and there is a wealth of optional side missions and challenges to complete.\n\nThe game is divided into two scenarios: day and night.  By day, the infected and 'virals' roam the streets aimlessly (often in huge numbers) but don't present too much of a danger provided you keep to rooftops and higher areas.  At night though, everything becomes much more sinister!  Not only are the infected out in greater number, but a darker, almost indestructable breed of the infected comes out for the hunt.  They're stronger than you, faster than you, and would like dinner with you (you as the main course).  There is no other recourse but to stay indoors and sleep until daybreak, or dare to go out and use stealth and speed as best you can.  It's worth it because you'll get double experience points, but you might not last too long.  You have been warned!\n\n[h1]Weapons and upgrades[/h1]\nThe game uses three large sets of upgrade paths for Crane: survivor, agility and power. You'll earn upgrades by gathering experience points in each of these three areas.  The weapon system is wonderful.  At first, you have nothing but bits of wood, table legs, the odd wrench here and there - with which to pummel the infected until they die.  But as your survivor experience points ramp up, so does the quality and power of  the available weapons and it won't be long before you're one-shot-killing the bulk of infected people.  Weapons can be upgraded with enhancements and buffs as you collect them, but they don't last forever.  You can repair a worn-out weapon only so many times before you must find or buy another in Harran.\n\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nFor more skilled players, a HARD mode has been added.  Good luck with that!  For the rest of us, I would say the difficulty is at medium level when playing on 'normal'.  You'll be in for some fights and reliance on parkour from the start, but nothing feels unachievable.  There will be enemies that at first will be too tough to confront head-on, but nothing is beyond reach.    At first, I tended to cling to roof tops and would become easily overwhelmed by the infected if I found myself in the middle of a street, but I didn't have to wait until too long before I was easily able to defend myself and reap all the resources infected bodies still carry once killed.  The only element of the game I didn't enjoy difficulty-wise was the small number of speed challenges (same sort of thing as the speed challenges in Assassin's Creed) but these are totally optional and nothing is lost for any player who prefers not to complete them.  \n\nThe parkour is really nicely done - it's easy to imagine that it's real-world achievable for a fit and strong person without being beyond realism (no silly platformer manoeuvres here).  As for choice of controller, I actually found mouse and keyboard much easier for the parkour than my XBox 360 gamepad.  Both are supported and hot-switchable but I found Kb/M more accurate.  Overall, gameplay felt fluid and fun, with very few frustrating moments throughout the game.\n\n[h1]Game quality and length[/h1]\nI have not yet seen a game world that is more detailed than this.  It's clear the designers absolutely loved what they were doing (the level of detail in even the least consequential things is astonishing).  The dust and particle effects are stunning.  The voice-acting of Crane is absolutely first-class and really gives personality to the protagonist.  I didn't feel many of the NPC characters were quite so strong, but they weren't bad either.  It took me over 100 hours to complete the game, but on average I take twice as long as the average gamer, so expect at least 50 hours of gameplay.  The story was enjoyable without being too predictable (a few twists and turns along the way) and it has left me wanting to replay the game.\n\nPerformance-wise, I only had problems with one area towards the end where framerates dropped and grass polygons were no longer rendering correctly.  Out of 100 hours, that was about 10 minutes of gameplay, but I'm running the game with a 6Gb nvidia Titan Black on a new 6-core i7, so there is a good chance there will be the same or similar problems on anything less than that (caveat: I did ramp up every single setting in the game) so you might need to dial back some things, but frankly, no matter what level of settings you use, you will still be impressed by the graphics.\n\n[h1]Anything not to like?[/h1]\nWhile the side missions were varied and fun, I didn't much like the speed challenges as they really didn't fit well with the story and were a tad too difficult for bad gamers like me!  Sometimes, 'trap' zombies were placed purposely behind closed doors with no chance for the player to take avoiding action, resulting in immediate death; death isn't a huge problem (you'll just lose a chunk of experience points) but it felt a bit unnecessary to put these deliberate traps in the game.  Finally, there is a big announcement on-screen about being about to embark on the final part of the game (it's really just to tell you that while the game will end you will still be able to finish off other missions and such).  This totally broke the immersion for me (I would rather the game just flowed into that final sequence) but it's a petty thing really, demonstrating that there really isn't much to dislike about the game at all.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nDying Light is an incredible game.  Single-players are getting a LOT of game for the money here, and even at full price it feels like a bargain. Even if you're not struck by zombie games, if you like a GOOD open-world game, I really recommend it.

How often have I not decided to go do this quest a few hours before sundown thinking \"plenty of time\" only on the way to the objective I stumble on some other stuff to do, like this dude that wants help retrieving his fishing rod or something. *Looks at sun* \"sure I can do that, plenty of time still\". Then only 5 minutes before night, I complete the mission and reallize how close to evil night I am. Frantically begin sprinting and parkouring for the nearest safehouse. On the way I find a police van practically unguarded! Knowing how good the loot can get in these police vans I just gotta open it and get the goodies. After all it could be rifle ammo, or a new shiny weapon! Im usually not more than a minute or so picking the lock. Done looting, but oh shit! it's almost 20:00, my watch is beeping, night is coming now! A few hundred yeards from the safehouse still it's too late, monsters emerges and I need to slow down and try to stealth my way back. Jumping over a fence I dump down practically in front of a dreaded volatile. Knowing it can rip me to shreds in seconds I flash my ultra violet lamp in it's general direction and decide to beeline straight for the safehouse. Several horrible grows tearing the silence behind me and action music fills my veins with adrenaline as I sprint for my life. From the growls I gather that several volatiles have joined in the hunt. Jumping down into a shallow wide crevice with a cracked concret pipe running in the middle I quickly slip into the pipe and crouch down in the corner hoping no one saw me go in. The monsters are shambling around on the outside with the distinct sound of them breathing. Sounds like air being sucked through shredded meat. But I think they don't know where I am.

I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW ONCE I GET INTO THE FOLLOWING. ALSO, I HAVE YET TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN WITHIN DYING LIGHT. Ok now onto the review for what I think so far :)\n\n\"Oh man this is just another shit zombie game.\" WRONG. It sure is a zombie game, but the added features of parkour and freerunning, combined with the large open world, and a fresh feel the often over-saturated zombie genre.\n\nPROS:\n- Gameplay is amazing. Parkour and freerunning are both very smooth, and there are very few issues with the movement. The one only area that doesn't do great in this regard is getting up cliffs or rocky areas, but considering that Dying Light takes place in an urban environment, you aren't gonna be climbing up that many cliffs tbh.\n- Weapon Upgrading feels really rewarding, where you find what you need to upgrade a weapon in the world, and then can add a variety of upgrades to (melee) weapons such as fire, electricity, bleeding, and toxicity. It feels pretty damn cool to get a high end weapon and add flame to it, so when you hit a zombie it will burst into flames. Guns in this game are relatively easy to come across once you get to a high enough survivor level, however it's rare enough that it's still special.\n- The upgrade trees give really awesome upgrades to your character and general survivability without feeling too overpowered for a good amount of the game. Obviously when you max out all your levels, then you are kind of an unstoppable beast, but at least it's not a situation where you get a level and go from really weak to tremendously overpowered. For Agility, you gain points by (as you may have guessed) running around the map, jumping and leaping from rooftop to rooftop. For Power, you can gain these points from killing zombies and generally doing damage. The best part is that you can get points towards this through molotovs, or other zombie-killing devices other than your own weapons. This is a plus because sometimes you are focusing so much on quests and running around to the point that your agility level is off the charts, while your power level is like, level 5. The Survival level is upgraded by completing quests, capturing airdrops, and saving survivors. One thing to keep in mind, is if you plan to play with friends, I would HIGHLY reccomend having one save file for yourself and another for you to play ewith your friends. I ran into a situation where I was playing by myself and then bringing my friend into that game when he was available. This meant that he only got survivor rank credit from the quests that we did together, and so I was a way higher rank than him. Then there's the legendary rank, which is unlocked after unlocking all the upgrades in every other skill tree. It turns you into a zombie killing tank, by increasing max health, stamina, as well as specific weapon damage. Overall, the upgrades are challenging enough and also provide you with enough reason to try to level up a certain skill.\n- The world of Dying Light is really damn cool. It seems authentic and realistic, and does not seem forced at all. It makes it really interesting for parkour, as well as when you are running away from a viral or a volatile.\n- The Volatiles in this game are actually terrifying, and also new and original which is great to see in the zombie genre. They are super-human zombies (rather ironic choice of words but you ge the idea) and they only come out at night. This makes any situation where you are stuck outside after the sun's gone down really damn intense. Dying Light does a great job making you goddamn terrified of the dark. The other zombies and special infected are pretty generic, but still, what those are lacking for, I feel like the volatiles make up for that one hundred percent. There are new infected added into Dying Light The Following from what I have seen, but in the base game, the infected that you encounter in the daytime are pretty damn generic.\n- The Hud is really clean and easy to understand, no problems whatsoever.\n- The graphics in this game are beautiful, with lens flare and all other sorts of cinematic effects, you feel like you are playing a movie sometimes. Absolutely gorgeous game!\n\nCONS:\n- As mentioned before, the average infected you will meet will be more of the same. The volatiles I personally believe help change the entirety of the game, but still overall the zombies are pretty underwhelming and quickly become an inconvienence rather than something scary within the game.\n- The story leaves lots to be desired. There is a lot of stereotypes and a shit ton of cliches, and is very predictable. \n- The characters are pretty bland. Many you meet you will frankly not care about. The game lacks in character backstory, which makes you quite apathetic towards a lot of people. That being said, there is one guy (whos name escapes me) that just hangs out beside the elevator in the tower when you ride it up and is like, the nicest dude from the get go. I love that man. \n\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a beautiful game with great mechanics player upgrades that you can sink hours into without realizing, Dying Light is the game for you. However, if you are looking for a very story-rich game, then this will fall short. I personally have had a blast with this game, and playing with friends makes the game just that much better. I would highly reccomend. \n\nThanks for reading my review! It is the first review I have done, but who knows, I may do more.

This is not really a first person shooter. What this game can be described as is a one-man-army simulator where you play as a highly mobile superhuman who spends his free time drop kicking zombies inbetween using a homemade machete/fire sword/electric rod to become a hero of the city of the undead - with friends or solo!\n\nFull Review:\n\nMany people say that this game is like Far Cry with zombies. I disagree. Far Cry as a series doesn't really have the same dynamic of enemies being obstacles. Far Cry's enemies are more of a goal to be overcome (think Far Cry 2's respawning enemy outposts vs. Far Cry 3's enemy outposts that stay cleared). Zombies never stop coming, but the majority of them are the slow braindead type, only attracted to noise - the kind that can be easily avoided by just simply running a couple feet outside their immediate reach. In general, avoiding zombies is the best way to progress, quite different from how Far Cry plays, where it's more of a \"taking back the island\" sort of experience rather than \"working around\" the city, which is what Dying Light excels at.\n\nThe objective is not to mindlessly kill zombies like a lot of other zombie games. In this one, your main methods of dealing with zombies are all finite resources, whether it be your melee weapons, your guns (ammo is limited), or your special crafted items, such as grenades or explosive ninja stars (yes how edgy). So the game essentially works off of the risk/reward mechanism of using your small pool of finite resources to loot materials and new weapons from a city that is under siege from undead. The way you be successful is by picking the correct application of your killing tools to loot these items most effectively so that you use less resources than what you loot.\n\nThis game really excels at just being a freeform open sandbox zombie environment that you have complete ownership of in terms of mechanical domination. Your character, Kyle Crane, definitely ate his greens growing up, as the guy throughout his journey will come to be an expert of parkour, soon enough learning how to freerun effectively and fluently around in the city in a way that is supremely satisfying. Know all those cliche \"People Are Awesome\" videos from 2010 where it's just a guy doing super cool jumps across the tops of buildings? Yeah, that's you in this game.\n\nEach and every melee weapon in the game has a unique feel and flow of combat to them. A baseball bat is a blunt tool used to smash open bones (and skulls), while something like a combat knife is good at quick slashes and wearing down zombies with multiple incisions. All of these weapons are animated realistically (I mean I think - hell if I know how to fight with a baseball bat or a knife, but it looks realistic enough!) and they all feel extremely satisfying to swing around and score some kills with. And if using a baseball bat to score a homerun on a zombies temporal lobe isn't enough for you, there's a pretty basic but very user friendly crafting system in the game that lets you add a variety of fun (and sometimes pretty nasty) effects onto your looted weapons. A baseball bat that also electrifies zombies? Sure, why not?\n\nAbove all else - this game is just the pure embodiment of fun and freedom. You don't even have to do the main quest if you don't want to. You can just run around and have equally as much fun - it's a fun environment to just exist in. Not a lot of games really offer that kind of experience. Did I mention this game is co-op? \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1588660774, "timestamp_updated": 1588660877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 178, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.923606216907501221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14267297": {"recommendationid": "14267297", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994503721", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 768, "last_played": 1588573866}, "language": "english", "review": "\"The Walking Dead\" by day, \"I Am Legend\" by night;\n\nI can't tell you how beautiful this game looks without you just seeing it for yourself,  but I will say this.\n\nThis is the first game, in a very long time, which has legitamately inspired a sense of fear in me.\n\nAt night time, this game becomes a heart pounding nightmare.\n\nLike horror?

I can just run around for hours without it being boring. It gets intense during the nights and you feel like it is worth going out of the safe zones at those times, because the reward is extra XP that you can use in the skill tree to unlock new and fun skills. The zombies are well done and even though some can get annoying, I feel like those are important to make the game more challenging. A tip is to play on the hardest difficulty to get the best experience. Also the co-op is fun and if you have people that you can play with, the experience gets even better. Me and my brother has played this game for so long and we are still stuck with it, even though the second one is coming soon this one will always have a place in my heart. The story is intriguing and the side quests are fun, even though some are a bit silly. The voice-acting is for me not a problem, but some NPC:s could have been \"voiced\" a bit better. Also, another well made part of the game is the weapons and crafting. You can make so many different cool things with the weapons and it never gets boring.

Also notable is the parkour system in place in the game; It is extremely well executed, and gives an incredible sense of freedom to go where you want, and do what you want.

Techland created a zombie game in the vein of Dead Island, with huge improvements, but without the companies. The zombie world of Dying Light revolves around a great premise. The side quests range from somewhat fun to damn cool. There are many different scenarios, and they are events and occurrences that would more than likely occur in a post-apocalyptic world. There are 44 side quests. While they may not be all worth doing, the player may be surprised by some of the adventures they bring.\n\nThe parkour is fluid and connected while building off on climbing and jumping mechanics that makes free-running exhilarating. It starts off slow, but once you get going on the agility skill tree, free-running is really fun. I highly recommend putting points in the fall damage mitigation and forward roll. For instance, parkour/free-running has three stages of upgrades. You start off as a novice free runner, and as you progress through the skill tree, you become more athletic, therefore, traversing the world faster with fewer stumbles. These all make for smooth controls that are very responsive, and it does not miss a beat. Fun times.\n\nYou can also combine abilities from different skill trees to perform combos. For example, you can use \"vault\" on a zombie, followed by a \"drop attack\" for a satisfying combo finisher.\n\nIf you are trying to connect Dead Island and DI: Riptide to this game, it probably shares in common some visual art design, melee combat, without the companies. But the melee combat has been greatly improved. The melee combat is extremely satisfying. The gameplay is where Dying Light shines. Gunplay is so much better too. Throw in free-running abilities, the three skill trees, and gameplay is a blast. Dying Light sports the best melee/parkour combat to date.\n\nAnd while I feel the gameplay is the best part of the game, Dying Light does many other things right too. In another light, the ending was predictable, although it could have been handled differently. I would have liked to see a twist in the story. I feel like the premise of Dying Light could have served a multitude of story branches. A missed opportunity, indeed.\n\nIt is one of those games that takes bits of concepts from other games like Mirror's Edge, Dead Island, Far Cry 3+4, and executes it well. It does not feel like you're playing those games properly, but it does remind you of them. If that makes any sense. It feels different and more than enough to stand on its own.\n\nIf you guys have a chance, give it a try. But if you choose to focus too much on its flaws, you will probably end up not liking it, and you will probably dislike it for the wrong reasons. I felt this way in the beginning, but this is one of those games that really grows on you. It is not amazing, but it has some spectacular moments.\n\nThe visuals are up to par with modern games, atmospheric and immersive, slick, and smooth controls--button mapping is great to accommodate for melee combat and free-running, extremely detailed game world, combined with satisfying melee combat complemented by three skill trees that enhance gameplay incredibly.\n\nThe sound design is excellent, from the cries of a zombie from several yards away, to a great soundtrack (some 80s/90s music),\n\nThere are many different zombie types--common, stronger, special, and nighttime zombies all make for interesting enemy and A.I. During the nighttime, some common zombies behave more aggressively, and the nighttime zombies like the Volatiles come out on patrol. Volatiles, like the more alert and aggressive common zombies, have a cone of vision that appears on the mini-map to show the player if they have been alerted. An eye icon appears over the actual zombie on the screen if they have spotted you, and the icon fills up with a red color indicator to show if you are being pursued. The zombie A.I. is smart.\n\nDay-zombies may not be much of a threat as night-zombies, but day-zombies can be a threat in numbers. \"Free-runner\" zombies are former runners that turned into the infected. They move and run faster, and they can climb objects and structures, unlike their common zombie cousins. They are more aggressive and they relentlessly pursue you until you put them out of their misery.\n\nThe physics is good, and it makes for some unintentional, hilarious moments.\n\nI highly recommend crafting and experimenting with every weapon, even if you feel like you will not like \"throwing weapons\" or \"trap bombs.\" In this game, you're going to want to try everything. They're all fun to use, and they provide for cool gameplay scenarios you can come up with.\n\nAchievements in Dying Light are worth hunting, especially in co-op mode. Take a little time to read through them because they encourage you to experiment and try different things. I am glad I looked through them. The point being is, get creative. Use your imagination and try to do everything. Experiment.\n\nNighttime is really intense because that's when the more hellish zombies come out and stalk you. You have probably read that other players have reported that the game does not feature real-time day and night cycles, and that is untrue. Early on in the game, there are a few story missions that introduce you to nighttime. I think this confused players. After you have completed those, day and nighttime cycle kick in. Day lasts several hours, and nighttime only lasts for a very short time. And this occurs without story mission/side quests. You can fast-forward time by clicking on a bed (wait until night or morning), and go off on your adventure.\n\nHowever, I do take issue with the timer for nighttime. There could have been a setting to change how long nighttime lasted. Seven minutes isn't all that much, even though it can sometimes feel like \"forever\" with Volatiles chasing you across the city.\n\nThere are mini-games spread throughout the world of Dying Light. These include \"challenges\" that you can participate in, like a free-running challenge, killing a specific amount of the infected in the quarantine zone, or a challenging scenario where you need to kill 40 zombies within a limited amount of time. It sounds simple on paper, but these challenges can be pretty entertaining in spurts and especially with a co-op partner.\n\nDying Light is one of those rare videogames that was designed thoughtfully. Single-player and co-op intertwine in harmony, and one mode does not hamper the other. After having played over 50 hours of Dying Light, I can genuinely say that this is one of the best single-player/co-op campaign games out there. With Invasion mode and nighttime adding a whole new dynamic to zombie-killing madness, gameplay is intensified and it brings fresh new gameplay that would have been missed had it not been included. It is one of the better games that have been released in recent years, and it definitely stands out from the crowd of new-gen games.\n\nAnyway, the story it's pretty cool in my opinion (it's a zombie game what you expect!).After playing through the story I asked myself how much these developers must love Far Cry 3.\n\n- Highly recommended.\n- Huge improvement over Dead Island\n- Excellent and thoughtful single-player/co-op design\n- The extremely satisfying melee combat system\n- Great parkour that is fluid and highly responsive\n- Deep skill trees, and game mechanics like crafting and upgrades\n- Great visuals for an open-world game\n- Immersive and atmospheric\n- Cool characters\n- Solid writing for the most part, and good dialogue\n- Great premise\n- Many zombie types provide for dynamic gameplay\n- Excellent zombie A.I.\n- Innovative nighttime zombie gameplay\n- Excellent and responsive controls\n- Missed opportunities in plot twist\n- Ending was anti-climatic\n- Missed opportunities in potentially good scares\n- The main protagonist feels hollow\n- Most characters are unforgettable\n\nPersonal Rating - 9.0 out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1593238172, "timestamp_updated": 1593243485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 182, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912294566631317139", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48803358": {"recommendationid": "48803358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212505048", "num_games_owned": 1739, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 14628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8853, "last_played": 1706363337}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] A Welcome change in the Zombie Genre:\t[/h1]\nDying Light is an open world first person survival horror action-adventure video game. Its different from its contemporary games by featuring fluid parkour system ie,.there is no restriction on what to climb and run. \n\n[h1] Gamplay:\t[/h1]\nThe game is in first person with heavy emphasis on parkour mechanics. The combat is mostly melee based with occasional gun use which makes fighting zombies tactical (whether to fight or flee). The game has dynamic day and night cycle which is well designed, at morning zombies are slow and easily killed but at night there are particular zombies that are vicious,fast and strong which makes you to run and hide instead of fighting. The game has a character progression system which lets you to upgrade your character skills which makes killing zombies extra fun due to the concept of levelling up. The optimisation for this game is good with the enhanced edition. Didn't encounter any bugs and it ran at 30 FPS in my old laptop at medium settings.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GrnT_UQFUw\n\n[h1] Atmosphere and Story:\t[/h1]\nThe story is about an undercover agent known as Kyle crane who is dropped in a quarantine city of Harran to get data about the virus from a person called Rais. But when he is air dropped into the city he meets with some survivors and whether he helps them or go after the file is what happens in the rest of the story. The story is above average and fun to play. The atmosphere of the city filled with zombies are really well made. The background music also echoes the mediterranean vibe. The city has byzantine architecture which looks good.\n\n[h1] Multiplayer:\t[/h1]\nThe game's multiplayer is of two types:\n1. Co-op mode\n2. NIght hunter mode\n\nCo op mode as the name says you can play upto 4 players in the single player campaign. The night hunter mode is about a human player who can invade other players game as a night hunter, a powerful zombie. This mode is really great with night hunter having some cool moves and the player has to fight it by killing and destroying the hives to prevent its respawn. The mode is fun to play when you have co-op partners but frustrated to play alone as the night hunter is really powerful and will lead to defeat of the player.\n\n[h1] Downloadable content:\t[/h1]\nThe game has several DLCs that are cosmetic in nature and some free DLCs were given which were good like challenges, special weapons etc.,. The game has one paid DLC known as the \"Following\". This dlc continues the story from the main game and takes place in the outskirts of harran. This gives the opportunity to include vehicles which are used to traverse the map and fun to use especially mowing zombies. The vehicles are upgradable through parts as well as through skills and the upgrades are found to have profound impact on driving. Some weapons such as smg,crossbows are introduced with this dlc.\n\n\n\nThe game was supported by Developers for atleast 3 years with regular updates and free dlcs, community events etc., so kudos to them as this type of support these days are quite rare. The game introduction of parkour is really great and it distinguishes from other zombie games. The story could have been better but its ok. Due to the introduction of new mechanics and the support of Devs, this game has the seal of approval from me.\nI recommend it if you like open world and bashing zombies. See you in Harran.\nUpdate: still good", "timestamp_created": 1549471923, "timestamp_updated": 1637810685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 149, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.908657252788543701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14478017": {"recommendationid": "14478017", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964140971", "num_games_owned": 652, "num_reviews": 163, "playtime_forever": 3242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2361, "last_played": 1468647338}, "language": "english", "review": "Dying Light is a zombie game that focuses on atmosphere and player movement. If you have played Dead Island you already know the basic mechanics; craft melee weapons and bash zombies while collecting supplies. But Dying Light employs numerous changes that improve on this.\n\nAtmosphere is perhaps its best asset. The day-night cycle is a crucial component, as there are major changes to mood and gameplay as the sun sets behind the horizon. At night, the tension elevates as you experience reduced visibility and face zombies that are nimble, fast and deadly. You will be tempted to venture out at night for extra rewards. During the day, you battle hordes of shambling zombies that are fun to eviscerate with a broad selection of weaponry. The difference between night and day provides a genuine rollercoaster ride.\n\nParkour movement makes navigating the world immensely enjoyable. You are able to run, jump and climb over buildings with ease. You just look at a ledge and hold the jump button to climb. As you come upon zombie hordes you analyse the area quickly. Do you attack or use the environment to avoid danger? Various slides and kicks make dealing with zombies, and human foes, quite interesting. Traps placed around the world can be triggered to slow pursuers or distract zombies, giving you an edge as you learn the world around you.\n\nThe single player is surprisingly entertaining and lengthy, with side quests that are often better than those in the story. Characters are well-defined and memorable, with more effort given to justify the game world. You run between areas, clear safe zones, rescue people and collect items. Story missions might even feature shootouts in indoor levels. Progression comes via a skill tree that unlocks significant character upgrades. You will also learn to craft items like Molotovs and flares to make you more formidable against the various zombie types.\n\nDying Light is also a cooperative game and playing with others is easy. The basic cooperative action works well, aside from rigid animations, and you can undertake just about every quest from the campaign. You can even open your game to a 'zombie invasion' where another player joins and takes the role of a dangerous night-hunter zombie that can instantly kill survivors with a pounce. Your goal is to destroy zombie nests before you lose a certain number of lives. Whether playing alone, or with a group of four, this versus mode is actually good despite its relative simplicity. It gets hectic when four players are battling tougher zombies and running all over the open map while being pursued by a night-hunter that can summon exploding zombies. \n\nDying Light is a terrific zombie game that greatly improves the core mechanics from Dead Island. It emphasizes the world and how you move around in it. The changes between day and night are refreshing and memorable. There is a healthy amount of content that will provide dozens of hours of entertainment in solo or cooperative play. Dying Light mixes intriguing elements to craft a zombie experience that is entertaining, atmospheric, visceral, and frenzied.", "timestamp_created": 1423989559, "timestamp_updated": 1423989559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 234, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.907869577407836914", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51143000": {"recommendationid": "51143000", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990383892", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 4999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4999, "last_played": 1553974876}, "language": "english", "review": "Dying light is the video game equivalent of a bowl of pretty good chili. There's a lot of ingredients, you could probably take out at least one or two and have a good time still. It's never an earth-shaking, transformative experience, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nIt's a solid open world game that's pretty fun solo and pretty fun in co-op. It's sort of half-way between a borderlands style looty-shooty thing and a horde game, with some fun twists like a parkour based movement system that is mostly functional and quick to pick up and understand (though you're still likely to bounce off a wall you assumed you'd grab every now and then) though it all goes slightly out the window after grappling hook becomes a thing. The melee focused combat is pretty solid. The guns are.... there, and they're not terribly offensive to use, even if the human-heavy segments where you're likely to lean on guns tend to be tedious.\n\nIt's a perfectly serviceable game and it'll last you about thirty hours if you grind out sidequests. There's nothing really overtly awful. It's not a contender for \"best game of the last ten years\" or anything. But it doesn't have to be.

I can say though the time spent was worthy of getting my personal review. My wife and I loved playing this together, and although it's not finished, we will come by and get to it once we can. I may just generalise the story a bit by then, but not spoil anything not to ruin the fun.\n\n[h3] \u2694 Gameplay: [/h3]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 It's a one-time experience\n\u2611\ufe0f Only for achievements\n\ud83d\udd32 If you wait a few months/years (try playing with mods)\n\ud83d\udd32 Definitely\n\ud83d\udd32 Infinitely replayable\n\nIf you're looking for a co-op/multiplayer type of fun or just simply slaying zombies, this game may be the right pick for you. Although it starts quite simple at first, it gets a lot better as you progress and what is most fascinating about this game is that the developers put care and love into it even after years since its release.\n\nThat says a lot about what type of game you'll be playing.\n\n[h3] \ud83d\ude04 Fun: [/h3]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 I'd rather watch paint dry\n\ud83d\udd32 Hard to enjoy\n\ud83d\udd32 Repetitive\n\ud83d\udd32 Actually pretty amusing\n\u2611\ufe0f The kind of fun you'll remember\n\ud83d\udd32 Ride of your life\n\nMy wife and I had a blast playing this game, and I strongly recommend playing this with friends. It can get pretty scary at night when alone, and this game knows how to put the thrill in it. The parkour and combat is nicely made and deserves a lot of praise.\n\n[h3] \ud83c\udfde Graphics: [/h3]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 MS Paint\n\ud83d\udd32 Bad\n\ud83d\udd32 Meh\n\ud83d\udd32 Graphics don't matter in this game\n\u2611\ufe0f Good (nothing special)\n\u2611\ufe0f Beautiful\n\ud83d\udd32 Masterpiece\n\nFor its time, the graphics still hold up, and I can say they are rather beautiful in some parts, even though you'll be seeing disfigured zombies and stuff. I am in between the Good and Beautiful at this time.\n\n[h3] \ud83d\udd0a Sound: [/h3]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Makes your ears bleed\n\ud83d\udd32 Bad\n\ud83d\udd32 Not special\n\ud83d\udd32 Good\n\u2611\ufe0f Beautiful\n\ud83d\udd32 Masterpiece\n\nThis game knows how to scare you at times, and the sounds are excellent for giving you the creeps. You'll be sh*thing your pants at times because the music accents the trill. Definitely a good place out there.\n\n[h3] \ud83d\udcd6 Story: [/h3]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 This game has no story\n\ud83d\udd32 Like playing Temple Runners for the story\n\ud83d\udd32 It's there for the people who want it\n\u2611\ufe0f Well written\n\ud83d\udd32 Epic story\n\ud83d\udd32 Masterpiece\n\nAlthough, as I mentioned, I didn't complete the story, it has its interesting parts and worthy of following it through to the end. I believe all are getting a lot better as you progress. Didn't get to be there, sadly. This part may change as I finish it.\n\n[h3] \ud83e\uddf5 Length: [/h3]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\ud83d\udd32 Short\n\ud83d\udd32 Average\n\u2611\ufe0f Long (if u can even finish it)\n\ud83d\udd32 To infinity and beyond\n\nAlthough at the time of this review, I was at 57 hours, the game feels pretty long as I've not even got to play the DLC maps. Or at least I think. You'll be having a lot of hours if you grind like my wife and I did.\n\n[h3] \ud83d\udcb7 Price: [/h3]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Free\n\ud83d\udd32 Underpriced\n\u2611\ufe0f Perfect Price\n\ud83d\udd32 Could be cheaper\n\ud83d\udd32 Overpriced\n\ud83d\udd32 Complete waste of money\n\nIt deserves a lot of praise, and the price for this game is worth your time and money.

If you're like me, you'll probably run for your life in the early stages of the game during the night because it's way too dangerous and scary.\n\n[h3] \u2696 Pros & Cons: [/h3]\n\n[h3] \u2795 Pros: [/h3]\n+ Parkour in the first person feels great.\n+ Combat and gameplay is fun, and so is the story.\n+ This game knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat and still make you feel overpowered later on, which is great because you can feel progression.\n+ Leveling is fun, and the tools you get are really useful.\n+ This game is a lot better with friends, but you can surely play it solo and still have a lot of fun.\n\n[h3] \u2796 Cons: [/h3]\n- Don't be surprised if I say that there are not many issues with this game, really.\n\n[h3] \u2699 Bugs: [/h3]\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Never heard of\n\u2611\ufe0f Minor bugs\n\ud83d\udd32 Can get annoying\n\ud83d\udd32 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\ud83d\udd32 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\nI've barely encountered bugs and seen any, so I can't call them out. The game is well optimised for a Mid-tier PC, and it will run just fine.\n\n[h3] \u2b55Conclusion: [/h3]\nDying Light is a totally exciting game, and if you're like me and enjoyed Dead Island's gameplay, you'll enjoy this game a lot more. It has a lot of action, and it's worth trying it out. I can't wait for Dying Light 2 to launch; I am sure it's going to be awesome.\n\nGet the game; you'll not regret it!\n\n[quote=TalePlay][i] If you've read this far, I want to say thank you and do check more of our stuff on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/taleplay]TalePlay[/url].

There are occasionals safe houses but beyond their borders its fair game for everyone to make it alive to the next morning. \nParkour run, kick, stab, shoot, evade at its finest.

There is super fluidable crafting systeme that let you make some crazy stuff of weapons, from electric bats to some axes fixed with nails that finish the job more easily. Weapons have degraying system so it wont be easy. Gotta be careful for what to use where cause the zombie population not sleep day or night. There are tons of different species. They don\u2019t make you bored. You will dance on your tip toes to reach your goal. \nSome of the most amazing zombie desings. From brute forced giants to and exploding bastards that can kill you in one explosion. Going trough the night streets not always the smartest idea cause the night will raise the bard of survivability. The night is where crazy horros happens.

There are some FPS drops here and there, but overall the game performs well with some graphics tweaks in the settings menu.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThis game is packed with content and game mechanics. Parkour, skill leveling, weapon upgrading, looting, crafting or just exploring the world and finding easter eggs. There is so much stuff to do, its unbelievable. Just the base game is easily 50-100hrs of gameplay. Most importantly, its fun as hell and playable in co-op mode.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story starts with you infiltrating the fictional city Harran that is quarantined because of the zombie virus spread. It is filled with interesting characters, plot twists, drama and humor. All in all a very satisfying story with crazy ending (if you decide to buy The Following DLC as well).\n\n[h1]Co-op[/h1]\nI can't express this enough, [b]this game is 10x more fun in co-op[/b].

It has been a very long time since I dropped $60 on a game and felt this good about it. I am a zombie game junkie, I play as many as I can. This one is hands down the most satisfying experience I've ever had. These are a few of the ways this game stands out to me as head and shoulders above the rest: \n\nCombat- The combat feels amazing in this game. From jabbing at things with pipes and wooden boards in the early game, to a slow motion decap later on, it just feels amazing to kill the zombies. They're an actual threat to you, and you can quickly find yourself overwhelmed if you linger in the streets. There are so many ways to dispose of them. About 23 hours into the game, I have several different guns, swords, axes, throwing weapons, molotovs, and a variety of combat moves that let me stomp on their heads when I knock them down. That's another thing I love so much. This game isn't just another start game, grab a gun, shoot everything game. You don't even SEE a gun till you've done quite a bit of getting your hands dirty. Guns also present their own danger. If you shoot a gun, or set off an alarm, you bring the attention of the masses of zombies in the streets. Not just one or two, they swarm you and it happens fast. The decision to pick off an enemy with a firearm is one you make very very carefully. There are genuine consequences to how you choose to confront your enemies. \n\nProgression - I can't say enough good about it. They have done an absolutely brilliant job with the balance and overall gameplay in Dying Light. In the beginning, the first time you poke your head out of the building you start in, you are terrified by the strength of the zombies, and they are everywhere. The entire game grows with your character. Searching boxes early on you get low end gear, but the stronger you get, the stronger the enemies get across the entire city. New zombie types start to appear, even in the daytime. Night time is just a NOPE! Unless of course you rock the stealth thing. I myself am too prone to running in wth my machete swinging. Eventually you are driven by the story and quests to HAVE to complete missions at night, and it's a rush from beginning to end. Loot gets progressively better based on your own progress, there are no \"junk\" areas of the game where the mobs become laughable and the loot even worse. \n\nThe overall experience- If you're an adrenaline junkie, you WANT this game. You learn very quickly that your life depends on mastering not only the weapons and combat, but also the parkour. You don't ever stop running and jumping, leaping to and from rooftops, over fences, cars and other obstacles. If you miss a jump, the horde will be right on you, grabbing and clawing and biting, and bringing plenty of their friends along for the snack. I would highly recommend this game to people looking for a truly action packed experience, this one is not for the faint of heart!! \n", "timestamp_created": 1425165155, "timestamp_updated": 1425165155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 219, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.89483720064163208", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91639706": {"recommendationid": "91639706", "author": {"steamid": "76561199024083299", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 936, "last_played": 1623937050}, "language": "english", "review": "zombi parkor", "timestamp_created": 1620472440, "timestamp_updated": 1620472440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 270, "votes_funny": 102, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894567906856536865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135763244": {"recommendationid": "135763244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137930870", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1320, "last_played": 1650672084}, "language": "english", "review": "Had a friend who used to play this back in the damn day whilst I was addicted to League, used to think he was a dumbass for not playing League instead. \n\nGuess who was the dumbass in the end.\n\nBuy this game and play with no lights in your room.

That commitment is rare, and especially for a game of this caliber. It's a blueprint more games ought to follow in that respect.\n\nYes, the premise is not entirely new, but the traversal freedom, landscape, and combat are all highly original, even if you've played a billion other zombie games in your lifetime there's very few that try as much as Dying Light does and gets them all right.\n\nIt's approaching the final free DLC for the game, but you'll still find an active playerbase and if you're really into co-op this game plays wonderful with others.  As a solo romp I found it to be a bit more bite-size as you go through the campaign, you may find yourself wandering around and doing side missions and whatnot but the session lengths usually top out at about 2 hours for me solo, and about 7 co-op lol.  The gear hunt can take a huge amount of time, as can nights where you can get much larger rewards for surviving, not being seen, or other specific rules that you may have to just try out yourself.\n\nWhat could be improved? well, there aren't all that many alternative endings tmk, in fact there may only be one outcome to the campaign, but this will be addressed in the next game and it is hardly a deep fault in this game, given that there is still a good sense of progression and very much reasons to continue even if you complete the campaign.  I also found that some of the characters are more convincing than others, but none truly fit badly or flubbed their characters to the point where i had to stop playing or anything.  \n\nAt night the world changes, and things get sufficiently creepy. Hunter zombies with glowing eyes and a much higher rate of traversal than you that require a complete change in tactics roam around, and the daytime relative safety (outside of areas with elites, which can become a huge pain without the right tools) disappears and things get tense.  You can find safety zones before twilight hits and sleep through the night, but surviving it and taking no damage, along with a few other exclusive bonuses and gear unlocks afaik, can make surviving the nights very enticing.\n\nThis really is one of the best zombie, open world, parkour games out there and whether you play alone or with others this one deserves to be in your library.  Thanks to Techland for really broadening the scope of what a zombie survival game could be, bring some production values and novel perspectives in the process.\n\nBuy this game!

Although imperfect, it was easily one of the more interesting games that I've played in the last decade and here's why...\n\n\nTL;DR \n\nPros: [list] \n[*] Adrenaline-pumping, fast-paced, high-risk/reward SP/Co-Op/MP hybrid gameplay\n[*] The entire game is playable in up to 4-player co-op\n[*] Satisfying and freeform movement unlike in any other game\n[*] Fantastic, almost photo-realistic visuals even more than half a decade after its release\n[*] From banger beats to atmospheric background tunes \u2013 the OST is spot-on!\n[*] Satisfyingly violent but never disgusting or in poor taste\n[*] Tons of content to keep you occupied quite literally for hundreds of hours after the credits have rolled\n[*] Unyielding support and frequent addition of new content and events from the development team [/list]\n\n\nCons: [list] \n[*] Although not bad, the story is definitely the weakest link\n[*] Parts of, especially the post-game, can be quite grindy\n[*] Control mapping, UI and Inventory system, game-balancing... These could all use some love\n[*] Although regularly maintained and, as far as I can tell, a bug-free experience, mechanically, DL can be a rough diamond [/list]\n\n\nEven though I\u2019ve completely disliked everything about the boring and repetitive experience that was Dead Island, which was Techland's previous title and, in many ways a predecessor game to this one, something about DL caught my eye and I knew that I wanted to take it for a ride, or should I say run?\n\nBefore moving on, I would like to mention that, in my honest opinion, this game is best experienced on Nightmare difficutlty. It will make bruteforcing throgh the undead impossible and instead makes you think about outrunning or completely evading them, bringing out the best that the game has to offer. It will also disable instant heal, thus preventing the \"heal cheesing\" abuse and in turn do that much better job to communicate the feeling of being severly overwhlmed to the player.\n\n\n[h1]Parkour, Exploration and the World of Dying Light[/h1] \nPerhaps more than the game\u2019s protagonist [i]Kyle Crane[/i], the fictional [i]City of Harran[/i] in which the game takes place, albeit devoid of life, somehow manages to be full of character.\n\nIts many districts, both visually and structurally different from one another, will quickly become familiar to you. You\u2019ll learn that while some of them offer much needed sanctuary, others will make it harder to survive and force you to run. If you are to have a chance to run again, don't hold back and utilize everything you\u2019ve learned and gathered up to that point.\n\nThis urban-jungle death-trap is one of the best virtual playgrounds that you can find yourself in. Built in detail both horizontally and vertically, in a way that nothing is unreachable for the daring and skilled runners. You'll want to get familiar with it as the city\u2019s skyline provides relative safety and absolute joy to traverse. \n\nDuring your stay in Harran, you\u2019ll get to know all of its zones and compounds, streets, roads and back-alleys, building exteriors and interiors as many of the constructions can be entered to search for valuables, but most of all, you will get to know its rooftops.\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay and Character Progression[/h1]\nPlaying as a [i]Runner[/i], which is a fairly common nickname for a Parkour practitioner, you're expected (even though you'll rarely be forced) to stay on the move and keep running. Thanks to Kyle\u2019s excellent physical condition, you\u2019ll have no problem evading hordes of not so docile undead that roam the streets below but don\u2019t shy away at the thought of coming up to a rooftop to take a bite at you either. This is especially true for human enemies which you'll also have to keep an eye out for.\n\nSimply by running, fighting, crafting and using weapons, tools and gadgets, you\u2019ll earn experience which will make you better at one of the three skill trees. [i]Survival, Combat[/i] and [i]Agility[/i] all have a decent amount of progression milestones for you to grind out and strive for. Naturally, simply by playing the game for a while, you will basically be given enough points to upgrade some of them, but if you want them all and if you want them now, the city provides numerous events, side stories, bounties, free-form arcade challenges and much more to keep you busy. Make sure to stay alive as death permanently voids any level progression that you might\u2019ve had prior to dying.\n\nPossibly the best thing about all of this is that [b]everything[/b] can be done with friends or other random players thanks to the drop-in/out co-op, which, at least for me, makes things incomparably more enjoyable. Furthermore, co-op is not just an afterthought feature as many missions and activities will allow you to play and compete with your teammates for higher scores, shorter times and additional XP. Even though you might be a lone wolf, teaming up with other players might be a good idea because...\n\n \n[h2]Night is when the real fun starts[/h2]\nI might\u2019ve said that Kyle can easily outrun zombies, and that\u2019s mostly true - \"mostly\" being the keyword here. At night, the [i]Volatiles[/i] will come out to play, and they\u2019re the kind of crowds you\u2019re better off without.\n\nThese brutish, agile monstrosities will patrol the streets and rooftops at night, traversing any obstacles with ease while looking for you. Once they spot you, they will alert nearby [i]Virals[/i] and allow them to spawn until you manage to break the line of sight and hide away in the night once again. The more they chase you, the more aggressive they become, and the harder it will be for you to evade the pursuit.\n\nDefinitely not something that I would recommend doing, at least not until you\u2019re experienced enough and confident to undertake such a task. But why would you even want to?\n\nThe thing is, when the night falls everything that you do will net you twice as much experience as it normally would! Even \"simply\" surviving the night comes with a hefty XP boost of its own, so play it safe or raise the stakes - it's up to you.\n\n\n[h2]You\u2019re not the only one looking to level up during the night[/h2] \nDuring night time, the game will allow invasions by a player-controlled zombie called [i]The Hunter[/i]. This almost Spider-Man-like creature can pretty much fly across the entire city in a manner of seconds, and all it needs is a single moment of you not paying attention to instantly kill you. In turn this will bring them a step closer to victory, netting them some XP and allow them to eventually level up and evolve themselves and gain new abilities.\n\nWithout going into too much details, I\u2019ll just state that the MP was fun, rather unique and very easy to get into. If PvP happens to be your thing, give it a try as a survivor or as the Hunter.\n\n\n[h1]What about the bad stuff?[/h1]\nAlthough enjoyable, DL is not without its flaws. The biggest ones are definitely the balancing-related issues and some item diversity ones.\n\nSome weapons are clearly better than others, and usually it doesn\u2019t really make sense. This will probably make you stick with one that works while ignoring the new, potentially better ones as they\u2019ve been proven inferior over and over again.\n\nDuring the late game, the enemies become extra spongy, and you need to grind absurd amounts of XP to be as effective with weapons as you were up to that point. Of course, there are clever ways to deal with them, but mindless grind is always a bad thing in my book.\n\nIn multiplayer, you will often meet cheaters who won\u2019t even try to hide the fact and will outright ruin your experience, and often times you with it as well.\n\n\n[h1]The Verdict[/h1]\nDespite all of its shortcomings, Dying Light is an extremely fun game, and if you\u2019re a fan of freeform movement and combat like I am, it is guaranteed to entertain you.", "timestamp_created": 1617116175, "timestamp_updated": 1619632646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 130, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.888159871101379395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114589592": {"recommendationid": "114589592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198850118681", "num_games_owned": 1361, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 2870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2868, "last_played": 1675687813}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Admirable zombie game[/h1]\n\n-[b]Graphics: 8/10[/b]\n[i]Nice graphics!

This game sort of came out of nowhere, it didn\u2019t have very much hype behind it prior to release and it came as a welcome surprise to a usually quite month of the year for big game releases. \n\nThe game play in Dying Light reminded me so closely of Dead Island. You play in first person view as you explore the world. Of course, the world has been overrun by zombies. One of the changes to the \u201cDead Island\u201d gameplay style is the parkour system. We have seen parkour systems used in games such as Assassins Creed and Shadow of Mordor, but Dying Light\u2019s version knocks them all out of the park. A third of the gameplay is based around the running and jumping across the landscape \u2013 you are able to hide from the zombies when you are jumping rooftop-to-rooftop so it is really in your interest to get to grasp with it as soon as possible. There are times when you will be thrown into the combat situations; this is where the Dead Island mechanics come in \u2013 melee weapons are going to be your primary source of damage and they work exactly the same as DI. Your weapons take durability damage each time you hit, but you can repair them on the fly with the required parts. Once you get your hands on a gun, the odds swing dramatically in your favour, but you do get the downside of the noise it creates, and it possibly attracting even more zombies to your location.  \n\nOne of my favourite mechanics Dying Light introduced though would be the dynamic day and night cycle. During the day time, zombies will act in their usual manner, whilst they are still a danger, they can definitely be managed fairly easily. Once it is night time though; boy oh boy, you better have your running shoes on! The zombies transform into a much more dangerous form, they can sprint, and see a lot further away, as well as their heightened sense of hearing \u2013 meaning you will find it very hard to by-pass them.  The day night cycle lasts for about 70 minutes in total, about one hour in daylight, and 10 minutes at night. \n\nGraphically, I am very happy with the quality of graphics on show. I was nowhere near able to push out the game on 4k, even on the menu screen my frame rate plummeted, and I even struggled on 1440p, so I had to make do with just 1080p with all of the settings ramped up.  The lighting effects, explosions, and scenery all look absolutely stunning. Textures are all high resolution and the animations of everything in the game are faultless. Whilst there is a lot of animations that can be annoying after the first few times, such as when you open a chest, you have to wait 2-3 seconds whilst the animation plays out of you opening it; personally I would have liked this to be skippable but it is a really minor issue. \n\nDying Light starts out in a very easy fashion, allowing you to get to grips with the game mechanics, and the tutorial at the start of the game introduces you to the game very well too. The parkour mechanic can take a little while to get used to as sometimes you will probably fall whilst climbing buildings because you aren\u2019t used to the way it works and feels, but it just takes practice. The only time I had real issues with the combat difficulty would be the later stages in the game, when you are just getting hammered by hordes of zombies over and over again. Little tip; conserve your ammo!!!\n\nThe vast open world you are playing in very rarely leaves you with nothing to do; there are tons of side missions, collectables and loot to find. There are over 100 different melee weapons, and they can be modified in different combinations (over 1000 of them!). The side missions do seem a little but samey after a while. I completed about 13 or so out of the 44 before I finished the main story and this was because they are very repetitive. A few other optional objectives consist of finding relief packages which is where you race the opposite faction to get a supply drop, saving survivors from the opposite faction\u2019s men attacking them, and the same for zombies. You can also go out of your way to find collectable items such as trophy\u2019s and notes around the world. \n\nCompleting the main story and about a \u00bc of the side missions has taken me just over ten hours. Right now I don\u2019t have a dying urge to go back in and complete the rest of the missions, purely because of the repetitive factor, but I will be keeping Dying Light installed so that I can in the future as well as the anticipated DLC which will be releasing soon. The devs have reports that with all of the current content in the game, you should be able to push 50 hours. I struggle to believe that, I would say you can get about 20 hours out of Dying Light at the time of writing this. \n\nI didn\u2019t have any technical issues. The game ran very well at 1080p at a steady 60 fps, the only time it dropped sub 60 was in extremely hectic scenes with hundreds of zombies and lots of explosions but that is to be expected. I played the game with keyboard and mouse, and should be strongly recommended you do not attempt to play with a controller.\n\nTo sum up, Dying Light is a really nicely done zombie adventure game. Personally I feel it is a much more rounded off game compared to the Dead Island series, and adds plenty of depth to the genre rather than re-hashing content that\u2019s already been done before. The main story and core gameplay mechanics make\u2019s Dying Light one of the standout games to be released in 2015 and I would strongly recommend this game to any open world genre fans out there. \n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n[b][u]5) Highly recommended[/u][/b]\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

This now-enclosed ecosystem gave birth to warring factions, with Rais\u2019 bandits on one side and Brecken\u2019s Tower on the other, fighting for the precious Antizin keeping the virus at bay.\n\nDying Light delivers an uncompromising, detailed take on a zombie apocalypse, showcasing a demolished city whose streets are littered with bodies and living dead. The struggle is palpable, with communities battling each other, rising and falling for the few scraps that are left, with no help in sight. Gore is a daily affair, as death: the various characters encompassing Crane\u2019s story aren\u2019t always well-written or relatable, save for some highlights. The main story itself is an overused trope about a one-sided villain, revenge, and loss - it could have been good, if it wasn\u2019t a limp-wristed crock of mediocrity.\n\nBe that as it may, DL will still manage to captivate players with its atmosphere, level of detail of each environment, and delightful brutality that is the hallmark of most activities - even if sometimes it degenerates into B-movie exaggerations. Exploring the world feels interesting and tense, as the clock always ticks towards a nighttime spelling doom for all not in shelter.\n\n[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]\nThe parkour system is DL\u2019s selling point, having Crane bolt through roofs, car pile-ups and scaffolding with superior agility, using a roster of moves and gadgets to overcome obstacles and make the undead bite the dust. This system does work and feels cool as traversal medium, however its inconsistency and bugginess will also spell your untimely end (alongside XP loss) more than a few times. The handy map shows all critical information and has custom marker functions, there\u2019s no getting lost; liberate safe houses to have closer respawns should you die, and a shelter for the deadly nighttime.\n\nSecrets like containers, blueprints, Easter eggs are scattered everywhere, in the most obscure corners of Harran - finding them is worthwhile and satisfying, not to mention useful in the long run. Looting supplies and resources is paramount to keep yourself stocked on repair and crafting materials, so take your time to comb each shack, house and street after clearing the enemies - but don\u2019t take too long, as DL has the habit of harassing you with enemy spawns all the damn time, no matter how silent you are.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2976084534\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nCombat features one-handed, two-handed melee weapons, firearms and a plethora of throwables ranging from home-made grenades to axes, knives and even arrows - all this on top of a rich moveset of judo-like techniques to deflect, throw, counter and slam enemies to the ground. While the regular slow undead may be simple (even if spongy on higher settings), Fast Zombies and Special Infected, not to mention bandits armed to the teeth, will definitely give you a solid challenge where positioning, correct usage of consumables and knowing the enemy attack patterns are paramount to victory.\n\nFighting anything feels satisfying, with a stamina system that punishes button-mashing and rewards thought-out offense and defense. You\u2019ll die if downed solo, while in co-op your companions can resurrect you within a certain time limit. There\u2019s a certain emphasis put on distracting enemies, being silent and avoiding confrontations when unnecessary, something the game betrays itself onto, given the fact it spams Fast Zombies all the time. Be prepared to hit-and-run, be fast and most of all, be prepared with plenty of resources.\n\nBosses are little more than normal enemies on steroids, with no special attack patterns, abilities or movesets of note. They\u2019re quite disappointing and forgettable as fights.\n\n[h3]Character Progression, Challenges & Crafting[/h3]\nCrane will improve his Combat and Agility skills in a \u201clearn-by-using\u201d fashion, meaning you\u2019ll gain Combat XP for defeating enemies and Agility XP for parkour-related actions. Survivor XP is gained from quests and random events like survivors in distress or military airdrops, both on time limits. Each point can be allocated in the related skill tree, granting Kyle new skills like combat moves, better parkour, better stamina, or wholly-new moves like sliding, shoulder-bashing and many more. The Survivor rank unlocks better crafting blueprints, unlocks critical accessories like the Hook and so on.\n\nCrafting is done via a dedicated panel, using the scavenged materials, divided in rarity tiers, to produce consumables, weapon mods, ammunition or other utility items. Many blueprints will have to be acquired either from quests or from the skill trees themselves. Weapons all have a certain durability and a number of repairs, except firearms, so you will eventually have to scrap them and use new ones - this is less of an issue later on where rarer weapons take a very long time to become completely destroyed. The balance of most resources is fair after early game, save for a few that are particularly cancerous to get.\n\nThe various challenges scattered around the map are a good way to rack up Agility and Combat XP, provided you can pass them as they\u2019re particularly tricky and often on tight time limits. Personally, I didn\u2019t find them much fun or worth doing, as you can get pretty much the same amount of Xp doing other, more enjoyable things instead.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2977099353", "timestamp_created": 1685330328, "timestamp_updated": 1685409674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.861742734909057617", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50327308": {"recommendationid": "50327308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198922886237", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 942, "last_played": 1621687506}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Starring at walls is better\n\u2610 Just don\u2018t\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n---{Audience}---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens\n\u2610 Adults\n\u2611 Human\n\u2610 Lizards\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boiiiiii\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n\u2610 Just press \u201aA\u2018\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{Story}---\n\u2610 Story?\n\u2610 Text or Audio floating around\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n---{Game Time}---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 It\u2019s free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs", "timestamp_created": 1556252888, "timestamp_updated": 1556333041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 164, "votes_funny": 64, "weighted_vote_score": "0.861635029315948486", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39763384": {"recommendationid": "39763384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166583520", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 198225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 123850, "last_played": 1644255188}, "language": "english", "review": "Update on my Old Review (2020-10-04):\nI would still recommend this game. If you've never played the game then skip down below where my old review is. \n\nMy update is just rambling on the current state of the game (PVP). \n\nI only play this game for the PVP after my first 1,000 hours and I'm sad to state that after amazing experience in this game, I'm gonna have to permanently uninstall this game. Thank you Digital Scapes for creating a unique PVP. \n\nUnfortunately, this game is dead. Techland hasn't done anything with the cheating problem and exploits/glitches are still alive and well. \n\nTo give you perspective, I was invaded by a level 60 player using an Alternate account. I knew he will be using several strategies such as double claw, insta claw, insta gp etc. I usually open my game up for randoms to join so people can enjoy what very little hunters there are. But from experience, you cannot win with randoms, so I decided to turn off co-op and face this apex alone. After all, I've been waiting on and off for 1 hour so I might as well play for real against a strong opponent. Sure enough the hunter started using the glitches that could easily flawless a hardcore gamer unaware of those exploits. But this time, I decided to play with the full ultimate survivor meta. Night Hunter Potion, grappling hook strats, flares on open areas, fire crackers, Dropkick animation cancel as well as 2handed bow cancel. Sure enough, I won with 3 Lives left. Hunter left after a DFA on last nest. Initially, I felt relieved that the match is finally over. Only to realize, that most hunter stand no chance against me if I decided to play like that all the time which means I have to tone down my skill level or risk them thinking I'm hacking. \n\nSo obviously, all I have to do is find hunters of similar skill level and I can continue having fun with this game, right? Therein lies the problem, the top 1% of this game is rife with toxicity, cheating and dev menus. I hate saying specific names but now that I'm uninstalling, I'm just gonna have a blast blasting people. Most respectable players in this game have moved on, some might drop by to see how the game has changed once in a while so now we're left with shady players. I'm not talking about the chinese or russian hackers, they've always been a problem from the start. I'm talking about good players with dev menus that allows them to do whatever they want. \n\nFor example, some time ago Fear invaded me when I joined a random chinese game. Sure enough, we got flawlessed. No teamwork on our part, just a completely easy match for the hunter. The next game when I was playing on my own. I got invaded by some of his friends who was watching fear's stream(Fear's Main vac banned btw). I looked at this guy's steam account and there's a vac ban; I'm playing on a vac secure game. So I went to the water and told him to get out. He proceeded to talk trash, yada yada. Then he used the dev menu's crash script to crash my game. \n\nTECHLAND! DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SUCH A THING CALLED A CRASH SCRIPT IN-GAME??? These retarded teenagers literally would crash people for the most unreasonable grievances. LAGGINESS, USING SAFEZONE/WATER after horde spit etc. \n\nAnother example, I used quick join along time ago and I ended up in BestGamerAli's Game. 4v1 back when hunter is OP in 4v1. I was playing against BGA and his fan boys. I proceed to destroy them after they realized they can't back up their trash talk. BGA in his almighty wisdom decided to crash my game... No wonder he's got a vac ban. He just resorts to a menu when things don't go his way. Now these examples are a while ago, but trust me when I say that's the norm in PVP now. Trash talk, Alternate accounts due to main account having a vac ban, Dev menu with crash script due to wahkah being retarded on discord etc. \n\nCheating is so rife in this game that some of the legit players I used to play against is resorting to cheating to protect themselves from cheaters. An Unnamed brazillian player (some people change their names more often than I change my underwear) decided to use god mode on me because apparently \"you hack I hack\". The entire game was clean but once he's down to 2 lives and no nests killed (due to games' balance favoring hunter at the time) he used god mode... he was a respectable player on all our matches previously up until that point. The point i'm trying to make is: Cheating is so bad that legit players would use cheats to counter people who they think is cheating. Congratz techland, you created cheatception the game. \n\nAt this point in time, this will never be fixed. There's no reason to fix this. I am only sad that this game finally died.\n \nPVP rating: 4.20 out of 10 (as of today)\n\n<<<THE END>>>\n\n************\n************\n************\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n\nMight as Well leave a Review after 2k hours. \n\nDo I recommend this game?    Yes\nIs this game fun?                      Yes\nIs this game fun with friends?  Yes\n\nI finished the main story 13 times and the Following about 3 times.\n\nI got this game a year after its release before hard mode and nightmare mode even came out. Game has changed a lot since then so if you want more value per dollar this is the time to buy it. \n\nI remembered goofing around in this game and just exploring. It was a lot of fun. I remembered mocking Rahim's death after joining a random coop and making everyone laugh. Fun times at the bridge and met a lot of friends most of which stopped playing this game\n\nStory: 8/10\nSide quests are somewhat related to the story but unfulfilling.\nMain story is ok\nHidden weapons and blueprints are fun to use. \n\nGameplay: 10/10\nThere are many ways to kill a zombie so that's good plus amazing parkour mechanics that work.\n\nPvP: 9/10\nCommunity is suffering from an extreme form of internet retardation and there are cheaters everywhere however once you get the hang of the game it becomes enjoyable.

Unlike many of the other survival games the action is superb.  The enemy AI makes sense and gets better as you go.  The environment is so realistic, the sound so immersive, the situation and the enemies so believable, that you'll find yourself feeling like you are actually part of a zombie apocalypse.  You'll shout at the enemies, goading them out loud in your room so you can whack on them, starting to believe that you can actually do this (admittedly exaggerated) parkour, and just having a whale of a time.\n\nIf you liked any of the Dead Island series, if you are looking for a System Shock 2, Deus Ex series, Bioshock series like game set in a zombie environment where the ACTION is a whole lot more INTENSE, this is the game.\n\nScavenging is well done.   You can look for loot in car trunks, trash cans, inside houses -- in cupboards, closets, fridges, cabinets, satchels, and the like.   You'll find shops to raid, some seeming to be garages, pawn shops, restaurants, pharmacies, and so on.  You'll also find scattered around special larger chests in varying colors, many are locked with varying levels of difficulty to lockpick.  These chests, and the police cars and police vans, often yield some of the best loot.  In this game, the best and most reliable weapons are melee weapons -- if you know Dead Island you'll get the idea although it is much expanded here.   Firearms, bows, explosives, and many craftable blueprints, as well as upgrades to weapons can be found.  These all come in various varieties and many in different tiers of capability.\n\nIt's as if an action game of the quality of the Far Cry Series had decided to tell the in-your-face story of surviving in a totally quarantined city in the middle of a zombie epidemic and your the stunt man in the action movie.   You have a good range of zombies to take on, as many as in any other game.  They work together and remind one of The Walking Dead TV series.   There are the normal biters, acid spitting toads, adrenalin fueled Virals who can dodge and run, Nightwalkers who are even worse and tougher, Goons who can take a beating and dish out huge damage but are slower.  There are Demolishers who can throw boulders and pieces of concrete pavement, Volatiles which spit and run and do parkour as well as you but are much tougher than a human who come out only at night or in the always dark areas.\n\nIn addition, there are bandits and Rais' men -- who try to control the access to the limited drug suppressant to the infection -- the sole way to keep alive if you are infected.  These arrive in air drops, which are important to get to quickly and acquire, as Rais' men intend to gather and hoard it for huge profit for themselves. \n\nQuests abound.  Tons of side quests, GTA like Parkour challenges, killing spree challenges, and the like.  Main story quests  also abound.  While you explore and move about the map, well I should say several huge maps, you may run into random encounters.  Here you can interact with fellow survivors, assisting them, protecting them, meeting random vendors who may have some of the best loot, and meeting special zombies.   \n\nThe Story is more than good enough the characters are believable, english voicing good.\n\nThe environment looks like survivors have been fighting hard to survive, even preparing traps and other contraptions all over the city maps.   You can knock a zombie into a bunch of spikes set up against a wall and kill it that way.   You can use car traps, electric fence traps set on the ground to electrocute them, UV light traps at night to discourage the Night Variants from coming near you, and so on.   \n\nThe combat is incredible with tons of moves you can make even unarmed.  Ever want to dropkick a zombie, it's a skill.  Want to jump with a weapon from a building and crush a zombie's skull as you land with a weapon thru its brain, you can do that.   If you sprint and want to knock the legs out from a zombie you can do a slide, later it is upgraded to a leg-breaker, making the zombie unable to use that leg.  Combat animations are superb.  \n\nFirecrackers not only attract zombies they can light up oil slicks in the environment and if there is a fuel barrel nearby, kaboom.   Some zombies have Hazmat suits with a gas tank on the back, if you hit the tank with a weapon, it begins to hiss as it leaks, and soon that ignites with resounding fury -- so don't be close.   The game has so many things in it that are interrelated that work as you might imagine -- you can't help but be immersed in the environment.\n\nThere are multiple difficulty levels.  Normal, Hard Mode, and Nightmare Mode.  Plus a New Game Plus allows you to slightly increase the difficulty even more, but lets you keep all your skills you acquired, plus any loot you have already in your basically infinite stash. But don't worry, you'll be using up all these weapons, explosives, firearms, in that stash as well.  Stashes are located in Safe Zones, which you have to find, clear out, and make safe.  Hard Mode omits the usual pausing with the inventory open, it doesn't produce as many purple and orange high tier weapons, and zombies are tougher and do more damage.  Your flashlight now also dims out as it is used compared to normal. In Normal you can pause the game even when in the environment but in Hard kiss that goodbye.   Hard Mode gives more experience, but you lose more upon death.  Nightmare takes it even to a higher level of difficulty, but the flashlight does not dim, etc.  Gold Tier Weapons begin dropping in H and N.\n\nExperience is gained by doing many things.   There are Survivor Skills which level up also the loot and difficulty it seems in the game.   Agility Skills which you get by using cool parkour moves.   Power Skills which are gained by doing cool combat moves.  There are 73 skills in all, but only about half are actually new skills, I'd call them moves or abilities that you can do.  The rest are mostly upgrades to a higher level for those skills.  You can even camouflage yourself like a human hunter does in the wild, by using zombie corpses to camouflage your scent, giving you some periods of relative peace but at the cost of some visibility (tinted view and some blood splotches if put on too much).\n\nIt is an extremely well balanced game.  Plenty of options for your computer and for your gameplay as well as for difficulty.   \n\nI could go on, but what is the point.   It's really a great game.  Get the Enhanced Edition, it will include the Following all all the DLC except unneede special stuff in Harran Ranger, Gun Psycho, and Volatile Hunter bundles, all of which are not key to the game.\n\nI've played this game for over 180 hours and I'm still not done the first map on Normal.   You can control the pacing and the risk by doing things your way.  Scavenge more and conserve the good stuff, or take on the world full blast with your best stuff, it is up to you.\n\nIt's a forgiving game in that you never just die.  You just lose experience. Saves system seems very solid.  Plus there are other modes in Co-Op and also a Be The Zombie mode, where you can either play the top echelon Night Hunter Zombie, or be one of the 4 humans trying to survive its Hunt and achieve your mission.\n\nLots of game and some more smaller content drop downloads supposed to come this year, mostly weapons and small new challenges.   \n\nNOTE: If you have an INTEL HD GPU, I cannot recommend you play this game with it.  You can expect 11fps or less in any resolution, even if you try 800x600.  It is possible that AMD/RADEON integrated GPUs may often be similarly out of luck.  But any decent gaming Video Card, I use an Nvidia Geforce GTX 750 Ti with 2 GB of VRAM, will easily play this game well.  Just make sure you have something that can game, doesn't have to be the best, the card I use or something in that ballpark will serve you well at very low cost.\n\nHere's to your enjoying this game as much as I do.", "timestamp_created": 1512608533, "timestamp_updated": 1512764839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86035686731338501", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "155376921": {"recommendationid": "155376921", "author": {"steamid": "76561199436420120", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5506, "last_played": 1709332374}, "language": "english", "review": "its better than dying light 2 in every way", "timestamp_created": 1704535237, "timestamp_updated": 1704535237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 173, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860105335712432861", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87461070": {"recommendationid": "87461070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122526427", "num_games_owned": 398, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 2478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2383, "last_played": 1712523199}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611\ufe0f  Beautiful\n\u2610 Stylistic\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\n---{Gameplay}--- \n\u2611\ufe0f Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2611\ufe0f Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{Audience}---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611\ufe0f Teens\n\u2611\ufe0f Adults\n\n\n---{Requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611\ufe0f Low\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611\ufe0f Average (Depends on the difficulty set)\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611\ufe0f  Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{Story}---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Like Playing \"Candy Crush\" For The Story\n\u2611\ufe0f It's Alright\n\u2610 Well Written\n\u2610 Epic Story\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n---{Lenght}---\n\u2610  Very short     (0 - 5 h)   \n\u2610 Short              (5 - 15 h)\n\u2610 Average        (15 - 25 h)\n\u2611\ufe0f Long              (25 - 60 h)\n\u2610 Very long       (60+ h)\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 It\u2019s free!\n\u2610 Underpriced\n\u2611\ufe0f Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 Could Be Cheaper\n\u2610 Overpriced\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{8/10}---\n\u26101\n\u26102\n\u26103\n\u26104\n\u26105\n\u26106\n\u26107\n\u26118\n\u26109\n\u261010", "timestamp_created": 1614322558, "timestamp_updated": 1614322558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 438, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858758211135864258", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29403121": {"recommendationid": "29403121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060001352", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 4173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3900, "last_played": 1489181379}, "language": "english", "review": "Dying Light is a damn good game, in my opinion, one of the best zombie based game you'll find on the market.\nIt's fun, addicting, very well crafted and beautiful to look at, here's exactly why:\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nI want to start with the gameplay, which is the highlight of the production. \nFirst of all, this game was brought to us by Techland, pretty much the same developers of Dead Island, in fact this game shares a lot of similarities gameplay-wise with their previous title.\nSo, just like Dead Island, Dying light is a first person action zombie game, focused mainly on malee combat, with survival elements and an RPG level system. What makes Dying Light way better is how much flawless the gameplay is. A lot of thought went into it and it shows, let me explain: Dead Island can be very boring at times because you spend a lot of time just moving around, on your way to your next objective doing nothing except dodging zombies, because killing them is no more fun. Dying Light avoids this by making \"moving around\" the most exiting thing ever! This game has an excellent parkour system, so instead of just running, you're jumping on rooftops, climbing buildings, jumping and sliding on zombies front-flipping your way to your next assignment. It just never gets boring.\nThe fighting is not as crazy as Dead Island, that had friccking Thor hammers and fire blades. You can still make special weapons but they're a lot more down to earth. To compensate that, Dying Light has a lot more weapon variety, while malee weapons are the clear focus, there are lot of throwable weapons (like shourikens, even explosive ones, or axes), molotovs, granades, a bow and some guns too, but they're not upgradable nor that satisfing to use.\nThe enemy design is pretty standard, there are your basic zombies: the normal one, the suicide one, the one that spits acid, the big one, the bigger one and your everyday human baddies.\nAs you can tell fighting is not as groundbreaking as the parkour system, but considering it implements some of the agility of the parkour, it can be fun sometimes.\nWhere the gameplay is taken to next level is on night time, because the dynamic time of the day doesn't just change the lighting of the eviroment, it changes how you play the game: when the night comes, zombies are faster and meanier, at the beginning you can't even hope to fight back and all you can do is run for your life, use traps set around, hide in the shadows and wait for the sun to rise again. The first nights are traumatic and you'll try to avoid them, but as the game progresses and you learn more, you'll conquer the night a little bit, so there's a good sense of progression.\n\nTHE STORY:\nAfter playing through the story I asked myself how much these developers must love Far Cry 3. A lot of similarities with that game, especially the crazy main bad guy obsessed with caos who kills his own men and the tripping on drugs platform sections. That, and quick time events boss fights.\nAnyway, the story it's pretty forgettable, nothing really memorable to highlight but I won't spoil it. Some sidequests are pretty decent, there are still some of the usual delivery boy missions, which zombie game really love apparently, but at least here there are some fun side characters to meet. A few of them at least.\n\nTHE PRESENTATION:\nWell it looks really good, the lights are beautiful, sunrises and sunsets are very pretty. What wins me over with the presentation is when you're standing on a high ground and you get to enjoy all the enviroment around you, it really looks beautiful.\nOne little complaint is how the water looks from further distances, it's pretty weird for me.\n\nTHE SOUNDTRACK:\nBarely remember any of it. Some nice tons here and there, nothing else to say about it.\n\nADDICIONAL CONTENT:\n\"The following\" expansion is a very good downloadable content. It's relatively cheap and it offers a lot. They changed the scenario to a countryside, where instead of jumping around you're using a dune buggy, which is awesome, it's upgradable, customizable, fun to drive around for a while. The story of this DLC is actually a little more interesting, with this cult who is apparently immune to the infection, a little more creative. A problem is that it requires you to do some sidequests to continue the main story and there's a lot of them, so it might become unfocused.\nAll that considered, if you like the game you can pick this up with no ripercussions.\n\nThe Bozak Horde is one those challenge missions that you can repeat how many times you want to, so it can be fun a few times if played with some friends.\nSpeaking of friends:\n\nTHE CO OP:\nThis game is excellent to play in co op with some buddies, running around and killing zombies becomes more fun and looking around for resources becomes less tedious. Also, dying in the game can be pretty stressfull because it kills the \"momentum\", luckily coop deletes this issue because a friend can just pick you up when you die, even from a fall, so you don't have to restart somewhere far away, after a immersion killing loading screen, less interested in keeping to play.\n\n\nIn the end, if you're a fan of zombie games, or first person games in general, or you want to spend some quality time with some friends, this is definetly a game worth buying. \n\nThere's zombies. There's parkour. And if you have the DLC, there's dune buggies.

I think I initially bought it because it was on sale and I wanted to add a \u201czombie\u201d game to my collection that wasn\u2019t Resident Evil. Now, if you\u2019ve read my Kingdom Come Deliverance review, you know my background. My last zombie game was the very first or second RE back in like 2002-03. Those games lean into horror and \u201cscare moments\u201d a lot. Silent Hill also comes to mind as far as building up that fear in you as you play and advance in the game. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was looking for that feeling here. After all my anxiety would flare up if something is making zombie noises and following me wherever I go. I have discovered in this new round of gaming that my OCD takes over and I try to complete every side quest and every item on the map, along with searching every nook of every room in order to find whatever might be there. With that in mind, I was thinking that a game that had zombies making zombie noises while I search or try to explore, might not be the best choice for me. After all, we need the games to match our personalities.\n\nBefore playing I read a couple of the reviews from my friends on here that I appreciate and take their advice. One of the reviews said that the respawn of the zombies was too much for him to actually enjoy the game, and as you\u2019ve read above, I need some time to feed my OCD and search every room without having zombie noises in my ear. Because of this, I chose the \u201ceasy mode\u201d in difficulty or as the game calls it, \u201cstory mode\u201d. This is important because I\u2019m a gamer that looks to play a game in campaign mode and looks forward to a good story. That\u2019s my goal. I don\u2019t care about playing a game that is just mindless shooting of something, nor do I care about co-op modes. Give me a good story and I\u2019m content.\n\nWith this in mind, I fired up the game. My first impression was that it felt like Far Cry 4 but with zombies. Even the dude\u2019s voice sounded like the one from FC4. I liked FC4 fyi. The initial part of the story and the character was a bit slow to grasp your attention and stick with it. But the way I play, I only play one game at a time until completion, so other games did not distract me away from it. I have to tell you that the game stepped up BIG time. The story picked up nicely, the map became clearer as time went by, the zombies would not respawn as quickly as I thought they would, giving me plenty of time for my scavenger hunt adventures and I just started loving it. It became a game where I ran everywhere. I stayed on the rooftops and once you get the hook you can basically move very fast through town.\n\nYou play as Kyle Crane, a GRE agent that was sent to the city of Harran to extract some documents that the agency wants (very suspect) because apparently the documents don\u2019t have the full cure of zombiyism and might hurt even more people if someone decides to mix up a batch and drink it. FYI, During the whole game, Harran is the only city with the virus and quarantined from the outside world. The story picks up from there very nicely and you become the \u201cgo to\u201d guy to help everybody and their mother. \n\nThe more I played the more immersed I became in the game. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of my very low expectations of the game or the actual mechanics of game play, (it has some very cool effects once you start upgrading your melee weapons and start slashing away at zombies to the point that it gives you slow motion and sound effects), but it really grew on me. I liked that it wasn\u2019t scary or gave me a lot of anxiety. I learned to just run past the hordes of zombies and avoid damage. I think I might have jumped out of my seat twice, and one time was a big fkn scary jump with a scream and all (don\u2019t judge). But all in fun, not crying to sleep scary.\n\nIf you like an open world like Far Cry and you like a good story and you like shooting zombies or hitting them with melee weapons, then this game is for you. I\u2019m actually looking forward to part 2. \n", "timestamp_created": 1607238062, "timestamp_updated": 1607238062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 139, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857640743255615234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123449773": {"recommendationid": "123449773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198426255024", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 3905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3597, "last_played": 1685706665}, "language": "english", "review": "DL1 > DL2", "timestamp_created": 1665079576, "timestamp_updated": 1665079576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 158, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.8574981689453125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111873475": {"recommendationid": "111873475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145663196", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1648306818}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2611 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10", "timestamp_created": 1646848974, "timestamp_updated": 1646848974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 141, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857299268245697021", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30665002": {"recommendationid": "30665002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238867674", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1038, "last_played": 1645655032}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n\n+ Game does a REALLY good job at being an open world zombie survival game.

There's scattered spike traps you can lure zombies into, there's puddles of oil to ignite, oil barrels to explode, so on and so forth.\n\nYou also get to kick enemies. This can help you knock down enemies, and you can also kick zombies off of anywhere. The ragdoll is pretty damn funny, and boy is it amusing to knock a zombie off a 6+ story high building.\n\nAlso, if you've played Dead Island, then this will definitely be very familiar. Only difference is: this is actually a good game.\n\n+ Free running was a brilliant idea\n\nThe game has its fair share of fetch quests, but they are much less tedious due to the method of travel which is the free running. Every surface, ledge, window, balcony, is all climbable. It's pretty much a first person Assassin's Creed game in this particular aspect. \n\nYou also unlock a grappling hook which is awesome. There's also cars in the DLC.\n\nGetting from point A to point B is pretty funny, and not tedious like I mentioned.\n\n+ Skill Tree is pretty good\n\nThere are a lot of abilities you can unlock. You can unlock more stamina, health, faster health regeneration, the ability to slide, jump over zombies, curb stomp zombies, being able to roll after jumping off of high places, etc. It's seperated into three different categories: Agility, Survivor, and Power. They each have their own levels and XP progression, so doing specific actions only count towards that specific category of skills.\n\nFor example, you level up Agility by doing free running. You will gain a certain amount of XP for every jump, climb, etc. For survivor, you earn more XP for doing quests, side quests, picking up care packages and delivering them, and what not. Power levels are earned by killing and hitting enemies.\n\nIf I had to complain about it, I would definitely say there's quite a few skills missing that should've been in the game. \n\n+ The game changes the setting half way through the game.\n\nYou go from a beach resort/urban city looking place in the first half, to an old Roman inspired looking city in the latter half. What I love about this is it offers a breath of fresh air to the game. I don't know too many open worlds that do something like this, but they need to do it more often.\n\nI started getting tired of the first city (Harran), and the second one (Sector 0) was refreshing to explore for the first time. I don't know, props to the devs for doing this.\n\n+ Enhanced Edition has a lot of value\n\nFor $30 (or $23.99 on sale), you get the game, and the Following, which is like another game in of itself, and some other crap that's neat I guess lol.\n\nCons:\n\n- Hard Mode is sometimes unfair\n\nI probably would not recommend Hard Mode for this game. I selected it thinking it would just be more challenging and require more strategy, which it DEFINITELY DOES, BUUUUUUUUUUUUT, it is pretty damn unfair a lot of times, and it's genuinely frustrating.\n\nYou will lose surivor points everytime you die. Not sure if that's only in Hard Mode or not, but even if it's not, you die more often which will make you lose the points a LOT. As a result, I was half the survivor level as I was for my Power and Agility level.\n\nOne good thing about it though, I found myself using the spike traps more often. Same with the oil barrels and puddles. Also, dodging is necessary for a lot of enemies. Get it ASAP!\n\n*Then let's talk about whether it's a good port or not*\n\nOverall, yes. Completely good port. If I had to complain, maybe not a whole ton of graphics settings, and not a lot of in depth one's (for example, there's just an on and off setting for Anti-aliasing instead of FXAA, MSAA, SMAA, etc.)\n\nThe performance is good for the most part, but the bad part is understandable. A lot of zombies can be on screen at once which drops the framerate a bit. Sadly though, lowering some settings didn't really ease this by much (maybe 5 FPS more when I turned some stuff down.)\n\nOverall, it's good. Good controller support, yata yata.\n\nLight 8/10, is a definite must own if you like Zombie survival open world type stuff.  Cannot be missed if these kind of games are you stuff!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1490170657, "timestamp_updated": 1490170657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.856922745704650879", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156163801": {"recommendationid": "156163801", "author": {"steamid": "76561199032387175", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 412, "playtime_at_review": 1654, "last_played": 1713252448}, "language": "english", "review": "If mama aint happy,nobody happy, so you'd better make mama happy!", "timestamp_created": 1705492630, "timestamp_updated": 1705492630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.856894195079803467", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47557965": {"recommendationid": "47557965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108905519", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 5430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1956, "last_played": 1572458134}, "language": "english", "review": "If Far Cry, Assassins Creed and Left 4 Dead had a threesome this is what you would get, amazing game", "timestamp_created": 1544920602, "timestamp_updated": 1544920602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 146, "votes_funny": 93, "weighted_vote_score": "0.856847763061523438", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14265584": {"recommendationid": "14265584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002524847", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 3407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3378, "last_played": 1571974885}, "language": "english", "review": "Dying Light is one of those games that does many things right, and it is a whole lot of fun.  Techland created a zombie game in the vein of Dead Island, with huge improvements, but without the campiness.  The zombie world of Dying Light revolves around a great premise. The sidequests range from somewhat fun to damn cool. There are many different scenarios, and they are events and occurrences that would more than likely occur in a post-apocalyptic world. There are 44 side quests. While they may not be all worth doing, the player may be surprised by some of the adventures they bring.  \n\nThe parkour is fluid and connected, while building off on climbing and jumping mechanics that makes free-running exhilarating.  It starts off slow, but once you get going on the agility skill tree, free-running is really fun. I highly recommend putting points in the fall damage mitigation, and forward roll. For instance, parkour/free-running has three stages of upgrades.  You start off as a novice freerunner, and as you progress through the skill tree, you become more athletic, therefore, traversing the world faster with less stumbles. These all make for smooth controls that are very responsive, and it does not miss a beat.  Fun times.\n\nYou can also combine abilities from different skill trees to perform combos.  For example, you can use \"vault\" on a zombie, followed by a \"drop attack\" for a satisfying combo finisher.  \n\nIf you are trying to connect Dead Island and DI: Riptide to this game, it probably shares in common some visual art design, melee combat, without the campiness. But the melee combat has been greatly improved. The melee combat is extremely satisfying.The gameplay is where Dying Light shines. Gunplay is so much better too. Throw in free-running abilities, the three skill trees, and gameplay is a blast. Dying Light sports the best melee/parkour combat to date.\n\nAnd while I feel the gameplay is the best part of the game, Dying Light does many other things right too. In another light, the ending was predictable, although it could have been handled differently. I would have liked to see a twist in the story.  I feel like the premise of Dying Light could have served a multitude of story branches.  A missed opportunity, indeed.\n\nIt is one of those games that takes bits of concepts from other games like Mirror's Edge, Dead Island, Far Cry 3+4, and executes it well. It does not feel like you're playing those games per say, but it does remind you of them. If that makes any sense. It feels different, and more than enough to stand on its own. \n\nIf you guys have a chance, give it a try. But if you choose to focus too much on its flaws, you will  probably end up not liking it, and you will probably dislike it for the wrong reasons. I felt this way in the beginning, but this is one of those games that really grows on you. It is not amazing, but it has some spectacular moments.\n\nThe visuals are up to par with modern games, atmospheric and immersive, slick and smooth controls--button mapping is great to accommodate for melee combat and free-running, extremely detailed game world,  combined with satisfying melee combat complimented by three skill trees that enhance gameplay incredibly.\n\nThe sound design is excellent, from the cries of a zombie from several yards away, to a great soundtrack (some 80s/90s music), \n\nThere are many different zombie types--common, stronger common, special, and nighttime zombies all make for interesting enemy and A.I.  During nighttime, some common zombies behave more aggressively, and the nighttime zombies like the Volatiles come out on patrol.  Volatiles, like the more alert and aggressive common zombies, have a cone of vision that appears on the mini-map to show the player if they have been alerted.  A eye icon appears over the actual zombie on screen if they have spotted you, and the icon fills up with a red color indicator to show if you are being pursued. The zombie A.I. is smart. \n\nDay-zombies may not be much of a threat as night-zombies, but day-zombies can be a threat in numbers.  \"Free-runner\" zombies are former runners that turned into the infected.  They move and run faster, and they can climb objects and structures, unlike their common zombie cousins. They are more aggressive and they relentlessly pursue you until you put them out of their misery.  \n\nThe physics is good, and it makes for some unintentional, hilarious moments. \n\nI highly recommend crafting and experimenting with every weapon, even if you feel like you will not like \"throwing weapons\" or \"trap bombs.\" In this game, you're going to want to try everything. They're all fun to use, and they provide for cool gameplay scenarios you can come up with. \n\nAchievements in Dying Light are worth hunting, especially in co-op mode.  Take a little time to read through them because they encourage you to experiment and try different things. I am glad I looked through them. Point being is, get creative. Use your imagination and try to do everything. Experiment.\n\nNighttime is really intense because that's when the more hellish zombies come out and stalk you. You have probably read that other players have reported that the game does not feature real-time day and night cycles, and that is untrue. Early on in the game, there are a few story missions that introduce you to nighttime. I think this confused players. After you have completed those, day and nighttime cycle kicks in. Day lasts several hours, and nighttime only lasts for a very short time. And this occurs without story mission/side quests. You can fast-forward time by clicking on a bed (wait until night or morning), and go off on your adventure. \n\nHowever, I do take issue with the timer for nighttime. There could have been a setting to change how long nighttime lasted. Seven minutes isn't all that much, even though it can sometimes feel like \"forever\" with Volatiles chasing you across the city.\n\nThere are mini-games spread throughout the world of Dying Light. These include \"challenges\" that you can participate in, like a free-running challenge, killing a specfic amount of the infected in the quarantine zone, or a challenge scenario where you need to kill 40 zombies within a limited amount of time. It sounds simple on paper, but these challenges can be pretty entertaining in spurts and especially with a co-op partner.\n\nDying Light is one of those rare videogames that was designed thoughtfully. Single-player and co-op intertwine in harmony, and one mode does not hamper the other.  After having played over 50 hours of Dying Light, I can genuinely say that this is one of the best single-player/co-op campaign games out there. With Invasion mode and nighttime adding a whole new dynamic to zombie-killing madness, gameplay is intensified and it brings fresh new gameplay that would have been missed had it not been included.  It is one of the better games that have been released in recent years, and it definitely stands out from the crowd of new-gen games.\n\n9.0 out of 10.   \n\n- Highly recommmended.  \n- Huge improvement over Dead Island\n- Excellent and thoughtful single-player/co-op design\n- Extremely satisfying melee combat system\n- Great parkour that is fluid and highly responsive\n- Deep skill trees, and game mechanics like crafting and upgrades\n- Great visuals for an open-world game \n- Immersive and atmospheric\n- Cool characters\n- Solid writing for the most part, and good dialogue \n-

Though this may seem like something you've seen a hundred times, Dying Light has managed to implement and capture the core aspects of what made those devices work by adding in the right amount of survival horror and scares.\n\nDeath comes swiftly at every turn if you slip up in the night. \n\nThis game captures the intensity and tension of fast-moving zombies from 28 Days Later, adds in a horrifyingly wonderous night-time gameplay that drastically limits vision and introduces enemies that are genuinely frightening; both when they jump you and when you are trying to sneak or run past them while listening to their guttural growls and screams.\n\nThe most amazing part? YOU are in total control at every moment. YOU will understand why and how you die. YOU are definitely equipped with the ability to outrun and outlast them all. Yet Dying Light still manages to keep up the fear despite giving you every tool at your disposal once the game opens up. \n\nAnd for the seasoned veterans, think the game is too easy after a while? Wear a pair of surround sound headphones, attempt it in Nightmare mode or turn off your HUD. \n\nGood night... and have fun!", "timestamp_created": 1466708312, "timestamp_updated": 1466708454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85594475269317627", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45816484": {"recommendationid": "45816484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001192813", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 13389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4475, "last_played": 1643208778}, "language": "english", "review": "Dying light is showing some age, but I only started playing this a month ago and I'd say it's definitely still an exciting experience. Unto tho pro's and cons:\n\nCOOLS:\n+Gameplay fits enviroment and vice-versa. It's genuinely fun just moving around and exploring the city of Harran.\n+Fun solo, but about ten times more engaging when playing with a friend or two. Great co-up game!\n+Good atmosphere. Sometimes quiet and tranquil when you're in a safe place. Other times heart-pumpingly frightening when you're being chased at night. \n+Incredibly good sound design is part of the immersion. Music is pretty good too though can get a bit numbing after a long time.\n+The game has some humour and doesn't seem to take itself to seriously, aside from the main story... more on that later.\n+There are RPG elements to improve your character and upgrade your weapons. Most of it very simple, but fun nonetheless. Inventory space is quite extensive and you have a stash with endless capacity for convenience. This is important in games with lots of loot.\n+Though not extensive, there are other zombie types beside your standard shambling kind and the difficulty curve goes up steadily without becoming unmanagable. Which should be always be praised if done right.\n+Dying Light can be pretty tough but death has minor penatlies save from heart-attacks and a minor setback on your leveling-points. It starts out pretty difficult with tough enemies but you can take all the time you want improving before you decide to tackle bigger challenges.\n+30 bucks for what could be over 60 hours of fun is money well-spent.\n\nNOT-SO-COOLS:\n-You will find every single Zombie trope and cliche this game. Though depending on your taste that doesn't have to be a bad thing.\n-What IS objectively bad is the story: it's convoluted, nonsensical, rushed and filled with plot holes and unlikable characters. [SPOILER] The FINAL BOSS is a QUICK TIME EVENT even though he's a normal guy with only ONE ARM and a KNIFE while you have 4 god-tier weapons including a FULLY AUTOMATIC RIFLE.[/SPOILER] Unforgivable.\n-Though the controls are pretty solid for some reason 1% of the time when you try to grab a ledge Crane simply... won't? It's hard to figure out why, and can be quite an annoyance when time or survival is of the essence. Happens mostly with combinations of wallrunning and [spoiler]grappling hook[/spoiler] shenanigans.\n-Aside from the rare encounter, most characters are unlikable. They often come over as whiny, selfish, incompetent, stupid, lazy or downright suicidal. This is NOT due to voice-acting which is mostly pretty good.\n-Even the main character suffers from this. The acting is good but Crane contradicts himself a lot in his words and actions, which feels hypocritical. He's especially naive and whiny in the main story missions, while he has better moments during some of the side-stuff. Since you're supposed to be playing as this guy, it's annoying and sometimes almost insulting.\n-DLC's are a bit overpriced, I'd suggest buying those on sale.\n\nAnd that's all. Any questions?

(With lots of Dead Island hate)\n\nShort review: It's basically what Dead Island should have been but mixed in with some Far Cry, Mirrors Edge, and a little bit of Assassins Creed elements.  If you want a superior Dead Island get this.\n\nLONG REVIEW TIME:\n\nPROS:\n\nBetter story (as far as a zombie game goes): As far a a zombie game story goes this is a lot better than Dead Island.  Basically- oh yeah SPOILER ALERT -you're a man named Kyle Crane who is dropped into the infected city of Harran to find some guy that has stolen a very important file from the GRE.  And guess what happens the minute you get dropped in? You get bit, of course, lazy pr^$k couldn't move fast enough.  There aren't many twists and turns in the story, but there are some very interesting parts here and there but not much else.\n\nCharacters: Compared to Dead Islands bland Characters, these actually have some soul to them (Take that for what you will) each one is pretty interesting, some are kind of bland, but not as bland as the ones in Dead Island anyway.  Each one seems to have some weight to it or at least some emotion.\n\nFighting the Biters: Fighting the zombies actually feels like it has some weight to it, with each hit you make, each gunshot, everything.  It doesn't feel as lifeless as it does in Dead Island with swings or with guns.  The hit sounds are solid, the impact and weight with each swing you make, the bone breaking for biters, everything, it feels pretty solid.\n\nScavenging for items: To craft good weaponry or even some distracting tools, you need items found throughout the world.  Aerosal, sawblades, chemicals, ductape, everything you find is useful in someway or another.  This is how you make throwing stars, strong elemental weapons, explosives, and more.  Plus my OCD says \"GRAB EVERY DAMN THING YOU SEE.\"  Not only that but almost every single building you go towards you can go into and scavange for some loot, very nice touch that you can enter most of the buildings to get stuff.\n\nTraps: There are traps riddled throughout the world that you can use to your advantage, like a car trap.  It sets off the alarm and the zombies gather around it, after about 5 alarm horns it goes off with an electric shock, pretty much killing everything in the area around it.  Or like the electric fence, which makes a loud high pitched screech to draw enemies over, then zaps the fences below them with electricity, useful for dealing with enemies on your tail.\n\nDifferent enemy types: There are different enemies instead of just zombies.  There are the Spitters from Left 4 dead except they are even MORE ANNOYING.  Demolishers, which as basically just really big buff zombies that can knock down a lot of your health and get quite annoying.  The Runner Zombies, they are basically runners that have been infected, they're as fast as you, and can climb up buildings to catch you. The prison zombies (I suppose this is what they're called) they are basically just a beefed up version of the regular biters except with a big piece of Concrete Rubar that will hurt you with the swing and knock you over if you're too close.  Hazmat zombies that can't get caught on fire, but have a air tank on their back, hit the tank, and BOOM.  The Volatiles, they come out at night to patrol and can sense you if you get too close, this basically goes as a cop system like GTA, the longer they chase you the more will follow, and the longer they'll try to search for you if you lose them.  And then my most HATED ENEMY EVER, the Suiciders, which can kill you instantly if you are within like 2 meters of them.\n\nWeapon Variety: There are a lot of weapons you can get, each has it's own little property based off what it is, bone breaking, slicing off body parts, etc.  AND THE GUNS ACTUALLY WORK LIKE F%#KING GUNS.  Headshots apply to pretty much everything except for volatiles I believe, they do have some damn good sounds, and the impact of shooting a enemy is very rewarding.\n\nParkour!: How could I forget one of the most entertaining things of this game?  Years after Mirrors Edge came out i've been trying to scratch a very unbearable itch mainly because that game left me with wanting more of it, and since Dice is lazy with making the 2nd game, I kept hearing about this game and it has free running properties, thankfully it's done correct.  It doesn't feel like a mess, it feels very fluid, except for when you start off when you trip over every thing you see and grab onto, but it keeps you on your toes when you are being chased by the Volatiles.\n\nProgression/level up: Progressing with your level in this game is pretty good, there are 3 types of levels.  Survivor, Agility, and Power, and each is leveled up based off of what you do.  Survivor is for helping people out with quests, getting air drops and giving them to the quarter master for some experience, or exploring and helping people in need.  Agility is for parkouring around the place, the longer/more deadly the jump, the more points you get from it, meaning the more dangerous things you do the more point you'll get from it.  Power is what you do to hurt biters, can be throwing stars, your own melee weapons, guns, traps, anything, even just smacking the zombie with your fist will get you points for it.\n\nDay and night Cycle: people complain about the Day and Night cycle because it isn't introduced at first, which it isn't, but I think that's a good thing, I don't want to roam around at night not knowing what's gonna happen.  After a few missions it introduces you to the day and night cycle and it works correctly, plus all of your Power and Agility points are doubled at night since it's so risky to go out.\n\nCONS:\n\nTHE F#%KING SUICIDERS: I hate these damn zombies the most, not only are they a pain to get away from, they aren't obvious from the rest of the crowd.  Need a example?  I was on the bridge trying to get to the top, while walking on the bridge and going through the zombies, there was one with his back turned, I figured \"Ah why not\" I hit him, BOOM, dead.  Turns out it was a stupid suicider zombie, but THEY ARENT OBVIOUS ENOUGH.  They blend in with the common infected so well it just starts to get annoying, like if you're in a battle with lots of zombies and they are blocking your path and you have to kill them, and then a suicider just waltzs in behind them and you hit him you just screwed yourself because of it.  I'm not saying they should get taken out, i'm saying I wish they were more obvious to see and identify.\n\nThe grappling hook: This isn't a con becuase I don't like it, it works great, but it's Kyle when he uses it.  If you grapplehook to certain things Kyle I guess goes artard for a moment and doesn't want to grab onto whatever I aimed it at.  Like one time I aimed up near a building roof and hooked at the edge, but instead of grabbing onto said edge and climbing up he just decided he wasn't even going to try and grab it, and then just fell and broke his legs.  Good going Kyle, a%#$ole.\n\nThrowable items: Most of the throwable items are really useless, like later you can make burning and freezing throwing stars, yet burning is the best out of them all since not just zombies but the enemy Humans will start flailing around a little giving you time to attack.  And then the explosives, the only useful one is the Explosive firecrackers since they gather around it and blows them all up.\n\nCONCLUSION: After playing Dead Island and then Dying Light, Dying Light is clearly superior, and since i'm running out of a word length, i'll just say this, it gets a 8/10 singleplayer, and a 9/10 for Co-op, it's fun, it's entertaining, and I haven't gotten bored of it since.  I'm not going to let AngryJoe or Benjamin \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw get in my way of saying it's another zombie game.
