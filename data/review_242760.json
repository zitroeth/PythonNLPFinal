It can certainly be fun, especially early on when there's much to see and do, but this game has so many major issues. The main problem is that building a base is almost totally pointless. You aren't safe in your base because cannibals and mutants can pretty easily wreck everything unless you build traps everywhere, or you can leave the safety of your base and fight them outside which defeats the purpose of having a base. If you do build one, you'll eventually realize that there's nothing you really need to put in there other than some drying racks and water collectors, and even these aren't necessary to finish the story. The story itself is pretty good, but why are almost all of the story-based elements of the game inside the caves? There's also significantly more loot, weapons, and tools in the caves compared to the surface. They're fun to explore, but there's WAY too many of them. I don't understand why this game is called \"The Forest\" if the entire story takes place underground. Why did the developers put almost nothing in the ACTUAL forest that's intended to be the focus of the game? In regards to the enemies, their AI is not nearly as elaborate as reviews of the game would leave you to believe, and they all take ridiculous amounts of damage to kill, especially on Hard and Hard Survival. Overall, The Forest was fun to play but it could have been so much better. At the very least the developers could've fixed the numerous bugs still present in the game.

As an avid enthusiast of the genre, I found myself drawn into the game's haunting atmosphere, gripping narrative, and relentless tension, making it a standout title in the realm of survival horror.\n\nAt its core, The Forest thrusts players into the role of a lone survivor of a plane crash who finds themselves stranded on a remote island shrouded in mystery and danger. As you navigate the dense forests and treacherous terrain, you must scavenge for resources, build shelter, and fend off hostile mutants who lurk in the shadows.\n\nWhat sets The Forest apart from other survival horror games is its emphasis on exploration and discovery. As you venture deeper into the island's dark and foreboding depths, you'll uncover clues and unravel the sinister secrets that lie hidden beneath the surface.

Whether braving the wilderness alone or banding together with friends, players will find themselves immersed in a hauntingly beautiful world filled with danger and intrigue.\n\nPros:\n1. Survival Horror Atmosphere: The Forest excels at creating a tense and atmospheric environment, especially during nighttime and cave exploration. The game's subtle horror elements add to the sense of unease, keeping players on edge as they navigate the hostile wilderness.\n2. Cooperative Gameplay: The game is best enjoyed with friends or a group of friends, as teamwork and collaboration are essential for survival. Whether it's gathering resources, building shelters, or fending off hostile creatures, cooperative play enhances the overall experience and adds an extra layer of excitement.\n3. Intriguing Storyline: The Forest's storyline is both compelling and thought-provoking, raising ethical questions about survival and morality in extreme situations. As players uncover the mysteries of the island and its inhabitants, they are challenged to reflect on their own choices and actions.\n\nCons:\n1. Sequel Superiority: While The Forest offers a compelling experience in its own right, some players may feel hesitant to purchase it at full price, especially considering that its sequel, Sons of the Forest, improves upon many aspects of the original game. As a result, potential buyers may question whether The Forest offers enough value compared to its successor.", "timestamp_created": 1709713173, "timestamp_updated": 1709713173, "voted_up": true,

Staying only in the game, you have only your memory to rely on. I do NOT recommend getting a map mod, as they reveal everything. If you're at your wits end, then so be it, but what I ended up doing prior to finishing the game was take screenshots of the map, marking my position and what I had discovered there.

"language": "english", "review": "The naked people are yelling at me\n\nCan't yell back at them and make a necklace out of their teeth, 0/10\n\n~\n\nOkay, my [i] actual [/i] review lol\n\nThe Forest is a fantastically fun game. The setting is gorgeous and the enemies are [i] actually [/i] intimidating -- the little giggles especially give me the heebies. I hate the cannibals and I love that I hate them XD\nThe story is intriguing, I imagine even more so if going in blind; I was sadly spoiled for this game unwillingly years ago so didn't get that little edge. However even going in knowing what to expect I'm having a blast. In particular I love the ambience and atmosphere. I really enjoy the lack of BGM, just listening to the forest itself and the in-game world around me. It really ups the eeriness factor especially when you suddenly hear some shriek or giggle right near you, I've had a few crap-myself moments absolutely lmao\n\nSome small curves to learn but nothing too severely different from most other survival-crafting games. The inventory and building menus are a refreshingly new take even if they take a bit of fiddling to get the hang of. The building isn't phenomenally good, but it's functional and has enough variety to remain enjoyable and not too limited. \n\nThe AI is where this game shines, it's a complex sentient network within the tribes once you progress beyond emaciated ferals. The tribals are less likely to attack outright unless you've started it, but perhaps they'll put up totems and effigies outside your base. Or maybe they'll run away during the day only to come back in numbers at night. Maybe they'll rush you in a fake-out, you swing wildly only to realise they were just dashing at you in an effort to escape past you. Maybe you'll kill one, even kill the most-adorned one, and any group it had with it will scuttle off...for now. The AI isn't just a mindless drone like zombie AIs usually are, that'll just throw themselves at you until they die. This AI will watch you, follow you, intimidate you, get in your blind spot, surround you, flee, regroup. It makes the game just that much more fun and interesting to play. And the longer you survive, the bigger and angrier the enemies are that will come for you. And they definitely [i] will [/i] come for you.\n\nA few little gripes about things that don't make sense to me, but are really just me being pedantic, not in the least game-ruining at all. But a couple:\n- I wish there was a torch craftable. I have sticks, cloth, rope, a lighter. Tree sap and fuel to ignite. How can my character craft decently complex trigger-traps but not a friggin torch lol.\n- Would be cool to be able to take stuff off the cannibals like that glowing skull headdress thing, or the CD necklace. Just for some extra flavour. Or craft a teeth necklace and/or tan their hides to make a flesh cloak and whatnot. If I'm gonna be in this forest surrounded by crazies, I'm going full feral and making a human-hide drum to boom menacingly while I shake a shaman-staff of bird skulls :P\n- I joked about it but I was sad that I didn't have a \"shout back\" option, playing into my full-feral-mode desires\n- The enemies do sometimes glitch out while pursuing me/at my base. Most often I see them suddenly appear on the top of my defensive wall, from where they jump down and rush me. It's not game-breaking but it can get annoying\n- I wish stealth worked better, even with multiple lizard skin armour pieces + mud coating I'm still seen really easily. I just don't bother with stealth anymore\n- Difficulty isn't handled very well. I ended up throwing my hands up and just playing on normal, after everything became so mind-numbingly tedious and enemies became insanely tanky, just on one step above (hard). That's the boring way of upping difficulty. New interesting mechanics and stuff would have been more fun than just upping enemies' health, lowering the player's (+ same for damage outputs)\n\nI think that's it really, though. For a small indie studio the team did a fantastic job and made a really lovely and actually frightening game that's fun both solo and with company.

exploration of humanity's darker nature, challenging players to confront their deepest fears and moral dilemmas in a world consumed by darkness.", "timestamp_created": 1707684934, "timestamp_updated":

I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I really enjoyed it! I played this game with a group of friends.\n\nThe mechanics are simple but enjoyable. Building your camp and keeping your character in a healthy state is engaging and not too stressful to deal with. There's lots of things you can build from structures, defenses, tools and all sorts of little things you can use to keep yourself safe and ready for the dangers.\n\nMostly, the objective is to explore the forest and acquire information to find your lost son. Lots of little things are hidden all around, usually in the form of pictures or documents. The caves are pretty central to the game, since you'll find some special items there as well as plenty of enemies. Combat is decent and works well. There's not much bad I could say about this game.\n\nVisually, the game also looks pretty good at least for my own standards. It also runs well, but the game is old at this stage so I would assume it wouldn't be that hard to run.\n\nI think the only gripe is that it is a bit short, and I wish it was longer. Still, what is available in the game in-terms of content is pretty sufficient and the game honestly delivers well. Oh, and if you have a full lobby it does make the game easier. I think the game is mostly designed to be played solo, though I think it is way more fun with a lobby.\n\nI recommend it, especially with friends! :D", "timestamp_created": 1709535265, "timestamp_updated": 1709535490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519230782985687256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160957259": {"recommendationid": "160957259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857853345", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1710896559}, "language": "english", "review": "eh. kind of boring ig", "timestamp_created": 1710896708, "timestamp_updated": 1710896708, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51868593692779541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162570905": {"recommendationid": "162570905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217236609", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1692036643}, "language": "english", "review": "spooky and fun", "timestamp_created": 1712701743, "timestamp_updated": 1712701743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163357836": {"recommendationid": "163357836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198849435287", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 879, "last_played": 1699244046}, "language": "english", "review": "my sons fucking ugly (i would do anything for him)", "timestamp_created": 1713753588, "timestamp_updated": 1713753588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518072307109832764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163340080": {"recommendationid": "163340080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018851542", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2150, "last_played": 1709848497}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great lumberjack simulator with added life trauma and bludgeonings.

Exploring The Forest with my friends was one of the happiest moments this year and I truly realized how much more fun games are when you have to survive or work towards a common goal with 3 other clowns. \r\n2) The crafting system is exactly what I look for in survival games. It's not F1 typa level of complexity and yet still requires a lot of discovery and testing before understanding how everything works. I was delighted to find even more and more hidden functionality when the game is only around 2GB. \r\n3) The atmosphere and story line are beyond expectations. Suspense and in-game sounds are top level and allow you to have chills down your spine every new interaction. \r\n4) The building system is addicting as hell, where even the game developers make fun of it across the storyline. The name of the game is absolutely ironic, as at some point you realize you are playing a deforestation simulator. \r\n\r\nI found myself completing all 100% of the achievements and doing all the additional side content in the game. I highly suggest picking up this game, esp with friends.

At the beginning it is hard to understand how to craft, but once you know how it works, the game becomes 100x better.

Cave exploration allows you to find cool and useful objects such as a katana, a chainsaw, hairspray, a map, a compass and most importantly clues on where to find Timmy and the missing passengers. People might think that this game is made for them because they assume that it's like Minecraft but that isn't true. Even if I love this game, there are two things I need to criticize it for:\n1.

Endnight Games. Released in 2018, it quickly gained popularity for its immersive gameplay, unique mechanics, and intense atmosphere. Set on a mysterious island inhabited by cannibalistic mutants, players must navigate the treacherous terrain, scavenge for resources, build shelters, and defend themselves against the hostile inhabitants. With a focus on exploration, crafting, and survival, \"The Forest\" offers an adrenaline-pumping adventure for players daring enough to step into its dark and foreboding world.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay in \"The Forest\" is both challenging and rewarding. Players are thrust into a hostile environment where every decision matters. Whether it's scavenging for supplies, constructing elaborate fortifications, or engaging in tense combat encounters, there is always a sense of urgency and danger lurking around every corner. The game features a dynamic day-night cycle and a complex AI system that ensures no two playthroughs are ever the same. Additionally, the inclusion of multiplayer co-op adds another layer of excitement, allowing players to team up with friends to survive together or test their skills against one another.\n\nGraphics and Atmosphere:\nVisually, \"The Forest\" is stunning. The lush forests, eerie caves, and desolate ruins are brought to life with impressive detail and atmospheric lighting. The sound design further enhances the immersive experience, with the sounds of rustling leaves, distant screams, and ominous ambient music keeping players on edge at all times.

You know the ones i mean, the ones that became almost overnight megahits a few years back like Ark, Rust etc.  Anyone who's tried to actually play one knows spawn campers and the shoot on sight mentality makes it rough without a very large group.\n\nI didn't expect to really, truly like this game as even without the PvP I thought it'd be the same tired old grind.  Chop down some trees, make a house, blah blah blah.  Jesus I was wrong.  First thing i noticed is the enemies are actually pretty terrifying.  I'd be chopping down a tree or hunting a deer and hear screeching from something that didn't even sound human anymore coming from way too close for comfort only for a mutant cannibal thing to leap out a tree at me and almost give me a heart attack.\n \nThis isn't something you ever really get used to either.  The mutants are unsettling as hell in the best way possible.  Sometimes they'll just watch you from the distance, sometimes they'll screech at you without attacking.  Even when you expect them to attack, they're stealthy as hell and almost always surprise me.  \n\nIt's also got the typical survival fanfare down to a science.  You're next upgrade is always right around the corner, but never easy to come by.  Combining that rock solid gameplay loop with terrifying enemies causes The Forest to transcend every other survival game I've ever tried.  It's fun, terrifying, and mysterious in the best way possible.

This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menu, but to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a day. \n\nThe AI in this game is honestly the best I\u2019ve encountered. The game now features different types of cannibals with tribes that will fight if you watch silently, but will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land, (you). The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if there\u2019s enough of them around however. There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you make, scouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locations, hunting parties (though I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re only hunting you), and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves. Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacks, climb trees to escape, light tennis balls on fire and throw them at you, wreck your base if you\u2019re not careful, but they\u2019ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterrupted, they\u2019ll drag their wounded out of battle if they can, and will run off to retrieve others if you let them escape. \n\nBeyond the normal humanoid cannibals there are mutants who can always be found in caves, but will surface more frequently the more you piss the cannibals off. These (with the exception of the babies) are significantly tougher to kill and do a lot more damage. If they come near your base they mean business and while the spider mutant takes a couple of hits to tear anything down, I\u2019ve seen armsy rip a tree OUT OF THE GROUND and slam it into my base, destroying multiple defensive spikes and walls allowing the small army of ten or so he brought with him entrance into the base. The sumo dude doesn\u2019t even need to do anything super special to wreak havoc, if he runs at your base everything in his path will be destroyed until he stops running.\n\nHow the cannibals interact with you is highly determined by your playstyle, though I don\u2019t think they\u2019d ever be friendly with you. If you escape the plane crash quickly before they find you and are not stalked, you can have the opportunity to build a base without their knowledge if you pick a private enough location not on one of their common routes, and they generally won\u2019t find it unless you are followed home. If in contrast you do everything you can to piss them off (mass cannibal killings, mutant killings, effigy destruction and creation, burning their bodies in front of them), they will be significantly more inclined to bother you constantly. In my current single player game I see at least 4-6 spider mutants a day somewhat near my base, 1-2 armsies, and the sumo dudes have only just started coming out so luckily it\u2019s been one at a time. Even though I am absolutely plagued by mutants, I can always ghost them and move to a different part of the map. You\u2019re in control of how much you see them, which really makes the game AI feel more real and dynamic.\nMultiplayer is significantly less \u201cscary\u201d but if you wanted to build massive bases it\u2019s SOOOOOOOO much faster. It\u2019s a lot of fun playing with friends and pissing mutants off but there is some charm lost from having others about in the forest with you. In single player the fear comes from the cannibals coming out of nowhere and overwhelming you, which really doesn\u2019t happen in multiplayer. Sure when you\u2019re in the caves they\u2019ll still drop from the ceiling but when it\u2019s two against three your odds are a lot better and you know it, diluting the terror. \n\nI know this \u201creview\u201d was all over the place but the game is definitely worth full price. I mostly just wanted to mention stuff that combats all the people saying they\u2019ve never seen the mutants do much. It has the best music and you get a nice sense of accomplishment having to collect each cassette individually. \n", "timestamp_created": 1462903751, "timestamp_updated": 1462903751, "voted_up": true,

Survival games where you craft things? How about horror games that can still take you by surprise every now and then even after playing for hours? Well then this game is for you.  The game takes mechanics from both of these genres to give you an unsettling, yet fun experience in one game. Build a base and defend it from mutant cannibals that roam the island, explore caves to find items to make your life easier, and solve the mysterys of the peninsula. \n\nPlus, this game has an actual storyline for you to complete. The main character, Eric LeBlanc's plane crashes on the island and his son Timmy is kidnapped by a mysterious man covered in red paint. You'll need to explore caves to find key items to help you in your search for Timmy and get to the bottom of the sinkhole in the center of the island.   \n\nDon't wanna defend your base from the mutants that roam the map? Well good news is there's a difficulty setting you can pick called \"Peaceful\" This makes it to where no mutants appear on the surface and will only appear in caves. I can't recommend this mode personally because it takes a chunk out of the gameplay experience. But if you're looking for a mode where you can build stuff anywhere uninterrupted, this might be a good option.\n\nNow it's time to talk about the Mutants. There's actually two kinds of mutants. There's the standard humanoid cannibal mutants which you will see quite frequently (as long as you're not playing peaceful mode) and then there's the bizarre and deformed Creepy Mutants.\n\nThe standard humanoid mutants are probably the most interesting from a technical standpoint. Their AI is set up to behave differently depending upon interactions with the player among other factors. The developers have stated that they left a bit of fogginess in the mutants' behaviors so that players will never fully figure them out.  There is a way to turn them completely docile to the player but it's very hard to do. They come in a variety of \"tribes\" with varying grotesque skin tones. From a more humanoid tan to dark blue and pale.\n\nIn addition, there are starved skinny variants of each mutant type. These mutants are crazed and attack out of desperation. They'll also stop to eat dead bodies occasionally, even in the heat of battle. These mutants are faster than their more sane counterparts but have less health.\n\nNow for the creepy mutants. The creepy mutants are more dangerous than the standard humanoid mutants and can level a player's base if left unchecked. They're normally found in caves exclusively but after about 5-10 days they start roaming the surface, often in patrols.  These patrols are very dangerous without the proper weapons, \n\nI don't want to spoil these guys for you so I won't talk in as much detail as I did about the humanoid mutants. I will say that the creepy mutants are a lot more predictable than the humanoid as they don't examine you when they see you deciding to attack or not,  instead they just charge at you. Their attacks have enough force to strip the player of armor, kill other mutants, level the player's base in seconds, and even knock down trees! Truly, they're not something to take lightly.\n\nAnd this concludes this review.

is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent \u201clore chunks\u201d and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no \u201carrows\u201d guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own \u2013 as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]\u201cLOST\u201d, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest.

With that being said, i'd like to list the pros and cons of the game\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\n-Open world sandbox survival done right\n\nWhen I first got this game, I thought it would just be another one of those build a castle and live forever kind of games. I was wrong, thankfully. In The Forest, you can build incredible structures, but the enemies make your life difficult regardless of how good your defenses are. Want to eat but your food reserves are low? Too bad! There's a raiding party of 6 cannibals outside yelling at you about your destruction of the environment. The more you cut down trees and kil cannibals, the more enemies will come for you. It's like the EPA, but they're pissed off and want to eat you. The cannibals will hound you day and night, and they're crafty little things. They will gang up on you from all sides. Just when you thnk they've left and it's safe to kill that lizard that's been running from you for a week, they come out of nowhere and start beating you down.\n\n-The story is actually amazing\n\nYou'd think that they would just make occasional tweaks to the AI to make them better at killing you, and that's it. But nope, the developers of The Forest actually made a compelling and interesting story (and it makes sense!). There's bits of lore to find everywhere. From caves, to boats, and sometimes just on the ground in select places. The game offers lots of foreshadowing and clues to what is really going on there. The games ending is just great as well. It answers damn near all the questions that I had asked about the game, but you know what the awesome part is? The ending is not an easy thing to get to! Why is that? Well I'll address it in my next point.\n\n-Caves\n\nI have a love hate relationship with caves. Caves are always scary, and it doesn't matter how much I've explored them. I STILL get spooked when I go into a cave I know I've cleared in search of some cans of coke and some TNT. There's an eerie feeling about the caves, because they're not just caves; they're breeding grounds and bases for the cannibals. There's noises that you think are cannibles breating, when in reality it's just sounds from the cave itself. Creaking, rocks falling, the occasional maniacle laughter. Oh wait that one is the cannibals, who are likely pissed that you're invading their home. These caves are also pitch black, did I mention that? you need to bring a torch, or 12. I mean, you really shouldn't go exploring in caves in anything less than full bone armor and the Katana or Modern Axe. Nah just kidding. You can explore them with only a lighter and your prayers, and you'll probably get eaten just the same. You know what really sucks though? All the best gear (and gear you need to beat the game) is located in the various cave systems.\n\n-Co-op mode\nCo-op is actually really good. You would expect it to be a glitchy, buggy mess (it's mostly not). The game is still terrifying and immersive, but now you're able to play it with friends! The scaries part of co-op isn't the cannibals though. It's guarding your food from your friend with the appetite of an elephant and the hunting skills of a quadriplegic.\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n\n-The AI seems to have very poor problem solving skills at times\n\nWhile smacking the occasional turtle and using his remains to collect water, some cannibals might show up to fight you. This isn't a problem when you have traps though! You know what is a problem? The cannibals seem to have the deductive reasoning abilities of a brain dead alpaca when faced with traps. GRR GRR and BLEAT BLEAT will run head first into a trap while RAWR RAWR stays behind and watches his two friends get impaled. He then decides that it's an amazing idea to do THE SAME THING that they just did. It's not as bad now as it used to be in prior patches, but they still do stupid stuff like this.\n\n-Weird ropes sometimes cause death falls\n\nSometimes when using climbing ropes, the game decides that you'd like to take a 5 story fall into a cave with a Virginia and her babies. It doesn't happen often, and has only affected me in Co-op games thus far, but it's still a massive pain in the ass (or legs, as it were).\n\n\n\nI don't have anything else major that comes to mind. The Forest is an excellent game that, in my opinion, is an absolute steal at $15. This game gets a 9/10 from me. I took off a point because of the annoying bugs and glitches that occasionally happen. It is almost perfect, but missed the margin of perfection by just a hair. If you don't yet own the game, I would encourage you to get it.

(This is worth $15 alone)\nYou get to hunt animals, use skins for crafting, and mount heads on wall of your house.\nCo-op\n\nEven in it's current state, EA, I feel I've gotten more than my moneys worth out of the game. I haven't finished the game yet, but I've seen videos of people who have. I'm more interested in base building and waging war on cannibals. There isn't much of a story. Your plane crashes, kid is abducted by cannibals, you need to save him. That's all there is to it. No quests or anything like that. As you explore you find pictures drawn by kids, and photos, and empty camps that show others have been here before you. You need to put forth a good effort to piece together a story. Almost like a detective. Find the clues to explain the situation. It's there if you want it, but seems to be something the devs threw in there as an afterthought. It's well done imo though.\n\nAs for the base building. It's a bit fiddly, and takes some effort to make a really intricate base. The system of base building allows you to build very complex bases though. Which is great for when you get a large group of cannibals attacking your base you can make all kinds of fun ways to trap or funnel them into choke points for maximum cannibal crushing carnage. After every update all the trees you've cut down will respawn. So getting a bunch of trees suddenly appearing right through the middle of your house is a possibility. Make sure you build your base around the trees you've cut down, just leave the stumps and build around them. Cutting the trees that are growing through structures will destroy the structure.\n\nThe crafting system is fun imo. No crazy animations or wait times for making rope, molotovs, axes, spears, etc. Just open the inventory and start combining ingredients. Certain herbs can be combined to restore health/stam. Combine 2 deer skin with rope and cloth to make a waterskin. Feathers and sticks to make arrows. Add cloth and booze to arrows to make fire arrows. A watch+coins+booze+circuit board to make a bomb. Add sap for a sticky bomb. Pretty simple. Once you add an item to the crafting mat in the inventory (just right click something to add it to the crafting mat, no clicking and dragging nonsense), a stick for example, a list appears telling you every item you can make using a stick. A bow, spear, upgraded spear, snowshoes, arrows, club, etc. It doesn't tell you which ingredients, or how many you will need to make each item though. So trial and error, or google, is needed. It's kinda fun. Almost like a mini game.\n\nNo voice acting, hand holding, tutorial (besides a very simplistic manual that explains the very basics), or anything like that. As soon as you wake up in the crashed plane you have the freedom to do whatever it is you want. No time constraints or anything like that. This is what i love about the game! Nothing is worse than having a 30 minute opening tutorial to explain that you have to eat/sleep/drink in order to survive. Also, no stupid plot points that open up more content. Like doing a certain part of the story in order to craft fire arrows or whatever.\n\nThe game is still being worked on with regular updates. Bug fixes and more content, like craftable/findable items, come every 15 days I think it is. Something like that. There are a few items that have no use. Snowshoes for example. I would imagine that you will need them in the snow areas, but in the games current state they aren't needed at all. I see this as a good thing. It means there's alot more tweaking and game mechanics to be implemented.\n\nThere is co-op but I've never played it. Therefore, I will leave this out of the review. Plenty of other reviews cover this subject I'm sure.\n\nAt the end of the day, it all comes down to if it's worth the money or not. In it's current state, I have gotten my moneys worth of enjoyment out of the game many times over. With more content and updates being added on a regular schedule It will only get more enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1496003061, "timestamp_updated": 1496003452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 345, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.947789847850799561", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38231209": {"recommendationid": "38231209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157346832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1944, "last_played": 1537832555}, "language": "english", "review": "I hope that the developers of this game will see this review.

Nothing more romantic than strolling down a sunset beach being chased by a bunch of naked cannibals. Makes you feel like a celebrity.\n\nDepending on your nature I would suggest, if you are patient: You don't mind set backs,and have a good sense of humour. Get it now. It's pretty awesome even with all the flaws. Regular updates mean you're generally not stuck too long with one issue.. of course with each update you'll generally stumble upon something else to perplex you.. think of it as hurdles.. But everything looks pretty so that's okay.\n \nIf you don't enjoy being murdered by flying tables, eaten by land sharks, dislike leviatating geese, backwards rabbits and other such oddities then I suggest you wait it out till the game is more developed.\n\n\nThe Forest:\n\nDay 1: I awaken from my inflight nap to find this creepy looking kid clinging to my arm.. I knew I should of paid extra for busniess class. I look around the otherwise empty plane. Where the fuck is my inflight meal and booze? there's a little turbulance and next thing we are minus half a plane and going down. Lol that kid isn't wearing his safety belt. He's screwed. We crash and I black out.\n\nI awaken once again, to a near naked oiled up man-thing scooping up the unconsious child, this upsets me somewhat because now I have no one to offer as a peace sacrifice to the natives. After he runs off into the bushes with the kid I yell \"SHOULD OF WORN YOUR SAFETY BELT YOU LITTLE SHIT\" I help myself to numerous trays of inflight meals and booze glorious booze that due to some miracle survived the plane crash and are still sitting neatly on seats and shelves. I pick up random pill bottles and devour the contents and collect a pedometer from a foot, how ironic. Lucky for me, I am a paranoid survival enthusiast and was wearing my outdoor back pack complete with survival guide in preparation for this very event. \n\nExiting the half a plane, grabbing a conviently placed fire axe fitted snuggly in that slack flight attendants chest, I raid a few luggage cases of the non existant passengers, mmm sexy panties. Wandering the beach at sunset, alchohol lines the beaches, natures natural drink cooler and notice a group of nudists. Fuck yes. This island is awesome. I run up to them waving my drink in greeting. The god of Tits and wine has blessed this place!! They stare at me like I am some kind of freak, probably because I'm wearing clothes and this has obviously offended thier religon because the nearest native attempts to claw my eyejellies out, shocked I hi 5 him in the face with my axe and the natives flee, shiny butts bouncing in the sunlight. \n\nI keep moving, being the survivalist I am I slaughter a few fluffy bunnies and a lizard, skin them and find a nice spot to set up for the night. I start a fire with my trusty everlasting lighter. Thank goodness they kindly let me bring my lighter aboard the plane! I build a small shelter out of sticks and cook myself a lizard, you can just taste the intestinal parasites! \n\nDay 2-4:\n\nNot only am I a paranoid survival enthusiast. But I'm also an architect and master of construction! I have found a nice spot to start my new life here on this island, no point trying the planes radio, salvaging and rebuilding the yatch or boats I spotted on the beach or any of that shit.\nI have lashed together some sticks to form a sturdy log sled! I have about 6 logs stacked ontop of the tiny twigs and another 2 logs carried by myself, with one arm. I push the sled along with the mere power of my pinky toe thankful for my Russian hertiage. I build myself a snazzy tree house because daddy issues meant I never had one as a child. I stash my porn in it along with the panties I salvaged from the wreck. I've got 4 walls, a drying rack, a fire, storage facilaties for my supplies, a freaking gazebo and a bunch of death traps surrounding my walls for those pesky natives, who despite the abundance of wildlife and edible plants, have opted for human flesh instead... Gotta hand it to them though, they have some really inspiring art peices, the man shoved through his own tennis rackets and every orifice crammed with tennis balls is my favourite, brings me to tears every time I see it. If I was going to make any effort whatsoever to return to human civilization, I'd totally steal some of thier work and sell it for millions. I've been working on my own style using the cannibals body parts, my centrepeice being 'head on a stick' I just can't seem to capture the same passions though.\n\nDay 5:\n\nWalls seem to be a weakness to the cannibals, they are in awe of them as they repeatedly ram thier faces into it, and growl at it. Small minded barbarians hahah.\n\nIt's not so funny when they walk through my wall... the sole source of my security.. but it's funny again when they walk into my campfire and burn to death. My emotional roller coaster of fun and fear may have something to do with my wandering through the forest earlier eating shrooms.\non my return to camp I accidentally walked into a fire, and caught fire to myself. In the rain. Adeles song has so much more meaning to me now. \n\n*TO BE CONTINUED*", "timestamp_created": 1412999368, "timestamp_updated": 1414198686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 454, "votes_funny": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946015894412994385", "comment_count": 32, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31797529": {"recommendationid": "31797529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091467820", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1392, "last_played": 1494995628}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to cover the least talked about subject of this game, which is the AI. It's a mixed bag, but nothing really stands out as 'bad'. In fact, besides a few pathfinding issues with large mutants, it's actually really good. It should be noted that I haven't completed a playthrough yet, but only because I'm a completionist and have not decided to climb down the hole yet.\n\nIn terms of the cannibals, they seem to act somewhat realistically. I play on hard mode, but...they seem to have a genuine interest in their own personal well-being. Now, I don't know exactly what attacks look like, since I built my base super strategically by hanging a bridge from the side of a cliff to a house built in the ocean, but I can describe my normal encounters on day 50+.\n\nNow, about that sense that they indeed care for their own well-being. It seems possible to intimidate the cannibals simply by not backing down, and holding your ground when they rush at you, and rushing at them back. You can do this dance of feint rushes to make them hesitant in attacking you. If you just run, they will be encouraged to attack you. If you strike out against them defensively, they will also be encouraged to attack you.\n\nBut, if you pick your targets carefully (such as only attacking the one that musters the courage to attack first of the group, or the strongest member of the group), the rest will become fearful. You can then take them down one by one until they flee. You can then flee yourself, otherwise they will come back. Or you can wait...depending if you need more bodies to burn... >:)\n\nIt's best to try a 'no-f*cks given' approach when dealing with the cannibals. I've literally kept working chopping down trees like nothing was wrong when surrounded by cannibals. Now, if they bring a fire-thrower with them, it changes the dynamic a little bit, because then the cannibals are under the misconception that ranged attacks are safer to perform than melee attacks. But if you chase them down, well, then they were wrong.\n\nIt's also possible to take a break in combat, if you've beaten the heck out of everyone. Bashed and bruised, even a large group will stop attacking if you clearly had the upper hand, and they have no more ranged members. You can just sit on a bench to recharge your stamina, and everybody can just chill for a bit. Then you finish it.\n\nBasically, it is possible to have a 'terrifying presence' in this game like Fallout, but you gain it by actual ingame ACTIONS, not stat points. It is possible to make even a large mutant run away (believe me, they're faster than they look, lol. Tried to run it down, but it just disappeared).\n\nNow, before anybody is under the false impression that the game is easy, I've played in multiplayer. My bro and I would wander off by ourselves, and be fine. But three or four of his friends sticking together? They're constantly dying. That's because they aren't playing the mind game with the cannibals. It's like they know whether you're afraid or not. And whether or not you're going to make them eat that club of theirs. Being smart is heavily rewarded in this game, and numbers aren't going to be an easy route to victory.\n\nThere is a few flaws with the AI, most notably when it comes to large mutants and caves. I mean, I suppose it's difficult for them to pathfind down there sometimes, and they aren't going to climb. Combined with what seems to be an intimidation system, you can end up with situations where a large mutant will simply stand there and stare angrily. On the other hand, there are genuinely unexpectedly 'smart' moments. Once a feral cannibal followed me home, and I turned around to see where it was hiding now. It popped its head up from behind a rock to peek at me in a humerous fashion, reminding me of a ferret or a groundhog.

That's right. But I'm not just going to be one of those people who just says, \"Yeah, its ok i guess,\" hinting at their 10000 hours. Before I go into the review, I would like to give some context. So, I bought this game around v0.03, and I spent a lot of time just base building, not really caving 'cause I be a wus. Finally, a while later, I saw the game was at v0.29. That was when I added 80 hours to my game time.I know the location of every useful item, I have gotten down into the sinkhole, found and alternate route to the katana, ect. I have enjoyed every last bit. I'm a bit bored, and waiting till v0.31 to see what it brings, but for know, I will just review.\n\nPros\n-Can run on a potato, but expect some VERY scaled down resouldtion. I mean like 520x420. But that is an extreme.\n-Can be very smexy, at 1080p with ultra settings, it is truely gorgeous, but you need a supercomputer.\n-The building system is very flexable. There is very little snapping, and that is somehing I like.\n-I know it was added forever ago, but multiplayer was probaly the most beneficial thing to this game. Ever.\n-It's fifteen f*cking dollars! FOR ALL OF THIS!?\n-Still in alpha stages, so more could be added. (Though I have played more hours of this than there are hours of Dishonored's campaign, so its already worth my money.)\n-Great community, unless you join a game with a five-year-old who says, \"Your in big trouble,\" and kicks you from game. That legitimately happened before I wrote this review. Srsly. Give me a reason.\n-Multitude of collectable items.\n-Interesting lore, or so I think. There is no wiki page, so you have to explore and find all the burial sites and photos to figure it out yourself. I could be way wrong. Look at the end of this review for my personal opnion on the story.\n-Devs are fantabulous. Thats not a word.\n\nCons\n-It is in alpha, so there is more to be desired.\n-When running The Forest on PotatOS 6.7 [Like that pun :3= ?] and you have it in low res mode, it is so pixelated, my friend thought that a tennis ball was a lemon, and proudly proclaimed, \"This is my lemon!\"\n-Feels a but empty once you have gotten to the sinkhole. So don't rush to get in there.\n-The inventory system is set up so you can carry a certain amount of a certain item. It is always the same. The katana goes to the upper-left, the rebreather next to it, you can only carry 5 dynamite, ect. The downside in this I find is the lack of inventory management. It might just be me, but I relish in the orginazational pleasure of shifting item around in my inventory to make room for new ones. Maybe it is just me and I'm a weirdo, but it's a con for me so it's on the list.\n-Want an axe for a weapon! No... well, tough luck. Katana is a bit later game so...\n-I like a heavy focus on the range of items and fauna to be found in a game. The game is doing better, but my soul is a void, so keep adding to fill it devs :3=\n\nLore- The sinkhole is called a cetone` in the patch notes, which is a Mayan word for abyss. These cetone`s formed in the yucatun peninsula in Mexico. This said, the area is not an island, but is blocked of by a mountainous region, indicating it is the southern yucatan peninsula. The compass points north to the mountains, so it must take place in the southern region of Guatamala. The Cetone`s were worshiped by the Mayans. This must mean that the massive Cetone` in the middle of the map was a hub of mayan civilization, as the cetone` there is many times bigger than any one in our knowledge, as they are generally only 30 feet deep. Perhaps a strange a race had hid in these caves and slowly mutated over time to adapt to cannibalistic dietary habits. As the Mayans discovered the place, they also discovered its unruly inhabitants. Perhaps that was why the Mayans disappeared. As memory faded of the hellish place, the sinkhole was rediscovered and put on the front pages of caving magazines worldwide. As you explore, you can see evidence of early 20th century spelunking equipment. After the explorers never returned, the incident was forgotten, and became a sort of \nbermuda triangle. In 1982, a family went on a boat trip to explore the region. They lost thier son and looked for him. It is assumed he was eaten. The grave near the yacht may show that one of the parents died by starvation. The final parent is gone without trace. The several campgrounds indicate people who explored the region, not believing the rumors of cannibals. A film crew's camp can also be found by Goose Lake. James Blanc (you) and Timmy Blanc (your relative) crash in the forest. The Virginias, or six-legged female mutants, are the only cannibals with genitalia, indicated that the malformed cannibal babies surrounding them are its offspring.\n\nLike this review so others can see and revise my theories.

This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menu, but to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a day. \n\nThe AI in this game is honestly the best I\u2019ve encountered. The game now features different types of cannibals with tribes that will fight if you watch silently, but will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land, (you). The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if there\u2019s enough of them around however. There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you make, scouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locations, hunting parties (though I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re only hunting you), and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves. Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacks, climb trees to escape, light tennis balls on fire and throw them at you, wreck your base if you\u2019re not careful, but they\u2019ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterrupted, they\u2019ll drag their wounded out of battle if they can, and will run off to retrieve others if you let them escape. \n\nBeyond the normal humanoid cannibals there are mutants who can always be found in caves, but will surface more frequently the more you \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 the cannibals off. These (with the exception of the babies) are significantly tougher to kill and do a lot more damage. If they come near your base they mean business and while the spider mutant takes a couple of hits to tear anything down, I\u2019ve seen armsy rip a tree OUT OF THE GROUND and slam it into my base, destroying multiple defensive spikes and walls allowing the small army of ten or so he brought with him entrance into the base. The sumo dude doesn\u2019t even need to do anything super special to wreak havoc, if he runs at your base everything in his path will be destroyed until he stops running.\n\nHow the cannibals interact with you is highly determined by your playstyle, though I don\u2019t think they\u2019d ever be friendly with you. If you escape the plane crash quickly before they find you and are not stalked, you can have the opportunity to build a base without their knowledge if you pick a private enough location not on one of their common routes, and they generally won\u2019t find it unless you are followed home. If in contrast you do everything you can to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 them off (mass cannibal killings, mutant killings, effigy destruction and creation, burning their bodies in front of them), they will be significantly more inclined to bother you constantly. In my current single player game I see at least 4-6 spider mutants a day somewhat near my base, 1-2 armsies, and the sumo dudes have only just started coming out so luckily it\u2019s been one at a time. Even though I am absolutely plagued by mutants, I can always ghost them and move to a different part of the map. You\u2019re in control of how much you see them, which really makes the game AI feel more real and dynamic.\nMultiplayer is significantly less \u201cscary\u201d but if you wanted to build massive bases it\u2019s SOOOOOOOO much faster. It\u2019s a lot of fun playing with friends and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 mutants off but there is some charm lost from having others about in the forest with you. In single player the fear comes from the cannibals coming out of nowhere and overwhelming you, which really doesn\u2019t happen in multiplayer. Sure when you\u2019re in the caves they\u2019ll still drop from the ceiling but when it\u2019s two against three your odds are a lot better and you know it, diluting the terror. \n\nI know this \u201creview\u201d was all over the place but the game is definitely worth full price. I mostly just wanted to mention stuff that combats all the people saying they\u2019ve never seen the mutants do much.

Great Dev support as well.\n\n======\n\nI woke in a broken plane, only to scavange what was left because I was hungry and hurt. Popped a few pills and jumped out of the plane's hull before seeing scattered suitcases everywhere. Each one of them seemed locked, but my trusty axe I found made quick work of them. Found tennis balls in a few, didn't know Roger Federer was onboard. Must of been in first class. \n\nBeing the Natural hunter I was, I beat Lizards and a few bunnies to death with a makeshift club I wrapped in cloth. Skinned them and saved their meat for later. Slapping the freshly carved Lizard's skin on like armor as a sick man I am, I continued to kill its bretheren until I was covered with their protective armor. I dipped myself in a fresh found pool of water near a large tree I couldn't cut. Oddly, I found a makeshift spear inside. Mine. Totally took that shit. And then I was met with a shriek off in the distance. Wolfs? Cyotes? Roise O'Donald? Either way, I was scared shitless as night started to fall.\n\nFast forward a day, after finding a large cliff side with one walkway from behind me for anything to sneak up, so I decide to build a defensive wall to close it off. I take to the nearby forest with a newly made log sled to transport trees back to my new base. A fire pit and Hunters shelter is made. I stow away rocks and sticks I have in excess there incase I need to build anything else. I light up the fire pit and cook a bunny on it, eating it before I huddled up in my shelter for the night. \n\nI woke in the night, only to be met with two sets of beady eyes glistening across my fire pit in the darkness. I pull my axe out in hand, hearing them hiss. Humans? They looked the part, but said nothing to me. One cries out as it dashes for me, I raise the axe and block his advance. I chop the axe into this crazed man, beating him back a few times until he fell to the ground. His friend hissed at me and ran on all fours away into the woods. What the fuck did I just kill, Smeagol? \n\nFast forward about three more days, I have my rear and front defensive walls built out from the steep cliff side to the oceans waters, only one way in. Its safter to light fires at night now and sleep, since the locals seem afraid of this place. I set out on foot, spear in hand and covered in mud and deer hides to keep me warm. I had to find their village. After evading a few patrols of the locals, I stumbled into three huts and what looks like to be a large den. Looking into said den after ghosting around the town to make sure no one is there, I enter to only find a noose to greet me. And another man hanging. I cut the rope to use to my gains. I quickly pull a stick together with cloth and rope to make me a shortbow. And all those fucking feathers, now into arrows. Seriously, I had about two hundred of them. Making a few I test fire the bow. We're good to go. The srieks come back in the distance, I bolt back home. \n\nDay... I don't even know. Sun has come and gone so many times now. Traps lingering in the forest just ouside. Effigies planted about fifty yards out from the front of my gates, only to be mimicked the same way by the locals across the way. They want to show their territory. I disobey. Covered in my lizard armor and deer pelts, I stalk upon a patrol not far from my home. I wait until two break off from the group, while I keep my watchful eye on them from the hilltop bushes. Bow in my hand. The two stop near a pool. I pull tension on my bows string, lining up a shot. Release. Arrow pegs the local in the head and drops. His friend panics, only to be met with me, silently springing from the bushes with spear. His limp body drops into the pool of water. I make effigies of their corpses. \n\nWar rages on and I begin hunting at night. Traps litter segments around the forest closest to my home. I draw them out of hiding with a simple fire. I wait. I watch. They come. Throwing a rock their way grabs their attention, turning towards me. I shoot a arrow at the leader of this five man pack. All hell breaks loose. I slink my way down hill side in the darkness, as they follow close behind. I slip past two traps. One of the locals gets hung up in my noose trap, as two more grouped together and get impaled on my spike trap. Leader and croney is left. I peg the leader two more times with arrows until he drops. Small one begins to run. I draw my bow, having a clear shot. I don't take the shot. I let him run. Let him tell the others that I will not be hunted so easily. \n\nIn this forest, you either die as the hunted, or you live long enough to see yourself become the hunter.\n\n10/10 - Would Crash Again. \n\n---------------------------------------\n\n(( Serious number: 9/10 )) Game is in /alpha/ and already this intense.

You survive by keeping warm, building shelter, finding food/fresh water and defending yourself from cannibals.\n\nThe story in [u]The Forest[/u] is okay. You can see the \"twist\" coming from a mile away, however, it is a far better and more detailed story than most other survival games on Steam. There is a lot of visual storytelling, as the game hardly has any dialogue, so you will rely on exploration and collectibles to discover what is happening. There is also no set order of exploration, apart from a few areas that require certain tools, so you can explore however you want, at your own pace.\n\nThe gameplay is where this game shines the most. There is survival, base building, exploration and combat.\n\nWhen you first start a new playthrough, your primary focus should be surviving. You can gather herbs, berries and many other resources to ensure you stay healthy. You do so by interacting directly with fauna and flora around the island or by crafting tools that help you out. Hunger and thirst are somewhat easy to control; at first you will rely mostly on berries, fish and sodas/snacks (found on the plane), however, after crafting simple tools like the bow and the spear, you will be able to hunt larger animals and stock up on food. Building farms to get berries almost negates your need for food and water completely, as they grow rapidly and provide you with seeds to restock eventual shortages.\nIn order to venture forth, you must also craft better weapons and clothes; this will allow you to deal more damage, camouflage, withstand cold biomes, etc.\nThe survival aspect of [u]The Forest[/u] is complex and it was very enjoyable to see how it is your main worry during the first few days and then becomes less relevant as you craft and find better gear.\n\nBase building is another feature I really enjoyed. You can opt for pre-made structures or you can create your own by using the custom building options. Now, custom buildings are a pain to build sometimes; placing the structures is not that smooth and sometimes, once built, they clip through objects and it looks ugly. You do get a fair amount of variety when it comes to buildings but I still wanted a few more, like the chance to build cages to keep animals and mutants.\n\nExploration is very enjoyable too. When you first start playing, having no idea where you are, exploring the forest is very enjoyable and even a bit creepy; however, you can find landmarks such as cave entrances, villages or even parts of your plane  which usually have collectibles or useful components. Some of said landmarks have areas that are only accessible after finding certain gear, so caves are often rewarding to come back to. You can also mark everything on your map with a waypoint (you can even pick different colors) which is a great way of keeping tabs on everything without getting confused - being able to write something on said waypoints would have been nice, though. Sure, it is not realistic, but once you have several of them, most of which in the same direction, it starts getting a bit confusing.\n\nCombat is where the game needs a little bit of polish, in my opinion.\nIt feels super stiff. [spoiler] ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) [/spoiler]\nWhile you can use the bow and cheese a lot of fights, if you use your melee weapons you can stun-lock enemies and they can stun-lock you. It is never a problem earlier on with smaller enemies, but it becomes very tedious late-game with enemies that attack multiple times and in groups. It also feels like you are swinging at nothing. There is also no downside to blocking everything, as (I think) you do not get damaged by any attack from the front. The enemies are constantly moving later on, so slower weapons become useless and the heavy attacks of all weapons are almost impossible to land. You will most likely rely on fast swings that will keep an enemy stun-locked until you find bigger enemies that are immune to it.\n\nThere is also the fact that the AI \"adapts\" to player behavior. When you meet your first cannibals, they will most likely observe you from a distance and run away when approached. They constantly patrol the island and they will actually warn their friends about your base's location if you decide to spare them. They will, however, grow more and more aggressive, so I feel like the best course of action is to dispose of them as soon as you see them. They will also carry injured tribe members to safety, climb trees, etc. Many other tiny details give the cannibals a very realistic set of interactions with the player and one another.\n\nWhen it comes to graphics, [u]The Forest[/u] looks absolutely stunning. There is just something truly special about the location - the sunlight peeking through the tall trees, the scary caves, the snowy areas, etc. Playable characters look a little bit less detailed, however. It is also a bit \"hard\" to distinguish between the first few enemy types - sometimes it is just a slight size increase with a different color.\n\nThe amount of music in [u]The Forest[/u] is minimal, however, sound effects are awesome. The crunching noises when you use a club to bash someone's brains in or the ghastly screeches of the cannibals at night is something truly magnificent.\n\nThe game is best experienced in Co-op, as you will be able to overlook some of the flaws while playing with your buddies. Some of my best gaming memories come from this game:\n[spoiler]-Me deciding to chop some trees at night and having a cannibal yell at me in the dark. That noise scared me sh-tless, made me scream and I accidentally fell off a cliff, killing myself (my friend was in the bathroom).\n-Fighting a huge wave of mutants on Hard Survival and barely making it out alive. My friend was down and almost dead, standing on a puddle of dirty water. I sprinted over to her, without healing; and instead of interacting with her, picking her up, I drank the dirty water, which killed me and, consequently, her.\n-And finally, deciding to build our way out of a very deep \"landmark\" (if you played it, you know what it is) without cheating. I remember asking \"Wouldn't it be a shame if we accidentally fell down?\" and suddenly hearing my friend going \"NOOOOOOOOOOO\" as she fell down the platform and had to start over.\nGreat times...[/spoiler]\n\nFinally, I would like to say that the game is still very buggy (I only gave a few examples, here) and some mechanics are not relevant at all. Sanity, for example, barely has any impact on the game; same goes for your weight and strength. \n\nIt might seem I was a bit too critical of this game, however, look at it as \"tough love\". I love [u]The Forest[/u]; but the more I play it, the better I want it to be. It is a great game to enjoy with some friends and a spooky game to try alone.\nI also wish it had more content when it comes to base building. I wish we could domesticate animals and have more wildlife to deal with. As it stands, only a few animals attack you. Wolves and bears would have been a great addition to the experience.\n\nThe game was developed by a super tiny team, so I congratulate them for how great it ended up being.\n\nConsidering how much it costs, its quality and how many hours you will get out of it, I totally recommend [u]The Forest[/u].\n\nLet's hope the sequel is even better!\n\nFinal score: 8.5 out of 10.\n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, please consider joining my group and following my curator page on Steam:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/goodguynickreviews\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/7792954-GGN-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1577568269, "timestamp_updated": 1593555883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 287, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920978665351867676", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41488349": {"recommendationid": "41488349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126562496", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4500, "last_played": 1582200398}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoy the peaceful, relaxing woodlands in a sandbox game?

However as the days pass by you eventually find yourself turning into the joseph stalin of the island and rule with an iron fist, decimating anything that dares move. In all honesty the games actually decent, not going to lie just the tree chopping mechanic had me amazed for a solid few years, only getting over how good it is now with the help of a psychiatrist.

Either way, it's a great game.\n\nExperience 1: (Playing alone or with 1 other person) It will be a horror/survival experience. You are doing everything in your power not to get killed by bloodthirsty cannibals while trying not to die of hunger or thirst.  You will be sh***ing yourself at night hearing them scream and shriek out in the woods as you huddle next to your dimly lit fire, waiting for the sun to rise. Your morality will wither as your belly aches and there just happens to be a nice corpse at your camp from the other night\u2019s frightening raid. At some point you will find a cave and muster up the courage to go inside, then immediately regret your decision and return to your camp, waiting for the end to come. The enemies with get stronger, faster and smarter as you get weaker and more beaten down.\n\nExperience 2: (Playing with 2 or more people) Everything is reversed. Now the cannibals should be fearing you. You and your crack team of wonder dads, all looking for the same child you somehow fathered together. You will proceed to murder and destroy everything in your path like a force of nature and the caves will become your hunting grounds. Life is your b**ch and soon you will come to discover that maybe the cannibals aren\u2019t so bad after all, and maybe you and your ravenous chums are the real threat to these once peaceful people.

Forest to develope.  \n\nPros:\n-Beautiful graphics\n-Crafting system (Somewhat complex & engaging)\n-Great building system\n-Multiplayer/Co-op\n-Great game environment (cave exploration, abandoned campsites, etc.)\n-Variety of enemies\n-Hunger/thirst system\n-Size of game world\n\nCons:\n-Enemies:  Mutants (cannibals) serve as the antagonists of The Forest.  They are curious, fierce, and unrelenting.  While combat is tough and fun, the occurance of the mutants I feel is too high right now.  I find now you have to hurry even more than in previous versions to establish a fortified base.  Have had to restart several games after being swarmed within the first two days.\n-Multiplayer:  Another pro that is also a con.  Multiplayer has come a significant way since fall of 2014.  Back then multiplayer was practically unplayable.  Now, multiplayer adventures are fun yet there still exist syncronicity issues with host and client.  Still enjoiyable, but has some kinks to iron out.\n-General Early Access bits:  Some annoying glitches and crashes still exist, and The Forest still needs to be fully optimized.  \n\nOverall, The Forest is a great game to play alone or with others.  A year ago I would not recommend The Forest, but would adivse prospective buyers to wait.  However, the game has made huge hauls and now I do recommend The Forest.\n\n8.5/10 as of v0.28", "timestamp_created": 1448743210, "timestamp_updated": 1448743268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 170, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.914671063423156738", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66564399": {"recommendationid": "66564399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012273098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9611, "last_played": 1592994845}, "language": "english", "review": "Best played with friends, or on easier modes for those playing alone unless you REALLY like challenges. \n\nSurvival crafting horror.  3d and VR, NOT for those that get easily motion sick or have issues with first person 3d games.\n\nThe basic goal?

If thats what you are looking for this game is great for you.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Part 2[/b]\n[b]If you decide to explore more and experience the \"story\"[/b]\n\n-  The main story is that you lost your kid, the savages took him underground, and you have to find clues to try and save him.\n-  Underground there's a MASSIVE cave system that is dark, dangerous, and massively confusing\n-  The \"clues\" are incredibly vague and almost pointless. (its kind of like being in an episode of LOST)\n-   Its very easy to get killed in these caves, and if you do it may be difficult or even impossible to recover your gear.\n-   The cave system is very dark which is straining to me, and gave me a sense of claustrophobia.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Part 3[/b]\n[b]If you manage to map out the cave system and gear up to the point where you reach \"the end\"[/b]\n\n+ The ending is very surprising, almost like plot twist in a crazy sci movie that throws everything upside down.

Me and my girlfriend were just sitting there like \"wtf did we just experience?\"  Its just a mix of disbelief and utter disappointment. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOverall... this is a mix of multiple genres and may not be great for everyone. \n\n\nDo you like open world survival games with pretty graphics? \nDo you enjoy playing with friends? \nDo you also enjoy \"light\" horror with cannibals running and disturbing you while you build?  \n\nIf you answer yes to all of these questions you may enjoy [b]Part 1[/b] of this game. \n\n\n[spoiler]If you want to just experience the ending and not spend endless hours exploring the caves, then type \"developermodeon\" in the main menu  ->  Press F1 to open a box in the top left corner -> Type Godmode on  (you'll take no damage) -> Find the sinkhole and jump in -> Enjoy the ending[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1560225299, "timestamp_updated": 1561608500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 284, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.913811743259429932", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41795929": {"recommendationid": "41795929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100229248", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 91822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65298, "last_played": 1606481107}, "language": "english", "review": "Hands down one of the greatest games I have ever played.  I have been playing The Forest almost from the beginning.  I began by watching Kage848 and GameEdged.  Those two got me interested in the game in the first place. \n\nThe First Night.\nI built a small wall against a cliff with an opening covered by a standing fire, which saved my life as it didnt take long for the natives to find me....and they will find you.  The fire proved to be a good way to keep them at bay, but gods was it terrifying.  \nMy first encounter, as I was running around the opening of my wall, was a dirty, hideous woman screaming in my face.  She struck at me once and I retreated up the cliff face, nearly falling to my death several times. All the while I could see the woman below me, running around on all fours screeching an awful noise, which attracted more of them.  As I reached the midway point of the cliff face, looking down, I could see several figures approaching through the trees in the pale moonlight.  One seemed to have a flashlight of some sort above his head.  The others noticed me atop the cliff and hooted and hollered most of the rest of the night, leaving me just before dawn as I was able to complete the climb up the cliff, and disappear out of view.  \n\nA few days passed before I had another encounter, this time I thought I was ready.  I had built several traps atop my cliff, which was surrounded on 3 sides by a sheer face.  The top of the cliff had a quaint little pond with several gleaming fish slowly swimming around their isolated home which fed me, along with the squirrels and rabbits for a few days.  Many trees dotted the edge of one side of the escarpment , while the other side was bare, giving me a beautiful view of the turbulent ocean below, which turned out to be my only escape....\n\nI awoke one morning to a bleak and rainy day, the fires of my torch would not stay lit, and I was cold.  I managed to craft some rabbit skin boots which aided slightly in warming my blue, shivering body. As the day wore on and the night creeped in, I crafted a decent fire, which I refused to use in the beginning for the fear of attracting more of the monstrosites which chased me to the top of this cliff.  As I looked off in the distance, over the rolling hills of the accessible side of my little moutain camp, I could make out several shapes heading my way. The night was approaching quickly and I could barely make out the group which was dead set on my camp. One appeared to be much taller than the rest, and the smaller ones were scurrying around the hulking figure very quickly, and with reckless abandon.  As they came closer I could see that the figure in the middle was not a man....but a woman.  I could barely make out 6 legs before the monster reared up and began to charge my way, with demonic speed and an intent to flay me alive. I had only a stone axe, and the plane axe in which I found after the devastating crash. I knew I was in trouble, and as I fought bravely, the group was too much. I turned and ran off the edge of the cliff, jumping for dear life into the ocean below....The screeches of the ugly monsters trailed closely after me as I plummeted into the icy depths of the waters that imprisoned me here.  Sadly I did not reach deep enough water, and the fall slammed me into unconscienceness.  \n\nI briefly awoke being dragged through the forest by two tribal looking men.  Each had one of my wrists, and I could hardly make out what they looked like underneath the canopy of trees.  Unconscienceness creeped over me again, and I succumbed to the fading of my vision.\n\nWhen I awoke for the second time, I could not see anything. I could hear the twisted echoes of screams all around me, off in the distance.  So far but seeming so close.  I pulled out my lighter which took a while to spark.  As the small sparks caught with fuel and the flame burst forth illuminating my body and surroundings, I realized I was hanging from a ceiling inside a cave.  As I looked around I could see the fleshy chunks of my plane comrades.  Bloody skulls littered the floor and here and there an arm or leg protuded from a giant pile of flesh and bile.  I noticed my plane axe was on the floor just below me, I reached for it and cut my bindings.  I fell with a hard thud to the cave floor and my lighter went out.  It would not ignite again.  I noticed a dim light off in the distance and began to head towards it, all the while not noticing the dangling rope behind me that would lead me out of this hellish underworld.  Venturing further and further down, the rope faded from view, and the screams echoed louder.....and louder.\n\nSo if this sounds cool, and you have the chance to play The Forest blind, buy this game.  You will not be disappointed. Thank you to all the developers for making such an amazing, terrifying, wonderful game.  I look forward to seeing more from Survivalist Gaming and Endnight.", "timestamp_created": 1525185474, "timestamp_updated": 1525185474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 251, "votes_funny": 31,
