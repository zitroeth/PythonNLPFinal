our son together. Both are now 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand\u2014the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed\u2014the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.\n\nUpon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.\n\nWith nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.\n\nAfter realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.\n\nToday, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.\n\nNow I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1703278847, "timestamp_updated": 1703278847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463917523622512817", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36476927": {"recommendationid": "36476927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396334301", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1522334496}, "language": "english", "review": "rubish", "timestamp_created": 1510512982, "timestamp_updated": 1510512982, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456594794988632202", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82014026": {"recommendationid": "82014026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408668339", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 226, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1607535902}, "language": "english", "review": "Developer: Asset Flip Studio\nAt least they're honest.\nThe game itself is a bit empty, but not downright bad.", "timestamp_created": 1607632505, "timestamp_updated": 1607632505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30059015": {"recommendationid": "30059015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005244416", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1487455848}, "language": "english", "review": "https://youtu.be/b-WZx9BrxKU\n\nI have been shown enough to change my review from thumbs up to thumbs down.
