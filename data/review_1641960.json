The visuals are quite good, and the customize-able airship is fantastic! Very cool vibes overall too... flying between ruined skyscrapers and wind turbines and the like. It really is a nice setting for an atmospheric survival game (heh, see what I did there?)\r\n\r\nThat said, at the time of writing this review, this game is pretty devoid of content. After really sinking my teeth into it, there is sadly very little to do. The announcements say that Forever Skies is set to leave early access later THIS YEAR. I honestly don't see how that's possible unless there's a HUGE update in the works. In its current state, I was able to complete all the available content in this game in less than 1 in-game week. And that INCLUDES all the time I spent customizing my airship... There is very little diversity in the types of towers you can find, and the landscape is basically an endlessly procedurally generated assortment of mountains, ruined skyscrapers, and towers of various types. It's visually quite nice, but in terms of gameplay there just isn't enough to do on these towers to keep your attention for long. Normal towers come in 3 types, and each type has about 3-5 varieties that you can find. At one point you can enter a 4th type of tower that houses an elevator that goes below the \"dust\" layer that prevents your airship from descending too far. Unfortunately, every \"underdust\" environment is exactly identical to each other, meaning once you've seen one you've seen them all. Same is true for the other tower varieties. After only a dozen or so hours of playing I became quite familiar with everything that I could possibly encounter along my journey.\r\n\r\nStory elements are also fairly minimal. There are some data pads to find along the way that help you understand a bit about the history of the environment you're exploring, but it's not very deep or surprising. Environmental catastrophe, nature reclaimed the planet, yadda yadda yadda. There are also some collectible objects and posters you can find randomly within the towers that you can then use to decorate your airship. After playing for a bit, I started to find a lot of duplicates of these objects, indicating that there isn't much variety to the cosmetic aspects of the game either.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I still had some fun playing this game, and I understand it isn't yet finished... but it just feels unusually empty for a game that is supposedly close to a final release. I look forward to seeing whatever gets added next, but I don't have high hopes for this game feeling \"finished\" within the next year. Compared to many of the other survival/crafting games I've tried, this one needs a lot more content than it currently has if it's going to get a recommendation from me.", "timestamp_created": 1710720569, "timestamp_updated": 1710720569, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 292, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801214754581451416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161699092": {"recommendationid": "161699092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157188007", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1710819633}, "language": "english", "review": "Of the games I've played recently this one scratches an itch that was left largely devoid by Worlds Adrift. I very rarely leave reviews on games but I don't want to watch another good airship game disappear into the ether. \n\nPros:\n- Very nice game atmosphere can go from peaceful air fisherman simulator to horror game real quick.\n- Ship customization is good and despite not having played the new update. Can make a lot of very cool ships depending on your preferences.\n- Story is interesting so far. Excited to see where it goes.\n- If you've played Worlds Adrift you'll get a very similar vibe with this game.\n\nCons:\n- Placement of modules/objects is a little wonky. Takes some wiggling to get things exactly where you want them.\n- As previous reviews have stated the game is fairly \"barren\" in terms of content. However it is still under development and I want to give the devs the benefit of the doubt and I have high hopes for the game.\n- Tutorial feels long for what it teaches you. Then again I did spend most of the tutorial harnessing my inner packrat.\n\nOverall:\nIt's a promising game that if done right could be one of the best games to come out this year for survival/airship sim fans. It has some drawbacks but it's enjoyable enough that they aren't too major and the studio seems to be fairly communicative with their progress which is welcome in an age where most studios like to go dark and drop updates out of thin air.", "timestamp_created": 1711685347, "timestamp_updated": 1711685347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770269274711608887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161053687": {"recommendationid": "161053687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370277451", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1444, "last_played": 1711473993}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended by german content creator Cornelius with the words: if Subnautica and Raft had a child....

Game is still \"Early Release\" as of this writing.\r\n\r\nForever Skies is essentially \"Subnautica\" in the air. That's a very good thing! \r\n\r\nIn carrying forward the analogy between Subnautica and Forever Skies, both games do a lot of things right for a futuristic survival game.  In Forever Skies, you unlock new areas through exploration which, in turn, unlocks new tech, which unlocks further areas for expansion. It's a simple formula but it feels very balanced and robust and entertaining. \r\n\r\nI love the idea that future tech development involves feeding raw materials and plans into a 3-D printer... It's a game mechanic that makes sense and simplifies \"crafting\" for the player. I love that your base moves with you and that it can be customized. \r\n\r\nWhere Subnautica and Forever Skies diverge is that Subnautica was a beautiful game with distinct biomes that were unique and alien. Forever Skies might one day get there (and I hope it does!!) but for now, it's a bit monochromatic. \r\n\r\nThe game is a steal for 20 bucks, even in early release. I just hope my save game is compatible with future expansions as they become available!  \r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed Subnautica, this is a must-have game in my opinion. \r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1711483952, "timestamp_updated": 1711483952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.63866347074508667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158615319": {"recommendationid": "158615319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027755505", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 928, "last_played": 1708252833}, "language": "english", "review": "This game feels like a mix between Subnautica and Raft with some uniqueness that makes it perfectly its own.

There should be dish outside that get damaged when hit. You could tie it into the progression system to only able to receive some signal and not all at the beginning with an upgrade or additinal dish later. \n- Instead of having the water Condenser looking like a cheap camping equiptment on the ground you could make a wall device that needs an outer wall on the other side and when you move the airship it slowly creates dirt water out of the atmosphere.\n\nThe frame of the game is good, I'd just really wish they work on the ship before they continue work on the story.\n\nEDIT: They since removed the art that seemd \"conceptual\" and replaced it with renders of the actual design ingame.", "timestamp_created": 1709166776, "timestamp_updated": 1711666687, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604190647602081299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161986478": {"recommendationid": "161986478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049725294", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 881, "last_played": 1712063377}, "language": "english", "review": "Calling it simply \"Subnautica in the sky\" doesn't give this game enough justice. It has it's similarities to Subnautica, and comparing the two is definitely a compliment with the hit Subnautica was. BUT. This game has a different feel for me. Many talked about Subnautica giving them thalassophobia or triggering fight or flight, but if you're like me and only found the game to be peaceful and easy, this game is NOT that. \n\nThis game has so much potential!! To bring up some of the issues mentioned in other reviews, yes it does have frame rate drops, when going down the lift, the frames drop, sometimes during storms, or when theres a lot going on visually such as during high winds, but I found dropping to 1080p on Medium worked for me (Ryzen 5 5500, 8gb ram, RTX 4060) I could run it on Epic, but the frames suffered and honestly visually the game is still attractive on Medium thanks to it's art style!\n\nIt goes from chill, you're gathering scrap for your next upgrade, to suddenly being warned by your AI companion \"A storm is coming\" and you're darting for your ship to get to lower ground before the extremely loud thunder claps start and the lightning wrecks havok on your ship. Only to find out that during your dart you ran into an insect that gave you meningitis and through glass that's caused you to develop a bleeding disease I can't spell. Next you're running around your ship desperately hoping your plants haven't rotten away so you can craft a cure for your diseases, all whilst your AI that should be saying \"Starvation Risk\" is now going \"hnfihfahwd\" because of the meningitis. That is such a cool feature and personally my favourite that I had to bring it up. \n\nThe exploration feels a little sparse for now, as others have mentioned there isn't too much variation in the localities, and I'm hoping that as the game continues development we'll get a couple more variations in the towers but at the same time, that familiarity feels empowering after a while, when you need to gather a specific item and know exactly what sort of tower to go searching for. On these towers, I'm not sure if this is a bug or intentional, but some towers will have debris clipping through the buildings, which visually makes sense, but theres no way to clear the debris (I'm talking metal beams, not things you can extract) which can lead to you getting stuck if you try and force your way through for that good loot, hopefully this will be tidied up in later updates, but I've only come across this once or twice!!\n\nTLDR: If an hour of gameplay equals a pound spent to buy the game, you'll get your money's worth and more!

By pressing \"run hardware\" in the options you will be able to run the game on medium settings with RTX 3060. So why the default graphic settings were on max when loading the game for the first time?\r\nThe overall random lights(compounds) is a weird idea as there is no clear direction where the player should go. And when the player is given direction most (if not all) compounds become irrelevant if not for the achievements. Take Subnautica as an example, not a lot of compounds, but those are split in biomes or split by different watercolors and the direction is somewhat constantly being provided to the player (even if there was no clear goal it was rather self-explanatory to go deeper to explore and you will eventually progress the story). Here same thing can be achieved by using clouds or fog instead of rendering unnecessary stuff and leaving more hints about where to find what. It took me a while to find a ship workstation if not for the question mark at the end of the game and then 5min later \"the end\".\r\nAll compounds are essentially copy/pasta with some small changes like some walls or paths are open or blocked. meaning, if you lack some resources you already know the way to get it - that was just a boring or bad design idea - might just add a console line or cheats to spawn stuff instead of spending time on this design. After all, it's a single-player game, so let players decide how they want to mess with the game.\r\nThere are bugs and glitches like with the medical bed just consuming all of the resources and not giving any results, or being stuck in textures or just outright falling through and dying.\r\nThe general idea of living in the skies is not so bad, but exploration happens on the \"ground\" objects and you even need to dive to the lower levels for rare stuff - nothing to explore in the sky.\r\nYou can't talk about this game if you are not comparing it to Subnautica or maybe Planet crafter(but not really).\r\nI believe releasing this project early was a mistake as further development will most likely add more assets like maybe on-board plantation, solar energy with rechargeable batteries or wind energy(does sound logical to have since you live in the sky).

It falls short in many areas. I understand it wants to differentiate itself, but if you are going to take away something that makes the game fun, you need to replace it with something equally fun. Here are the major points which kept me from enjoying this game:\n\n* Looks visually interesting and impressive in the trailer, but the actual product falls short of this. It has its moments but more often it's pretty dull and depressing to look at.\n\n* On a related note, the world feels rather dull, lifeless, and sad. Yes I know it is a post-apocalyptic setting. Other games take place in a post-apocalypse and manage to make it lively and fun in their own way. Video games are supposed to be fun and exciting. In 11 hours of play I have encountered very few life forms and the ones I have are not interesting in any way to interact with.\n\n* I take a major issue with the game's design. My first couple of hours were frustrating as I had to do tech upgrades just to get any vertical movement at all. You do realize it isn't realistic to say that a hot air balloon can't manage to elevate itself by 5 feet to get to an unreachable area. An easy fix for this would be to just start the airship off with one turbine already built. \n\n* Another related aspect of the design I take issue with: I don't think any progress of the game happening upward is even necessary. You could, like Subnautica, have progression move downwards into the toxic fog, but the game was designed to prevent this, since the underworld loads separately and is limited to indoor, on-foot areas. A HUGE missed opportunity in my opinion and despite the game being in early access, I'm sure this aspect of the games design is set in stone by now.

There is much potential and it can be quite fun, however it is very unpolished yet. Here are some examples:\n\nThe UI:\nThe UI is a mess. You cannot place markers and lose orientation very quickly. If you place ressources [spoiler](eg. inside the lift to the underdust)[/spoiler] and fly away to gather other ressources you need, you will probably not find your way back. Also all objects on your radar are squeezed to the border and it is very hard to distinguisch them. The unability to zoom doesn't make it better. The Databank delivers very little infromation, sparing out the information you really need [spoiler](e.g. that gastroenteritis virus can be extracted from dust lettuce).[/spoiler]\n\n- Ressources:\nRessource grinding can be very annoying. You need tons of synthetics only to put three room pieces together with plastic walls. If you use synthetic fuel, it will be burned faster than a paper plane in a crucible.\nOther fuels are more effective, but the ressources needed are very rare. Furthermore you can make yourself comfortable with cruising around for hours to get the ingredients for one freakin' booster.\n\n-Questline:\nThe questline seems broken. There are passages skipped by whatever trigger. [spoiler]At a certain point you will be promted to visit three infected greenhouses. After the second one it suddenly skipped and told me to craft some holographic thingummybob at the workstation I did not yet have. So I got the workstation first, but had no blueprint to go on. Revisiting a infected greenhouse didn't make it either, because there was no computer left there to get data (and maybe the bp) from. [/spoiler]\n\n-Powering:\nWhy do some devices need power where others don't. And why is the battery sucked out so fast. I cannot even recharge three tools without changing the batteries of the charger. And why can you craft crystal batteries, but not solid state bateries?\nYes you can say it is easier to get SSBs, but it is easy to get polymer-ingots, too but you have a recipe for that. \n\n-World Design:\nLooks very great at the first view. But you will soon realize that there are all the same buildings over and over again. Hunting for all blueprints you need, makes the game very repetitive.\n\n-Others:\nThe official wiki is outdated and delivers false information.\n\nEDIT:\nforgot to mention, that the perfomance is poor because there are way too much particles to be rendererd.

I compare it to both of these games in part because of rafts scrap floating by mechanics and subnoticas tech progression. \nMaps are randomly spawned in POIs that you fly to and from with a light that you can power down to know if you have been there or not yet. Most things have more then one use, and in some cases I ended up using them for the wrong thing for the story, and needed to go hunt down more of it. this isn't bad however, it just lets you learn what you need and how to use it. POIs do have varied types with larger ones seeming to spawn less then smaller, and it is possible to miss upgrade scans. thankfully it has a bit of a codex to tell you what to look for and what POI type you want to visit for it.  I got auto extractors pretty late in the game, and thus I was alwase low on synthetic material and had a excess of batteries. With upgraded ones that focus on the flying debris, I could trade batteries for multiple stacks, and used them a a sort of auto turret to prevent damage from said debris while flying. \nthe story is a little scant, but I also may have skipped some stuff by accident. \n it has a build system that you can make complex without being overly confusing, and supports large base building if you want it. I kept mine relatively small. unlike subnotica there is no central power or fuel system, and you cant recharge batteries, but anything you put on your ship that makes it fly just integrates no matter where it is. \nThe only two complaints is that sometimes it is very hard to find what is damaged on the ship, and for whatever reason it would revert my saved graphics settings from medium to epic. while my computer can ruin it at max, its a lot more fluid at lower settings.

And you know, the story is fine. It's not bad. But listen. Listen to me. Look me in the eyes. This game is not about that. This game, is about taking your little magic airship building gun, and building little rooms and platforms with it. and then deleting them and making new ones because you got a new balloon on your airship and it totally threw everything off but now you can make more rooms anyway. and it is about putting up little airship posters in your little airship bedroom. And then going outside and shooting one hundred million stupid plastic balls out of the stupid sky because you built too many stupid railings and now you're out of synthetics. Anyway. That is the purpose of this game, and it fulfills that purpose, and does it well. 100/10, would shoot plastic balls out of the sky again.\n\nThat said, there ARE some things that could be improved. First of all, I could use more airship building options but that almost goes without saying. In particular double doors and railing gates would be good (unless they already exist and I just haven't found the blueprints yet, in which case, carry on). Also, some sort of trash can or at least the ability to drop items in the world would be extremely welcome. Inventory management in this game is, in my opinion, overly onerous. Some easy tweaks would improve this, and I hope to see such tweaks in future updates. Other quality of life improvements I'd like to see would be the ability to queue multiple crafts, and some way of tracking which locations on the map you have already visited. There are also some graphical and performance issues (in particular, the [spoiler]elevator to the underdust[/spoiler] stutters noticeably every time I use it, and sometimes when using the deck cannon my character's clothes wander off to the side).\n\nFinally. Combat. Many people have requested this and I see that it is in the roadmap (er, flightmap). Respectfully... bullshit. Every game has combat. You can play other games if you want to fight monsters. Almost literally any other game that exists, actually. This game doesn't need combat, I don't need it, I don't want it, please don't add any type of mandatory combat to this game.

I'm talking more than just Underdust here: explorable buildings, to be able to get out and wander across those mountains, set up bases, build, etc. To be Subnautica requires being able to build those kinds of experiences in a different world where a lot of stuff won't work; to be NMS requires something else entirely.\n\nThat's the kind of experience that has longevity, but I don't know what's really planned.\n\nBut it's fun.

The game starts with a tutorial where you build your basic airship frame with a cockpit and one room and you go from there. You visit several different locations, that are somewhat differentiated in tiers to gather resources, find blue prints for building, and advance the story.\n\nPros:\n\nThe overall world design is cool, and the graphics look amazing. You do really feel that the world below is toxic and you are barely surviving by hoping from one location to the other. Building is nice, the game gives you a lot of tools to build your airship, as well as a good set of decorative items to place to really make it feel homely.\n\nThe survival aspects are there, but not annoying. Raft has this problem where you are surviving constantly, meaning the game itself is constant stress because either the shark messes with you, seagulls annoy you, or you are constantly either thirsty or starving. In Forever Skies it is more balanced, and by advancing the game you can make things that make your life surviving easier. As it should be.\n\nThere aren't a lot of threats, and imho that is a good thing. Right now it is the perfect balance of surviving while not being constantly pestered by all sorts of things that are just annoying to deal with.\n\nCons:\n\nThe story is short. I moved through the story in one long evening (5 hours), and then I spend about ten more hours to get all the blueprints, and build my airship to maximum cozyness. The game needs more POIs to find, but also a longer story, and perhaps more reasons to descend beneath the toxic cloud.\n\nA bit of of jank. Just a tiny bit though. Movement on foot and especially jumping is a tad bit janky, but that its not that bad. I had worse.\n\nIt also does not seem very optimised, as my graphics card was on full blast in 1440p locked at 60pfs. But I had neither any stutters nor FPS drops.\n\nImprovements:\n\nLateral movement for the airship. You have yaw, up and down, forward and backward; but sadly no straight left to right (lateral) movement. Would be cool to have.\n\nMore things to do place inside the airship, as 3x6 airship was more than enough for me to have all the storage I ever needed, plus all production. I have seen people build these huge airships, but there is sadly no point yet. Perhaps indoor farms?\n\nA way to make food last longer. I know the freezer exists, but it would be nice to have a can \"presser\" where you press cooked food into a tin can using metal.\n\nOn board water storage. Give us these huge blue barrels that contain sap so we can store fresh water on the ship. Or better yet, a water cooler.\n\nCoop: so I can throw my friend off my airship into the toxic death below.\n", "timestamp_created": 1688315830, "timestamp_updated": 1688315830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857918381690979004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "154109048": {"recommendationid": "154109048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198882401336", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1176, "last_played": 1703473071}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fantastic. Similar to Subnautica, the landscape is visually stunning and the entire survival fundamentals function well for the genre. Forever Skies displays a lot of promise for being an Early Access title. I've really enjoyed my playthrough, but I've encountered some challenges that can make the game difficult at times:\n\n1. There is no auto-save function. I've encountered a few game crashes from frame drops mainly when taking the elevator. It's sad when I lose 10-15 minutes of progress without an auto-save function because i forgot to save manually. \n\n2. The ability to filter Map icons. Unless you plan to just pick a direction and go with the flow, the entire circumference of the map is littered with overlapping icons. \n\n3. Organic replenishment. This is more of a question as I haven't really been paying close attention to whether a plant or nut regrows after harvest. I have returned to previously visited Greenhouse rigs and haven't found any new growth, but it may have been too soon. If this feature is not implemented, I'd love for the opportunities to grow our own from seeds in planting beds. \n\n4. Linear gameplay. As the player unlocks and upgrades their ship, more towers become available to the player, but most of these upgrades and unlocks are hidden within the main story quest. This is fine, but I'd prefer to take my own path. I'm at a point in the main story where my progression is halted until I find some more honey...so now I have to go on another journey to explore new towers I haven't already visited. \n\n5. Asset replication. I think I've explored the same metal box a few dozen times. The same two lockers on the ground laying on their sides. This isn't really a challenge, but more a complaint. The only reason to explore these areas is to take advantage of the number of crafted resources you can find, i.e. circuit boards/polymer. \n\n6. Player/Environment Interaction. As I continue to build/expand my ship, both horizontally and vertically, I've noticed the increasing challenge to maneuver my vehicle for rig docking as even the smallest branch sticking out from a greenhouse is enough to bring me to a complete halt. Most rigs have between 1-3 circular docking areas large enough to fit a moderately sized ship and hovering with a docking ramp can only get you so close. It would be nice to craft a smaller vehicle for better maneuverability in tight spaces. \n\n7. Gameplay loop. Others have mentioned the monotonous loop and it's true to some degree. Each type of tower rig contains the same resources, which is good if you're targeting a particular resource, but ultimately you're just flying from rig to rig chasing resources. Occasionally you do find a blueprint or poster, but I always strip every rig down to the bare bones and walk away with another 100 glass I probably don't need. This leads me to the final challenge. \n\n8. Early game hoarding is discouraged. Storage boxes have 9 spaces and resources can stack to 1x, 10x, 25x, and 100x, depending on the resource. I'm assuming I'll be able to upgrade the boxes later, but it's hard to hoard anything when I can only stack rarer resources to 10. Why do plants have their own inventory slot? This is a problem when you introduce a perishable timer on every organic matter. Until I found the cold storage blueprints I was unable to keep anything organic for fear of spoiling. \n\nChallenges aside, Forever Skies is extremely fun and I plan to visit most if not every tower rig. The seasonal event adds a nice touch as well. Looking forward to the next development.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1703222475, "timestamp_updated": 1703474486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857137024402618408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140886531": {"recommendationid": "140886531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015258616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 699, "last_played": 1708214766}, "language": "english", "review": "Some say this has a \"raft\" feel to it, but I have not played raft, however subnautica is a great analogue to compare from, that started with enough content to keep you busy for a while then as content dropped, It got even better - Forever Skies gives me the same feeling I got from subnautica - I cannot wait for more updates and as the game stands, yes far far from complete but still enough to whet the appetite.

It's a beautiful title that explores some genuinely new ideas and has wonderful game-design sensibilities.\n\nAs of writing this review, I've played it fully through twice now, at different stages of EA, The first playthrough was admittedly a bit rougher around the edges, but it felt like a fair amount of content, and a ton of potential. I had a blast with it, right up till the moment the story ended.\n\nI've come back after a while (not really sure when I bought it), and noticed there was some new content. So I played it from the beginning again. I'm glad I did - there were a lot of mechanical (and some story) changes that I admire. This is a team that's unafraid of revisiting their design choices and exploring new paths. There is also another \"chapter\" to the story, which I find progressively more enticing the more I explore the world.\n\nIt currently struggles a bit with performance issues. This is understandable, as the team is focusing on design and content before optimization. So it's poorly optimized at the moment. I am able to enjoy it fully, but I have fairly decent hardware. If you're threading the minimum specs, know that there will probably be some extra turbulence on your flights. That said, I've experienced virtually no situations (in the story thus far) where good framerates mattered for gameplay. It's a pretty chill experience.\n\nThis gives me major Subnautica vibes (though replace thalassophobia with acrophobia). The comparison doesn't just end there though - they are both fairly chill in terms of survival elements. Both deliver their stories through wonderfully cryptic data logs and such, Both have an interesting \"alien\" world to explore. I suppose one big difference is there's nowhere near as much wildlife in Forever Skies, But it's got it's own unique charms instead.\n\nI highly recommend!\n\nEdit: I rarely review games.

This was originally meant to be a standard patch with a few quality-of-life updates, bug fixes, and some additional in-game posters added-in to wrap it all up.\n\nHowever, our eagle-eyed QA team caught a few instances of something that might impact a few players with more advanced airship builds. So it was decided to run more tests before committing the fixes, but because we already had these posters ready, we thought we might as well put them into the game. It\u2019s a quick and easy thing to add so no point waiting.\"\n\nThe QOL changes mentioned are coming in the next few weeks, but we saw no reason to keep players waiting as the posters were ready.\n\nIn the post I mentioned, we have also left sneak peeks of our next major update (expected soon).

All I have to say is that those people either aren't used to indie games, or they rushed through every quest marker as fast as possible while completely ignoring the exploration and base-building in this game.  Both elements are a complete joy and though I'm excited for more content in the future, it's [b]100% playable as-is.[/b]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nHaving said that... there are [i]a few[/i] issues that could use a little refinement/QOL improvements that would make this great game even better.  The devs addressed most of my biggest issues (storage space and stacking, the \"synthetic grind\" killing my soul, and fabrication costs), but here are a few more things that I feel would really improve the experience for players:\n\n[b][u]1.  Storms do WAY too much damage [/u][/b]\n\nThis is my biggest gripe with the game, hands down.  It's incredibly frustrating, and could be the difference in me putting a couple hundred hours into this game or quitting in frustration in another day or three.  \n\n- During every storm, the lighting completely WRECKS my entire airship, including my high-cost equipment (indoors and out) as well as the airship itself (indoors and out).  \n\n- This is especially true for players like me who geek out for hours and hours on big builds, and therefore have to stay parked for a long time in resource-rich but dangerous areas.\n\n- The biggest issue is that there is no safe place to \"park\" a while for those who want to [i]seriously[/i] build or overhaul their airship without having to:\n\na. stop what you're doing and make 875446889743 repair patches every ten minutes (using half the resources you just gathered and needed for your build) \n\nor \n\nb. make a mad dash to the console to fly away from the storm (which is impossible sometimes mid-build/upgrade since you had to pick it up for said build/upgrade).  \n\n- Adding a spot for the players who are build-intensive at resource-heavy locations (or even consistently safe/calm areas in the sky to hang out while we build without having everything we just made undone by lighting strikes) would be a really enormous QOL improvement.  \n\n- An option to turn OFF storm damage for those who [i]only[/i] want to build would be even better, or even a \"creative\" mode with no damage and no huger/thirst/health concerns :)\n\n[b][u]2.  Plant spoilage rate is FAR too fast (and the cooker/fabricator speeds are far too slow). [/u][/b]\n\nConsidering how many plants can be collected at each greenhouse location and the limited uses for them, the rate that the plants spoil at means that over 90% of the plants you collect while exploring expire while you're still crafting/cooking them unless you return to your airship every time you pick up 2-3 plants (which is incredibly tedious, no one wants to do that). This has severely hindered my desire to even visit the greenhouses - I would honestly rather catch 1000 dust lettuce/dust moths with the crappy lure than go through all the steps required to craft the advanced or unique ones just to have the plants spoil before I can even get the lures fabricated by the time I get back to my airship.\n\n[i]*Note: I do realize there is a freezer in the game that is supposed to prevent this from happening, but in 45 hours I have yet to come across it.  Having the freezer (also other tech, see below) be accessible much earlier or in a more obvious location might resolve this issue and incentivize players to explore more greenhouses and/or use more plants in crafting.[/i]\n\n* Edit to add:  I found the freezer.  It does nothing at all, and everything still spoils just as fast. :(  \n\n[b][u]3.  The location of certain tech isn't clearly defined or even hinted at, making important or desirable tools pretty hard to find. [/u][/b]\n\nI had no idea where to even begin to find the workstation (windmill?  greenhouse?  underdust?) However, blueprints that require the workstation begin showing up in your blueprints menu from nearly the first radio tower or two.  \n\n- Giving players some sort of hint on how to find the tech they want or need, or hiding the blueprints/uses/etc for that tech until you obtain it, would avoid some confusion and frustration.\n\n[b][u]4.  The UI text size cannot be adjusted at all, is next-to-impossible to read in several menus, and the text/background color schemes on nearly all of the UI interfaces are VERY hard to see. [/u][/b]\n\nThis one is kinda important, especially for visually impaired people (I am not, but it's still very very hard for me to see the UI text!) \n\n- Playing with a PC connected to a television greatly exacerbates this issue.  I often have NO IDEA what the main UI says since the sky/background/etc is often the exact same shade of blue as the text for basic in-game messages (i.e., \"food has cooked,\" or \"lure has caught a thing,\" etc).  \n\nWorse yet, the \"[i][b]extremely light green text on slightly lighter green background[/b][/i] color scheme in the menu tab that tells you about the locations and the resources you find at them is basically unreadable (for anyone on any screen). \n\n- Adding some accessibility options that enlarge text size/change text color for all UIs in the game would be wonderful!!\n\n- Even just making the text in all menus and UIs a bit bigger/darker would go a long way, and is likely a pretty easy fix until accessibility options can be optimized :)\n\n[b][u]5.  There is no option for a glass door. [/u][/b]\n\nThis is just my OCD, but with an entirely glass airship that looks AMAZING in all glass, the metal doors stick out like a sore thumb (and are kinda ugly, sorry!)\n\n- While we're on doors, a wider or double door option would also be killer!  The amount of things we have to put on catwalks outside is kind of a lot: water collection units, insect catchers, extractors up to and including the extra-enormous but [b][i][u]COMPLETELY FANTASTIC IN EVERY SINGLE OTHER WAY[/u][/i][/b] auto extractor (thank you!!!!!!!), etc - means I often run into the doors/equipment or get stuck outside on/between/behind the equipment when trying to enter my airship.\n\n- Side note that the railings for the catwalks are too tall for the extractors and too tall for the player character to jump over ;)\n\n[b][u]6.  Thank you for the increased inventory space OMG what a huge improvement!!!  But hear me out... INVENTORY FUNCTIONS THOUGH!!!! [/u][/b]\n\n- I would KILL for an auto-sort function, a hot-deposit function would be awesome, and a build from storage function is essential for build geeks ;)\n\n[b][u]7.  The story is pretty sparse (but this is to be expected in EA). [/u][/b]\n\n- I don't play survivalcraft/base building games specifically for the story per se (and I assume more story and lore are in the works anyway) but this world you've created is SO COOL!  \n\nI want to learn more about it... \n\nOverall, I think great story with a lot of surprises, reveals, or twists (etc) would hook me [i]even more[/i] into this already great game.  \n\n- Adding some element of secrets/hidden locations/mysteries for the extra-curious, extra-observant, or extra-diligent to find [i]might[/i] mean I never do anything other than play Forever Skies again XD\n\n[h1]Thank you so very very much for all your hard work, you've made a wonderful game and I am excited to see more added to it!![/h1]\n\n(edit: format errors)", "timestamp_created": 1690038059, "timestamp_updated": 1691890271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732310950756072998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140508276": {"recommendationid": "140508276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045453755", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1303, "last_played": 1687402678}, "language": "english", "review": "Very solid game for early access.

Part of it is a quite awkward UI, which seems to just slow you down and get in the way, but its deeper than that. You are flooded with basic resources which takes away any feeling of progression or difficulty, and the trivial but time delayed method by which you get them ends up rendering the basic game-play loop a chore rather than a challenge. Research is almost instantaneous, which again detracts from any feeling of achievement when you finally unlock stuff. \n\nYour airship gets damaged by randomly floating debris which you can do little about since its largely everywhere and the way the building system is setup often means you are quite often hunting around your ship trying to find which part has been damaged, which ends up feeling mechanically like tedium that is just getting in the way of you playing the game. Locations that you visit are largely identical with minor variations. Food and water is so plentiful that it makes the whole hunger / thirst system seem largely pointless. \n\nVisually the game is quite nice, and I love this genre, but unfortunately the core game design is just so far off the mark that I don't see much hope for this game developing into something great down the track - although I hope I am wrong.

I wanted to be on something that would be my traveling home, my lifeline and my vehicle of exploration. Obviously I turned to Subnautica and Below Zero and as always they were excellent. I started searching for similar games which brought me to Forever Skies. This game is exactly what I was looking for and in many ways it captures that feeling better than Subnautica ever did. It all comes down to the sheer necessity of my mobile home. In Subnautica I can build a base and live there (which is great fun!) and never REALLY need my Cyclops submarine. A base and a seamoth will do just fine. But in Forever Skies, your airship is your life. You depend on it for everything. There you must cook, eat, drink, sleep, craft, store items, research and explore. You have to keep an eye on damage and fuel. You develop a daily routine. Get up, make water, make sure you have bait ready to go to \"fish\" for the big moths that fly around in the dangerous wastes below (I can't tell you how horrific it sounds to subsist on a diet of boiled moths!). The ship becomes your place in the world. It becomes the primary character in the game and you get to know every inch of it because you designed it from scratch.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is amazing. You get up and walk outside onto the catwalk you've built and the wind sounds almost like a raging ocean. You go back inside and close the doors and the sound is muffled, serving as a psychological reprieve from the horrors outside. You suddenly feel safe in your flying fortress.\n\nAt first I had a very small airship and I was happy with it. It had everything I needed and I knew my way around perfectly. But the game pressures you to upgrade. You see your airship can only go so high (and so low), yet many of the platforms with life-saving materials and loot are too high for you to reach. So you have to upgrade your balloon which also allows you to build a bigger platform underneath. With the bigger platform comes more storage and amenities and room to breath. I've just finished upgrading my airship to what I'll call \"phase two\" and even though it's very simple and functional I'm proud of it. I visualized it and built it and it's my own. I don't want to turn this review into a comparison to  Subnautica because I love that game too, but let's face it, aside from some limited interior design and custom placement of storage lockers, etc., my Cyclops is exactly like your Cyclops and everyone else's who ever played that game. Not so with my Forever Skies airship.\n\nI could go on and on about how much I love this game and the feeling it gives me when I play, but I don't really know where to begin or end. You get the picture.\n\nOf course it is early access and there are some rough spots but none that have bothered me too much. I complained to the devs about the lack of rebinding options for the keyboard but that was fixed in the experimental branch. The game actually updated before I started writing this so maybe those changes have come to the main release itself. In truth, as the game stands now, it feels very polished, EA or no EA.\n\nThe immersion factor is superb and the ship is amazing. I've become addicted to this game world and I know as the development increases it will only get better. I'm sure many others have said this but I'll say it too: if you love Subnautica you'll love forever Skies.", "timestamp_created": 1689180610, "timestamp_updated": 1689181006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.66669774055480957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148347821": {"recommendationid": "148347821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312669363", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 403, "last_played": 1705720462}, "language": "english", "review": "I just think it's a really cool game is all.

From the story, to the world and exploration, you can't play Forever Skies without thinking of Subnautica. \n\nInstead of being under the ocean though, you are in the sky. You get command of your own airship within the first 15 minutes of the game. Flying the airship feels a lot like the larger 'Cyclops' submarine from Subnautica - but in Forever Skies even the hull/frame of the airship is modular and customizable giving even more personalization. \n\nEven the world and exploration gives extreme Subnautica vibes. In this world, there are these radio/beacon stations that contain valuable resources and recipes for you to collect which you can use later to craft. These stations are littered about the world, very similar to the sunken parts of the spaceship in Subnautica.\n\nJust like Subnautica, you start the game with limited resources. You gather resources throughout your exploration, and you gather recipes to create better things. There's a tool for scanning, crafting, gathering, there's even a few weapons. As you explore you learn more about the world, and the people on it. \n\nI almost feel bad comparing it to Subnautica so much - the story is quite unique and surviving the harsh environments in the game is also quite different from Subnautica. But the inspiration is clear, and the mechanics are similar enough that one can't talk about this game for more than a minute without mentioning ... Subnautica.\n\nIs this game fun? Yes, it is way more fun than the game should be. To me, this proves that the Subnautica 'formula' can be applied to other environments/themes quite successfully. \n\nThe main pain-points for me are similar to that of most other early access games. There are performance improvements that need to be made (especially on the planets surface). Some of the UI could be a bit more clear, specifically the part where you navigate the discovered information about the lore/tech/etc. \n\nThere is also the issue of amount of content currently present in the game.\n\nRight now, you can get through the entire game in about 6 - 10 hours of gameplay. But when you reach the conclusion of the current content there is a message from the devs saying \"this is only the start\".\n\nSo is it worth playing? If you have exhausted Subnautica completely and you are going crazy looking for something similar - I would say YES this is worth playing! \n\nIf you are looking for something with more than 6 - 10 hours of game time, then I would recommend smacking the wish-list button and checking back in after a few more updates! \n\nI do not regret my purchase at all, the time I have spent in the game was fantastic and I look forward to the future of Forever Skies.\n\nFollow me on Twitch at www.twitch.tv/killerham", "timestamp_created": 1687899487, "timestamp_updated": 1687899487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630915820598602295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156773213": {"recommendationid": "156773213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072197369", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 558, "last_played": 1706357481}, "language": "english", "review": "An interesting concept, but nothing like ready for real-world play; there's really not very much to do, and what there is tends to be quite repetitive.\n\nPart of me feels bad for giving an early-access game a thumbs down, but there are three specific things about the game that to me represent actual developer decisions and are thus unlikely to change as the title develops: they are -\n\n1: Long press\nI hate long press (where you have to hold down a button for a certain period of time to activate a function) with a passion - just by itself it nearly ruined No Man's Sky for me, and I regard it as a serious error of judgment by any developer who tries to use it.\n\n2: Overdone survival mechanics\nAlmost half your time in this game is spent repetitively feeding and hydrating yourself, exacerbated by a regular need to sleep that drains both food and water. There is \"survival mechanics\", and then there is \"tedium\", and this game is definitely in the latter category.\n\n3: Really bad UI decisions\nAs an example of this, if you want to move a storage box, you have to empty it first. Want to put in a new window? You have to remove anything you've placed near it (not necessarily actually attached to it - just near it). And the inventory! Oh lord, it's awful! It's tiny, and there are plenty of things that don't stack. You will spend a lot of time in this game shuffling your inventory around, and I loathe inventory-shuffling.\n\nThere are actually other aspects of the game that annoy me too, but they are mostly things that could be ironed out during early access. The three things above, though, are game-killers for me. \n\nIf they can fix these things and polish the rest, I'll happily change my rating to thumbs-up, because there is some real potential here...

Hard to believe this game is still in Early Access.  Likely the content amount will need to keep growing, but the quality of gameplay itself at this stage is better than some fully released games I've bought.  As an avid Subnautica player, I can indeed confirm the many comments from other players supporting similarities, especially in the need for subtle, finesse style of driving (flying vs piloting i guess) your main vehicle (not the small one in Subnautica, but the sub).  However, this game is quite creative in concept, and fundamentally different to Subnautica in that Subnautica vehicles cannot substantially be changed (except for adding a few things such as storage, farming, and a few installations of system upgrades and weapons which none in itself drastically change the sub's shape or form, just what it can do).\n\nIn Forever Skies your airship (think of a huge, moddable Zeppelin) is basically as upgradeable and flexible as you want it to be (as your Subnautica fixed bases basically, but in here you take the base with you!).   The fact that your buildable base is also your transport changes quite a bit the game.  It's I guess what I wished my sub could have been in subnautica, as if the little drone thing could have slowly grown into the sub, and later a massive sub base which obviously would have not fit in the internal caves but you get the point.  Floating around the clever version of the virus infected world in FS is such a different experience to most games i've played.  The airbase does require some large mass movement control to manage, and to approach the many buildings critical to story progression does require finesse and proper flying, not just simple AI-controlled approaches as in other games.  Then there's the thrill of using some key tools reserved for outdoors, near the ship edge type of tools (like a \"fishing\" device that uses lures to procure food from lower altitudes not safe to fly) that put you near the edge of your ship and test your fear of altitude in an interesting way.\n\nAll in all a really pleasant experience for explorers/crafters/base builders.  Even better, as I mentioned the quality of implementation so far is vastly superior to a good number of fully released games I've bought.  Now, my rig is fairly powerful, so regarding compute needs all i can say is that with a good PC the game plays smooth and looks beautiful.  No bugs found yet (aside from what my fishing lures catch, lol).  Cant wait for full release to see what else the developers throw in.

There's a solid skeleton here, but it needs a lot more meat on its bones before it gets a thumbs-up from me. \n\nCompared to other early access games, Forever Skies is very well polished. Even on launch day, I only noticed a handful of bugs in my 6 hours of playtime, all minor interface issues that were easily remedied. The game looks good, the airship design mechanics work well, and exploring the world feels natural. I caught a couple of tools that seemed to be missing their sound effects, and spotted at least one spelling mistake in the interface, but that still puts it in the \"exceeds expectations\" category for me.  \n\nWhile the content is polished, though, there just isn't a lot of it. Six hours was enough for me to reach the end of the story, and that was at a rather leisurely pace. About a third of that consisted of puttering about over a ruined city, landing atop various towers, looting them for resources, and generally having a blast. Another third was dedicated to inventory management, shooting mining lasers at alien tumbleweeds, and using the resources thus gained to craft more small boxes to help manage my inventory. \n\nThe last third of the game involved docking my ship at a big tower and exploring a cramped and confusing dungeon area. At this point, the free-roaming gameplay I'd been enjoying was replaced with a simple, tedious loop: \n1. Go down the elevator.\n2. Run around until I hit a barrier.\n3. Grab or scan something nearby. \n4. Go up the elevator to research the thing.\n5. Repeat. \n\nParts of it were visually stunning, but being on a 100-second oxygen timer meant I was scrambling to and fro too fast to really appreciate it. After a few cycles of this, the end arrived without much fanfare. I could return to the clouds and set sail again in search of new furniture or compartments, but I'd run out of truly novel content. Compared to other games in the genre, it felt like I ran out of road right when it should be starting to get good. \n\nRight now, Forever Skies feels like a pitch for the game the developers want to make. There are lots of hooks that aren't really expanded on, indications of what content might arrive in the future, but what's there now is just enough to whet the appetite. I very much like the look of that future game, and hope to see it come to fruition. \n\nIf you just can't wait to sink your teeth into a surprisingly robust demo, and you don't mind gambling a decent chunk of your money to do so, you might consider picking up Forever Skies now. If not, I still suggest keeping this game on your wishlist and following its future development.

It looks good, they have obviously spent some time with the animations and art, it also seems to run decently (at least on my current rig, was pushing 4k ultra with no real issues, with other background tasks running). The story is interesting enough for the type of game it is, its not doing anything revolutionary but its a tried and true way to push the exploration aspects of the game along enough to keep you going in the right direction in its current state. So for the Pros I think its a nice addition to the category from what I've seen so far and if you like this type of game I think its going to be worth playing.\n\n***Cons as of right now that I've notice:\n-the movement feels a bit sluggish, almost like you are walking in fluid unless you are \"sprinting\", and your stamina gauge runs out very fast when you are sprinting. Getting off ladders is also quite hazardous since you tend to move backward some as you are getting off them, if you are on some small pipe or near a ledge this could cause a lot of issues.\n\n-the air ship is the main selling point here, like the raft in Raft or the sub in Subnautica, it makes sense that it would be a little floaty since its a blimp, but honestly a little more responsive handling would be nice.\n\n-Interacting with objects can be a bit cumbersome, a lot have hitboxes that are quite small so you can't interact with them easily, it also feels like you have to be a bit too close to everything.\n\n-I think they are looking to add farming into the game (similar to Subnautica) and that would be nice as it would make the numerous plants easier to deal with for all the crafting/nutrition needs and give you more reason to build out your sky ship. However it would be nice with the harvesting if you either didn't use stamina with the knife OR you used far less. Constantly having to wait while you character gets out of breath after swinging the knife just a few times isn't great, makes for harvesting bio materials a slog.\n\n-Storage improvements would be great. The stacking sizes are quite low as well as the storage box sizes. I don't know if this is \"realism\" seeping in, but good storage is always a QOL aspect that makes games far more enjoyable. I'm sure they are looking to add larger containers as something to craft, and it seems some slightly better storage, but the storage gets out of hand very quick with the various things that for some reason don't stack (such as the plants) and having very small stack sizes of some things that you find quite a bit of early on. Making stack sizes far larger would be nice and a greater option for storage in the beginning of the game, even if you have to collect more materials. If nothing else having tons of boxes on the floor makes the game harder to play just when dealing with walking around your ship since they don't stack or attach to walls.\n\n-Stacking food would also be great, as well as some sort of crafted fridge to keep things fresh. I don't personally mind the survival aspects of eating and drinking, but filling up your precious inventory with food always gets frustrating in games. I know its hard to balance the food spoiling things with stacks, but a sweet spot would be nice, maybe have some sort of \"preservative\" material that you can use to craft lasting food that you could then stack in some way. Stacking the old rations like any of the other old food would be nice also since they are another thing that takes up space. But this is part of the storage issues from before.\n\n-Recycling built objects would be nice. We already have the tool for it might as well make use of it. When I got to the point where I could make the storage shelves and larger boxes I had more than a few boxes full of small boxes. Yes you could throw them overboard, but it would be nice to get the resources back (even some) that were spent on them OR possibly having an option to use them to make some of the larger containers like you can when making the larger water bottle or upgrading other items.\n\n-Maybe some hints on what the missing research items come from. I just happened to miss one and didn't realize what it was I was looking for because I thought the thing I had passed was something I already knew about. Had to backtrack because I was missing materials to progress. In this case it was a barrel I believed was just another thing with polluted water because it wasn't very well labeled, and wasn't overly obvious to be something new, but turned out to be something important. \n\n\nI've seen the devs responding in forums so they seem to care about what people are saying and wanting to make their game enjoyable so far. Thats a good sign, but lets see where it goes. I think the modders will have a time with this game, but I would prefer the actual devs to put out something great to start without relying on such things like the AAA devs seems to do these days (***Bethesda***).", "timestamp_created": 1687715025, "timestamp_updated": 1688138729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608192741870880127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "154349239": {"recommendationid": "154349239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333621998", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 1286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1286, "last_played": 1703484113}, "language": "english", "review": "So the game is cool and all, and I recommend it because it's a pleasant experience, however it does leave a lot to be desired.\n\nFirst of all, some of the stuff you see in the trailer almost never happens, or it does happen, but you were expecting something different from the trailer.\n\nNavigation is quite clunky, but you get used to it. Gameplay is also quite repetitive, with places repeating and just having variations. Honestly, I would hope the places weren't generated automatically, and were hand-crafted but fewer in number.\n\nThe biggest issue is really the building mechanics. Just an example, you cannot change a floor (from metal to glass let's say) if it has stuff on it. So you have to move all the stuff first, change the floor, then move them back on it. In general, building is such a hassle that I almost avoided it. Also, by building a bigger ship navigation becomes even clunkier than before, and you can't even see what part is colliding with the environment. So I prefered building a smaller ship. Which goes against what you see in the trailer (ie a ship with two floors etc). Though it's possible to do that, I dunno why you would do it.\n\nIn general that game has made some choices for gameplay and stuff that really need some fleshing up, or reconsidering.\n\nOh, also, it required my computer to be set on the lowest graphics, and it still lagged or even crashed occasionally, and I got a good machine - not ultra, but it shouldn't have had any problems running in medium or high.

But there are aspects about this game that I am in love with!\n\nIf you're wonder what this game is like, it's basically Subnautica in the sky, with part of it on the surface of the planet. A thick toxic layer covers the planet and will kill you if you take your airship into the \"Dust\" below. \n\nThere are bases and outposts that litter the sky atop wind farms, comm towers, and skyscrapers where people tried to survive. In these location you can find needed items, tools, blueprints, and items to scan so you can learn about them or fabricate them for use.\n\nThere are several stations that do various jobs that you can place on your airship. There are currently several styles of furniture you can discover the blueprints for by going to all the locations. There are also old world relics left over and forgotten to time. These are placeable decoration and the computer's interpretation as to what they were for is sometimes comical, i.e. the football you find is most likely an item of \"worship.\"\n\nThere is already a fair amount of notes, logs, journal entries, mail, etc. that helps paint the lore, dispair, and conditions people were living in. Some of the items and messages are required for quest objectives. There is a very slight puzzle, if you could call it that, system where you have to figure out how to get around certain obstacles or get things to work such as doors and unpowered laptops. All can be solved by carefully searching the areas, reading messages laying around or crafting items. \n\nYou will acquire a scanner tool. Use this on anything you can. It will give you blueprints, lore, important info, and required knowledge and the ability to craft items. Try to explore ever square foot of a location for supplies, relics, and other useful things. Create crates to store the most valuable ones in.\n\nBUILDING THE AIRSHIP: You start out with a small humble airship to travel to other locations but as you do you pick up necessary materials and blueprints to expand the airship. You expand the ship using the Airship Tool which is basically the same as the builder tool if you've played Subnautica. It has a menu of compartments and part. All cost materials!\n\nCurrently I have managed to make a x4 ballon wide \"Quad Blimp\" with over 6,000 lbs of weight capacity. x6 Upgraded Engines and x4 Upgraded Turbines. .This gives me the max altitude attainable as well as the max speed and acceleration. \n\nThe airship takes damage from collisions with debris, structures, low altitude, and the horrific storms. Lightning is probably the single most dangerous thing in the game and the most costly to repair! Try to get next to a tall structure so that the lightning will strike it instead of you! You will have repair kits you can loot and craft too. You will use them as fast as you go through a pack of chewing gum. Loot everyone you can hold as you will need it. Same with fuel. Water and food can be caught extremely easily when you need to eat and drink so don't store a lot of it, especially if it will spoil. Only store purified or canned water and ration kits.\n\nSome people say the game isn't what it's worth but I disagree. I played both Subnauticas and many other similar survival games prom kickstarter to where they are today. This game has major potential! They're taking some of the best ideas, environmental concepts and base building ideas and putting them together. \n\nI will warn that this game currently is a gfx hog and can play very laggy on potato computer. I myself have a gtx 3080 and decided to play on high instead of epic quality which basically eliminates all lag. But it will no doubt be optimized in the future.

Ok that's the end of my weird little weather tangent lol.\n\nAs I progressed I did notice some flaws in the game, most notable after a while all the islands kinda just mesh together since apart from a few they all look and act about the same, fairly small, you land, spend a few minutes savaging for resources, then leave to go find the next one which usually looks very similar with only a few changes, which is fine, but I felt that after just a few hours of exploring I had seen everything there was to see on these islands, nothing new was there to excite me, I'd love more story elements, or little minigames, or just fun little unique things on some islands, but given that FS just came out in early access I'll give them a bit of slack since the game is genuinely fun despite that.\n\nAs I was playing through the game I also had their Discord open on the side to see what others were up to, and as I was going through the game I started to see people talking about how they had already finished the game or discovered all there was to be discovered, which surprised me, surely two days after release people can't be already beating the game? Can they? Well as I continued playing I soon found out that there wasn't quite as much content as I had initially thought, in just 9 hours I had \"Finished\" the game, while there were still minor things left to explore and the game doesn't technically have an end, I had finished all major parts of the game.\n\nWhile the game did indeed turn out to be short that doesn't mean it was bad, what was there was amazing, in fact some of my favorite games are those that are short but what they have are truly amazing, I had an amazing time with it and given that Forever Skies just came out I trust they'll add way more as the updates go on, but if you're planning on getting FS now just be aware of the fact that in it's current state it's rather short.", "timestamp_created": 1687470159, "timestamp_updated": 1687470159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595835864543914795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140787253": {"recommendationid": "140787253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006577539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1687868509}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fantastic so far.

I really do wish they waited to release this when they had more content in the game.  As I want to play more, but there is nothing left to do.  I'm still glad with my purchase, there just isn't enough content for the price.\n\nI finished the playable story at about 10 hours in, then spent the rest of my time getting all the upgrades, building everything and upgrading my balloons as big as they could be.  Played around with multi tiered ship building, got to a point where I had a pretty self sustainable  set up and then sadly ran out of things to do.\n\nI can already tell that when the 4 player mode comes out the game will be much more fun especially once the next plot progression is released.  I can't wait.\n\nHere are some things I wish they would update though....\n\n1.)  Make the compass device be a discoverable map device.  In that it shows you where you went and what you've seen (black out areas you haven't been to, color in areas you have).  I missed one storage container upgrade early on, and after spending an hour trying to back track to find it... I gave up.  If the world was more notable I wouldn't ask for this, but half the time you can't see due to a storm or it's dark, or it's the same looking area as places you been before... you get my drift..\n\n2.)  Allow us to que up multiple crafts of the same craft at a time.  When you have to make 20 plastic scraps and you can only make them 1 at a time, it takes you out of the game play and makes it less fun, not to mention has you ending up having to eat and drink due to the time passed.  (This could also be done with and upgrade to the processor if you didn't want it to be something anyone can start out doing)\n\n3.) Some crafts (like Polimer) have no animations, they just sit on the finished product image until it's done, then rotates. (I'm sure this will be fixed, just listing everything I found)\n\n4.) Voice acting to the notes.  I want to get immerse in the lore of the game, but some times I'm in say the under ground and am running out of air, or not wanting to sit around while my thirst and hunger are ticking away,  being able to que up the note for a Voice Actor to read it out would help me stay in the moment instead of having to stop and read on a screen that prevents me from continuing to play.  Same goes for the  notes you get for scanning something.  Having a voice actor (say the scanning device's programmed AI Voice?) tell me the info I just scanned instead of having me hold the tab button, stop playing, open a new screen, read the note, that's buried in this huge menu (which itself has bugs), then exit out of it just to keep playing bit of a buzz kill.\n\nAll this said... I am not disappointed in my purchase.  I will be eagerly waiting the next updates.  But in the current state of the early access, I would not advise others to get this game yet, unless they want to support the developers.
