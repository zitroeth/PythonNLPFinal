With their plans to combine all of their games under one universe, I\u2019m happy to support them.  They plan on releasing a world creator/workshop thing AND add even more content if all goes well.  People have issues with the split PC/mobile pricing and extensive (and logical) responses have been made.  Basically, they consider this a $20 game and I\u2019ve enjoyed playing it on both platforms.\n\nEdit: yet?", "timestamp_created": 1453386306, "timestamp_updated": 1453530135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 279, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.952640056610107422", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32107664": {"recommendationid": "32107664", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994596601", "num_games_owned": 1316, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4147, "last_played": 1498439476}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has been on my wishlist ever since I heard of the premise and especially after seeing the documentary on the making of this game.

I know the mobile version is probably good since Butterscotch is primarily a mobile developer but the PC version is top-notch as well.  It works great with both K&M and controller and looks glorious on my 4K 42\" monitor.\n\nThis is not a roguelike survival craft-em-up.  Rather, it is a RPG-lite craft-em-up with quests and a storyline.  You probably won't get as much replayability with it as much as those roguelike survival games, but I tend to drop those games after the first death or so.   Not so with this one.  The structured quests are always driving me towards my next goal instead of pottering around aimlessly.\n\nCrashlands - the game I would also be proud of if it was the last game I ever created.", "timestamp_created": 1496325606, "timestamp_updated": 1496407052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 110, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.899303734302520752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74031485": {"recommendationid": "74031485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132503739", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 549, "playtime_forever": 4426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4426, "last_played": 1596891221}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]My playtime:[/b] 73.8h (based on steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (~3 achievements).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (~29 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (~2 achievements).\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\n[i]Crashlands[/i] is a game where you have to gather resources, kill enemies, and craft items to defeat bosses.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- 4 difficulties\n- 3 game modes\n- Unique bosses\n- You can finish quests in any order that you want\n- A lot of craftable items, including the ones used for decoration purposes\n- Pets with different abilities\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Gear crafting is luck-based\n- Sometimes the game might feel too grindy\n- Too many gadgets and devices to choose from\n- Hardcore mode beats the point of the game\n- You need to wait for minutes to craft or hours to wait for a resource to respawn\n- Auto-lock tends to lose target\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like games where you have to gather resources, kill enemies, and craft things, this is your game. The game has some difficult achievements in the hardcore mode though so you might want to reconsider if you aim for 100% completion.[/i]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe designs are simple and clean. Most enemies are cute-looking and everything looks comical. I also liked the pet evolution screen that looked like [i]Pok\u00e9mon[/i], although it's executed differently.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe game has a unique storytelling. Instead of taking everything seriously, everyone talks nonchalantly and jokes around - even to the final boss. There were times when I had to reread the conversation twice though; sometimes it's kinda hard to get what they were talking about.\n\n[h1]The game[/h1]\n[b]Modes[/b]\nThe game has 3 game modes: story, hardcore, and creative. Story mode is the standard game where you will get an actual story and quests. Both hardcore and creative mode will be unlocked after you reach a certain point in the story mode.\n\nHardcore, on the other hand, is a story mode without quests and extra life. Yes, you have to restart the game if you accidentally die from an enemy. Since there is no story in this mode, I found that the recipe gathering took too much time. The perma-death also made the mode to be frustrating; it seems that it beats the purpose of the game where you have to take your time to craft the ultimate gear and explore the map.\n\nCreative mode isn't an actual game. It's more dedicated to those who want to get... creative. You have unlimited resources and no objective. You can either build your dream home base or draw something from the floor tiles or... anything.\n\n[b]Exploration[/b]\nThe game focuses on resource-gathering and exploration. You'll be thrown in a land, gather some resources, and craft new items from the said resources. The game has a very vast map and it's almost impossible to uncover everything. I was even surprised that the game ran smoothly even though I had revealed a lot of portion of the map; it only took longer to wait when I opened a map or traveled to a different land.\n\nThe game has 3 lands to explore. Each land has a unique theme, quests, crafted items - everything. It's as if you're playing the same game 3 different times before you finished the actual game.\n\n[b]Crafting[/b]\nYou can craft pieces of equipment, tools to gather better resources, and even decoration items that serve no purpose except to make your base looks better. Crafting becomes vital in the game if you want to do almost anything because you can only obtain most items by crafting.\n\nAlthough you can craft some items at the start, some items require a recipe to craft. In story mode, these recipes are dropped either from gathering resources, killing enemies or bosses, or completing quests. You will have all recipes from the start in creative mode and you can get the recipes from all but the latter in hardcore mode.\n\nCrafting takes time. There are some items where you have to wait for a few minutes to craft. I felt like I was playing a Facebook game because of this. Luckily, you don't need to wait that long in hardcore mode and you can also do other things while you wait.\n\n[b]Resource Gathering[/b]\nResource gathering takes time, especially if you don't know where to look for an item. The game might have a feature to track how many items that you need, but the game fails to tell you where you can get the said item. Even if you know where to get it, it might still take some time to gather since some items are not common in the land. There are even some resources that take hours to respawn.\n\n[b]Battles[/b]\nApart from resources that you can pick up, there are times where you have to battle enemies to gather resources. Some enemies are easy to beat, some might kill you if you're not careful. Each enemy has unique attack patterns and since you only have melee attack at the beginning of the game, you have to do your best to hit the enemy while dodging their attacks that are indicated by red marks.\n\nEnemies have a lot of variants of the same type. A higher variant will sometimes drop an egg that you can hatch and keep as your pet. There are also evolved variants that will drop some essences that you can use to evolve your pet. However, I found that the egg drop rate is very low, especially in the latter part of the game.\n\n[b]Equipment[/b]\nYou can only level up by switching gear. However, crafting gears are RNG-based; there are different qualities and bonus stats that will only be revealed after you craft them. Saving and loading become vital if you don't want to gather the resources again to get the best gear.\n\nThe game also has other items called gadgets and devices that you can place in your hotkey to use. These items have different effects - from hitting the enemy from a long distance to making you invulnerable for a few seconds. However, I found that there were too many of them and most of them were useless since you only need to get ranged items to kill end game enemies. I never bothered to test new items after I filled all of my hotkeys with the ranged ones.\n\n[b]Bosses[/b]\nThe game has 11 bosses with different attack patterns and element types. You also can't outgear the bosses in the hardest difficulty so you need to learn the attack pattern properly to finish the fight. Since it's risky to melee most bosses, I found that I ended up hitting all bosses with items in my hotkey slots from afar until they die. However, sometimes the auto-lock loses its target that I had to spam click on the bosses whenever I could to make sure that I didn't lose the target.\n\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\nThe game offers 4 difficulties that you can choose before you start the game. I played the game in the hardest difficulty and I didn't have any problem with it. The monsters take a long time to kill though; it might even take minutes to kill a stronger monster than your level. You also can die in 1 hit by an enemy that is weaker than you.\n\n[b]Length[/b]\nIt took me 55h to finish the game in story mode and an extra 4h to obtain all of the grindy achievements. The rest of my playtime is spent in finishing hardcore mode, which might take longer or faster based on your skill.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's a game where you can do a lot of things to craft and kill enemies. The game has a lot of unique bosses and vast maps to explore.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/23741321]Follow our curator page[b] Alexander's Club Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1596982760, "timestamp_updated": 1597079932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 118, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86672365665435791", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20671382": {"recommendationid": "20671382", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993156502", "num_games_owned": 8385, "num_reviews": 197, "playtime_forever": 3309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1667970966}, "language": "english", "review": "I wasn't sure what to expect from this game.\nWhatever it was I was expecting, this game FAR EXCEEDED my expectations.\nThis game is fun.

Others have compared it to Don't Starve and gameplay-wise, I suppose it could be like that a little. You play Flux, a space trucker whose ship was destroyed by a sinister floating head. To get back at the floating head and get off the planet you're stranded on, you'll have to gather resources and help out the natives in what is very clearly a comedic romp through an alien world.\n\nI never enjoyed Don't Starve because of its soul-crushing difficulty, and I wasn't readily attracted to a game with similar playstyle, but Butterscotch Shenanigans does a great job with their trailers, and since it was on sale for $5, I decided to give it a try. Mainly, I've been sold on the fact that I don't feel punished for simply wandering around aimlessly, smashing resources and treasure chests along the way. Your inventory is limitless, but craftable items can often cost a lot of resources, so plan to chop at everything you run across on the inevitable chance that you'll need it to craft something later.\n\nPets can be earned and upgraded to be more effective in combat. I love the Pokemon reference in-game when they're evolved. Enemies also don't seem to target pets, which can be a double-edged sword if yours does AoE (Are of Effect) damage, pulling an entire herd of Wompits down on your head.\n\nCrafting recipes are unlocked through quests and harvesting resources. It's always exciting to work your way through a forest only to have a random logtree drop a new recipe. There are also teleporters EVERYWHERE. Alongside the infinite inventory, this is one of my favorite features. It's annoying to have to jog back and forth between your home and whatever wilderness you were in because you need to craft more health potions.\n\nIt might sound like a casual experience, but it definitely has its challenges. I've died five times as of the writing of this review, mostly due to underestimating the power of the enemies. But death doesn't feel soul-crushing--it feels like a lesson learned. If a herd of Wompits stomps you into a bloody pool, maybe don't take on a whole herd next time.\n\nThere are definitely some areas where I think the game could be improved, though. Enemies spawn in thick clusters which can quickly overwhelm you when you meant to only fight one or two at a time. You earn perks in-game and I've earned a few, but I couldn't even tell you what they are because they go by the screen so fast, and there's no obvious way to review them afterwards. The data screen is also severely lacking, and I want to go a bit more into that.\n\nWith an infinite inventory, there is no place where you can quickly review the items you have. For example, if I am trying to make sure I have enough sticks to make something that requires them, I either need to have that item already on my tracker (which can only track one recipe at a time, BTW), or go all the way back home and check the recipe in the crafting station. It would have been nice to have this feature in the data panel, along with the list of perks unlocked, and maybe even a catalog of unlocked recipes. Anything to reduce the amount of unnecessary trips to my home base.\n\nAnyway, that doesn't stop me from playing and enjoying the game. Flux has a jaunty little skip while she roams the land chopping up the baddies and harvesting their parts for equipment. Her back and forth with the NPCs can also be really funny at times. I recommend it for anyone who likes exploring, active combat, and collecting things in their games, with a dash of humor to top it off.", "timestamp_created": 1556035786, "timestamp_updated": 1556035786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823992013931274414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20673984": {"recommendationid": "20673984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004098028", "num_games_owned": 3814, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 5735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5125, "last_played": 1528684571}, "language": "english", "review": "Crashlands rocks.\n\nI tested this for around 60 hours before release and can say that the game delivers on it's promise.  The sorta isometric view seems to make everyone mention Don't Starve (damn it.  I just did it.) I see it.  Crafting, weird creatures, item drops, etc...  It's all there.  But the games are very different.  Don't Starve is a grim bizarre survival game that will murder you often as you discover your randomly generated tale.  Crashlands has a scripted story that pulls you through the colorful, randomly generated terrain of three biomes as a super powered interplanetary delivery person. The whole \"kill, pick up drops, craft materials, become more badass\" loop is super tight. I've spent way too many late nights scouring the savannah for one more essence to give me one more shot at making an epic weapon.  There is some dark compulsive magic at work here.\n\nThe actual combat is interesting because it works well on a tablet or on a PC, and it seems right at home on both devices.  That's cool.  The pc feels comfortable in the whole Torchlight/Diablo format and the approach works well on tablets as well, which I found really surprising.  \n\nCrafting is super with the infinite no-fuss-no-muss-none-of-this-stupid-encumberment system.   The Butterscotch Shenanighans crafting slot machine is one of the games best features, and finally getting a great weapon or embiggening a pet is super satisfying.  \n\nI love games with pets, and the whole raising, fighting and embiggening of pets is a great addtion.  Pro tip:  If you're as terrible as I am, you can make your pets pretty powerful and let them do most of the work.\n\nThe story is funny and warped and weird and emotional and exciting.  If for some reason you don't like having fun, ignore the story and get back to hitting things really hard.  The game won't penalize you.  If laughing hurts your soul, the gameplay will pull you through.\n\nThis is a really good game.

Combing elements of survival, story, and humor to create an amazing title. I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1] \n\nYou are Flux and you are handling a urgent delivery with your robotic companion Juicebox. Your ship is destroyed by quite the purple head thingy... yeah.  You are now stranded on an alien planet and have to try and establish communication again and survive on the planet with its hostile environment.\n\nThe controls within this game are fairly simple using the mouse to either click and you will move there or hold it and you character will move where your mouse is. Crashlands also utilizes the A S D F and C V buttons as quick buttons, the A S D F buttons can be changed to quickly use your items while the C and V buttons are for your wonderfully murderous pet. The game mechanic is done well and I can see how easily it is converted to its mobile counterpart. Crashlands has a large amount of customizable floors and walls with useless furniture to behold. The game does a nice job of guiding you through everything and learning the game with rather comedic moments with Flux and Juicebox whether it be between themselves or the non-hostile inhabitants of the planet. The combat mechanic in the game is very fun as it requires you to be intelligent about you approach with every creature you see, which wants to kill you.... which is almost the entire planet. This game also removes the hassle of having to manage you inventory because apparently you have black hole pockets, just don't question it and be happy. Other than the expected do quest, get gear, and farm stuff mechanics you would expect of an RPG you can also rip the eggs from the creatures you kill and then raise their baby to murder their past brethren, overall very nice as long as you don't think too much on how STWOMPY (My personal Wombit) killed over 100 of his own kind already along with other creatures (so proud). The only problem is having to go back to old areas to remove bits of black so I can see the whole map, as it's quite the long process.\n\n[h1]Graphics/Sounds[/h1] \n\nThe graphics are cartoonish and more innocent than anything else. They are polished and very smooth and the evolution screen while you evolve your pet is quite majestic to watch. The music is alright and the sounds match the creature well.\n\n[h1]Pros/Cons [/h1] \n\n[b]Pros [/b] \n\n+ Great survival element\n+ Good amount of customization\n+ Large game allowing you to play for hours on end \n+ Cross-platform saves\n\n[b]Cons [/b] \n\n- Annoying to have to go back to previous areas of the map to fill it out without black areas\n- Moments where a crafting recipe I was tracking is replaced by a quest item track when I talk for the quest (slightly annoying, perhaps an option to not automatically change the tracked recipe?)\n- Grinding is existent and prevalent within the game\n\n[h1]Suggestions [/h1] \n\nThese are my personal suggestions that I feel would improve the game.\n\n- With the editor major update (when it is released) there should be an option to create custom player models and creature models to help create a true sense of freedom through customization in the update. \n- If the created creature is hostile the ability to select its attack patten would be amazing\n- Workshop for maps and mods with the large scale update\n- Ability to have \"Vanity items\" meaning that you could be waring one item for stats, but you can use another item that you prefer visually to be seen on you\n- Ability to see pet stats. To be able to see stats such as growth (Ex 26/100 and when it is evolved #/300), damage, and unique attack chance.\n- Future Co-op feature \n\n[h1]Final thoughts [/h1] \n\nI played Don't Starve and it was nice, but it wasn't my cup of tea. Crashlands however dragged me in and keeps me there. The game is fun and even though it is meant more for a mobile platform with its control scheme it does not take away from its value as a game in itself. It's a challenging game and makes you a bit more alert as you try not to get stomped out of existence. I love Flux and her attitude along with Juicebox and I think this game is something I could easily recommend to those who like Don't Starve but want something different and a bit more lighthearted. Also the trailer is just perfect.\n\n[h1]TL;DR [/h1] \n\nThe game is a more lighthearted version of Don't Starve and is able to keep you in a way Don't Starve couldn't. The game has mobile controls but it really doesn't hurt the game as a whole. There is a large amount of customization and the RPG element is great. This allows for the game to be a large, more open world, RPG survival game. It's actually cool that the main character is a female and the interactions she has between the non-hostile inhabitants of the alien planet, or her robotic companion Juicebox are very humorous at points. There are not many issues I am able to find as I play through the game. The only issues I see people having is that there is a grinding element to the game and that there are times on the map where you have to move to previous areas to have a fully exposed map without any black spots. I would definitely recommend this to people who want a different take on the Don't Starve survival technique or simply want to try something new and love an RPG element with customization.\n\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1453664006, "timestamp_updated": 1455560497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 139, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812813103199005127", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32662183": {"recommendationid": "32662183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164485757", "num_games_owned": 623, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1529818821}, "language": "english", "review": "(+)\n- Nice crafting system\n- Funny story\n- Nice sound effect\n- Nice and colourful graphics\n\n(-)\n- Grinding time will get longer as you progress, I don't recommend this for unpatient players", "timestamp_created": 1498186915, "timestamp_updated": 1498187008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811048626899719238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142457044": {"recommendationid": "142457044", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971396287", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 645, "last_played": 1689884890}, "language": "english", "review": "With the caveat that I only paid $3, it is worth the money, but man, is this game a needless grind.

However, upon playing for a couple hours I noticed this isn't a true 2 player coop game but instead a 1 player game with a 2 player sidekick. Let me explain.\n\nThe 1st player can craft, battle, die, equip and do everything in the game as it should be. However, the 2nd player can only battle and pickup items. He cannot partake in anything else especially crafting and equipping items to increase attack and defence. Also 2nd player cannot die but instead gets stunned. So the 2nd player has no fear of death, cannot equip anything, cannot craft...let's just say the second player has a long list of things he cannot do. In other words you're a side kick with limited functionality.\n\nI could see how this might be a good thing if you have a younger brother or sister who just wants to hang out with their older sibling and you don't want them causing problems. But if you have two serious gammers who want a piece of the action and all its glory this won't happen with this type of 2 player coop.\n\nIf Butterscotch Shenanigans changes the way the 2nd player partakes in the game, allowing for items to be equipped, giving the option for the second player to craft items and actually have a life bar and can die, I could see this being a great coop game.

But first, from noting but with the help of your fellow \"Juicebox\" you will have to gather, kill, figure out a way to leave the crazy alien planet you where forced to land on.\nAnd kick the ass of the dude who smashed your ship.... this is gonna be a long trip.\n\n\n[h1]Layout:[/h1]\nColorfull with a day / night cycle and many biomes, the game knows how to be appealing and varied. Flux, your hero, walks like a dummy and indeed (she admits himself) she has no elbows and knees. Monsters are cute creatures and i have to mention their offsprings to tame, a great addition.\nAll pieces of armor, weaponry are visible on Flux and effects of passiv and actif effects are nice.\nAlso enemies have hundreds of attacks that use various and pretty sprites.\nOnly different version of enemies doesn't change much except in size and subbtle shades of their respective colors.\n\nTo sum up Crashland is a pretty game:  designed like a comic where creatures and characters are enough ridiculous to be loved at first sight. Environments are very nice and the world is huge.\n\n\n\n[h1]Music and Effects:[/h1]\nMusic is quiet but very good. Slow paced, it makes the adventure much like a walk in an alien park than something.\nI really liked the yoghurt speech of characters and overall effects. Music and effects never bother you. For a game that will catch you during hundred of hours  it's a very good thing.\n\n\n[h1]Controls:[/h1]\nMaybe the most complicate thing to talk about especially because of the cross-platform feature.\nDesigned to be played on a tablet, on pc you only move/interact with your mouse and use few keys as menu/quickslots shortcuts. Simple enough, many tasks are automatic like building walls/floors in your bases, cutting or picking up item where you just need to clic one time. Also items have no durability so coupled with the clever self-managing inventory, it spare you millions of clics.\nBut in combat it's another story. Because of lack of movement keys, especially in the hardest difficulties, you will die alot due to miss clic on ressources or bad timed attacks. \nAlso consider that monsters always have attacks with area of effect so you can imagine how tight it can be. I want to mention the fact that all menus are excellents, crafting is easy and clear, map is perfectly clear too, also you can teleport at anytime to your base and other points of interrest.  Dialogues of quests and even datas about every monster you encounter are stored in a nice compendium.\n\nThe overall is very good and very easy to handle. Only combats can be tricky sometimes. \n\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nCrashlands takes from many games and does a great mix with its own personnality. \n\nYou will [u]farm, kill and grind during hours[/u] to get the required gear for every zone you will explore. Especially on Hard and Insane difficulties !\nVery soon you will need to be organized and cultivate restorativ plants, ressources and in general collect/gather everything. This aspect of the game is very important because every pieces of equipement you craft has a random chance to get one of the 5 qualities that varies from basic in white to epic in orange.\nThis difference is also in passiv armor and weapon effects that can trigger amazing bonuses like health leech or even berserker mod where your attacking speed increases.\n\nSo quite often (again in very high difficulties) you will be forced to farm and craft again and again sames items to be able to maximize your stats. Maybe another weak element of the game that should have been turned into a system where you can add more components during crafting and increase chances to get better qualities. You can still recycle your old gear to get some materials.\n\n[u]Combat[/u] is of course a huge part in the grinding imposed by the game. I was surprised by how vicious animals can be.\nI started in insane mode and to be honest i got owned so many times with different attack paterns, aggro or even the look of enemies, that i just felt a bit disguted. With very unaccurate controls for movements, many times i had to dodge attacks and instead Flux went to cut a bush/tree/ect....\nSo quickly i had to prepare fields and organize my ressources to aggro correct monsters and time my attacks/movements/ skills accordingly. Especially if you consider that every enemies have attacks with area of effects and marked radius/attack paterns shown on the ground. Note that depending of difficulty levels you will or won't be able to outmatch bosses with your equipement, making every boss fights epic... so indeed \"there will be something for everyone\".\n\nYou can also accept [u]quests[/u] from native aliens or  Juicebox (the robotic companion). Even if the tasks are often basics, it brings funny dialogues and many ways to expend your knowledge of the lore and crafting receipes. The more you take quests, the more you venture further on the planet. And it's a good thing because it brings some kind of \"direction\" in a game where the world and possibilities are enormous. Sometimes you can get receipes from enemies or ressources, making exploring and farming much more enjoyable. During night time new monsters appear giving you other receipes and challenges!\n\nAlso [u]dialogues[/u] are a delight, totally in the mood of Battle Block Theater, Crashlands brings a fresh air. Punning all the time and makes you laugh with weird situations. Nothing is serious and it's where the game shines above many.\n\n\n[h1]Life span:[/h1]\nCrashland is a long and interresting game. But be ware, you must be prepared to do some tasks often as what you can do in a game like Don't Starve but in a \"friendlier\" way. The only thing that might lack is a local or internet co-op mod.\nChallenge is decent and again there will be ways to play for everyones.\n\n\n[h1]Fun/Stress aspect:[/h1]\nEven if it can be difficult nothing is punishing or too important to bother you. You just enjoy and have choice to do things the way you want and at anytime. As an exemple, your base never gets raided or as promoted (and it's totally justified) your inventory manages itself. Even dying is not so hard because you just loose few items to forces you to walk a bit (the monster that killed you despawn leaving you chances to get your stuff).\nAlso you can teleport to your base and important locations at anytime and you don't need to feed, rest, ect your character. Food only serves to heal when you don't have passiv restorative effects on your armor or weapons.\n\nThe game and will only stress you because of movements with mouse during combats and forces you to do again an again what could have been easier... let's say more intuitive.\n\nCrashland is still amazingly funny and entertaining !\n\n\n\n\n[h1]TO CONCLUDE:[/h1]\n\nI've posted that this game was the one i was waiting for this year.\nAnd indeed, Crashlands is the gem i was waiting for. Balanced and easy to pick up on every aspects (expect movement with the mouse ARGH). Crashland is a good addition to a genre that stays a bit too serious and even punishing sometimes.

In a few words this game is brilliant and silly fun. \n\nThe only setback I found was the walking speed of the main character.

It was nice to discover that there are Face Huggers (from the Alien franchise) which can poison you and increase your walking speed considerably. Unfortunately, they're exclusive to the Bawg. Although a greater speed could make exploring and collecting more fun, I'm afraid it would break the game characteristic difficulty.\n\nThe game is hard, especially on insane mode, but oh it is so much fun.

However, if you enjoy old school grindy point-and-click ARPGs, you're in luck! Personally I am finding it a lot of fun.\n\nThe core gameplay consists of exploring each biome, taking quests, grinding kills and harvesting resources to build ever-better crafting stations. Each monster has its own attack style with a special attack every so often, so combat revolves around basically having to learn how best to tackle each one.\n\nWhilst superficially the game bears some resemblance to Don't Starve, it is far more casual and forgiving. This may or may not appeal, depending on what you prefer. In Crashlands, death is not the end but rather a minor inconvenience; you respawn at your base, and get to retrieve your lost resources by visiting the site of your death.\n\nThe game has a very charming art style, a great soundtrack, and I find the dialogue funny and quirky. I can see why others might not enjoy it, though.\n\nCrashlands has more content than I was anticipating; at the time of writing I have played about 45 hours and have just reached the 3rd biome, so I think I'll easily hit 60 before I'm done with the main plot arc.However, I would say that the repetitive combat mechanics and the fact that each biome is visually new but is basically a remix of the previous in terms of mechanics is starting to lose its novelty at this stage - I thought after the Bawg that'd be the end of the game and I was just about ready for a finale, so a whole other biome was a surprise!\n\nOverall, if like me you enjoy ARPGs and don't mind stylised cartoony graphics, this game will give you hours of grindy fun. However, if you don't like the genre or find you prefer you games more with a darker, more serious setting and tone, then it's probably best to steer clear.", "timestamp_created": 1496061288, "timestamp_updated": 1496061367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715734779834747314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41137446": {"recommendationid": "41137446", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986937538", "num_games_owned": 767, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1299, "last_played": 1521947155}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n\n+ Cute Design\n+ Unique Asthetic\n+ Legitametly Funny\n+ Likeable Female Protaganist (Not a Mary Sue)\n+ Addictive Gameplay\n+ Base Building is actually fun and easy\n+ The \"Feel\" is responsive, everything you do, regardless of how small, feels like an accomplishment\n\nCons:\n\n- There are some parts that definetly feel like a grind\n- Some mechanics seem to be left unexplained\n- There are some quality of life improvements that could be made, for example, being able to access your recipes anywhere and being able to keep a secondary weapon always equipped (perhaps being able to assign it to the right mouse button, which as far as I know is not used in game)\n- Some graphics seem low res, which can certainly detract from an otherwise beautiful game\n- Areas are too samey, with little to no landmarks to make them interesting\n\nSummary: Very fun game, good mechanics, art and music, though suffers from issue with grinding, quality of life improvements, and repetive enviroments.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game.", "timestamp_created": 1522353811, "timestamp_updated": 1522353811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71466982364654541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21473190": {"recommendationid": "21473190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042913113", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 283, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1456593040}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Don't be fooled by the playtime, I've logged tens of hours on Android for this game.[/b]\n\n[h1]TL:DR You'd be hard pressed to find a game as rewarding and well-made as this one. [/h1]\n\n[b]There's crafting, survival, cooking, fishing, building, questing, and plenty else to do in this game. Crashlands is REALLY good, and each of its mechanics is so well done, you'll wonder why other developers hadn't thought to do it this way.[/b]\n\nFor the full review, I'm going to break things down by mechanics and features. New players will also be able to learn some useful tips about the game, by reading this.\n\nSo, let's start with:\n\n[b]Storyline and Gameplay[/b]\n\nFor starters, this game is pretty funny. It doesn't take itself seriously, and has jokes and humour littered througout. The thing is, it's all quite well done, and creates an enjoyable world to explore and discover. The characters you'll meet are often silly and entertaining, but not in any way that breaks immersion. Overall, it's very well done, and by doing the storyline quests and side quests, you unlock more recipes and ingredients to use to make your character even stronger. \n\n[b]Crafting[/b]\n\nThe crafting system in the game is very well done. There are different crafting stations for different tiers of equipment and tools. There are a lot of similarities between this system and Starbound, however this one ups that by offering ideas that make it easier to craft. One of my favourite features of crafting is the ability to track a recipe. Click \"Track\" then you'll see what ingredients you'll need to craft that item. As you collect the ingredients, you'll see how much you have, and how much you still need, in order to make that item. \n\nRecipes are another fun aspect of the game as you start with a bunch when you make a new station. You can also get new recipes from finishing quests. My favourite feature, however, is that you can get epic and legendary recipes from resource drops, mob drops, and fishing. It's very rewarding to kill an enemy and suddenly see a recipe box pop out. It could be anything from a new piece of furnature for your house to a legendary blueprint for a piece of equipment. \n\nCrafting is this games' killer app, and it really is killer.\n\n[b]Exploration and Map[/b]\n\nExploration in Crashlands is very similar to Don't Starve. You start at your pod, and as you travel further out, your map gets filled in, block by block. \nThe further away you get, the more interesting (read:dreadly) the enemies become. Then again, the greater the risk, the greater the reward. There are lots of interesting places to discover, and NPC locations are littered everywhere, which results in gaining new quests, learning more about the planet you've crashed on, and of course, more recipes and lot. \n\nIt also helps that the art style in Crashlands is wonderfully colourful, with lots of glowy things that light up the world in a myriad of colours. Exploration is FUN FUN FUN in Crashlands.\n\n[b]Cooking and Fishing[/b]\n\nAt a certain point in the game, you're going to gain access to a hearth for cooking, and later, a fishing rod for fishing. \n\nUnlike a lot of games that have fishing spots randomly appear in different places, fishing spots are permanent in Crashlands. That means you can place signs (assuming you've crafted some) at any spots you find, and come back to them every two hours. At one point, I was using signs to label sites on the map, but eventually the game one upped that by giving me a recipe for an item that creates fishing spots in any body of water I choose. \n\nLet me remind you, fishing spots are pemanent, so these items were a Godsend, as fishing is not only very rewarding, it's also very enjoyable. Add to that the fact that you can also gain legendary items and recipes from fishing, and you have a system that will keep you coming back for more. \n\nFishing spot cooldowns will continue to count down, even when you're not playing the game, so long as you haven't left the game paused. Pausing the game and leaving it, unfortunately, also pauses timers. Bummer for sure, but this can be avoided by simply exiting the game when you walk away from it. The game saves everything automatically, so you won't lose anything by doing so.\n\nAs for cooking, when you use the hearth, you'll have a bunch of recipes for potions. Potions provide health, speed, resistences, etc. There are all sorts of boosts and benefits from potions, so you'll want to pursue that, when the hearth comes available. \n\nQuick tip: There's a quest, not long after you get the hearth, that'll allow you to make really good health potions out of fish and stone. If you have a rod and a hearth, but not this recipe? Do some quests, it's worth it... so worth it.\n\n[b]Building[/b]\n\nBuilding is another great feature in this game. It's extremely simple to get some building supplies, then activate build mode which will allow you to click (or tap) anywhere on the screen to place that item. \nAdditionally, each building type is seperated into function. Floors have their own section, so it's easy to select that item set, choose a floor type, and just start pasting those floor tiles down the way you want. \nVegetation (farming... yes, this game TOTALLY has farming) is another section, and you can plant your seeds, and place potted plants which can both be harvested after a 15 minute cooldown. \n\nAgain, cooldowns will continue to count down while you're out of the game, so be sure to check back on your farms, from time to time. \n\n[b]Animal Taming[/b]\n\nHere is perhaps one of my favourite features of Crashlands, you can have pets! Pets serve two features. First, you can feed your pets to harvest resources from them. These resources can be used in certain recipes, and often come in really handy. \nThe second function, and perhaps the most important, you can take one of your pets out with you while you explore. They'll fight for you, while they keep you company. Additionally, they're invincible, so you don't need to worry about them getting killed by other baddies. They also don't need to be fed to stay aline, feeding is only something you do when you want to... milk them... \n\nHow about one more awesome point of keeping animals... Well, you can also unlock recipes for items that will cause your animals to permanently evolve into larger and more powerful versions. Each animal has multiple stages of growth, each one making them bigger, stronger, and look cooler, each time. \n\nYou should get an egg drop for each enemy type, shortly after you've crafted a station that can make that animal's nest. \n\nKeeping animals is absolutely worth it, in this game.\n\n[b]Looting and Inventory[/b]\n\nThere's loot... lots and lots of loot. When you kill creatures, fish, harvest resources, etc, you'll get showerd with items and materials. The key point here is that there is not traditional inventory with a sprawling list of things you have and don't have. The inventory system manages all of that for you, and there is NO LIMIT TO INVENTORY SPACE. As you pick things up, they will scroll by discreetly on the left, along with a number in brackets which indicates how many you have in total. \n\nThe inventory system in Crashlands is another one of those features that makes you wonder why it has taken so long for a developer to think of it. It's clean, efficient, simple to figure out, and cuts out all the mess of traditional inventory spaces.\n\nAs mentioned before, all enemies, resource points, and fishing have a chance of dropping some epic items, so there will be a lot of \"OMG That's AWESOME\" moments in your adventures with Crashlands. \n\n[b]Summary[/b]\n\nSeems I'm at the word limit for this review, so let me just sum it up by saying, Crashlands is one hell of a good game. It aces its presentation, mechanics, sense of rewarding, and enjoyment.

The game is very basic in the action RPG genre, and it shows some of its mobile elements (as the game is also available on mobile devices) with some of the control elements and mouse drive controls. With that said, the combat can give a challenge with its sorta give and take gameplay, and it's complemented by a crafting system that has some depth to it. It's a game that took elements that I normally don't enjoy, like \u201chome building\u201d systems, and made them enjoyable for me. It's got a good sense of humor with its small jabs and wit here and there, and the game comes together well as an overall package to deliver a fun experience. I've got 10+ hours in it, but I've seemingly only scratched the surface, as while the game can get repetitive, it definitely delivers on the content in terms of items to collect and craft. Whether it be on Steam or on the mobile platform (if you have something like a Galaxy Tablet, it definitely works well there) (and there's cross platform play), Crashlands is a fun time all around, and is best suited for the kind of adventuring player that wants to take in the sights, and enjoy the trek along the way. \n\n[b]  Video Review: https://youtu.be/VfIkIobolnA[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The game is a sum of it's parts. Every element of the game, even the elements that I find to be negatives, work well together to make the game a sum of its parts. Picture a set of gears working together to power something. That's this game. \n[*] Building system is very easy to use and easy to rearrange things with. Very straight to the point, and gets the job done without over complication.\n[*] Like the crafting system, especially with the weapons element. Multiple attempts makes sense for weapons and armors due to rewards of higher calibur weapons. Gives reasons to recraft and recraft.\n[*] Boss encounter and high amounts of enemies in one area definitely bring a strong impact. Surprisingly difficult at times, even at the normal difficulty. \n[*] Pets actually make a reasonable difference in battle, especially the bigger ones. They aren't just there for show. \n[*] There's a lot to do. You can spend a lot of time just exploring to get more items to craft with, and finding new schematics and what not. Those wanting to just get lost in minecraft like elements will enjoy themselves here. \n[*] Game's combat does have a sorta fencing like style to it, and can be challenging in some aspects. Simple, and straight forward, but it works despite its flaws.\n[*] Like the fact that there's cloud saves that works cross platform. Those wanting to do both will enjoy the fact that this seems pretty straight forward.\n[*] Sense of humor that knows the power of subtle touch, and not banging you over the head with the joke. It's obvious the developers had fun creating this game from the ground up, and it shows with the execution. Little things like the big baddie showing up out of nowhere to zap the tree I was about to chop down made things a bit more interesting. \n[*] Great aesthetic. Enemy designs are nice and actually feel a little fresh compared to other games in the genre, and yet still have some familiar aspects to them. Good color choices as well. \n[*] Like the items that were designed to collect items via bombs. Smart. \n[*] Performance is there. Never dropped under 60 FPS under normal conditions, and even when my machine was doing other significant tasks, it held on to it then too. The machine is up there in terms of specs, but still was surprised. \n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Game suffers in control areas, most likely due to its mobile counterpart. It will take some adjusting, especially in tight gameplay areas where its easy to click on something in the middle of battle. \n[*] Would want to see some better menus and quest tracking. Having some information on the main screen about your next objective would have been appreciated. Some hints on where to get certain materials will go over some players heads.\n[*] Wanted more hotkeys honestly. Understand the simplicity and the mobile portion, but 4 hotkeys made switching things in and out for easy a little bit more trouble some that it was worth. Especially with the fact that you can't switch items in battle.\n[*] Game will get repetitive for some, as while there are things to change it up, combat will be against a lot of the same enemies early, and there's fetch quests. Some map legend elements would have helped this.\n[*] The map implementation can be very annoying, as your natural reaction is to click to drag the map, only to have you teleport to the nearest teleporter.\n[*] Those looking to have their hand held in terms of what to do with quests and items to find will not enjoy elements of this game. Reading quests information and looking at items to determine what you need to is required. \n[*] Would have liked to see the options menu be available from the pause menu, as opposed to only via the title screen.\n[*] On a side note, it reminds me how badly I am at interior design.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

Running around for 10-20m collecting material to craft something for the quest to finally receive a decorative item !? (the wombat statue)\n\nThe crafting is a bit soulless.

A million times yes. Just buy it if you haven't.\n\nPositives\n-Inventory. It's rare that I get to say this, but I love Crashland's inventory system because... well, you don't have to manage it. Acquired materials are simply tracked. Inventory management is basically just restricted to equipment, and this is fine.\n-Combat. Challenging combat with a relatively simple interaction loop makes for generally enjoyable combat. Death is expected, but it's trivial to run back and grab your stuff. The monsters are super interesting and in no way feel contrived.\n-Story. Although there isn't a TON to the story, it's humorous, and it drives the player's motives. Expect to chuckle a lot and feel a general sense of forward motion. The protagonist is hilarious, the antagonist is hilarious, your assistant is hilarious, every NPC you meet is hilarious.\n-Crafting. Tiered crafting systems basically depend on style, and boy does this game have a lot of style. Every time you move up a tier feels good -- what weird, gross things do I get to make now? The sheer amount of crafting stations is mitigated by the fact that you'll WANT to know what comes next.\n-Graphics. The graphics are stylistic and neat. You won't see anything like these graphics elsewhere, and they're gross and enthralling and great. Can't get enough of it.\n-Environment. There are three distinct worlds, and they're all a lot of fun to explore, complete with their own creatures, materials, inhabitants, and quests.\n-Platform. I LOVE THE FACT that I can sit at my computer and play, save it to the cloud, then jump in bed and play the same world on my phone.\n\nNegatives\n-Uhh... nothing.

It looks nice, it's funny, and I really like the idea of merging casual crafting with exploration and ARPG elements. The problem is that each of those three things is super shallow in Crashlands and WAY too drawn out. Even though it shares a lot of similarities with Don't Starve this is extremely not that game. There's no sense of urgency and no survival elements. This essentially boils down to there never being any tension when exploring and no reason to really build anything other than what's needed for quests. I like that there's combat but it's VERY simple with extremely basic enemies. You can move and attack and that's about it. And the idea of rolling random rarities on equipment you craft is cool but it ends up just forcing you to grind for more materials so you can craft things over and over again to get a good roll which just plain isn't fun. On top of that exploration is never rewarding. It's just the same randomly generated landscape bits filled with the same enemies for what feels like miles. I've yet to find anything truly unique or weird or interesting in the world. You just sort of pick a direction and walk until you get bored.\n\nUltimately there's nothing about Crashlands that doesn't work.

It's like Don't Starve except everything that annoyed you from DS has been removed and replaced. Your companion is a robotic moving cargo carrier so item storage is not an issue and instead of just struggling to survive as long as possible you are looking for new enemies to kill to get better equipment or searching a new biome for a new resource.

I don't know, 30 hours on mobile? I LOVE it. It's definitely better on PC though.\n\nEssentially, you crash land on a planet. It's point-and-click movement similar to Diablo or Torchlight, and you simply click on enemies once to start attacking repeatedly until they're dead. You can't do this for long though, because they WILL attack and probably kill you, so after one or two attacks you need to run away to dodge an attack, and then run back to whack them again a few times.\n\nThe RPG/Stat upgrade system goes like this (and it's very similar to Don't Starve in some respects): Gather a whole lot of Wood/grass. Build a workstation. That workstation gives you blueprints for a Helmet, Gloves, Body armour, and a weapon, sometimes even a pickaxe or saw for gathering. You also get furniture to build, as well as the next Workstation you need. \n\nYou go out and gather the required ingredients from dead enemies and the environment, come back, make your armour and weapons, and you're now a bit stronger. If you remake them, you have a chance of getting a better version (common, uncommon, rare etc.) with better stats, so re-making items can be worthwhile if you have the resources spare. Eventually, you make your next Bench, and the cycle continues all over again.\n\nYou also have missions. Lots of missions. It's virtually impossible to explore the whole world unless you really really don't have anything better to do. It's huge. And there are multiple \"worlds\" each. This is a LONG game. Missions usually include killing something, making something, or fetching something. Surprisingly, it actually is a lot of fun. \n\nYour weapons are all Melee, but you can get quick-use items, like a poison dart blower, something that makes you move faster, etc. and they're all on cooldowns so you can't spam them. You also craft explosives and potions with varying effects. If you're lazy (and you will eventually become lazy) you can make a garden with your most commonly needed ingredients (cutting down trees gives you seeds which you can then plant and repeatedly harvest). This is handy for making potions, of which you will need thousands.\n\nI realise this is more of an explanation of the game rather than a review, but you really have to try this game to understand its brilliance.

So the guys blasphemously ripped out many of staples we're sick of... Letting us focus on the important things: Beating up the local wildlife and collecting stuff to make bigger stuff to beat up bigger local wildlife. So we no longer have to manage an unweildy inventory and angrily raid about 50 chests for that 1 item we know we picked up somewhere, but likely left in an outpost in God-knows-where (yay). The map is littered with teleporters that let us hop around the place on a whim (yay). And if you die, you can just go back, pick up your stuff and carry on (yay)\n\nOn the surface, this might seem worrying. By removing all this, does it leave a rather shallow game? Not really. What it ultimately does is make it exceptionally approachable and give you the freedom to muck about and just... enjoy it. Seriously, I could just mill about the Savannah for ages - it was just so relaxing. That's not to say it's easy (you will die... a lot), but it's laid back and easy to dip into.\n\nThe only real weak point is the armour crafting. Basically, your kit will randomly have special effects when you craft them (poisoning, going berserk, resisting damage...) - but it cannot be carried over when you upgrade. This sucks big time, as you'll repeatedly end up with Excellent Level kit... then have to forge like 30 items of the next level in the hope that one of them will actually have bonuses worth upgrading to. And you're forced to upgrade A LOT (the enemies scale quite dramatically). It ironically adds a lot of tedium to a game hell-bent on removing it. It's frustrating and can detract from the enjoyment - but there is at least enough enjoyment to be had to mitigate it to a degree.\n\nOther than that though, it's great fun! The combat is reminiscent of the old Mega Drive platformers: Studying the attack patterns and finding the sequences to best get a hit in. The pets are an inspired (and fun) addition and the writing is utterly wonderful. It's cheeky, playful and there are tons of laugh-out-loud moments to be had. The characters are brilliant and the item descriptions equally funny.

A bad guy stops you and steals your packages, destroying your ship in the process. Your task is to find said bad guy to take your packages back and deliver them to their recipients. This involves resource gathering, monster hunting, animal taming, lots of crafting and extremely simple to use building mechanics.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is pretty simple, kill monsters and explore to collect resources. Use those resources to craft more advanced equipment and build a prettier house. Then use that equipment to kill more monsters. Along the whole way, you'll find a tonne of quest givers with sometimes complex, sometimes hard and sometimes just downright strange requests. Despite the gameplay being simple it always seems to keep sucking me back in.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe game is entirely 2d with very charming and well made graphics. Every weapon, tool, piece of armour, enemy or NPC is made very creatively and are pleasant to look at. I particularly like the creatures in the game, every one of them is very unique.\n\n[h1]Mechanics[/h1]\nHaving mentioned the enemies being unique in looks, they're also very unique in their attacking patterns. Whenever you encounter a new enemy type, you have to learn how to avoid their attacks and defeat them. This keeps up the challenge when entering new areas of the world. Besides that, everything in this game is just easy to use. The inventory completely manages itself, meaning you won't have to sort through the huge amounts of resource types in the game. The crafting is extremely easy to use and keeps crafting while you're away from the workbench. This is a particularly good feature in my opinion, since I get frustrated from sitting and watching an item craft timer go down. Finally, the building is amazingly simple to use and very quick to open.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nMy final thoughts on this game are highly positive. From what I hear, I'm not even half way through the game and I've enjoyed every second of it. The game runs smoothly, looks amazing and is just perfectly executed. In addition, the developers are still updating the game occasionally. The exact same game is also on mobile, along with a cloud save to synchronise your save games across PC and mobile. Meaning you can really play this game anywhere (especially with a Nintendo Switch version coming out soon.)\n\nI 100% recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind a little bit of crafting/hunting grinding.\n\n[quote]If you would like to see more reviews like this, check out my curator page over [B][URL=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/aagcurator#curation] here.[/URL][/B][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1535529442, "timestamp_updated": 1536201167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654585897922515869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31573893": {"recommendationid": "31573893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025557930", "num_games_owned": 1368, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1494048755}, "language": "english", "review": "Seems interesting at first, but the real gameplay gets repetitive real quick.\n\nThe whole game is like this;\nYou start with basic craft station and schema and then-\n1.Talk to NPC and accept quests\n2.Craft weapon, armor, tool to complete quests which is pretty much:\n- Killing mobs\n- Craft something\n- Killing mobs and craft something\n3.Unlock new craft station, schema, and new quests\n4.Repeat\n\nExploration is just finding enemy, ingredent, and warp pad to unlock fast travel spot.\nThere's nothing interesting to see.\n\nCombat is repetitive.

Crashlands is a game that reminds many (including myself) of Don't Starve. In my opinion it is to Don't Starve, what American remakes are to European original films. It's goofier and more flashy, but in the process loses the idea of what makes the original so genius.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nCrashlands drops you into an alien world, where you need to craft and help the locals to retrieve the packages lost during the crash landing. You have to scavenge and hunt mobs for materials that allow you to craft better gear and challenge harder mobs. It's actually fun for the first few hours, until you notice, this is it, that's basically the whole game. Just grind to craft another workstation, another weapon, another armour. It might have been okay as one of the possible activities, but it gets really old when it's the only activity available. And you have to do it a lot. There are 35 levels of equipment and they increment in twos. This means, the same gameplay loop has to be repeated around 17 times, that's at least 10 times too many. It's also possible to 'domesticate' pets, until you notice, that it's basically another part of the crafting system as the domesticated pets create materials which you'll need to create your weapons and armours with. It doesn't really help that the design of most of the gear is rather uninspiring. You can have the same sword/axe/helmet/etc. every 2 levels. I mean, it looks different, but the only actual difference is that it deals a bit more damage than the same item of the lower tier and a bit less damage than the item of the next tier. Only the gadgets and devices are a small breath of fresh air, at least some of them offer interesting, new mechanics.\n\nAnother gameplay element that's gravely underdeveloped is base building. There are possibilities of building furniture, plants and some other random stuff, but they (mostly) serve no purpose. You can just put them around if you feel like it, but there isn't really any good reason to do so. The only things that are actually needed are workstations, which allow you to craft better and better gear (there's like 20 of them) and pets nest. The rest of furniture might as well not exist.\n\nThe enemies are nicely designed in terms of their looks and attack patterns, however, they all suffer from one major problem - bullet sponging. Most of the time you'll find yourself slapping the enemies with your ineffective weapon for mediocre damage and just running around to not get hit. When you get better weapons, you'll move on to other enemies which will have the same spongey feeling to them. On the other hand enemies attacks welcome you to the world of hurt. Most special enemies will deal enough damage to one-shot you. There are many defensive stats, but at some point you'll probably notice, that the most important one is indeed the HP, that lets you survive the one hit and quickly heal up, the rest probably matters, but there isn't any in-game explanation of what do they exactly do. Like what does 20% toughness do? Does it decrease the physical damage by 20%? More? Less? Does it mean 100% toughness makes you invulnerable to physical damage? Who knows...\n\nEnemies' attacks usually give you a lot of time to dodge, but it's unfortunately balanced with the speed your character is moving. By far one of the most frustrating things about Crashlands is the fact that most of the time you're literally crawling through the world. Being able to activate the 'turbo mode' helps a bit, but you can't have 100% uptime on it, so that sucks. Something like a Don't Starve's 'Walking stick' would be a great help to the game - that is an item that allows you to walk really fast outside of combat, but has to be switched to a weapon during combat, so it would still not be that easy to dodge the attacks.\n\nThere are also some minor bugs in the game, where quests aren't properly marked on the map or your teleporting doesn't work the first time you click (happens A LOT). Not that big of a deal in the end, but it does show the lack of polish of the game.\n\n[h1] Story and Quests [/h1]\n\nThe story initially got me interested. It was a bit goofy, a bit crazy but it held up. I was following it rather closely until the end of Savannah, the first act. After that though, I was a bit underwhelmed with the game mechanics and just felt like finishing it up for the sake of being done with it, reading just a part here and there to still know what's going on. Reaching the last level, Tundra, I was so worn out I would just skip every dialogue ASAP. It didn't matter anyway and it did feel stretched just for the sake of having three acts.\n\nThis might have been different if the quests were a bit more creative, but unfortunately they aren't. 90% of the quests will be your typical 'kill this/gather that/talk to someone'. As I mentioned before, it might be interesting enough for the first act, but after that you'll find just skipping most of the dialogues and then checking your quests screen for the item that you actually need to gather up to finish the quest.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nFor me the strongest asset of this game. Crashlands looks neat. It's colourful and it feels alive. Even though most of your gear does the same, it looks differently, based on the materials that were used in the crafting process. The enemies and allies look a bit (positively) weird, which fits the goofy, alien theme of the game. The animations are fluid, damage indicators clear and you can easily spot all the materials as they have their distinctive looks.\n\nMy only complaint here would be the lack of possibility (at least I haven't found it) to disable screenshake. I always turn it off in any game I play, and I found it as annoying in Crashlands as in any other game.\n\n[h1] Sound and Music [/h1]\n\nI actually liked the music of the game of the game and I think I had it on for most part of the game. It was nothing to write home about, but it also didn't get on my nerves, which is important, as the game is about 30 hours long and you'll be hearing lots of it on repeat.\n\nThe sounds were mostly well chosen. Enemy sounds were fitting, 'juicy' sounds were 'juicy' enough. No complaints there.\n\nOn the other hand, the person who decided to put the 'thumping' tree in the game, should really re-evaluate how it impacts the playthrough. Hearing that annoying sound for 'roughly' the 8 hours you spend in the last act was stuff of nightmares.\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\n\nCrashlands does some things good, it does most things mediocre and a few things - plain bad. It is even a great game up until the point where you notice you've basically seen everything and still have around 20 hours of grind left. If it took 10 hours to complete, this review would probably even be a positive one. It's just, that the game is stretched to almost 30 hours, but the content is just not there anymore past the first act.

In a good way. There's very little in the way of tedious wait times when things are crafting and the recipes are usually simple enough not to have a whole ton of things you need to build to build things you need to build things with. If that makes sense. It's fast in other words so you can get back to smashing things.\n\nCombat is slightly more complicated than it seems with each enemy having unique attack patterns that you need to learn to avoid. However realistically I found that since most of the big enemies could kill me outright in one or two hits dancing around them trying to get hits in is just too risky most of the time. Even a small enemy attacks so fast they can catch you off guard or between healing item cooldowns and wipe you out.\n\nThe best option seems to be to just aggro as much stuff as possible with ranged attacks and let your trusty one legged rhino-cow-thing AOE stomp everything into oblivion whilst you carry on mining stuff or chopping wood whilst dodging attacks. This is pretty hilarious to watch and somehow never really gets old. The only problem is said trusty rhino-cow isn't so trusty as to continue attacking the swarm of cosmic monstrosities following you unless you keep throwing in the odd ranged attack to keep his interest. If he kills his target he'll just run back to you and ignore the other dozen critters until you attack something too. I feel this was done deliberately to stop easy farming by just letting the pet do all the work but it can make things awkward as it is often near impossible to actually get an attack in whilst giant land-squids, butterflys and rhinos are doing their best to separate your brains from your skull.\n\nOne big issue I continually had is the pathfinding. Click to move games are never my favourite but after a few minutes of instinctively trying to WASD my way around the place I had become quite comfortable with it. Until I clicked inside the house only for my character to run headfirst into a wall for ten seconds. Try to cross any land dotted with water and it's even worse requiring constant clicks right in front of you just to keep him from trying to drown himself. This can be even more awkward in combat when you try to use a ranged attack only for him to run directly into melee range because there just happened to be a small bush blocking the shot. In a game with mouse only control the pathfinding really could do with being a bit better than this.\n\nHaving WASD as the item bar seems like a clever middle finger to traditional keyboard controls however having access to just four items can be a little limited and detrimental to the game. Two of those slots have to be taken by the wrench and blowpipe ranged weapons for practicality and the other two have to be taken by the basic food items at the moment since the cooldown is so high on them and the amount they heal so low. All the nice bomb recipes I've found are too dangerous to use until I get better healing items. I found a recipe for a HP potion but it is quite costly and currently heals more health than I actually have... and presumably will also be on a 30 second cooldown.\n\nThat said there isn't really any penalty to dying, true to the quick paced nature of the game. You can just teleport immediately after respawning to a nearby portal and are rarely more than 30 seconds away from recovering all your stuff. Whilst it may seem a little weird to totally remove any fear of death like this it really just serves to make the game more enjoyable. I can't count the amount of times in Terraria, Minecraft or similar that I've spent an hour grinding resources only to get killed by something stupid and rush back as quickly as possible to get my gear only to find it gone. In at least half of those innumerous situations I've just quit the game and got bored of it for the day.\n\nThe infinite inventory and lack of hours spent sorting through chests and juggling resources around also serves well to focus this game on actual gameplay and not a shelf stacking simulator. All of these things make it feel like a far more casual and basic game but they also make it more about action. The game is also pretty funny with great dialogue however it does concern me that it is very linear so far so I don't know that it will have anywhere near as much replay value as similar games. That said, after five hours I don't appear to have even glimpsed the end so all in all it is well worth the \u00a310.", "timestamp_created": 1469715298, "timestamp_updated": 1469715298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626118302345275879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29129575": {"recommendationid": "29129575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151063636", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1390, "last_played": 1523218653}, "language": "english", "review": "CRRRASSSSHHHHLLAAANNNNDDDSSS!!!\n\n+Amazing Inventory system \n\n+RPG Elements on point \n\n+Building a base couldn't be easier\n\n+Farming very well done \n\n+Amazing DEVVSS\n\n+CROSSPLATFORMINESS \n\nEVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!

Definitely tons of value.\n\n+ Excellent crafting system\n+ Controls are tight and simplistic\n+ Has good humor\n+ Areas/Biomes are unique and stylized\n", "timestamp_created": 1482871276, "timestamp_updated": 1482871276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610157132148742676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34450046": {"recommendationid": "34450046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099841240", "num_games_owned": 2347, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2313, "last_played": 1588313768}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 A Must-Play Gem! \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nIntro:\nI'm thrilled to share my thoughts on Crashlands, a game that has captured my heart and gaming hours like no other. Across Steam, my iPad, and Android, I've invested in this masterpiece across multiple platforms, and the value it delivers is beyond compare. The convenience of seamless cloud saves between my PC and mobile devices is a game-changer.\n\nGameplay:\nCrashlands unfolds an expansive open-world canvas where adventure knows no bounds. The enchanting crafting system and endearing pet companions are standout features that truly set it apart. The game maintains a refreshing sense of lightheartedness, allowing it to effortlessly forge a special place in my gaming collection.\n\nCustomization:\nWhat drew me further into Crashlands is its crafting system \u2013 a delightful blend of resource gathering, inventive crafting, and watching your creations breathe life into the virtual world. This addictive mechanic adds layers of depth, ensuring I'm immersed for countless hours on end.\n\nRecommendation:\nI wholeheartedly recommend Crashlands to every gaming enthusiast out there. If the game were priced at $20, it would still stand tall as a remarkable investment. The voluminous hours of gameplay it offers are staggering. I've joyfully clocked around 50 hours on Steam alone, matched by an equally significant journey across my mobile devices.\n\nValue and Conclusion:\nCrashlands, when juxtaposed with its price, is nothing short of a marvel. Its price-to-value ratio is unbeatable, delivering rich gameplay experiences that elevate it beyond mere entertainment. This game isn't just about the hours spent; it's about the joy those hours bring.

Also there are tons of items to craft, will give you lots to do. You will get more than the given price.\n\nOne thing to NOTE: this game is more of Action game with crafting elements rather than pure crafting survival game. The difficulties progression spikes fast, almost every enemy you find from the beginning can kill you in one or two hits. Even after you level up your gears, sometimes the low level enemies can still kill you in one hit. But after you learn their pattern, the game is not that difficult. The patterns are easy to learn and dodge.
