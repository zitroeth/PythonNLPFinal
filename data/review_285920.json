They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can\u2019t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.", "timestamp_created": 1710980029, "timestamp_updated": 1710980029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606447458267211914", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158735129": {"recommendationid": "158735129", "author": {"steamid": "76561199395088812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1289, "last_played": 1712022884}, "language": "english", "review": "Another game my son enjoys so we are enjoying this time and the game. \nAnd I'll Tell you I'm hooked, Can't wait for Terra World", "timestamp_created": 1708366280, "timestamp_updated": 1709153192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593384683132171631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158463916": {"recommendationid": "158463916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249959436", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 36945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36849, "last_played": 1709755115}, "language": "english", "review": "TerraTech!\n\nThis is a cute little game made for people who really like building LEGO.

Missions and building factories will also net you some cool stuff.\n\nAlternatively you can play in creative mode/the R&D Labs DLC, which are both fun experiences that give you the chance to build anything you want.\n\nThe game has modding support, ranging from skins to brand-new blocks, weapons, and even more game-changing stuff!

By far the best goofy robot/vehicle builder I've come across. It does have some significant flaws, but the core gameplay is easily good enough to make it worth the money.\n\nPros:\n\n- Very wide variety of weapon, locomotion, processing and utility blocks\n- Blocks are divided into distinct 'corporations' each of which has its own style and strengths\n- Accessible and simple mechanics and style that evolve naturally into more complex gameplay (certain areas are hurt by this simplicity, see cons)\n- The corporation and money systems make for quite a satisfying form of progression in the campaign\n- There are moments that the building system provides that you just don't get from other games. Building a massive crawling resource processor, and then challenging yourself to make it a FLYING massive resource processor and succeeding is fucking brilliant\n\nCons:\n\n- It sometimes feels like the devs sacrificed too much in their pursuit of a simplistic style. This is most apparent in the controls - for some reason they quite significantly limit the customisation you can do in this area. Only a very limited number of keybindings are allowed\n- The camera control is awkward. Trying to fly and target an enemy tech at the same time is unnecessarily finicky\n- It feels like there is a lot of wasted potential when it comes to the campaign. There's no real exploration value to the world, so reaching a point where you can fly or are super-powerful is an anticlimax\n\nAll in all, this is a diamond of a game that could do with a lot of cutting and polishing.

Terratech's maybe a few inches wide, but there's definitely at least a mile of depth here.\n\nIn terms of only an inch wide, the building mechanics are extremely intuitive and easy to grasp, just grab a block with your cursor and connect to a different block via their attachment points. Only some basic physics are simulated like mass, gravity, inertia, but it fits the game very well and allows things to remain intuitive. The campaign and NPCs are no doubt too simplified, and I wouldn't mind a more difficult and varied challenge and a reason to build and experiment, but these are secondary in this game and serve only as a unlock/progression conduit.\n\nOn the other, mile deep hand, the number of different shapes and functions of the blocks makes it so fun and engaging. From getting your first Frankenstein's monster by adding bits of your defeated foes to your own vehicle and letting it grow to a chaotic, unsightly mountain of a monstrosity. Unbalanced, moving on an ill fitting set of wheels and tracks of various sizes and purposes, bristling with random selection of weaponry, everything scavenged from the burning wrecks of your enemies. To your elegant and deadly, streamlined to perfection, pre-planned and carefully crafted, heavily armoured and armed flagship that is maybe a tank, a mining and refining complex, a flying fortress, or maybe all 3 at once. A behemoth that can obliterate any size target from beyond the horizon in a matter of seconds. And everything between these two extremes.\n\nThe building mechanics are vastly improved from the time I first played it many, many years ago. Back then, even building a simple mining, refining, selling structure was a major pain steeped in tedium and frustration. There is rarely any need to alt-tab to check wiki or forums about something specific. Building still could use many improvements though, like drag building conveyor belts, mirror building, exploded view for inspection of deep internals in large builds, modular building - now you can only place blocks one by one (patch 1.5.3 from a month ago introduced a new connecting block that allows modularity though).\n\nWhere the game falls short is the counterpart to its extremely fun building loop, the world where your creations live. There just isn't anywhere near enough challenges and reasons to build and experiment with different types of crafts and structures. The terrain, despite having fairly varied biomes, only ranges from very flat to slightly bumpy, even in the \"mountains\". The biomes areas are very small and scattered around in random patches. The world doesn't change as you travel, you just go, very quickly, through the same bits of grassland, desert, salt flats, hills etc. There's almost never any necessity to purpose build something to allow progression, the entire world just blends into colourful patchwork. I would love it if the biomes were much larger, both horizontally and vertically so that making a helicopter to get to the top of the mountains, or a speeder to get through the salt flats would make sense.\n\nI've had some of the most fun during the Slippery Slope challenge, where you have to build a very specific vehicle and have restricted blocks. After an hour of failing I managed it with a tiny car utilizing a weapon with extreme recoil, mounted backwards to help me move through the obstacle course. I just wish there were more reasons to build something specific as now it boils down to making several blueprints for vehicles - regular tank, hover tank, fast tank, flying tank, and structures - defence turret, charging station, autominer template, refining and selling template. I still had plenty of fun doing those, but the game has so much unrealised potential that it leaves me wanting more.\n\nHaving said all that, not only the devs are still adding new qos features and blocks to Terratech, but they have a new game - Terratech Worlds in development, which seems to be addressing the majority, if not all of my wishlist for this game. I can't wait for that to release.\n\nIn the meantime, I'd absolutely recommend Terratech even at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1703257312, "timestamp_updated": 1703257671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865860641002655029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120646070": {"recommendationid": "120646070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363126821", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 21349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11741, "last_played": 1688320934}, "language": "english", "review": "lego: now with ballistic missiles and high power lasers!", "timestamp_created": 1660523075, "timestamp_updated": 1660523075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855676412582397461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28593264": {"recommendationid": "28593264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154661444", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 22103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10922, "last_played": 1697067835}, "language": "english", "review": "Any Early Access game that listens to its community is worth buying.  This is one such game.\n\nSince I've bought this game around 15 months ago, I've been in a love/hate relationship with it.  I've gone from a positive review, to a negative review, back to a positive review, and now I'm hopefully putting my final word on this...\n\nWhen I first found this game it was like the re-creation of childhood memories of playing with K'nex and legos, building starships and vehicles and battling it out.  It was a concept I wanted to program into a game myself in my early adult life but still haven't laid a finger on understanding 3D graphics.  The hype was real.  I look at the minimum requirements...crap.  I seriously need to upgrade.  I buy it anyway...it runs, choppily, and I play the hell of out for a few months and love it to pieces.  I build a rather large tech I dubbed Juggernaut with an onboard scrapper, refineries, furnace generators, and delivery cannons.  I clash titan to titan with twitter invasions.  I'd almost say the 3 fps slideshow due to my outdated computer made it more cinematic.  I studied flight for days to build a successful quadcopter.  I merrily flew around the entire planet, stopping occasionally to collect loot pedestals before blasting off again.\n\nThen the road got bumpy.  Probably even more so due to own obsession with flight and ambitious base building.  I remind you this is an [b]Early Access[/b] release, and save breaking updates are bound to happen eventually.  But the problem here was...they happened [b]every[/b] update.  Even when they weren't supposed to get broken...mine got broken.  I had a bit of an obsession with flight at the time as well, and getting the parts I needed to rebuild that quadcopter or other key components like lightweight venture brackets could be an absolute nightmare.  Then the bugs came...oh dear lord, the bugs!  I've never sent so many crash reports before.  I backed off for a while, gave the devs some time work out issues.\n\nIt was around when the SCU saw an official release that I made a return to TerraTech.  I was like \"You mean I don't have to pile junk in my front yard anymore?!\"  Around that time the game went on sale, and I feel like they might have pushed an update out early for it because several blocks were missing in the SCU's GUI and it would gobble them up never to be seen again if you threw them in there.  Oh...that and the Megaton Cannon.  The devs decided to completely destroy any balance they had with weapons when they gave the Megaton Cannon a large explosion radius and [b]shield piercing[/b].  Anything you build...kiss it goodbye should you roll up to someone with a few of these game breakers on their tech and you don't have one to shoot them with first.   It was at this point I changed my formerly positive review to a negative one.\n\nFast forward to present day and this positive review.\n-Updates breaking saves?  Gone.  If not fully compatible, won't corrupt the save file giving you a chance to save your techs and bases to purchaseable snapshots.\n-Megaton Cannons?  Nerfed.  A lot.\n-Bugs?  The devs called the Orkin man.\n-New Hawkeye Corporation with actual helicopters (imagine my excitement with my quadcopter obsession >.>)\n-More aggressive turret AI.\n-Guns attempt to fire at an enemy from further away, intelligently arching their firing solution for maximum reach.  It's always been a thing but less noticable due to the range they would target an enemy.\n-New crafting system as well as crafting for all 4 corporations.  Now as long as you get a high enough license grade with a corporation you can effortlessly unlock all of their blocks.\n-Unlocking blocks in general is SO MUCH EASIER.\n-Multiplayer is in the works and should see a release in [strike]February-March[/strike] Delayed for the sake of focusing on content, but not forgotten.\n\nSo to sum up...buy it.\n\n[strike]And devs, if you read this little wall of text, can we please get enemy techs to spawn with FULL batteries?[/strike] Done.\n\nEdits for the typos.\n\nAdded 6/8/17\nSo I went back on this today on the latest unstable branch and was greatly pleased by the increased difficulty.  A GSO grade 4 mission actually felt dangerous as I had to fire my boosters and flee as I was greatly outgunned by 3 shielded opponents.  I'd normally only get to face shields against invasion techs, it's wonderful to see full batteries!  I actually had to add more guns to survive a fight for once.  Oh, and speaking of boosters...their benefit was normally unnoticeable and fuel capacity too little to ever care about.  Now I'll never take them off.

Roll around, kill enemies, snap their parts to your vehicle, rinse and repeat. The difference is that instead of a top-down, Asteroids style game, TerraTech is a 3D, physics based game, with some extra resource gathering and crafting elements. \n\nYou also have a base to protect, bring resources too, and craft from. Resources come in the form of trees, rocks, and various precious minerals, and you collect them by shooting at them, attatching drills or other tools to your vehicle, or even by just getting a big enough car to plow through them. Resources are not stored in any sort of inventory screen, but instead get added to a \"stuff blob\" that floats above tractor beams in your base or attatched to your car.\n\nThe game is still in fairly early development, and any problems I have with it at the moment have to do with the unfinished parts, which will be cleaned up as development progresses. I'm really excited to see where this game goes. \n\nIf you want to see the game in action, I've recorded a bit of it for my channel, which you can check out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz3pda_N_3E&list=UUBo9F0FU148NjZOJFN7rrGQ", "timestamp_created": 1409457523, "timestamp_updated": 1409457523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 224, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818794071674346924", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102860632": {"recommendationid": "102860632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271989642", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 6574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6054, "last_played": 1695851699}, "language": "english", "review": "Watched ssundee play this and loved it since.

As you play you will eventually gain access to refining and crafting wich, while not being that much fun, give you something new to do. It give you a reason to build bigger.\n\nNow the negative side of things.\nI bought this game to play with my brother as it said it was Co-op, wich is a complete lie.\nYes my brother can join my game and have his own tech.\nYes he can help me do missions and defeat ennemies.\nBut!\nHe does not have his own inventory or money. He must use my stuff and is tethered to me like ark used to do in early access. The crafting has been completely remove from Co-op mode, wich removes the purpose of making bases.\n\nBasically, what the devs call Co-op is basically just a player taking control of one of your AI vehicles and following you around the same way and AI would.\n\nPeople asked the devs to fix those issues and the devs said it would be impossible to make Co-op work otherwise, wich is just a way of saying theyre too lazy to do it.\n\nSo overall, the game is AMAZING if you like playing ALONE but is it NOT Co-op.\n\nEdit: After playing 200 more hours, Here is what i have to say.\n1. The game is amazingly addictive.\n2. There is alot more content in the solo campain than there is in the coop one.\n3. Despite my second point, the game is alot more fun in coop.\n4.

You will be one of those contractor pilots, and start from nothing to make your own fortune.\n\nThe main selling point of TerraTech are its really easy to understand, but also fairly deep, vehicle and facility building mechanics, allowing players to build completely customized vehicles from all the blocks found from defeated enemies, mission rewards, crafted with factories, or bought from trading terminals. In this, the game is really excellent, boasting an huge variety of building blocks and components, such as machineguns, electromagnetic railguns, hovercraft propellers, resource collectors, component fabricators, batteries to store energy, energy shields, rocket boosters... if you can imagine something, it probably is in Terra Tech. \n\nBuilding does not limit to a single vehicle, as you can have multiple ones controlled by AI, creating your own fleet that follows you to battle. defensive fixed turrets, material refining plants, selling stations, all this can be built from scratch in a LEGO-like fashion, keeping it easy, but also having depth since efficiency, energy needs and attention not to overload production lines are all factors to keep in mind. \n\nThe world of TT is divided into Biomes, each containing unique resources and terrain formations. Your main activities will be provided by Trading Stations, working also as quest givers, having a list of missions always available to complete, ranging from assassination, escort, base capture to resource collection. Missions are given by different companies, there are four in total, each specializing in different things (mining, combat, etc.) and by completing their assignments, new and more powerful blocks from that company will be available for crafting or purchase. While some missions have some narration to them, there is not a real story in TerraTech, and the \"final objective\" would be reaching the maximum level with all companies, while building the ultimate Tech in the process.\n\nOther than Campaign, also other modes are available, including a PVP oriented one. A very cool feature in TT is the possibility of sending your Tech to invade other players by uploading it to the Steam Workshop, while still keeping it in your campaign (a \"copy\" will be sent). This way, you never know what is coming during an Invasion event.\n\nOverall, I had great fun with TerraTech, and am completely satisfied about how this game turned out from Early Access. The great variety it offers is really exciting and makes you always want to play more to get more stuff, better stuff, more money, more XP to build the ultimate vehicle, or base. I have only one remark about this game, which is the absence of Co-Op, which would be really great.\n\n[quote]Liked this review, and want to see more of the same quality? Check out [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39323490]Tamaster's Review Archive[/url] to see all my Reviews in a single, convenient location.[/quote]\n\n[h1] Gameplay Analysis [/h1]\n[b] General Gameplay [/b]\nGameplay in TT will be divided in mainly Combat, Resource Gathering and Building.\n\nIn the various biomes, there are many rocks, crystals and even plants you can destroy to harvest materials. Each material has a refined form, acquired by using a Refinery to process it; refined materials are more valuable to sell, and necessary to craft more advanced parts. This is why you will generally need to build selling circuits and processing circuits, consisting of silos, resource receivers, factories, refineries and selling cannons, to process all the HUGE amount of stuff you will find, and make money and parts out of it. Some missions also will require you to gather, process and sell high amounts of materials.\n\nBuilding is the crown jewel of TT, and is performed by using an attachment point system, making it really easy and intuitive. Still, building a good tech which does not lack in any particular field requires time, planning and patience in collecting / crafting all the necessary things. Possibilities are endless. Making sure guns fire in the right directions and are not obstructed, having enough power storage for shields and repair bubbles, not overloading the wheels too much are all things you wanna think about.\n\n\n[b] Story [/b]\nThe story is minimal, consisting in sporadic narration in some missions. A lot of lore and backstory can be found in block descriptions. \n\n\n[b] Combat System [/b]\nCombat in TT is simple enough, putting vehicles against each other. All the guns of a Tech will fire together, there are no selection groups, but ammo is always unlimited anyway. The general rule of thumb is: the Tech with bigger guns wins. There are exceptions to this, as a small fast tech can go around a huge but slow one and hit it in its weak side, but generally speaking, the vehicle with most guns strapped to it wins for raw DPS.\n\nWhile not perfect, or completely balanced, the combat is still fun, as blowing enemies in a million pieces and then gathering the remaining blocks for yourself is satisfying.\n\n\n[b] Content & Pricing [/b]\nPriced at 25\u20ac, i'd say this game IS worth it. The content is virtually unlimited, and it will be the absolute joy of building games lovers. Speaking of duration, it takes around 25 hours to complete the main campaign (max out all licenses). Then, creative mode, and other additional ones, will still be available, or just start a new campaign using a different style. \n\n\n[b] Balancing & Challenge [/b]\nSome weapons are very overpowered, such as Big Bertha naval cannon, and capable of instantly destroying all but the most heavy and shielded Techs. You still can find them also on your enemies, but they will not have the same precision of a human player. One of the four companies is basically useless (Venture) and very under-powered.\n\n\n\n[h1] Technical Analysis [/h1]\n\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\nSimple, colorful graphics, with great distance render, and also a lot of physics going around. The style is pleasant and adapts well to this type of game. \n\n[b] Sound [/b]\nGood soundtracks and weapon / machinery effects. \n\n\n[b] Performance & Stability [/b]\nWhen building larger techs, performance can degrade significantly, especially in Building mode, even on high end configurations (i7 4820K, GTX1080, 16GB RAM) leading to very low consistent FPS, in the order of 20-30 even. Also having many mined ores or base parts around degrades performance significantly. Overall it is good, but expect it to worsen as your base and techs become largers. There have been some rare crashes randomly.\n\n[b] AI [/b]\nEnemy AI is actually pretty smart, as smaller and faster enemies will try to get in your blind side to flank you, while heavier ones will attack straight ahead. They even collaborate when in numbers. \n\n[b] Quality of Life [/b]\nNothing to complain about, the game gives you all the tools to build your very own quality of life, such as filters, resource-specific silos, etc. so your imagination determines how efficient and clean performing crafting / mining will be. Menus and UI are alright.\n\n[b] Bugs / Issues [/b]\nNo major issues to report. Good polish.\n\n\n[h1] Conclusion & Rating [/h1]\nTerraTech is definitely one of the best sandbox building games of this year, and an example of successful Early Access. A very good game building fans and creative minds will have plenty of fun playing.\n\n[h1] RATING: 8.0 / 10 [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1534936373, "timestamp_updated": 1607720133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800871729850769043", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14362022": {"recommendationid": "14362022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007324693", "num_games_owned": 725, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2390, "last_played": 1481753309}, "language": "english", "review": "Where to begin?\n\nI have been playing and producing TerraTech videos since October 2014. \n\nThe moment I gazed at what Payload Studios had begun to materialize, it dawned on me that this could be the most innovative and creative game in the years to come. The only way to explain how far it has come is to look back at my original let's play videos, but this is not about looking back, it's about looking forward to what is, potentially, on the horizon for us.\n\nImagine an progressive open world vehicle and structure block building game with moving parts allowing you to build just about any vehicle or structure you can imagine and have it instantly functional WITHOUT the necessity of a \"garage\" or \"build mode\". Everything you do in TerraTech is \"on the fly\" and does not require you to stop playing so that you can build or customize your vehicles and structures. This feature alone makes this completely unique from any other vehicle combat game currently in existence. Include the ability to create flying vehicles, fully customize bases, harvest resources, and activate an army of AI controlled minions to do your bidding, TerraTech then has the potential to be the best combat based block building game ever.\n\nThe game is not finished obviously, and there is much to be done for it to accomplish all of the above really well, but it s still playable and fun. Even after messing around with the newest version, there is a number of things that need to get ironed out right away. So, if you are picking this up now, be aware that you will experience all manner of minor and major bugs. Not to mention, the sounds are still very 8-bit casual, and the soundtrack, although enjoyable,  has only one track so far and it can become a little... repetitive. \n\nMultiplayer is absent here, but it is a promised feature and I would not consider this a finish product until that becomes a reality, so I am crossing my fingers on that one. In the mean time there is a way to \"invade\" other people\u2019s games with your creations via twitter, but it is not a directly interactive way to play with other players yet...\n\nI would highly recommend picking up the Early Access version of TerraTech if you wish to support the development process. If you want all of those features now, perhaps wait a while, but I do believe in the Payload Studios team simply based on their passion and current rate of game development.\n\nI am in no way affiliated with Payload Studios and I have not been given anything. I personally purchased the product in October 2014.\n\nThanks for reading!\nCheck out my channel for more videos. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/DeluksGaming\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0di7oNLhQc", "timestamp_created": 1423276849, "timestamp_updated": 1423399142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798206031322479248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16240422": {"recommendationid": "16240422", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989063449", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 13797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3375, "last_played": 1693311141}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is what you'd get if you put Space Engineers, Minecraft, and Robocraft into a blender, and it's every bit as amazing as that makes it sound.

Yes my review reads like many of the other negative ones. That's because they were accurate and informative reviews. TerraTech isn't a bad game but it isn't a good one either. Saying that a game has \"potential\" is just a polite way of saying its \"incomplete.\" Terratech is incomplete in everything it offers and putting several incomplete things together does not make a complete game.\n\nFirst, all of my time played was during the free weekend. It was also solely spent in campaign. I really do appreciate when developers offer players free weekends to try their games before they purchase. I have bought several as a result.  This unfortunately will not be one of them.\n\nWhat exactly is TerraTech? Is it a building game? Is it an adventure game? Is it a vehicle combat game? Is it a crafting game? For me, where TerraTech falls short is that it's trying to be everything at once and in doing so, misses the mark on everything.\n\nAs a building game it's ok. Creating cars isn't too bad, although moving something that's buried deep inside your car is a pain.  Building bases, likewise is ok.  The camera being fixed to your vehicle, especially if it's a large vehicle makes base building more difficult.\n\nAs an adventure game it's ok. The world is vast but somehow the same. The quests all become repetitive very quickly.\n\nAs a vehicle combat game it's barely ok.  The A.I. is absolutely dumb.  I can't even call it A.I. as I'm pretty sure it just scans in a radius for a player cab and then drives towards it holding \"fire\" until it dies. If you want to not die you better build a gun platform that's stacked with batteries, shields and healing.\n\nAs a crafting game its ok. I like the idea of a crafting base that takes raw minerals and assembly lines it to refine stuff to either sell or craft. But resources have to be gathered and your A.I. bots cant do that for you. They can only follow/guard your piloted vehicle. There's no automation to help you gather resources so you have to do it yourself.\n\nAnd overall, whats the point of any of these? Yes the campaign has a point for new blocks and teaching you things but you could just go to creative mode and mess around with every block and no limits due to money or resources. Why build a fixed base when  you have to drive around to gather resources because the A.I. cant help you? Why gather resources to craft things when most blocks can be bought or scavenged? Why be creative with your vehicles when you're only going to face gun walls in combat?\n\nI tried all of these. Tried making a fleet of mining vehicles that were piloted by the A.I. but all they can do is guard and follow.  This means that they become mobile storage containers but somehow look the same because they need guns in case your piloting the wrong vehicle when an enemy decides to attack you. First enemy encounter I lost because my A.I. storage cars ran into my car at the start and we all got wrecked by mortars. Well, I don't have enough blocks to rebuild anything so I guess I'll just reload my save.\n\nIf you love playing TerraTech, hats off to you. I'm glad you enjoy it and keep on playing.

It's a good game to just mindlessly grind. While it's not perfect it is simple and enjoyable compared to the other games in the market right now. It's good and it's cheap with only the R&D labs i deem as necessary DLC the rest are for skins. and R&D labs is essentially a sandbox that you don't really need. It's cheap so buy it, if it's too expensive then get in on sale.\n\n[h1] CONS: [/h1]\n\n- Parts rotation is dumb: just right right-click it and hope it will be in the position you want. You can place additional blocks around it to \"block\" the other positions, but yeah it's just infuriating have a system were you can select which axis to turn it.\n\n- Story/parts progression: In order to progress you need to do missions, these are provided by those station things (that I forgot the name of) well all in all it's fine, but if you spam missions on one of those stations at a certain point no new story missions will appear and you need to go to a far away station to progress. it's just annoying, hop in your speedy jet and find a far away station to be your next base.\n\n- Poor optimization: I'm lagging from a game that looks less than roblox (lol) but really I'm on a 720p windowed on Fast setting and I'm still getting FPS drops. I can run GTA V on high 1080p @60fps so idk.\n\n- Can't replay finished missions: Good because you can progress, Bad because you can't do them again. Missions that add extra stuff in maps like half-pipes and ramps will disappear. Sucks because some of them are cool and fun, but you can't do them again unless you restart a new game.\n\n- HE is too powerful nerfing them neuters their power: The Cruise \"DOOM\" Missile will absolutely destroy everything from other techs to your own techs. Due to how HE works it can destroy blocks deep within your tech even if you spam other blocks in front of them. But nerfing them (with a mod Nerf explosions i think) absolutely makes them useless it prolongs the battle, which is actually fun but it can be annoying as it takes too long. There's no in between, I still use the mod btw.\n\n-Varying factions with different aesthetics: Hawkeye is full black, GSO looks generic, Geocorp is all yellow. It is fine if you'll make a tech from one faction only. But some parts are so useful that it's difficult to do so. Hence you'll have a black armor with yellow tracks and white guns, not good to look at. There are skins but it is rather limited. Thankfully there are mods for skins.\n\n[h1] PROS: [/h1]\n\n- Simple creation: Drag and drop, while parts are limited with their connection surfaces, there are a lot of them with specific purpose in varying factions. Making a helicopter is usually hard in most games like this, but here it is easier. Still complex and needs to balance it properly but with that one Better Future part that can hold it in place makes it easier to fly. I am a human with a monkey brain I approve.\n\n- Virtually endless map: If you want to make a base but not found the perfect place for it you can just keep going and find that perfect valley for you.\n\n- Bigger is not better: while being big brings a lot of things in the table, a small tech can just hide beneath you and destroy you if given enough time, and you'll lose all that time and creds you spent on it. YOU can do this to bigger techs as well. Shield stops most bullets/shells and missile explode on impact, but HE can penetrate it and do damage AOE style. And energy drops fast if you don't pay attention to it.\n\n- Fun mindless grind: Create a giant tech with one purpose, to split the world in half. While there's no terraforming you can clear forest worth of trees to reap world ending profits. You can alaso make a portable refinery so you can just go around and destroy trees and send it to orbit while moving. It lags a lot though :(.\n\n-Mod support: Base game too limited for you? or is it too boring? don't worry you can spice it up with mods you can even add water.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nA great game to mindlessly grind, there are missions and in the beginning parts and creds are limited. But given enough time and effort you can be a multi millionaire spend all of it in one tech. Only to all of it be destroyed because you run out of energy for your shields lol. You can be creative and make a mobile bunker with a fully working refinery, make a land battleship, or a floating fortress. Heck I've spent 2 hours making a quintuple copter that looks like a drop ship, fully armored of course with guns and missiles out the ass. AND the best thing it functions like an actual heli thankful to that one better future tech. Buy it I highly recommend, get it on sale if you want the other DLCs. Oh and the game is fully released AND their still updating it in the beta, absolutely chads compared to the other indie games studios.\n\nP.S. I think there was an update and so the game broke lol. My mods are not updated I think and I should wait before opening this game again.

It fills my heart knowing that while many of you could be doing literally anything more productive than taking the opinion of another voice in the vast internet noise with anything more than a grain of salt means that my time here has not been wasted. Honestly, I was not expecting to receive a whole lot of feedback, especially from a dev themselves!\n\nI would like to remind everyone that a review is made based on the experience of the product at the time of its conception. I am fully aware of the roadmap provided by the wonderful folks over at Payload, but until that vision is realized, I do believe my stance remains unchanged much to the chagrin of a few less than enthused voices who seem to take offense at a review that by their own analysis will be made irrelevant due to:\n\nQuote\"\nA. The devs are working on it, and probably it will be added into the next update\nB. The devs won't put it into the game because it is a stupid idea.\n\"Unquote\n\nAgain, just because it may be fixed over time, it is not fixed now, and this is a review of the product as is, not what has been promised and many times have not been delivered upon by an innumerable selection of \"potentially\" fantastic experiences.\nNow while you might want to slap the \"Well those games aren't this game\" or \"those developers aren't Payload,\" I genuinely hope so!\n\nNow on to the review!\n\nThere's a lot to be desired in this game. That is in no way a testament to its flaws, rather than to its strengths.\n\nThe creative freedom will have you sinking hours into the game without you realizing it; Optimizing your fleet, base and defenses, factorization, and general experimentation is the crux of this game.\n\nThe campaign is childish at times, with its humor and directive for a seemingly younger audience. However I was invested enough to want to not only unlock the next tier of blocks, but simply see how the game progresses. Some factions definitely have way more thought put into them than others hence why hawkeye is definitely the best faction ala the newbie soldier.\n\nJokes aside, while the single-player campaign is seemingly where most of the development of the game has gone into, mechanics introduced early on and sporadically throughout leave a hollow, longing feeling. Of course by this I am referring to multiplayer.\n\nEnemy techs which will harass you throughout your conquest -for better or worse- are both pre-made and community generated. This adds a potentially layered and complex difficulty curve that not only will inspire your future designs but will test your current design and combat abilities......... if the AI wasn't the equivalent of \"Mouse1+W\".\n\nAs it stands, the AI is dumb as rocks, easily exploited, and do not react well to anything beyond if the player's tech(s) are inside their detection range. Because of this, once you unlock the longer range ordinance you can sit safely on a mountain range several hundred meters away from your objective and lob nuclear fury upon them without so much as a reactionary \"!\". \n\nThis is problematic as the short-range nature of early game can be extremely frustrating for new and inexperienced players as you have no choice but to fight or flee. Likewise, late game, sometimes the XP sound effect would startle me as one of my distant techs one-tapped another \"my first tech\" on the other side of the map, causing me to rip off the last block holding the structure of my new \"Super Battle Tank Deluxe XXL\" together, rendering it into a sad pile of shattered hopes and dreams.\n\nAt least there is an undo button.\n\nBut there is not an undo button for the absolute disappointment that was \"invasions\". \nThe first time I encountered this intimidating countdown and enemy spawn area larger than anything else I have previously encountered had me speeding off to gather my other techs for what I assumed would be the fight of my life.\nThis was it, do or die, another player was attempting to Dark Souls everything I ever loved into oblivion. My heart raced, a light sweat soaked my forehead, my fleet awaited nervously at the edge of the battlefield. And there, from the sky, it came...\n\n\"Garry\"\n\nI couldn't tell if it was bad luck, developer oversight, a glitch, or a combination of the three that such an imposing encounter ended up being me watching an AI controlled tech struggle in vain, only to slump over to one side as it repeatedly climbed the same sand dune until I had decided to put it out of its miserable existence. 1570 (ish) experience appeared above its remains, but only then had I realized what I had always known, but never wanted to admit.\n\nI was bored.\nBut then I realized what I had so desperately wanted, and despite it never being promised, was nonetheless underwhelmed that nobody at payload had considered.\n\nI played a lot of Robocraft when it too first launched into Early Access. The premise of building your own war machine and coordinating in a squad of unique and passionately designed great-wall-of-guns had scratched such a creative and competitive itch no other game had truly provided. Being able to design both a functional and visually appealing design able to best the more crude and redundant gunbeds which littered the playing space was truly an euphoric experience. I suppose I assumed this would be fundamentally the basis of Terra Tech's multiplayer, being so similar in concept, but not all great games think alike.\n\nDespite my love for these types of games, and no doubt my soon to be hundreds of clocked hours, save yourself the time, and skip over this one until it has more thoroughly matured. I believe this game could take the type of building-sandbox it champions and truly evolve into something remarkable, but as it stands.... eh.\n\nEdit:\nI have removed my previous listing of recommendations as most of my concerns have either been addressed or are part of the roadmap per my latest viewing of it.\n\nThe prospect of what has been presented both by the community and the developers themselves is exciting. Every time I see a new update released I am quick to read over the notes in ecstatic eagerness to which one of the more recent had even introduced me to a YouTube personality I quite enjoy.\n\nWith that, I still wish to update this review at a later time when I have sunk many more hours into this game and many more updates have been released.\n\nSo then -you might ask- why do I still insist on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" review? Well I'm glad I asked myself that on your behalf; I would not recommend this title, simple as that.\n\nWith all the other games and experiences out there, all the other prospective new ideas and projects, this isn't a non-recommendation I make lightly. Payload deserves every penny they get to continue support for this game, and in theory, if nobody recommends the game, then Payload get no money, they stop development, and then everyone loses. That's no good, and I would never wish that upon this title.\n\nHowever,\n\nThis is a niche product. Someone who isn't into craft-em-ups is not going to enjoy this genre of game-play despite who might have recommended it to them. But until the AI is fixed, certain weapons/progression is re-balanced, new game/ end game experience is polished, and until the roadmap is closer to its full realization, as it stands, despite what may or may not be promised/conceptualized/rumored, these things do not current exist, hence isn't a game I current recommend.\n\nThank you for coming to my TedX talk on one of my favorite video games!\nTL;DR:\n>Bad AI (Really bad AI)\n>Wonky progression\n>Rough early game, barren late game\n>Updates are slim and mostly consist of bug fixes\n>Larger updates generally contain many placeholders, ideas, but run dry within a few hours of experience\n>\"Multiplayer\" is neat but, like the game, unfinished\n\nReview Character limit : ^)", "timestamp_created": 1561492655, "timestamp_updated": 1577354373, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 300, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754907488822937012", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22005947": {"recommendationid": "22005947", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995481246", "num_games_owned": 897, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 19963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3572, "last_played": 1708718331}, "language": "english", "review": "This is how Early Access should be done. Take note, other developers.  \n\nIf you are reading reviews you already know what kind of game this is.  If you don't then watch the videos or check out others on YouTube.  This review is more about the developers, the state of the alpha, and the general experience of TerraTech.\n\nEarly Access is a crapshoot.  Every developer makes promises of awesome features, steady updates, listening to player feedback, etc.  Most of them fall short of these goals, some fall far shorter than others.  In my experience there are three types of Early Access developer:\n\nGroup 1: The Real Deal.  These people make promises that they know they can keep, or have a very reasonable, educated expectation that they can keep them.  These are the developers who know what they are doing, have a plan, and know how to make it all work.  They have the drive and motivation to get their game out there and they look forward to feedback from the community.  They are skilled game designers and passionate gamers and they exemplify what Early Access is meant to be. This is like the big holiday dinner at your grandmother's house when you were a kid.  The food is great, its prepared with care and skill, and you feel welcomed and wanted.\n\nGroup 2: MEDIOCRE. This group of Early Access developer has some skill, but no soul.  They usually fail to meet some of the stated goals and they almost never involve the community in the decision making process.  They might end up with a playable game or they might not, but the process is often painful for everyone involved.  Updates come slowly and fans don't really feel involved in the process in any meaningful way. Sometimes they make sweeping changes to the structure of the game that result in an experience very different from what the fans paid for. This is like cheap fast food.  It was made by someone who doesn't care about the food, doesn't care about you, and will almost certainly \"forget\" the extra pickles you asked for.\n\nGroup 3: The Snake Oil Salesmen. These developers are one step above criminals.  They are the bottom of the barrel, the worst that Early Access has to offer.  They grossly oversell their game often with little or no idea how to live up to the promises.  They gladly collect the money, release a few half-hearted updates, then disappear into the night.  They often treat upset fans with unwarranted hostility and they usually leave the game totally unfinished. These developers can be criminal or incompetent...or more likely, a lot of both. This is like a street vendor in a shady part of town.  They are selling burritos filled with meat of indeterminate origin and they only take small bills. You might get a decent meal, or you might spend the next 12 hours doing a reenactment of \"The Exorcist,\" but from both ends. Either way, when you return to the spot where you found the food cart you will see only a deserted lot.\n\nTerraTech is at the top of Group 1.  The developers are active in the community, they listen to public opinion and let it gently guide their decision making process, and they are very, very active with updating the game.  When I first started playing this game I found the tutorials a little hard to follow and the world was a little too harsh.  Within a day or two an update was released that clarified the starting quests and made starting out a touch easier.  After getting a feel for the game I found that over time the game slows down due to an excessive amount of spare parts floating around the map.  The very day I went to the forums to complain I see that a new update was released that adds a new block that sucks up all the spare bits and keeps the map clean.  Today I get on and see that they released yet another update that fixes some other minor issues the community has been complaining about.\n\nIf you browse the discussions you will see the developers out there talking to people, answering questions, taking suggestions, and engaging the public.  They don't just shake hands and kiss babies, they are there to work with the fans to make the game better.", "timestamp_created": 1458749115, "timestamp_updated": 1458749115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.752615392208099365", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68829243": {"recommendationid": "68829243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172640226", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 1264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 945, "last_played": 1667001300}, "language": "english", "review": "car go brrrr", "timestamp_created": 1589002830, "timestamp_updated": 1589002830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 49, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751019001007080078", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123661765": {"recommendationid": "123661765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424587221", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 29493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 98, "playtime_at_review": 29220, "last_played": 1712983181}, "language": "english", "review": "I've both had this game for awhile, and played it for a decent amount of time to say that this is on my top 5 of favorite games. \n\nThe game is pretty fun to play, so lets start with some of the major positives:\n-- The main things that makes this game enjoyable for me is the large amounts of creativity you can fit into your techs from making them crazy strong, complex, or just make them look awesome. Personally I've spent lots of time in the creative mode building cool things that are mostly functional. And if your out if ideas, heading to the workshop and looking around can inspire you.\n-- Base Building is another strong point. Making large crafting bases and armored bases is super fun, but this is hampered by the limited building size, but there are ways to get around it.\n\nThere are a lot more positives, but those are just two that I think are pretty key to enjoying the game.\nMoving onto some of the problems, while being small I think the game has a lot more potential in these areas:\n\n-- First of which is the building limit. I found it quite annoying when I wanted to make a mega base but I can see the reasoning behind it with people who might have performance issues with them.\n-- Second is the quests. After doing most of the quests, they become very repetitive and boring, but that usually happens to most games after completing most of the game. But when this occurs is not at the end, but usually when your halfway maxing one of your many licences meaning you get to this point much quicker than you thought.\n-- Lastly is while not being to much of a problem is exploration, While the biomes that you come across are all very cool, I think with a game that you can move around a lot in a openly infinite world can have much more to offer here, Though I know its hard to pull well as this game has done.\n\nThose are just some of my personal thoughts and yeah, very much a 10/10 game if you love making unique vehicle's or tech's in this case.\n\nEdit: Co-op needs to have crafting capabilities as this is a huge part of the campaign in my opinion, which it is currently lacking at the minute \n(Its quite easy to find negatives, but the dev team does an awesome job otherwise)", "timestamp_created": 1665451492, "timestamp_updated": 1665451764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750518918037414551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17238246": {"recommendationid": "17238246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160598370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1396, "last_played": 1577105029}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is AMAZING. its: Creative, fun,addictive, it has CARS, it has GUNS, it has KILLING, it has EXPLOSIONS, it has EXPLORING, it has BUILDING. it has MINING, it has DISCOVERING,IT HAS MUSIC,  it has EVERYTHING from EVERY ELEMENT OF MY FAV GAMES. buy this NOW try it out, and also support Terra Tech on patreon! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/payloadstudios/terratech-physics-based-vehicle-construction-and-c\nTerraTech if your reading this, i love this game..and the music. the music is cool too :3", "timestamp_created": 1437930806, "timestamp_updated": 1437930806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750091493129730225", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35631962": {"recommendationid": "35631962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180211482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8108, "last_played": 1668513974}, "language": "english", "review": "I played for about two days straight, trying to unlock everything upgrading my tech, it was extremely fun, well developed and getting better but the late game got quite repetitive and boring.

The introduction of the Hawkeye Corporation firmly cemented that belief in my mind. \n\nPros:\n\nUnending world- awesome to explore and find new enemies, bases, biomes, etc.\n\nNear unlimited building possibilities- even though there is a limit on how big you can build techs (64x64x64 blocks I think), there are still literally millions of different combinations. I have never had two techs that are the same, even though their purpose may be the same.\n\nImmense potential- this game can and hopefully will do great in the future. The game developers have confirmed multiplayer, and that will be huge. They also have at least two more unique corporations in mind. They have also expanded the game so much since the first time I played it, that I can't see why the game would bog down now.\n\nFlying!- Ok, this is more of my personal thing, but flying in the game is really fun. Only thing is I wish is more effective air-to-ground weapons (other than the over powered Hawkeye Seeker Missiles :D ).\n\nCons:\n\nStill in Early Access- this means the game still has quite a few bugs in it. I myself have experienced everything from corrupted save files to glitches techs. However many of these bugs have been fixed, and are being fixed right now.\n\nCan rush through corporation grades quite quickly- I have nearly always maxed out 3/4 of the corporations in less than a week of playing (about 2 hours of gaming each night). Once you max the corporations out, the game becomes relatively boring since you no longer need to hunt for new blocks; they all unlock automatically.\n\nLimited types of enemies (even with Twitter)- I have encountered all enemies over and over again (some a lot more than others). This is bad when you are trying to find new blocks, especially those just implemented into the game (Hawkeye). Invaders are really the only ways to gain those new blocks, but invaders are quite rare.\n\n\nAll in all I have enjoyed the game, and hope to see it gain more steam (no pun intended) in the future. ;)\n", "timestamp_created": 1479393248, "timestamp_updated": 1479393248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743172883987426758", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78099068": {"recommendationid": "78099068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328324515", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 12255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4851, "last_played": 1693274432}, "language": "english", "review": "--{Graphics}---\n\u2610 What is real life ?\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2610 Addictive like heroin\n\u2610 Awesome!\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s just the gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Starring at walls is much better\n\u2610 Just don\u2018t\n\u2610 Depending on your Friends\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boiiiiii\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n\u2610 Just press \u201aA\u2018\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 You will get faster Challenger in LoL on Asia\n\n---{Story}---\n\u2610 There is none\n\u2610 Text or Audio floating around\n\u2610 Average depends an DLC\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovley\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n---{Game Time}---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 There is no \u201eprice\u201c\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Maybe in Sale\n\u2610 Burning your money is better\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 A Bug's Life\n\u2610 Get a nuke full of bug spray\n\n---{hackers}---\n\u2611 there is none\n\u2610 not much\n\u2610 a few\n\u2610 unplayable\n\u2610 Hackathon", "timestamp_created": 1603579662, "timestamp_updated": 1603579662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743123948574066162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139115505": {"recommendationid": "139115505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797621916", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 152779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 951, "playtime_at_review": 147268, "last_played": 1713213397}, "language": "english", "review": "hours... but its a great game for when i was little, its good for the brain to unleash your inner autism and create what ever you want.", "timestamp_created": 1685228847, "timestamp_updated": 1685228847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740486502647399902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21379560": {"recommendationid": "21379560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213535407", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4103, "last_played": 1704162441}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has it's flaws, but it's a nice game to just play when there's nothing else to play.

But we'll get to those later.\n\n[h1]First let's go over what makes this game great.[/h1]\n\nThe building system is amazing. It offers lots of variety, yet still manages to keep it simple. I don't know of another game that can match it here. Other games either have several additional layers of complexity or have far less flexibility. \n\nThe crafting system is amazing, interesting, and as far as I know, ENTIRELY unique to this type of game. I have never seen one even remotely like it. Easily one of the best, most fun parts of this game.\n\nThe physics and vehicle control are mostly good and fun. Sometimes a bit frustrating, true, but what remotely realistic physics system is not. No complaints here.\n\nThe graphics are adequate. Nothing to write home about, but don't detract from the game either. \n\nThe sound, similarly, is fine. It's not outstanding in any particular regard, either good or bad. It serves its purpose and that's great.\n\nThe PvE progression system is fun and interesting. Yet another feature I have not seen in any other similar game.\n\nThere's probably a few more things that I should add here, but at the moment I don't recall. If I think of more to put here, I will edit this review later.\n\n[h1]Now, unfortunately, on to the less favorable things. [/h1]\n\nFirst up is descriptions of all the building pieces. While they are interesting, they are TOTALLY lacking in ANY useful information. There are no numerical values on anything, and thus it was up to the community to test and figure out exactly what those values are, to determine what pieces do certain things better. And I say this was \"up to the community\" because it would be far too large an undertaking for one individual to figure it all out for themselves. So the information does exist, IF you can find it. But to have it completely lacking in-game is, to me, a fairly egregious oversight and really NOT acceptable. \n\nNext is the terrain. OH GOD, is the terrain horrible. It is hard, with all kinds of sharp corners, edges, step slopes, minuscule small peaks and valleys, and so many knobs and artifacts that huge portions of it in almost all biomes are either entirely impassible with any ground vehicle, or only passable with extreme frustration and much finagling. Be prepared to get stuck everywhere, all the time. Unfortunately, the size of tech does not really matter here, as there are obstacles of all shapes and sizes sufficient to frustrate any and all of them. This is probably why all the newer corps are focused around flying. The only actually usable terrain is the salt flats biome, which (as you can probably guess by the name) is also the most BORING biome. For the love of gaming PLEASE FIX THE TERRAIN. It would be fine to have ONE biome full of difficult or impassible peaks and valleys, but not nearly ALL of them. Pick one to keep, and then flatten out the rest. Not so flat as the salt flats, but more rolling with larger, more gradual hills and valleys. This, more than anything, is what has repeatedly made me Alt+F4 and walk away from the game frustrated rather than close it happily with a smile on my face. Nothing sucks like losing your best tech due to getting stuck on some ridiculous terrain artifact you couldn't see (for the umpteenth time) only to realize the last time you saved was half an hour ago, and the auto-save is from 5 seconds before catastrophe happened.\n\n[h1]That said...[/h1]\nI still feel the positives outweigh the negatives, and if the description of this game sounds like your kind of game, you should definitely give it a try.

There is no AI for helis or planes, just for ground vehicles and hovercraft but even this is poor. Kind of makes a lot of the steam game images misleading because if you're planning on building the perfect jet for dog fighting, you're out of luck, ground attack only.\nThe AI they do have for ground vehicles is shockingly bad. They do nothing but drive in a completely straight line towards you shooting, they don't navigate obstacles like rocks, trees or cliffs. They just drive straight into/off them. They also only activate once you're painfully close. They're visible far before the AI switches on and they just sit there stationary until you get close enough. There are a lot of weapons that out range this AI on trigger so you can just cheese most enemies by shooting them from a distance and they just sit there and take it without moving.\nFriendly tech AI is also pretty basic as only the guard/follow option is available meaning you can't programme techs to harvest resources etc, just either follow you around or guard a location (if you anchor the tech like a turret that is, you can't have a vehicle patrol an area).\n\nCrafting is also (by the developers own admission) janky at best. It's very awkward to try and place things properly, particularly auto miners which for seemingly no reason require you to pick them up and place them over and over and over until you find the sweet spot and it finally works. \nI actually did my campaign run without crafting a single part (except for mission required crafting) and just using the buying stations. I just set some mining stations up for money (which is very tedious and frustrating to do as it is) and bought everything I needed negating the system pretty much entirely.\nOh, and there is no crafting at all in multiplayer because fuck you.\n\nThe building system is very unique and does a lot of things right but it is also infuriating to use at times. Seemingly basic utilities like mirror mode, copy/paste, a proper undo, moving multiple blocks at once (for example a wing that contains multiple parts) are all missing. You work with 1 part at a time, click and drag and that's it. \nThe rotation system is pretty un intuitive as you have 1 single button to control the axis AND the attachment point relative to the tech, no rotation or movement axis drag, meaning sometimes you will sit spamming the button to get finally get the right angle and attachment point of which there are sometimes 10-15+ variations and if you miss it you have to spam press and go through them ALL again.\nIf you try to move a part that is supporting others all those parts fall off, this means if you spend 10 minutes making a wing with lots of parts and attachments then when testing the craft realise it's weight and lift is off, you can't just move the wing as a whole. You have to break it all off and start the wing again in the new location from scratch and then do the same on the other side. Trying to make large vehicles with lots of complex parts is a nightmare because to make things symmetrical you have to do it all manually.\n\nIt's also pretty buggy. The sound would randomly bug and stop working for around 10-15 minutes at a time then come back for no reason. Nothing would fix this, I tried loading a new tech, reloading my save and restarting the game but all that would work was just to ignore it and wait for it to come back. I also experienced several crashes in my 68 hours which isn't so bad but not so great either.\n\nIn conclusion I've mentioned a lot of negative things here and I want to say I don't hate the game, I actually really like it and there are many great things about the game (which you can read about in all the other reviews) but I feel I had to mention this stuff because it goes mostly un-noticed.\nAs mentioned, I would be willing to overlook all this if this game was in early access and when playing at first I thought it was and I was shocked when I checked the steam page and saw it was not. Sadly though, the response from the developers to many of these issues is simply that to fix them or add them would be too complex and that they may as well make a new game to include things like this.\nThis excuse I heard in response to AI aircraft, resource collection AI, moving multiple blocks in build mode, copy pasting blocks and having crafting work in multiplayer and it's frustrating as a player to hear things that would be a huge quality of life improvement for the players and things that are standard in many other games of this type just being dismissed in favour of a new skin pack.\n\nI wish there was a maybe button because you'll likely have a really great time playing this game despite these issues but I feel this had to be said.", "timestamp_created": 1644957406, "timestamp_updated": 1644957406, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735415279865264893", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44054470": {"recommendationid": "44054470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356248890", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 16346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4812, "last_played": 1708059032}, "language": "english", "review": "This used to be my favorite game when i was younger and couldnt wait to buy a computer to play it. so one Christmas my dad bought me and my brother each laptops and i instantly asked him if i could buy a game. and so i did. i bought terratech and fell in love with the soundtrack so i played it everyday with the exception of holidays and special events. after this update i really didnt expect much from the sound track but it made me fall in love over again. i hope you (the devs) see this and think about the impact theyve made with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1533940878, "timestamp_updated": 1533940878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.73535311222076416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1534151217, "developer_response": "This is amazing!

You even get to actively participate in the creation process of the game - there is a thread in the forums where people upload techs that the devs then showcase and put into the game as actual enemies.\n\n[h1]Gameplay [/h1]\nThe gameplay is unique and not boring. It is unique from other \"build-your-own-robot\" games in that there are much less limitations on what you can build, compared to other games similar to this. Some people say it's repetitive. Personally, I think that there is always something to do. For example, I might need to get a certain block, so I harvest the resources to craft the block, head back to my base, fight off an annoying little enemy trying to lay siege to my epic base, craft the block, go complete a mission, and then use the blocks I got from that mission to upgrade by base/tech. It's very fun. TerraTech also now has a creative mode, so if you really want to build whatever you want, you are able to do so!\n\n[h1]Bugs [/h1]\nThe game is still in Early Access, so you can expect lots of weird bugs. But as I previously mentioned, the developers are literally working day and night to squish all these bugs. If you don't want a game with lots of unrefined details and random glitches, then maybe you should hold off until the game leaves Early Access. But personally, I haven't really found that many bugs in the game. It's not nearly as bad as some of the negative reviews say it is.\n\n[h1]Lag [/h1]\nYou DO need a relatively beefy computer. I have close to minimum specs (if not UNDER minimum, I'm not sure how the specs really work though) and my laptop only plays the game well while it's charging. Even though this is the case, I still love playing this game. It does have a lot of optimisation issues, but the devs are working hard to fix them.\n\n[h1]Combat [/h1]\nSome reviewers have criticised the combat by saying that all it involves is slapping a bunch of guns on your tech. In reality, it's way more complicated than that. In order to make a successful combat tech, you need a big tech. A big tech means it will be slow and bulky, so you have to compromise by putting tons of shields and repair bubbles to protect your tech. But these need batteries, which are explosive and take up a lot of space, which means that..... you get the idea. Just jamming guns onto a tech is not always the answer. There are also at least 25 different types of weapons in the game, to suit every play style.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer [/h1]\nThere is no multiplayer. But if you want multiplayer, then NEVER FEAR! Multiplayer has been worked on for months by the devs and is still a work in progress, so don't complain about the fact that there is no multiplayer currently! Be happy that the devs are constantly working on it. You can expect multiplayer for TerraTech by the end of the year.\n\n[h1]Summary [/h1]\nIn the end, TerraTech is a very unique game. It is very fun to play and has an extremely strong community, but it is in Early Access and so it still has lots of unrefined details and it has a long way to go until it is complete. But I don't think you will be disappointed by this game if you buy it. It's a great game to play, it really encourages creativity and it's just fun to mess around with. For it's current price, I reccomend you buy it, if your PC can handle it. Multiplayer is coming out soon, and TerraTech will constantly be improving over the next months or years to come.\n\nIn the end, my score for this game is: 7.5/10. However, I would give it 8.5/10 if I exclude all the bugs and optimisation issues.", "timestamp_created": 1491563171, "timestamp_updated": 1511421565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733698785305023193", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121601603": {"recommendationid": "121601603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416171852", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 37286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33308, "last_played": 1708877850}, "language": "english", "review": "car", "timestamp_created": 1662083664, "timestamp_updated": 1662083664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732686460018157959", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115471649": {"recommendationid": "115471649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800665248", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 4992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3309, "last_played": 1707833212}, "language": "english", "review": "I swear to god if I can't automated everything in multiplayer within the next year I'm gonna kill someone", "timestamp_created": 1652576812, "timestamp_updated": 1652576812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732504665851593018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100638487": {"recommendationid": "100638487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048129050", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 9061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8095, "last_played": 1697015083}, "language": "english", "review": "Destroy the competition, peak capitalism, more money", "timestamp_created": 1633551290, "timestamp_updated": 1633551290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732462942600250244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130070397": {"recommendationid": "130070397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054673316", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5994, "last_played": 1673809942}, "language": "english", "review": "It has been nearly 3 years, and they still haven't added the Refiners/Crafty Mike to multiplayer.

I can build machines for hours and hours. Machines that fly, machines that race. Machines that are particularly good at murder.

Anyway, I'm getting off track. If you want story, progression, cool item drops, or anything else cool, you will not like this game. It is equivalent to the relatively early days of Minecraft before all this Ender Dragon nonsense where all you could do is run around and punch animals. This game has enormous potential, it is a blank slate for hundreds of fun ideas to be slathered all over it. It could be an MMO/Action RPG with awesome special items and weapons with different buffs and debuffs to snap onto your vehicle. It could be a singleplayer/co-op Pikmin-esque \"gather pieces of your spaceship so you can fly back home\" kind of game. But before anyone gets excited, this game has been in development for over a year and a half and there is still almost nothing too it. This is most of the reason why I hate Early Access and Kickstarter, because I could have experienced this awesome game way in the future when it had actually been finished, instead of now in its extremely unfinished state, where I am begging for something that will come when I have forgotten the game completely. I am really hoping this game disappears from my memory so I can come back in 3 years and be amazed at all the new awesome stuff. But for now, sure you can go hunting for special items and make loads of dosh but in the end it doesn't mean anything. There is no goal. For me that is an almost deal breaker. But luckily the many hours I've played of this game have been some of the most enjoyable of my life. And that is why I am desperately hanging on to my faith that the developers can do it, that they can complete the game and make it something truly outstanding.

Haven't had this much fun in a long while.  Since I was enjoying the demo so much I bought into the game.  The gameplay in the main game didn't let me down either.  Nonstop fun right from the start.  3 days into the game and 27 hrs to show for it.  The time just flew by.  The game can be real intense at times.  Especially when it comes to combat with much larger enemies. LOL I used my little starter vehicle (after my big one died) and managed to kill it , though I did die about 4 times in the process.  didn't take long to learn how to build the base and start collecting the resources.  Found just about all I needed on the forums.  I think the learning curce is fine just takes some effort to learn how things work. I already knew that some aspects of the game were not working, but I'm confident those things will be done.  Making games like this doesn't come easy.  Great job to the Devs.\n\nNow I did encounter some issues while playing, then again this is early stage developement and feedback is important.  I would just like to point out that the frame rate dropped considerably many times. Mostly when engaged in franctic combat with the enemies in large vehicles.  Though I think you may already know this.  Is there a way to inprove this performance on my end.  My computer system is well above the recommended system requirements.  Also I would like to know if you intend on fixing the sound, it only has one track of music.  That doesn't stop me from enjoying the game, but it would be great if I could only turn off the music and not lose the environment sound as well.  Great original concept.  For those who keep losing your resources while moving about, try using the slower wheels. The venture fast wheels make the vehicle to fast and that is why things keep dropping out (personal experience.\n\nI hope to hear back from the developers, you have a very good game here so I hope you polish the contents.  As far as multiplayer goes it's another milestone.  You need to bear in mind that the game does lag under the stress test and multipayer would not be a fun experience.

I got this game for free for reviewing purposes > [/b]\n\nPlease take care before buying this game.\n1 - It is on its early stages if you are looking for a polished finished game this is not the game you're looking for.\n2 - If you are looking for a robotics sandbox game with on-going content and unlimited fun in designing your desired robot AND like to support devs Then this is the game you're looking for.\n\n\n[h1] MEGA review update [/h1] \n[i] The game is celebrating 1 year take off, And they reduced the game price to 19,99$ and the dlc to 9,99$, I think this is pretty great from the devs to do such thing, And hoping it would bring more buyers after they read this or other reviews [/i]\n[url=http://terratechgame.com/celebrating-a-year-on-the-off-world/] Source[/url]\n\nSo now to the game.\nI am satisfied with the content it has for now, Although the price is high and also with a VERY early Dlc ... I am still loving it.\nThe game so far is an open world mode, With enemies all over and a few objectives to complete and follow.\nKill the other robots to harvest their gear and tech or whatever, and to keep on upgrading yourself further and further, And you can use special techs to turn materials into money and other useful stuff.\n\n[b] Note worthy update 1# 3/31/2015 [/b] \nA few bugs were fixed among the journey, Added a few more content, and a few balances.\nBut it seems that the game still suffers from bad optimization, It seems that I keep getting fps drops every now and then.\n\n7 Challenges, I like the flying challenge, you create an aircraft and see how long and high you can go, Keep beating highscores and try to reach for the highest rank.\nAnd also a racing challenge which is fun and others.\n\nI also own the dlc, And its really cool because it is a huge white room with unlimited techs to create WHATEVER you want, And also it gives you exclusive access to the experimental techs the devs are currently developing, And a few rams and stuff to test it on.\n\nYou can make your robot move by adding wheels, just thought i'd say this if you think you can give it legs and make it walk normally, This game reminds me so much of that battlebots combat competition where they create a small remote controlled robot and battle each other.\n\nI have a lot of time spent on The dlc mode and the challenges over 5 hours on them alone but since my internet goes off a lot steam did not record it all but yeah you will spend a great deal of time if you like that type of thing.\n\nSharing my creations with People on Twitter is not really my cup of tea, but others might like it, you can load their creations and use it in the challenges or the Dlc mode and they can use yours.\n\nSimilar to dark souls you get invaded by other player's character's except they are not controlling it, its an asynchronous multiplayer type, so they are controller by AI, which brings me to the point of AI being very clever and tough in this game their movement are really good you cant drop your guard down next to them.\n\nThe world is really colorful the music is similar to bastion (  Just 1 soundtrack from bastion not all ), The animations and ointment are also great, I also have a feeling that with the more progress they go with the game will be a bit more demanding on your Pc ( Its not currently demanding at all , was able to run it at my corei5 4gb gt635m Laptop nicely) \n\nPros : \n1 - An open world filled with colors and enemies, although its not that done yet but it is pretty great.\n2 - Great music, animation, ai, design and all is looking good so far.\n3 - Unlimited creativity to create what you please.\n4 - Unlimited fun at the DLC and the challenges.\n5 - Very promising roadmap not too big for them from what it seems, and once they reach it , the game will be soo good.\n\nCons : \n1 - While driving in reverse the control changes a bit unlike any other driving game, I mean its no biggie but still.\n2 - Though its still on its early stages, it already has a 16$ -> [b] now its 9,99$ ][/b] Dlc that should be included with the game itself because its actually fun.\n\n\nYou might expect me to write more cons thinking ( The game is still early ) \nWell yeah but please think of it this way, If you buy an early access game and get bothered with the little content it has thats your fault because you should know what you are getting before you get it, and this is the point of all my reviews, Is to help the buyer to see what they are getting themselves into to avoid the Buyer's Regret \n\n\nSaying it again.\nIf you buy this game expecting a fully polished experienced you will get disappointed.\nbut if you are an early access type of guy and wants to support devs you'd like this game if you are into sandbox robot tech building, this game sure has it good on that side.\n\nSo recommending it for he/she who meets the requirements I just said.\n\n\n  [i] This review was written while i was a part of the original traders group OTG, however you can trust that the review was not effected by that fact, I was not forced to lie or anything, you can read it and judge for yourself, all my reviews are honest and I am no longer a part of the group.
