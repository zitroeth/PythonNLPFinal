The game is still in its early stage and is beautiful and magical, flying around is nice but when it come to crafting and building, the parts i most enjoy in those kind of game, its a burden.\n\nLet's talk stat and about the last DLC Dragon Cove. To build a house in stone of course you need stone block and for stone block you need stone. Lets make some math:\n\nFor one square of stone foundation you need 8 Stone block (3 Stone per Block for 24 Stone total) and 4 plank (1.3 log, 1 log give 3 plank). So for only 1 modular part you need those and we need around 3 minute per stone block to be create in the furnace SO it take around 24 minutes for 1 modular parts.\n\nThis is where it become a burden.\n\nLet's say you and you friend wanna build a cool house together, you'll need let say a house of 6 foundation block per 6 foundation block square (36 Foundation block, 288 Stone) lets add some wall to this and make it 6 tile high because you might wanna build a second level to that neat house (288 Stone).\n\nSo lets stop there, you have a square with wall that cost you around 576 Stone that you need to create in the furnace each time with 3 stone each for a total of 1728 stone (That you need to pick each one by one) and 28.8 hours of waiting before you get the mats!\n\nOH AND I'm NOT FINISH........... you don't have a roof, stair or anything else!!!!!!! and i'm not counting the time it took you to gather alll those rock!!!!\n\nIt become insane the amount of stuff you need for this and i haven talked about the armor and creature you need to kill to create them................\n\nWell its a good game and i wont play it anymore sadly........ until the fix the amount or drop rate or jsut add a drop amount in the dedicated server so that we can adjust it our self.\n\nThat said, i'm still waiting for my 7th floor piece! think i'll get it next year! cya then!......\n\n-------EDIT---------\nFew comments, sad one, made me realise that some of my point were not very clear, all of the up review is based on the fact that there is only 1 furnace build and yes you can built multiple one that help go faster, my point is i like to compare basics elements and make it clear what you get by having simple base element etc.\n\nThe issues here is not really the furnace because yes i use it but the  is some others issues that i think people haven consider in the comment section:\n\n-You still need hundreds of rock pick one by one(taking time to gather)\n-You need plank and so cutting wood and converting them(taking time to gather)\n-You will need to kill a lot of creature for the roof, stair and windows parts(taking time to gather)\n-You need to mine a lot of element for some specific parts.(taking time to gather)\n\nDon't get me wrong i like a good farming but i also like my build to evolve. Always felt that in all those crafting game (7 days to die, vlaheim, Conan, satisfactory, Space Engi, V rising etc. ) i always get the feeling that i'm doing something that evole in a time span where the balance between gather and craft is well made. i got the feeling they haven play their own game to test it out.\n\nIn anycase it's always a good habit to try it out your self so go ahead and try it out, i'll go on something else while you are making your foundation house in the next days!\n\nCheers!", "timestamp_created": 1673585192, "timestamp_updated": 1676650130, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 307, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892833948135375977", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140020270": {"recommendationid": "140020270", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970719258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 4892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4866, "last_played": 1696686379}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has potential but I'm concerned they will never finish it.  I paid for a rented server and played it PVE with my buddy for a few months, finishing off the first two maps.  While waiting for the next update I built houses and farmed materials preparing for the next big expansion.  After a few months they added *one* new boss. After that, instead of continuing with their PVE maps they switched to working on a PVP mode and wiped out all my structures and character progress.  I visited the new public servers but they are ghost towns.  There are many abandoned player-built structures making what should be a magical place, a wasteland.

I often find myself sacrificing my souls instead of having to fly a few islands to the closest portal. The inventory management is a clogged mess, almost no QoL are present like having to stare at a cauldron to brew potion/food 1 by 1. (They changed the furnace why wasn't it changed for the other stations as well) The talent tree / leveling system while trying to split into 3 distinct branches is all mixed up. The combat is a bit lackluster but i wouldn't mind it as much if the melee spec wasn't so gimped. (no hit impact just as an example) The building pieces are way too few and simplistic for my taste, the cold mechanic is unintuitive, the whole plant growing / repair cost loop is not an enjoyable grind to me (I have to gather mats to smelt items that will repair my equipment but i lose durability in the process) etc etc.\n\nEvery issues i currently have with this game seem like they could be addressed if they are indeed issues and not by design, but as things stand right now, this is one early access title that i probably won't touch again until its 1.0 release.", "timestamp_created": 1672334106, "timestamp_updated": 1672344156, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 142, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.882328808307647705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129174634": {"recommendationid": "129174634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039673913", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 847, "last_played": 1681941501}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game, but I just can't get what developers want to achieve.\nThe last thing that made me realize I've had enough: Iron ingots which take 8 minutes to craft each [strike]and you can't queue it[/strike], you have to stay before furnace and wait.

If there was a neutral button I'd probably put this game there.\nProbably better to wait for more content or full release. Needs a lot of balancing. \nDevelopers seem to be paying attention to feedback and doing regular QOL updates, so that makes me feel hopeful for the future of this game.\n\nCombat feels slow, so knowing they've already sped it up makes me wonder how slow it was before. Melee feels terrible, enemies don't get knocked back or react to your hits. Spent all my time shooting things with the bow because at least then you get bonus crit damage for attacking weakpoints. Didn't carry a staff at all because of the severely penalizing weight system currently in place, it wasn't worth it. If I needed flame damage I hit things with my torch. Not to mention the higher tier your equipment is... also heavier? Making the new backpack upgrade not as nice as I thought it was going to be. \nThis should be the meat and potatoes of the game, but something is off.\n\nBuilding is very, very limited. There aren't many pieces to work with. The degradation system is currently poorly implemented, so much so they've disabled it to stop at 30%. It takes a lot of resources just to build a small house, trying to keep up with repairs on top of that would be a nightmare. It would not be in any way fun to have to constantly repair your house. Either there needs to be actual base defense, or they should scrap damage by weather entirely. There are defense parts sold by a merchant, but they are gated by rare relics instead of gold.\nThere also isn't any way to prevent trees from spawning in your house if you've happen to build where they respawn. Enemies also respawn within walls you may build, so it can be tricky to build in a safe location. Important to take note of all spawns before building.\n\nFood system is pretty good. Recipes are simple and combine two ingredients for effects. (phys/poison/eletric/fire resistance, stam bonus, healing bonus, speed bonus, etc.) It was fun discovering new recipe combos. They take awhile to cook though, so if you're making a lot of food at once, better to have multiple camp fires set up. Ingredients are abundant so it doesn't take more than a few minutes to get more than what you need.\n\nPotion making is a chore. You have to craft a water skin every time you want to make a potion (it is not re-usable and is used up), then you have to fill the water skin, then also have the other ingredients. Definitely make a teleporter or build next to a well to alleviate a step. Kill every little nibbler dragon you can, because you're gonna need a lot of that leather.\n\nFlying feels pretty good, but the stamina bar is a limiter. Makes it more of a puzzle trying to guess how far you can get to that island over there, and whether you'll make it to an air currently or outcrop in time. Food stam buff didn't seem to help much. Didn't test if stamina potions can save your life, but probably. Considering potions are such a pain to make it made me hesitant to use them.\n\nBest part of the game is the aesthetic. The visuals are really good to look at, the game is very pretty, everything is well designed from the enemies, to the character armor and weapons. The world is fun to explore. NPCs seem limited at the moment, like the quests for most of them aren't implemented yet, but that's to be expected in early access. Most of them are currently just lore flavor. I enjoyed piecing together the story from the tablets, monuments and dialog. The world building is overall quite excellent.\n\nI've spent hours grinding in Valhiem without complaint, but for some reason in this game it feels like molasses with little pay-off for the labor.\nThere's some good bones here though.

Apparently people are not able to change their negative reviews to positive ones, or just delete them, when what they complained about is fixed. Here goes:\n\nFirst, i read alot about the crafting being too slow. They changed that in a patch. The crafting still takes some time, but it's absolutely acceptable. Cooking doesn't require you to stand next to it, and the crafting stations that you *do* have to stand next to, take like 1.5 Seconds to craft one item. Some crafting is instant aswell.\n\nNext, ranged weapons (Staffs and Bows) are useless and unplayable. Honestly, i don't know if these people played a different game, never played a game before or were on something. Ranged weapons are more than viable, actually i only had a couple encounters where i preferred melee weapons. Yes, ranged weapons break quite quickly, losing roughly 1 Durability out of 100 per shot. However, there is a talent to reduce that decay, and also bows deal incredible damage. Staffs deal a bit less. Tho, you can really kite basically every mob in the game quite easily if you want to, making ranged weapons, imo, a bit op even.\n\nSo i just wanna go a bit into what the game offers.\n\nCombat System: Nothing special really. Dodging, blocking, attacking. Quite simple and a bit too easy. Blocking doesn't punish you at all and is the go to in melee. Also feels somewhat clunky, cause you can't really tell when you're locked in an animation and so on. Otherwise, it's solid and definitely better than just spamming left click.\n\nThe Building. Time consuming is the way i'd put it. It's very similar to Valheim, using structure stability as a difficulty. There is not much more to say. A building system like many games have done. Nothing super special to mention here.\n\nExploring and World-building. This one is different. The map is basically a prologue map, which is one huge chunk of land floating in the air. After that you'll unlock flying as shown in the trailers and you'll fly from small island to small island in the next zone. I think the idea is neat, but there is not really enough reason to explore the islands right now, except for a couple collectibles and quests. Nothing really stands out, if they changed these isles to a solid landmass, it would feel the exact same. \n\nThe flying. To put it short, i like the idea. However in practice it's a bit exhausting. You will fly from island to island with your stamina bar, you can't go on longer trips which i think is a missed chance. Afaik there is no talents to buff flying. I would like the flying to be a bit more... free. It's limited because you can only go certain ways, not wherever you want. If you want to get to island C, there is a high chance you gotta land at Island B because your stamina won't last. Doesn't sound bad on paper, and really isn't a huge problem. Over time it does get exhausting tho. Also some islands have barriers which cause you to be unable to fly. It can be a bit frustrating, however it is to prevent cheesing to much, if i had to guess.\n\nAlot of the things you'll do will feel like a chore, sadly. However all in all i wanna remind that this is an early access game, released just last year. There is alot of effort put into this game no doubt. If the devs stick to the game like this, and continue to work it out, it will definitely be a good one.\n\nIs it worth 30 Bucks right now? If you're desperate for a new Survival action RPG, yes. Otherwise, no. Wait for a sale or further development. Still i will recommend it, cause it's a good game and it really feels like this is more of a passion project than just a cash grab.

It does a lot of things good and it does some bad. The reason that I've chosen to not recommend it after 9 hrs played is as follows;\n\nIt's gameplay loop is centered around combat and progression. But you're far too stuck in the repetitive cycle of having to scavenge every little bit of scraps from enemies and those same respawning enemies over and over, to get anywhere progression wise in terms of stats or tech opportunities. The burden on the player is far too high relative to the feeling of reward you get when you get over that hurdle. Also there are some annoying bugs that they need to fix. But except for that one which doesn't let me damage mobs sometimes, nothing really bothered me that much. The combat is not enjoyable in the long run. And considering how much you have to grind to at least FEEL like you're getting something exciting out of it, you're bound to get burned out from it. As I was. \n\nIf I was allowed to make changes to this game I would reword the combat, OR I would introduce some actual skills into the game that allows the player to express themselves more than spamming left click on whatever weapon you're using when you have the stamina for it (an annoying and tedious resource in this game). I would also rework the loot system. I find my self not giving a shit about chests. I have to subject myself to way too much combat for the resources I need to craft gear (for example fabric and other \"pelts\"), which is quite frustrating with this combat system.\n\nLevel design, music/visuals, quests all good. It's just that you never end up feeling rewarded really. The player has little to no creative expression in combat except abusing bugs or getting pegged by them. And the loot is very irrelevant except for advancing crafting/tech. Stats are uninteresting and prove very little variation, if any, in contemporary loot tiers. Just having inventory weight makes this experience 10x more tedious as well. Bed doesn't let you sleep through the night ffs. \n\nFelt like I was getting cucked out a good fantasy RPG experience really. Sad to see, and I hope the devs turn it around so I actually want to play this again some day.\n\nEdit: For context, this is the type of game I would like to love. In these days where dark fantasy prevails, I miss the old high fantasy games and settings in any genre. I love them like you would not believe. And considering that in the open world survival crafting genre (a genre I also love), there is a DISMAL lack of any ambitious fantasy game (and I believe that there is a good untapped market for it), it's just another disappointment to be honest. I am still waiting for what this game wants to be. \n\nAlso, it does have skills, but it's scarce, and it takes forever to get them. Another thing I'd like to mention in regards to this review, is that it's a singleplayer frame of reference. As such, the grinding issues are probably a result of the game not being balanced for solo play, which I believe should be the baseline for any game.

Below I will state everything I think that is wrong with this game and the issues I have encountered.\n\n[h1][b] What is wrong with the game [/b][/h1]\n\u26abThe combat is a joke and has clearly never been re-thought or re-worked even though us players that have been pledged to the game have asked for changes, they did not listen. Its clunky, boring, slow and just stupidly tedious at times. \n\u26abThere are way to many server issues to even account for. This one should be obvious to any Early Access title game so get ready for this one.\n\u26abThe base building is just atrocious. I cannot say how bad this feels. It is not a good system. You open up one menu to scroll to select and then it randomly close's on you... what?!\n\u26abThe Enemies could have some better animations, Variety and Uniqueness to them but what we get feels like a copy and paste fest of the same enemy, just a few tweaks.\n\u26abEDIT #1: They recently have to give refunds to the community (US PLAYERS) due to the fact that you CANNOT actually go into a PUBLIC server. They only have LOCAL and Private servers. YOU HAD TO PAY FOR A SERVER. WHAT!?!?!?! Here is a link: https://steamcommunity.com/games/715400/announcements/detail/3443593298797211757\n\u26abEDIT #2: Local play is a joke. You can only have 4 players and you CONSTANTLY disconnect. There is no optimisation or testing been done here.\n\u26abEDIT #3: To play with 10 people you have to jump through loops and hoops like a dog. Its a \"cumbersome renting process, high fees and insane delays\" the devs said. Look - https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/715400/view/3443593298796653788\n\u26abEDIT #4: I recently got a Fig email UPDATE #9 since I was a backer I get these.

In some cases it's good--grinding for gear is fine. Just time consuming enough to be a bit of a time sink, but not so out of reach you need days to complete an outfit.\n\nBut building is a whole other story. It is extremely difficult to get a moderately sized house at tier 2 and 3 building. For tier 2, you need to leather to make windows (why?) and roofs (why???), and the enemies that drop that leather are difficult and time consuming to face unless you're farther into the game, at which point you probably aren't even bothering with tier 2 building anyway. On top of that, you need 4 leather for a window, and enemies do not drop multiple leathers, so you need to fight 4 of these things each time if you want a WINDOW.\n\nIt sucks because the building is just interesting enough to make some cool designs like in Valheim, but not overly complex that I'm scrolling through pages of options like in Conan Exiles or 7 Days to Die and being overloaded with choices.\n\nMe and my boyfriend are playing privately together, and with the combat and gearing we've found the grind to be just fine, but building is SUCH a wall to climb it's starting to feel like we shouldn't even bother with making a home at all. Which sucks! I love building, dammit!\n\nIn terms of performance, had a couple FPS drops in some places, but that's it. The first time you load in it's quite laggy, and then it's smooth sailing the rest of the playthrough. No loading screens, either, which is nice.\n\nSomething about the game keeps me wanting to play, and I can't put my finger on it. It's fun, cute, and the NPCs are honestly pretty enjoyable. A sword on vacation, a spiteful talking chest with sibling problems, an amnesiac skeleton, an enormous dragon space deity--they're all quite memorable to me. I love finding new NPCs to chat to because I know they're going to be a bit quirky. The Animal Crossing-esque dialogue noise is also cool to listen to.\n\nCombat is simple--click to attack, click to block, hold attack to use a charged up attack, press a key to dodge. Mage, archer, melee. No combos or anything, but apparently that's going to change in an upcoming patch. I don't think combat needs to be overly complex to be enjoyable, though. I'm having fun fighting enemies.\n\nThe game seems to have heart put into it, which is always refreshing. I would definitely recommend picking it up, but for the love of god, fix the build grind.\n\nEDIT: I just reached iron ingots, and I take it back. 3 minutes per ingot?

Survival game combat systems tend to be pretty simple, and with that said, I thought the combat was appropriate for the game. Shields would be nice though since there is active blocking.\n\nI thought the game was far more interesting than other survival games due to the RPG influence with quests. It was a breath of fresh air really. I would like to see way more of them. \n\nThe complaints I have are regarding the building system, survival stuff, and gold. If you want to attract more people to this game, the building system needs far more pieces to work with. And decorative items. Valheim is again a great example of a simple but robust building system that allows builders to really crack out. Survival; the game needs more challenging survival aspects such as hunger and thirst. Gold; simply not enough of it, or, lower the costs for blueprints. The gold farming required to buy stuff feels more grindy than a Korean MMO and I was really irritated by it. \n\nI would recommend this game to my survival gaming friends.

Attack, block, and some kind of special. \nDecay of especially randed weapons in FF is actually brutal, to the point where it more or less forced me to go melee. Especially because the repair cost of advanced items in Frozen Flame is very rough. Whereas in Valheim you only need a roofed work bench of high-enough level.\nStamina plays a similar role in both games.\nTravel in FF feels a little more convenient, although portals in valheim make up for a lot.\nHaving had far more development time, Valheim definitely feels better balanced. \nBuilding in Valheim allows for more creativity, it's less flexible in Frozen Flame. And getting 100% resource cost in Valheim, as opposed to 50% in Frozen Flame, makes me appreciate Valheim more.\n\n\nThe good:\nAmazing artstyle and simple but fun combat.

Combat, at the moment, feels a bit sluggish with room to improve needing a speed up of animations, projectile, dodge and block times.

With the already in the works pipeline for expansion and flight I haven't even unlocked yet, I can't imagine it will disappoint. \n\n[b] Combat [/b] \n\nSo this is what had worried me most from reviews since everyone stated combat was clunky. If you have played a majority of Survival/RPG games this Combat system is fine. As someone with too many hours on Dark Souls I thoroughly enjoyed swapping between weapons for optimized damage, Ranged is super easy to use and melee isn't punishing if you know how to dodge and block. Magic I'm still toying with. Ultimately it comes down to Stamina Management, Git Gud.\n\nWith that being said are there things that could change? Absolutely. The talents need a More Expansion to make combat more fluid, some of the animations for attacks are like .5 seconds off, weapon variety could increase (and may later on). Enemies could have more than 2 attack patterns or more variety of enemies to spice things up.

Yet | Quick Review [/h1]\n\nVideo review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-AMzWxAuMY\n\nFrozen Flame is a survival adventure sandbox game a la Valheim set in the vibrant (if slightly generic) world of Arcana, an ancient land steeped in magic both good and evil. For you see, Arcana has been beset by the Faceless\u2014a mysterious evil entity who has spread a nondescript curse across the land and, you guessed it, you're the only one who can stop it. If this premise sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it is, but it\u2019s not why you\u2019re really here, is it? No, you\u2019re here to say \u201cforget the Faceless,\u201d I want to build cool houses, cook cool meals, kill cool bosses, and just generally lose myself in a fun fantasy world, maybe with a friend or two. And if this is indeed what you're looking for in a game, congratulations! You have pretty much found it. Because Frozen Flame checks all of the boxes that fans of the survival adventure sandbox genre have come to love and expect. \n\nFor example, there\u2019s a fairly robust building mode that allows you to create the fantasy home of your dreams. Or, if you\u2019re like me and lack any semblance of architectural prowess, the tiny prison cottage of your nightmares. There\u2019s also a decently deep crafting system that allows you to (after gathering all the requisite resources scattered about the world) hit all the fantasy crafting highlights: armor, weapons, makeshift shelter, you name it. And finally, Frozen Flame invites you to get experimental in the kitchen\u2014or bonfire, rather\u2014as no two ingredients will produce anything short of an edible, health-restoring meal, with some perks thrown in for flavor. \n\nSo, after gearing up and grabbing an NPC quest or two, it\u2019s time to hit the road and see what Arcana has to offer. There are time trials to complete, collectables to collect, jumping puzzles to jump, and vistas to... vist. Occasionally, you\u2019ll stumble upon the game\u2019s narrator\u2014a fairly forgettable \u201cyou are our last hope\u201d kind of lady that appears as a white raven\u2014and she\u2019ll bestow you with unsolicited lore about the land. \n\nAnd all that (the cooking, crafting, building, and aimless exploration) is about it as far as what I would call Frozen Flame\u2019s strengths. So, if you've been sitting there muttering to yourself, \u201cJust hurry up and tell me what there is to kill and how to kill it,\u201d I\u2019m afraid I have some bad news: at least at this stage in Early Access, Frozen Flame\u2019s combat is a bit shit. There\u2019s no optional target lock a la Dark Souls, so many of your attacks and abilities will either stop well short or sail right past the enemy. If you do happen to land a blow, the actual attack animations and associated sounds don\u2019t combine to create anything particularly impactful. It\u2019s also easy to cheese some of the bosses, as they won\u2019t always aggro you if you stand just outside the zone of the fight. If you do manage to catch one's attention, contrary to what I thought for the first several hours of playing this game, there is a dodge but you wouldn\u2019t know it if you\u2019re playing on gamepad, as the controls aren\u2019t re-mappable, and nothing seems to be the dodge button by default. So, please play on mouse and keyboard if at all possible. Finally, I was thoroughly whelmed by just the number of enemies on display\u2014outside of some little forest goblin dudes, skeletons, and the occasional jelly blob, there just isn\u2019t much to fight. \n\nCouple all this with semi-consistent lag spikes and Frozen Flame is currently, in my opinion, more frozen than it is flame. \n\nOf course, all of these design flaws are subject to change, even by the time you watch this quick review. Take it from me\u2014I received my Frozen Flame review copy on November 3rd and spent a whole week playing the game before an update completely reset my progress and tweaked a few features, including a redesigned ability tree and a much better tutorial. So, all that to say, while Frozen Flame probably isn\u2019t worth your time, yet, this is a game that the devs have been feverishly working on for five or so years now, and I think it has a bright future. I'm giving it a tentative score of 2.79/5 (full scoring breakdown in video) and am looking forward to revisiting Arcana at full release. \n\nRoadmap: https://sharing.clickup.com/b/6-19289618-2/board", "timestamp_created": 1668698177, "timestamp_updated": 1668698253, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 119, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667027115821838379", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140195235": {"recommendationid": "140195235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079275290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1674, "last_played": 1686975521}, "language": "english", "review": "Tried to play on a self hosted dedicated server like every other survival game, only to learn that it wasn't *really* a meaningful way to play the game and nothing is explained.

There is no weight or impact at all and still, even in the \"beta\" they just launched Melee still sucks and is utterly boring. I really cannot play more than an hour with the combat as bad as it is.\n\nNothing going story-wise or anything interesting to explore at least in the new mode for survival. It's basically just running, gathering resources, and going in at night because you freeze quickly. There seem to only be 2 or 3 zones, a sea with islands, a Frozen reused asset wasteland, and the same floating islands. This is 30 bucks? There is no mounts, pets, taming, interesting fight mechanics, or real progression at all.

I also think i get the feeling for what the devs are trying to accomplish but more updating is surely needed. But! with that said, i think this game could very easily be a hit.\nI get the feeling that the devs are trying to bring together a perfect balance of RPG and survival in one by putting a spin on some things. I get the feeling that they want it survival but without all the time \"wasting\" that a lot of other survival games make you micro manage. But at the same time, they are trying an RPG vibe to. with skills and perks, leveling, and a \"story\" of sorts. \n\ni really like the fact that Most of the survival parts of the game are not a \"need\". although they are, its given in such a way that you want to eat and sleep, not that you HAVE to, and if they keep on that formula, they could really pack on a bunch of \"survival\" elements and it not bog the feel of the game down. If they can continue to Implement more Engaging and interesting ways of showing survival, then we are in the right direction!\n\nSecond friendly critique would be the combat. the base combat is pretty good and i like the charge up abilities and dodge mechanic! but... it is a little dry right now in the combat department. The combat could be very fluent and far more engaging if there were more options to pick from for charge abilities, active abilities, and even fun synergies! another conversation that i will talk about is in regards to mobs. Great first run at mobs. for the zones that are currently out, there are a fair amount of different mobs to attack. the area to improve on in my opinion would be making them a little more dynamic and inconsistent. less hit bags of heal and more threatening! maybe have one or two abilities that each mob has a random chance to pop off. also maybe make some mobs attack a little faster or move faster?? i recognize that the ranged weapons will suffer the faster you make a mob, but maybe some of them have abilities to close the gap on players? pretty big difference in difficulty just picking ranged of melee..\n\nLastly i want to talk a little bit about the story aspect of the RPG. its definitely fun running to all the bosses and collecting artifacts that unlock new bosses and zones. cool idea! expanding on that to create side quests and what not would also be fun. i also like the fact that in some of the quests you keep it vague. i think a little less \"show me were to run\" and i little more \"Tell me were to explore\" would lead to better exploration! Thats another thing, the Map is not big but doesn't really feel small either, maybe play in to the smaller zones and build more caves and buildings to find rather that making the map just flat but big! just a small thought!\n\nI wont speak on weapons because i know the devs are working on them, but another fun thing to add to weapons could be weapon arts that make holding different weapons worth doing?\n\nAfter all of that, i recognize that the devs are in the works for a lot of fun things and my critiques are that of opinion. and all that i have said hasn't begun to scratch the surface of what this game has the chance to become. This game really does have some charm to it and its been fun to play! so i want to say that i truly Enjoy playing the game so far, even as a new father, with the small amount of time i have to play a game through the week, it has been worth it to play this one!\n\nthanks for reading and i cant wait for further updates!", "timestamp_created": 1670035692, "timestamp_updated": 1670035692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606603085994720459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125632572": {"recommendationid": "125632572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037066574", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1668698324}, "language": "english", "review": "Seems like a lot of money for what's on offer here.

You *can* dodge, but there's never really a reason to aside from maybe super early in the game, and there's no animation cancelling either, which makes the whole thing kinda useless anyway (Attacking is REALLY slow).\n\nEnemy variety is severely lacking. There are like 4 or 5 different types of \"faceless\" (Caster, Archer, Shield, No shield and some weak early ones) I've encountered in 22 hours in addition of various pallette swaped boars, land-Jellyfish(?) and some damage-sponge miniature dragons called nibblers that take way too many hits. Oh, and some ghosts that all looked the same, I guess.\n\nGiven that the strategy for each of them is pretty much just hit them until they die, it might as well have been only 2 enemies.\n\nFor a \"Survival Craft\" game, there are zero survival elements. You can eat food to heal some and get some buffs if you feel like it, but that's it, you can't starve. There is \"Exhaustion\", which reduces your max. stamina by like 25%. Mildly inconvenient I guess.\n\nThere seem to be weather conditions like hypothermia, but they are so irrelevant it doesn't even matter. Just pull out your torch for a couple of seconds if you're close to hypothermia after an hour in the cold.\n\nThe pacing is god-awful. You're stuck for hours in the first area learning the ropes with barely any progress (because the game decided to be a story rpg so you unlock new stuff by progressing that, rather than your character.)\n\nYou're stuck wondering how you can learn how to make better items, better building parts, only to realize that you won't until you do the quests, which brings me to the next point:\n\nThe dialogue is utter garbage. The translation is so bad and barebones that I doubt that any thought was put into it. So you're reading this incoherent nonsense to get a quest, but the questlog doesn't even show enough details. Sometimes there are waypoints at least, sometimes there aren't. The only thing marked is the NPC where I'm supposed to turn in the quest or got the quest from, thank you game, really helping me out when trying to find some tablets on a whole bunch of floating islands.\n\nThere are character levels which I think increase your stats? I'm not sure, it's not really \"feelable\". Main thing is: each level up gives you a \"Frozen Flame\" item, which you can use on an altar to learn some skills, which are 90% useless. Thre are a couple of no brainers like slower breaking weapons (Stuff breaks so fast in this game, it's ridiculous.) or less stamina consumption for your weapons of choice so you can mindlessly swing longer. Then we got \"You can run /fly when encumbered\" which is a no brainer because you will be encumbered A LOT because of the next point:\n\nEverything weighs a ton, especially all the tools and armor and weapons you carry. Pickaxe? 20 weight, Hatchet? 20 weight. Bow? Make that 26 weight. Armor? Around 10 weight a piece. And your maximum weight is like 275.\n\nNow all that wouldn't be so bad if you didn't need a metric f*ckton of materials for building. The foundations are your average survivalcraft size. The walls and roofs however are only quarter sized. Meaning to fully enclose a single foundation with man-high walls you need not one or two walls per side, but 4. And each of those walls cost you like 4 branches (lowest tier). that's 64 branches to cover up a single foundation. Branches are laying around on the ground and usually give 1-3 of them. Chopping down trees gives some more and some logs, which you can not downgrade to branches and can not use aside from firing up your campfire at this stage. \n\nYou'll be spending 4 hours just collecting branches to build like a 3 by 2 house. Oh and the roof needs fiber too, which also only drops in amounts of 1-3, so the pain is real.\n\nBy the time you finally settled in, you explored the first area more throughly than you would've hoped for, grinding the same few mobs over and over again to get cloth, which you can't produce at this stage. (Thankfully the developers put in a shop where you can buy 5 of them for the price of a fish, which is way more effective than producing them yourself later on even.)\n\nSo what now? You finally got your little stick base and settled in. You got used to the game and now you've finished the quest. Well, screw you, because now you're moving into an entirely new zone, so you'll be doing it all over again but with the next tier of materials. (Unless you want to keep runing to a waypoint to teleport back and forth to your stick-base.)\n\nOverall I feel there could be a good game here somewhere, but my oh my does it need work. And seeing how this has already been worked on for more than a year, I'm not impressed, even when they are a small team.\n\nOn the plus side, the game looks very good. the animations are generally nice (though the sound design packs zero punch) and the game does capture you with its mysteries for a while and the controls aren't too bad either.\n\n\nI got this game for 10 bucks so I'm not too mad, but I think it's currently too jank for the asking price.

It makes me want to create large structures to hold the 10-12 furnaces and 15 cooking stations. You are able to make your own teleport pads, which my \"end\" game now are fairly easy to make.

Its slow, clunky, uses a lot of stamina early game and your crosshair is slightly off and its quite hard to aim.\n- Melee weapons - The Abilities are really good and does ok damage and again.. it eats your stamina and you are kinda like locked in an animation and its quite hard to dodge attacks.\n- No FOV slider - Big problem for Ultrawide screens as a lot of it is in your face.\n- Game not Optimized (25fps - 60fps) - Yet playable. - someone posted a fix in the guide.\n- Building expensive - It get destroyed by Mobs around and there is no room to build too. Its just super expensive.\n- Cant Skip Time - Nighttime i think the MOBS are more powerful and these blue looking jellyfish will automatically attack you.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

The main reason is that \"fun\" does not appear to be a foundational driving factor in the development of this game.\n\n- SKILL TREE: Maybe one of the worst.  Extremely minimalist.  Boring choices.  \"Weapons break more slowly\" isn't something I'm excited to grind towards.  I've probably got 10 hours ahead of me before I could get to the only single skill I can find that I'm excited about (chain lightning... on a 45 sec cd).  \n\n- COMBAT: Combat feels like shoving a boulder up a hill.  I'm using a staff which on its own gives me two attack types that I spam over and over and over and ... I feel under powered, shoot 3 times for a small amount of damage (instead of 2 because I skilled into it) only to have to wait for the recharge.  There is no exciting high action movement and skill here with a range of options to cast.  I can understand starting slow but this is brutal.  \n\n- DECAY: The decay rates in this game are way too high.  Chop 10ish trees and break your axe.  When we logged back on this morning after playing last night, all of our chests and fires had broken and we had a bunch of bags sitting on the ground.  This is not exciting game play.  I'm assuming we can mess with this on server settings but why even default it that way?  Dunno.  Some won't mind but again, not fun.\n\nAnything good? - Sure, a lot of the basics are working okay.  You get rewarded for exploration.  The graphics are pretty mundane but nice enough.  The hamster wheel of what to do to go on to the next thing is pretty nicely laid out and interesting enough to want to keep going.\n\nBuy it on sale and go in with low expectations.

Some things that I think could use a bit of tweaking:\n\n-Cooking, it should either take at minimum of a quarter of the time to cook something or allow you to put in multiple things at once. Otherwise it is rather daunting to stand at the stove and cook. In my play through i found that I went without food as much as possible.\n\n-Durability, even with the talent for having things break less quickly I feel that things still break far too quickly for how slowly you gain and craft resources. This applies especially to later items.\n\n-Repair Cost, when the metal cost to repair an item is the same as making a brand new item you might as well make a new item... Didn't even get a chance to build the deconstructor before finishing the current campaign because it was more pressing to repair my weapons and tools.\n\n-Boxes, if \"E\" opens a box it would be nice if it also closed the box rather than taking stuff out of the box.\n\n-Patterns, when you purchase a pattern it would be great if there were some visual indication that you already bought it. I think there was maybe one NPC it disappeared from after buying.\n\n-Weapons, I understand the staff is mostly DOT dmg, but it just seemed very underwhelming to use. All later weapons didn't seem to keep up with the bows dmg at all.\n\n-Map, might be more of a personal preference, but a mini map would be nice rather than the compass. Otherwise if it would be possible to get the map to open quicker. Because the land masses are so spread out I found I was opening the map often to make sure not to fall into the void.\n\n-Building, would be nice if it felt like it was more necessary. Maybe it would be on a server? Solo, a platform seems sufficient. \n\nAside from all its current faults the flight system is done nicely, I enjoyed that. There is the just right amount of environmental clutter as to not be overwhelmed by it. There were some spots where you could run through the ground texture though...

You do feel the Early Access hard though - it feels like a slightly longer demo, so just manage expectations on content if you buy it now and you'll have a good time. \n\n* Looks beautiful, great graphics and a nice-looking UI. Creature design is great too. \n* Movement feels very fluid and nice, the flying mechanic is fun - would love more movement speed as there is a fair bit of running around, and the teleporters could be better placed...\n* Combat has a lot of room for improvement but I've certainly had worse, and I appreciate the variety of weapon options. More magic options would be nice!\n* The building is good, I play a lot of base building game and it's among the better in that aspect that I've played. Acquiring materials is a bit too grindy though (and I say that as someone who does enjoy the grind, up to a point), certain things are extremely easy to get while others are unnecessarily hard given their purpose. \n* I played single-player and I expect it would probably a lot more fun with friends, haven't tried the multiplayer functionality at all but I hope it's good and that I have someone to play with at launch. \n\nOverall I look forward to seeing more of this game and I hope people give it a chance despite the mixed reviews.", "timestamp_created": 1674580968, "timestamp_updated": 1674580968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566323280334472656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125691713": {"recommendationid": "125691713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007837956", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1668721888}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun start, it has a nice look and fun tutorial to play.
