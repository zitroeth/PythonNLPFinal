There are 2 major things wrong with How to Survive.\n\nFirstly, take a look at the DLC. If How to Survive truly is an indie game, control of the project has been overtaken by greedhead corporate dumb think leadership. Someone (likely 505 Games) has opted to make DLCs out of basic features that should have been part of the basic game. Examples are an extra harder difficulty and a hardcore feature. Other DLCs (Heatwave) resemble what would have been unlockables for games only a generation ago. Lastly there are the DLCs that suggest the core game was released unfinished taking the cutting room floor scraps and selling them off as DLC when they got to them later. I don't know if the nickel and diming customers business model bothers you, but it sure as hell bothers me.\n\nThe second problem is the game itself. Its not good. How to Survive is a perfect example of the tidalwave of schlock being put out by the burgeonning indie industry. It is an inferior imitation of mainstream titles like Diablo and Torchlight. It tries to be unique and original with additional survival features like hunger, thirst, and sleepiness, but they're implemented in a way that make the game tedious and annoying. The quality is painfully amateur and inconsistent. Struggle as a melee character, but have 2 triple bladed boomerangs and you're so golden the game gets dull. The content is particularly slim. Each island is painfully small. And the game itself manages to be as repetitive as Diablo and Torchlight, but in the most flat, boring, and completely unrewarding manner possible.\n\nHow to Survive lives up to its lousy meta score. No idea why this game has such an overwhelmingly high positive customer review count. The $15 asking price with the lazy DLCs is crazy to me. Other games How to Survive is trying to be are the same exact price and offer more and better quality content minus the annoying survival gimmicks and DLC. Specifically either of the Torchlight games.\n\nHonestly, my recommendation is to not buy How to Survive at all. If you absolutely must take the plunge, as stated in the tl;dr above, buy it when its 80-90% off. That way you won't feel too ripped off when you find out how painfully below average it is.", "timestamp_created": 1413319189, "timestamp_updated": 1414880311, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1364, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815099000930786133", "comment_count": 77, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11007735": {"recommendationid": "11007735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027999270", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1609, "last_played": 1408908137}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Once Bitten, Twice Shy [/h1]\n\nA fun, 'Diablo'-esque Third-Person RPG, \"How to Survive\" caught me a little off guard. At $2.25 (Summer Sale 2014), I certainly wasnt expecting much but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this title from 505 Games. \n\n[b][u]Campaign | Gameplay:[/u][/b] The story is straighforward - play as one of three protagonists stuck on a deserted island infested with zombies, and learn 'how to survive' long enough to find a way out. The gameplay is fun (and told from the perspective of a top-down isometric shooter), good graphics and atmospheric sound, M&K controls that are intuitve and responsive, features a broad selection of weapons (from Axe's, Machete's, Bow & Arrows, Molotov Cocktail's to a wide variety of guns), and interesting characters. The game's strength however was the Inventory setup - which allows you to collect a seemingly random mish-mash of junk from your travels around the island and combine them in various ways to create useful items (Eg. String and a wooden stick to create a fishing rod, An old bottle, kerosene and a scrap of fabric to create Molotov Cocktail's, An old rubber tire, an axe and string to create body armor etc etc).\n\n[b][u]Flaws:[/u][/b] Uneven difficulty spikes, and sparse 'Save' points cause needless frustration in an otherwise enjoyable experience.  \n\n'How to Survive' might not break any new boundaries but 505 Games have taken on a disparete variety of gameplay elements and executed extremely well to create a refreshingly fun, zombie-horror romp. At $2.25, this one is a no-brainer - A Definite Recommend (8/10)\n\n\n[u][b] Want More Recommendations?

The graphics are decent for the top-down style. Good lighting and water effects. Day and night cycle where night really amps up the challenge by making you watch your back constantly. A diverse crafting system. Decent skill tree options. Some of the voice acting is funny (I think intentionally) and unique. \n\nI liked the survival aspects, which is the point of the game. You have to monitor your hunger, thirst, rest, and health. It's all manageable. You can collect empty bottles to store up water reserves, hunt animals and collect plants to cook at a campfire for food, collect herbs and create bandages to restore health, and secure a bunker to sleep in. \n\nThe combat is solid. The controls are easy. You craft increasingly strong weapons as you progress and different weapons have unique advantages. The machete cuts through plants and carves arrows from sticks, the bow is powerful and the arrows recoverable, the gun is rapid fire with plenty of ammo on the islands, the boomerang is very powerful but not as smooth and fast as the bow, etc. Melee combat animations are fluid with just enough variety--more than I expected from a game with this visual style.\n\nWhile the gameplay mechanics are very solid, the storyline becomes more of a chore than fun unfortunately. It's a series of fetch quests that take you back and forth across the maps. Every time you pass one direction and clear the large amount of zombies, you have to then fight them all over again on the way back due to a fast respawn rate. This turned the game into a slow fetch quest grind for me and I lost interest about halfway through. If you make a wrong turn, it's even worse, because now you're fighting respawns over and over and you're not even in the right spot of the map. \n\nYou can't save the game except at story checkpoints and that can take a bit of time. Perhaps, if I could save at will, I could have tolerated the grind in smaller doses. \n\nMaybe it's just me, but I had trouble with the quest early on where I had to collect meat from a deer. I kept wandering the map looking for deer and could never find them. When I finally would spot one, I would have to clear hordes of zombies to clear a path to it and these actions usually scared the deer away, leaving me to wander yet some more. The worst is when you're hunting deer at night and the extra zombies come to chase you down. You need to keep your flashlight on these nighttime zombies to keep them at bay, which makes focusing on the fleeting deer more difficult. The game says you can track the deer once you injure it by following blood on the ground. It's not that easy to do when the ground is already covered in excessive blood from slaying zombies. I eventually caught the deer and made the mistake of cooking the meat, which didn't complete the quest, so I had to repeat it all over again.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I actually told my friends how much I enjoyed it at the beginning. Then the grind just beat me down. \n\nThere is also inventory issues. Some of the crafting recipes call for 5 or 6 items. You're already stocking ammo, weapons, water, food, bandages, quest items, etc and the 25-item inventory fills fast. I don't really consider this a negative, because it more accurately reflects the reality of surviving on these islands. It might frustrate some players though. 25 slots is still considerably more than some games permit. \n\nOne small nitpick when it comes to resting: you aren't allowed to unless your rest meter is low enough. One time I was by a shelter at just over 50% fatigue. I couldn't rest before setting out on the next leg of my journey. That's just silly, because you can make adjustments on the other survival factors whenever you please. \n\nAs much as I would like to recommend this game for all its positive, interesting concepts, I just can't because the story is a major drag.", "timestamp_created": 1387950879, "timestamp_updated": 1387950879, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 296, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793917655944824219", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "7822928": {"recommendationid": "7822928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996405101", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 808, "last_played": 1697072164}, "language": "english", "review": "Now first lets get the positive out of the way.\nThe games graphics are fine for what it is.\nThe story can be funny sometimes.\nThe co-op challenges can be fun with a friend.\n\nNow lets get to the real review where we look at what they promised and what they delivered.\nThe game is an ok size however it's extreamly limited in size for it's price.\n\nIf you forced yourself to go slow you would take maybe 6 hours to finish this game.\n\nAnother problem  is the content  the guns,melee weps, mutants ect is all really limiting.\nSome might disagree with me there but think about it theres maybe 8 guns, 3 chainsaws , 6 melee weps and 1 ammoless total op wep.\n\nNow for my Largest disapointment with this game it's promise  \"experience for zombie game veterans\"\n\nThere is NOTHING veteran about this game it hands everything to you on a silver platter.\nThere's sleep areas at night prebuilt impervise to any zombie attack that you only need to clear out once.\n\nNight creatures are as deadly as a new born kitten.\nAmmo is WAY too common i had 2,000 ammo constantly.\n\nThere should never be a weapon that can destroy armys without some sort of price \"i'm looking at you boomarang\"\nYou should not point out on the map where the players have got to go.\n\nThe crafting tells you what's possible.....\nThe \"hardest\" mutant is the easyest thing to beat with a handgun.\n\nFood is too easy to aquire.\nWater is Way too easy to aquire.\n\nItems respawn.....\nChanging difficulty only changes what damage they hit.......\n\nAnd i could go on with this list for acouple more pages.\nAll in all this game was a disapointment and broke it's promises.\n\nBefore you say i did not play long enough know that i defeated the game twice  and defeated half the challenges with friends.\nI played through twice to see if anything at all changed i really had to force myself to with a dieing hope that something hard or fun would of been added.\n\nUpdate#\nOnline co-op is lag and bug filled and has serious annoyances that i had hoped they might have removed.\nThe difficulty and enemie numbers are the same.\nYou and the other player are forced to share the screen meaning you can't move far from eachother.\nThe match making system is pathetic as it's auto finding where you select options and hope that someone else has the same options but a diffrent character.\nAll in all no real change to the game still not worth the money.", "timestamp_created": 1385729186, "timestamp_updated": 1390018445, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1132, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776154160499572754", "comment_count": 48, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11157567": {"recommendationid": "11157567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015032780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 458, "last_played": 1404942012}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredibly boring, unbalanced game, that fails to deliver anything meaningful.\n\nFirst, the crafting: This is the game's only true strength, but it's still lacking.

Everything boils down to a couple of tiers of equipment that do the same thing.\n\nSecond, balance: The difficulty curve is all over the place. At the start of the game, you will get mauled, guaranteed, by all the zombies. You'll only have a stick to defend yourself with, which is slow, weak and inefficient against the sheer number of zombies. Then you can finally get a ranged weapon and the game becomes yawn inducing, followed by the second island, where helmeted zombies might actually land a hit on you if there's several of them.\n\nThen you get to the third island and, despite further upgrading your bow AND gun, find that neither are all that effective against the zombies there. How ineffective are they? It takes two perfect head shots to take them down, assuming they don't have a helmet. They also come at you in droves and your movement is slowed by the swamp.\n\nThen you find the recipe for an upgraded boomerang. This weapon outperforms bows and guns quite easily, in terms of speed, damage and lack of ammo consumption. It's only weakness is that you have to wait for the weapon to come back before you can throw it again, but this didn't cause me problems at all. Between the long effective range, high damage and hitting twice, it's often able to take out multiple zombies per throw and the delay is actually pretty low.\n\nThird, the enemies: There is nothing remotely interesting about any of them. There's regular zombies, progressively faster and stronger zombies, fat (explosive) zombies, head crabs and giant zombies. Nothing new to report. Oh, and there's also zombie deer and what I believe are emus. The birds just zerg rush, so they're also boring. The deer attack by charging and can stun you, which makes them one of the more interesting enemies, if only because their speed means they'll actually hit you.\n\nFourth, the plot and characters: The plot is bland. You're marooned on an island and have to survive. The characters are all varying degrees of insane and unlikable. I'd guess that the game was aiming to be parody, but it's just so unfunny and overall dull that I honestly can't tell if it's being sincere or not.\n\nFifth, the quests: Every single one is a fetch quest. If it's not a fetch quest at first, it will become one soon enough. Also, get used to failure, because it's guaranteed. Unless it involves getting to another zombie infested island, you're not  actually accomplishing anything.\n\nAnd then there's the monkeys. With pet parrots. Who give optional fetch quests, because clearly we didn't have enough of them already, right? These are what make me wonder if the game is meant as parody, because they so clearly break the bleak mood of the game. Unfortunately, all they accomplish is changing my mood from apathy to annoyance. The squawking really gets old.\n\nSixth, bugs and nitpicking: One bug I keep running into is that, after I took the skill that showed certain plants on the map, some of the plant icons would remain after harvesting while others wouldn't. A similar problem I kept running into with the skill to see animals on the map was sometimes the icons for them didn't show up, despite the deer being close enough for me to see its antlers.\n\nAlso, there's a sound bug with the boomerang. Sometimes after throwing it, the sound continues even after it returns, which gets annoying very fast. Usually it happens when I open the inventory menu while it's still airborne, but sometimes it just happens.\n\nAnd one last, little annoyance, of no real significance: The voice acting doesn't match up with the dialog boxes, like they were using two different versions of the same script. The ideas are all the same, but the words are different.", "timestamp_created": 1404945675, "timestamp_updated": 1404945675, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.77537989616394043", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8173430": {"recommendationid": "8173430", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978133265", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1387646981}, "language": "english", "review": "I picked this game up full price, from it's description it sounded like the type of zombie survival game I always wanted to play. Sadly it was a major disappointment, it's survival aspects in name only. All the elements are sort of there, the \"open\" map, ammo, limited inventory, food and water requirements and rpg stats, but their implementation is all wrong. \n\n Few of them really matter, you get tons of ammo as drops, and managing water and food is pretty irrelevant, you quickly stack some items for that so that it's more of a petty maintenance than an aspect of survival.\n\nThe so-called open map is really just swathes of map with small pathways cut into them, with just a few open spaces that are usually there just for the sake of variety it seems. The only \"Open\" element is that of course it isn't a linear game and you can run back and forth between areas and quick travel between maps, but it's not far enough from just mundane backtracking.\n\nThe combat isn't too bad, it works for this type of game, if it wasn't for the overabundance of ammo and the overpowered weapons from the very start. Combat soon feels more like something you just do on the way and not much more enjoyable than running from place to place.\n\nThe crafting is another annoyance if you need a particular item, you have a limited inventory, that's okay, you shouldn't be able to carry everything with you.. but then there is no storage area. It's already not fun to run around this island aimlessly, I don't want to have to run around looking for that one damn ingredient, usually for a quest (what else is there to do in this game?) Just a limited item storage for SOME things, I can decide what to get rid of later, but a few times I've already dropped something I needed to find again, much to my annoyance.\n\nThe overall feel of playing this game was BOREDOM. I was falling asleep at my comp, I soon couldn't take it. It's not too relevant but the final straw was all the damn \"Krovac's Rules\" cutscenes. Think he's a neat quirky charcater? Wait till you have to endure overwrought, way too long, unskippable video tutorials with the same crappy music, for something that should be explained in 2-3 lines of text. \n\nDon't want to be mean, but it's kind of important to remember what a survival game is so we can actually get a good one. This just isn't it.

Yes, everything is subjective about this, even categorization or meaning of words, but god damn, calling How To Survive in 2013 a \"GEM\"? Hell no!\n\nGame wants to be either Dead Island or The Walking Dead, or even both, but as I see for majority of players it doesn't work and neither for me. If they used quotes from TWD, at least they could be more picky about selection. It's not like market is filled with zombie games, it's more like market is filled with average and bellow zombie games, and I can't help myself, but I feel How to Survive is just another regular zombie genre product with zero to none originality. But hey, it's still better than Dead Island Epidemic :D \n\nStory is near average, same with overal script, but I liked the variety of weapons and also crafting of recipes. Visually, the game is nice looking, soundwise I didn't like it that much. Animations of finishers will get repetetive soon and so the fights will. Game will lasts you easily over 10 hours. Add another 10 for DLCs. \n\nFrom survival point of view, it's yes. How to Survive feels above-average difficult, and it really gets interesting at Iron Man or Kovac's difficulty. If you feel as an player with people in the game, for me I had to say no and most probably you'll feel same. \n\nTo sum it up, nice, fast, difficult zombie action with lot of things to do, lot of crafting and fighting which might get repetetive after few hours, enough types of zombies makes the game more fresh, but still it has some major flaws, not just story but the whole game in overall. If you can get it during sale for 3-4 euros/dollars then get it, otherwise full price is no-no.

There will also be a bullet point Pros/Cons review near the bottom of this.\n\nHow to Survive is in my opinion a well done game to say the least. The game has a simple yet elegant combat system that I found satisfying, it takes patience to truly master zombie slaying as you must take time to zero in your aim for those rewarding headshots. This is better then many other games as it adds a touch of needed skill to it. The game also contains a decent variety of zombies to slaughter including some undead animals that prove to be quite scary when encountered. Many zombie types also require you to change up your strategy as a nice bonus, while you normal zombies can be dispatched with melee weapons, zombies such as Fatties require a ranged approach as they will otherwise blow up in your face upon death.\n\n      One issue I had here though was running zombies tend to get spastic when right on you and I found it hard to aim at them as they attacked while running circles around me. The island settings also do nicely, between varied terrain and well done lighting the game's presentation is both beautiful and terrifying. One of the game's strongest points is its well done crafting system, playing the game I constantly found myself wanting to find new items to combine to produce more deadly weapons and armor. This is further expanded by crafting and adding attachments such as scopes for homemade guns to decrease aim time or pulleys to give your bow more damage. Another nice mechanic the game has is a day and night cycle where at night an abundant number of more mutated and aggressive zombie type foe come out to play, what really sets this apart from other games is your ability to fight these off by simply staying in the light. With a campfire your safe and to travel you can simply grab a torch from the fire, however you will drop the torch to the ground if you need to use any other weapon, and while you can use a flashlight with a weapon it is a directional light, so if your not careful these creatures can come up from behind you and attack. The game also sports a decent Hunger/Thirst/Sleep system that adds just a little more spice to the difficulty, however if you acquire both skill perks to double these meters you'll find yourself rarely having to maintain them. \n\n       The game contains a few different character to play as each with different stats and available skills to acquire. A couple of which have a unique ability to craft a specific item only as them. As said the game does contain a leveling system in which each level grants a skill point of your choosing, however out of the 12 or so skills I had playing Jack I only found 4 or 5 of them to actually be worth something. While the story isn\u2019t the best it was still rather entertaining and when taken the time to scavenge and keep yourself properly equipped the main story ran about 15 hours for me across 2 days of constant play. Now though the game lacks any sort of structure building mechanic the game does allow you to drop items anywhere and will never disappear which really came in handy as I tended to have a hording problem in this game. I have a friend that I got to also get the game and together we found the multiplayer gameplay just as fun, you can either to a simple challenge which is essentially an island with a single goal such as finding a plane to escape. You can Co-Op the story, this part was especially cool as while my friend was just starting his story I was well into mine and I retained both my stats and all the items on me allowing me to easily aid him in his story. All in all I'd say this game is worth trying especially for any fan of zombie and/or survival game, to those of you I'd say you wont be disappointed.\n\nSo in a nutshell:\nPros:\n-Satisfying combat system\n-Addictive crafting system\n-Well done setting\n-A decent story both in quality and length\n-Enemy variety\n-Day/Night cycle\n-Hunger/Thirst/Sleep systems\n-Level and skill progression\n-Multiple playable character\n-Rebindable Controls \n\nCons:\n-Zombie AI can be a little wonky but rare\n-Camera style made some areas extremely difficult to navigate\n-Some what low variety of melee weapons\n-Controls for aiming seemed to be off at times (Xbox 360 Controller)\n\nOne final note is that I found that getting information on more advanced stuff was hard, especially seeing how typing \"How to Survive...\" in an internet search engine usually found unwanted results.\n\nMy finally score for this game as a long time zombie and survival game lover is a solid 8/10, while its of course not a AAA title it does very well with what it has and I find myself strangely addicted to continue playing and watching as my character started as a hopeless shipwreck survivor and evolved into the perfect survivalist.", "timestamp_created": 1413433317, "timestamp_updated": 1430456374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 128, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730237901210784912", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38314746": {"recommendationid": "38314746", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991288710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 999, "last_played": 1512698156}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][i]How to Survive[/i] is a short, -very casual- isometric horror-action game, unworthy of the survival title, and a major disappointment. Take its name to heart; in reality, the game is a glorified tutorial, with far too much hand-holding.[/h1]\n\nThe game regularly reminded me of the demo disks back when PlayStations were the rockin\u2019 new thing, and I half expected the game to fade to black after a couple of quests and tell me it would be \u2018Out this Summer\u2019 in goofy Comic Sans. \n\n\nInitially, you select from one of three premade characters with predetermined stats, and character-specific talent trees.\nThere is another female character available by purchasing a DLC pack, but why this hasn\u2019t simply been patched into the base game is beyond me.\n\n[h1]-[/h1] The campaign plot is incredibly bland with your typical \u2018washed up on a desert island and must escape\u2019 theme. Expect a linear set of quests with little to no interesting objectives in between, a shallow sense of freedom, and an overall repetitive experience. \n\nAll quests are fetch-to-receive with objectives and go-to points clearly located on the map, making the entire game far too simplistic to be considered survival at all. There is a visible % completion marker on the menu, and I couldn\u2019t believe how quickly I was progressing through the main campaign whilst seemingly achieving nothing.\n\nYou can, of course, skip side quests, but there is so little else to do except mindlessly grind zombies on islands that are far too small, so I would recommend doing them if you do decide to play. I warn you now that they are borderline ridiculous, and if you\u2019re looking for a more serious game you should avoid this completely. Monkeys and talking parrots destroyed whatever little immersion had been built for me and reduced it to zero.\n\nMany dialogue boxes don\u2019t match up with the voice acting. This is more irritating than game breaking but feels as if the voice actors were working on a different script. I could understand if it were worded differently for the purpose of a journal, but it isn\u2019t, and as subtitles, it just looks unprofessional.\n\n[A major annoyance for me is a continuity error with \u2018Emily\u2019s quest\u2019 and a sound file. Maybe I\u2019m being picky, but I noticed it, and it bothered me, so I\u2019m mentioning it.]\n\n\n\n[h1]-[/h1] \u2018Kovacs Rules\u2019 are scattered around the island providing you with tips as and when they occur in the campaign. The video cutscenes for these tutorials are unskippable and fairly irritating when you find a duplicate. This would have worked a lot better with a large tutorial island and a separate campaign map.\nZombie game Veterans will most likely be disappointed by this amount of hand holding. \n\nThe difficulty also varies as you progress and feels uneven. I don\u2019t consider this game-breaking but it is very disjointed with the overall tutorial feel. The combination of the two does not work well.\n\nCertain survival mechanics such as fishing and hunting are largely useless, as edible plants and roots respawn frequently, and water stores are easily located on the map with icons. There is little to no danger of starvation or dehydration, making these trackable needs unnecessary. Rest areas and fire pits for cooking are also marked, dulling the experience further.\n\n\n[h1]-[/h1] Inventory management is awful and very unintuitive. There are far too many steps required to simply move an item around in your backpack. Designated areas for food, weapons and craft mats would have been more sensible.\n\nThere are many craftable weapons which is a shame considering all end up feeling rather similar, not to mention certain weapons obliterate enemies with one or two hits. This allows you to cheese all the content and leaves all other weapons largely redundant. I\u2019m looking at you, bladearang. \nYou are able to dismantle certain craftables, however, so you don\u2019t lose or waste materials if you craft the wrong thing or need the parts for a better item. This I [i]really[/i] liked. It\u2019s been more than once that I\u2019ve wasted rare mats and realised I already had three of what I just crafted, in several games. \n\n\n\n[h1]-[/h1] Graphics are probably the biggest positive; visually the game is very nicely presented, with a decent amount of detail, however, there are no in-game resolution or graphic sliders, and this must be done in a config menu before launch.\n\nAs for design, I actually really like the character model movement. There is a little bit of weight with each step you take - an overall sense of a backpack stuffed with items, aching limbs and exhaustion as you trek through swamps, scrub grass and jungle - it\u2019s almost tactile.\n\nOn the flip side, enemy design is basic and mostly uninteresting, which is a shame. Just your standard bunch of corpses with different models and occasional movement speed tweaks, with a few behemoths thrown in here and there for good measure.\n\nThe day and night cycle is pretty cool, and things do get very tense with the nightfall soundtrack that always put me on edge. It does become rather grating at times, but it certainly lets you know things 'could get ugly' at any moment.\n\n\n\nIt feels as though development was hastily packed together, and never fully completed but still packaged as a \u2018finished game.\u2019 This becomes more apparent when you consider that various standard game content (difficulty and challenge modes) are available as DLC. I did not purchase these and so can\u2019t comment on how well made they are, BUT, all -should- be part of the base game and not individually charged for, especially considering the store price.\n\nMore and more commonly now developers appear to choose the drip feed route, and slowly milk players with very small amounts of basic content rather than releasing a complete game, which I don\u2019t agree with. Just do the right thing, patch the game, earn the respect of people you\u2019re creating for (who have paid for your product!) and be a little more passionate [i]please[/i].\n\n\n[h1]There are much better zombie survival games out there, and comparing this game to ones such as Diablo or Torchlight, is embarrassing. They are far better games in their own right, and I personally don\u2019t understand why anyone would make this comparison.\n\nIf you have a limited amount of time to play games I would suggest avoiding this one.

What a pleasant surprise.  It's like Diablo 2 gameplay, with zombies/mutants as your enemies, and one of four survivors as your hero.  The gameplay is very fun, although it does get a bit stale with a lack of diversity among the zombies/mutants.  Couple the lack of diversity with a completely OP weapon (cough, triple boomerang) and you've got a recipe for boredom.  If you want the story mode to remain challenging, I highly recommend avoiding any boomerang, as they are fast, powerful, ammo-less, and there's no such thing as durability in this game.  Killing zombies with a shotgun made out of a tube and duct tape is much more rewarding anyway, right?\n\nStill, easily worth $15 and a play through or two.  The challenges are were the challenge is (play on words intended).  You get your character dropped on an island with no equipment, a real \"out of the freezer into the frying pan\" kind of experience.  The challenge is reaching your escape under the allotted time, without dying obviously.  \n\nThe crafting system in this game is beautiful.  You can make guns out of tubes, boomerangs out of bones, armor out of tires, and potions/elixirs galore from the plentiful plants on the islands.  Very rewarding indeed.\n\nThe talent system is... meh.  It seems like an after thought, and there is a real void of any interesting talents.  Everything is just passive \"make explosive arrows\" \"carry more explosives in a stack\" \"make X potions\" \"do more damage on headshot\" kind of thing.  Would've loved some Dead Island-esque execution talents or some character specific special moves.\n\nBottom line: Buy it.  You can easily get 10-15 hours if the idea of a Diablo-ish zombie game with great crafting sounds fun to you.  How to Survive gets a 3/5.\n\nTawok\nwww.GuildLeaders.com", "timestamp_created": 1388165450, "timestamp_updated": 1388771613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 184, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723225533962249756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147846540": {"recommendationid": "147846540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133726836", "num_games_owned": 1321, "num_reviews": 539, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1478963829}, "language": "english", "review": "I do not own this game but was somehow able to make and write this review", "timestamp_created": 1696742520, "timestamp_updated": 1696742520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 47, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722589671611785889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8912654": {"recommendationid": "8912654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082918293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1188, "last_played": 1637042522}, "language": "english", "review": "Well i really enjoyed this game and have just finished it,all the time i have added up is actual in game time and i enjoyed every moment of this well made and entertaining game.\nOk you start by picking a character so i choose ABBY (thought she would be faster and have more stamina) and of you go,the graphic's in game are good and the ZOMBIE'S (if thats what they are) come in variou's form's from you standard walk and run and chase (and they really do leg it after you) to other varietie's thet i will let you discover for yourself (allway's best to find thing's out for yourself so no spoiler's here),i will say this there are about 6-7 different type's and i wish there had been more.\nThe music in game is good and you really do know when something is coming as the tone change's and then LOOK OUT as its usually something you havent seen before.\n\nHow to Survive Launch Trailer - YouTube \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8BgC-eo_NY\n\nThe script is really well written and my most memorable character is KOVAC,he has been stuck on the island (island's i should say) for some time now and his \"HOW TO SURVIVE GUIDE\" is probablly the funniest thing in the game and the animation that goes with it had me laughing out loud a few time's.\nNow dont get me wrong the game isnt a \"comedy survival game\" at certain points its more \"survival horror\" as in you have to manage resource's and keep an eye on what you have but KOVAC'S ranting's add a real comedy overtone at certain point's in the game (usually when you find one of the aforementioned \"how to survive\" pages from his book)\nAs the game progress'es you come across path's that are blocked and shed's that wont give to your weapon or anything else you are carrying,but beleive me you can and do find a way to open up these inaccesible path's and in the process find new challenge's and new item's and quest's,and that has you going back to island's you thought you had finished to find out what secret's are there (even more so now with the new DLC for download which introduce's new island's,new character's,new weather condition's,new weapon's and to top it all of LAVA-hell yeah).\n\nHow to Survive: El Diable Islands DLC Trailer -

Its by no means perfect, for me the biggest issue was the excessive level of padding. For instance why cant I just use this one boat to travel to all the other islands and instead need to move to different locations throughout zombie infested islands to reach different boats in order to get to other islands? Padding that's why. Where HtS really shines though, is in the crafting department. There's a lot of stuff you can craft and improve as you discover new recipes books or just by experimenting with the stuff you have in your inventory. \n\nThe combat system won't turn any heads around, but its not too shabby at all IMO, especially the ranged combat mechanic. Now, the lackluster skills tree and the clown mobile safe houses mechanic was a little weird and slightly detracted from the experience, but not by much.

The number of legitimate looking positive reviews indicates that whilst others have enjoyed the game I haven't.\n\nThe survival element from which the game takes it's name seems tacked on with little effect on game-play.  In the hours I've played I've never come close to starving or dehydrating.  A little message pops up telling you that you're becoming thirsty or hungry and that's solved by drinking or eating one of the many things in your inventory.\n\nThere are wells and bottles and canisters everywhere; I've haven't felt any tension or had to go on an epic quest to find water.  There are also edible plants everywhere so whilst meat might not always be on the menu starving is not going to happen.\n\nSleeping is ... strange.  There's no building or reinforcing shelters and no bedrolls or similar.  There is one special shack per island that has a closeable door.  That's the only place where you can sleep.  If you're 51% tired you can't sleep but if you're 49% tired than you must.  There's no wait command so sleeping through the night won't happen unless leave your character to get tired.\n\nAs survival games go there's no real element of survival in 'How to Survive'.

There's a bit of a learning curve for a lot of aspects, but once you get past the first island, things become a lot mroe clear. \n\nPros:\nNice storyline. I'm not generally a fan of zombie games, but it's a mix of nature survival and zombie survival\nCrafting lets you do different things without being too in-depth (though pretty linear/few overlapping components)\nPlentiful ammo, so if you use it properly, no real need for time-consuming CQB once you get going in the game\nWon't do any spoilers, but there are interesting twists and turns\nThe \"Kovac's Tips\" are a nice way of doing in-game tutorials; informative but fun and creative\nThe base game does a pretty good job of being clear about your goals, good map icons (though the DLC loses that in a lot of ways)\nOveral enjoyable to play, and keeps you drawn in for the base game (though for DLC, see above point)\n\nCons:\nThe camera angles... it's a fixed cam, or rather a series of fixed cams that semi-randomly rotate. No way to adjust your veiw. Sometimes enemies will be a few feet away, but you can't see them because of the camera angles.\nYou need to stockpile all your \"dropped\" weapons in a couple centralized places, or you'll lose track of where stuff is - no system for keeping track of what you drop (no chests, storage system, or map to show where stuff is)\nAfter the main game, not a lot is explained well enough - have to google A LOT later in the game\nLots of grinding later in the game, and though it says you're getting xp, it's essentially meaningless becaue of how the upgrades work\nIf you move offscreen, a horde of zombies could appear where you just were. Constantly clearing the map everywhere you go is a huge pain\nZombies respawn way too fast. If you can back-and forth between islands (or even off-and-on screen sometimes), everything fully regenerates right away\nNighttime combat: think Hyrule field from Ocarina of Time - no way to stop annoying pests popping up throughout the night, and from all around you.

The \"Kovac's Way\" DLC is a MUST HAVE! Without this, the base game is trash. If the difficulty is too hard for you, get \"Hello my name is... Nina.\" DLC, her skills make the hardest difficulty more manageable. \"El Diablo Islands\" DLC will adds a lot more content if you liked the base game.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I bought all the DLCs, and all my playthru and review is based on my experience of having all the DLCs activated.\n\nWARNING when buying DLCs, the \"Heat Wave DLC - x 3 pack\" is the same as \"Heat Wave DLC - Kenji's pack\", \"Heat Wave DLC - Abby's pack\" and \"Heat Wave DLC - Jack's pack\" combined! DO NOT REPEAT PURCHASE!\n\n\nThe game is quite interesting at first, but it gets boring and repetitive very soon. The game consists of fetch quests from start to finish. While fetching items, you got to take care of your other needs other than health.\n\nDuring the early game, you might need to spend some time gathering food and resources, but once you venture into 2nd island, food water and sleep are just things that take up some of your limited inventory space. And if you are playing solo, inventory space is VERY LIMITED! I play co-op with my friend, and yet we are still struggling on holding all the quest items and crafting ingredients.\n\nCrafting might seem complicated at first, but in fact there are only a handful of recipes to do.\n\nPlaying co-op have their pros and cons.\n- Co-op have a very lousy camera. Both players share the same camera, therefore when both players wander too far away from each other, off-screen zombies become very dangerous.\n- The connection is quite crappy, it will de-sync every couple of minutes, ruining a lot of fun. Also, the desync will cause the joining player to take a lot of damage sometimes. \n- Quest rewards will only be given to the host player, so if the reward is a good gun, only one of you will get to use it.\n- Food and drinks must be shared.\n+ You have double the inventory slot.\n+ You have double the health, so when one is dead the other can try to survive and revive the dead player without having to reload checkpoint.\n\nThe other game modes are a waste of time.\n\nIf you collect 100% achievements, you will need these DLCs.\n\n- [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/289730/]Kovac's Way DLC[/url]\n- [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/289734/]Barricade!

This game might not be the best zombie/crafting/survival game ever made, but it has a lot to offer when playing co-op.  Even if the game feels as though it could have been bigger.  The idea of keeping your character fed, hydrated, and rested while exploring zombie infested islands and crafting useful items from scraps is a fun idea that is implemented well with this game -- the world, items, and crafting options just seem a little lack luster.\n\nThe survival aspects of the game, eating, drinking and resting, are presented simply.  Safe houses must be discovered and cleared out for the character to have a safe place to rest.  This part of the game works well.  The safe houses get progressively more difficult to clear, and they are spaced appropriately throughout the game.  It would have been nice if the islands were larger.  The player must search for wild edibles or hunt for food.  Foods can be cooked and combined, but a lot of the times there is little to no reason to do it.  While it's fun to make a dish a Fish 'n' Chips, there is no difference from that and just a cooked fish.  This part feels as though it could have used more work.  Maintaining good hydration is another survival aspect that is done simply and effectively.  Fresh water can be found around the island, and the player can store water in different containers.  These containers can be re-used for water again, or for storing other liquids.  Various fruits and items can be mixed with water to make \"mix drinks.\"  This part of the survival felt as though it got more attention.  Every new drink that was discovered had different effects, and that led to more creative use of inventory space.\n\nThe back packs are a tad small; however, if you are planning on playing co-op, which I highly recommend, the back pack size works extremely well.  It took extra coordination between my partner and me, but that added a lot to the co-op.\n\nThe combat is solid and balanced.  What would be overwhelming at first, in time becomes just another brawl on the beach.  The learning curve fits well with the progression of the character.\n\nThe story is nothing exceptional, but that's not why I played this game.  However, all of the npcs are voice acted which is a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe asking price for this game feels right on.  It's a steal when it's on sale.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269475707", "timestamp_created": 1402419656, "timestamp_updated": 1402419847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692509055137634277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12515829": {"recommendationid": "12515829", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997190295", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1413587683}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good game, but camera work ruins whole gameplay in a cooperative mode.

Basically, survival part always puts you into some time limit, whether you have to find a place to sleep, or find food or water. But if you are careful and collect/use things around you in the right way, you'll deal with that part easily. Then comes zombie grinder part - you have to autoaim with melee or self-made firearms, trying either to QTE or headshot every zombie you meet. Sounds simple, but it can actually be a lot of fun. \n\nSo, to pros:\n 1. Maps are small, but very detalied, in very limited space of those islands, you have to run around a lot, and as you progress, seemingly same places become very different, as enemies and weapons change.\n 2. Enemies are nicely done - every enemy is a threat if you ot careful. Even stupidest and slowest zombie can damage you if you miss and for some reason have nowhere to run. And armored runner is a lot more dangerous, not even talking about zombie deers and such.\n 3. There are interesting recipes for different things - which you find throughtout the game. Altho, you can make those items way before you get recipes, which makes guides very useful. But in any event, you have lotf of options what to do with your things - for example you can cook and eat some meat, or make a trap for zombies with it.\n 4. Overall gameplay is satisfying, killing tons of enemies is fun, inventory management is alright (not too tedious), crafting is neither too simple nor too complicated.\n 5. Challenges and last difficulty add some interesting features to the main game - they worth checking on their own.\n\nCons:\n 1. Biggest one - DLC's. So there are several things that doesn't come with the main game \u2013 those are Last difficulty, Nina character, 3 more islands and 2 modes \u2013 One Shot Escape and Barricade. And you need all except Nina, to get all achievements. A bit lame. But, on the other hand \u2013 If you buying this game with 90% discount, it\u2019s not a big deal.\n 2. One shot Escape DLC in particular \u2013 idea of it is, creating the most hardcore experience in the game, forcing you going for long time with weakest weapons. But there is a problem with randomness \u2013 because sometimes you can find all details for next weapon after learing 20% of the island, and sometimes it takes 100%. It\u2019d be ok, if it always took 100%, at least that would be skill-based challenge, not luck-based.\n 3. Barricade DLC is flawed too. Again, idea of it is ok \u2013 you trying to protect one point on a map. Except, it is always same point, same island, same enemies, and point you protect for no good reason right on the crossroads, not in some corner, where it\u2019s easier to protect. Plus it takes literally hours to get even to wave 10. Maybe I was doing something wrong, but this mode is very strange.\n 4. Well, there is a bug. If you somehow go into boss\u2019 field of view, but if you are still far away (like behind trees, or on top of the mountain), if you do not get close to him fast (within 30 seconds or so), game can crash. Which can be painful in One Shot Escape mode, since you\u2019ll have to start all over.\n 5. If you play main game not on hardest difficulty \u2013 there is one OP weapon that kills everything. If you play highest difficulty, it gets obsolete, until you get one certain item, then it\u2019s OP again. (I won\u2019t spoil it for you).  But only main game suffers from it, most challenges just don\u2019t have enough items to create that weapon.\n\nSo, in the end, even with all those cons \u2013 most of them are about DLC\u2019s. I guess it\u2019d be more fair to rate every mode 1 by 1. So main game (with highest difficulty and islands DLC) \u2013 8/10, worth checking. Challenges \u2013 8.5/10, definitely worth trying. One Shot Escape \u2013 6/10, it\u2019s alright, but has flaws and requires skill and a lot of patience. Barricade \u2013 4/10, Idea could be implemented better for sure. So overall, I\u2019d still give a game as a whole rating 8/10 \u2013 It\u2019s an interesting experience.", "timestamp_created": 1534820242, "timestamp_updated": 1534820242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691279888153076172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17654455": {"recommendationid": "17654455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070646106", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 378, "last_played": 1440206691}, "language": "english", "review": "This review is coming from a stand-point of about 7 hours of solo play.\n\nDo I like this game? It's okay, I mean, it's nothing special, it's a twin-stick zombie survival game with a somewhat interesting crafting system.\n\nThe game-play, it's basic and easy to understand as all twin-stick games are. Nothing new. Which is totally fine, I mean it's a tried and tested system.\n\nThe story, I haven't finished the story, simply because I hit too many BDN (Board, done now) moments. I just couldn't do another fetch quest. That's all this game is, fetch quest after fetch quest after fetch quest. When did I hit my limit? When the drunk pilot wanted his cargo, where was it? All over the islands... All twenty pieces of the damn stuff. I quit, I was done with the game from then on. The characters were, eh. The only person that interested my in any way was Kovac, mainly because SPOILER ALERT [spoiler]he's apparently the one crashing the boats into the islands[/spoiler] SPOILER ALERT OVER. I say apparently because I have no idea if he is or not, though if that was him on the radio at the start of the game it makes sense as he seems to have a radio station at the top of his island. I digress. The characters are cliche to say the least, oh no a mother and daughter that are split up on a terrible island, the friend who was bitten but has the thing you need to get off the island, the crazy old lady, the apparent friend who is actually the villain, the disabled knowledgeable one who spends all their time tinkering with your escape rout and the drunk.\n\nMay as well look at this games big point, the crafting. It's okay. I mean you can make things, cool yeah, okay. I never bothered with the potions. The guns? Didn't bother with them either. Melee weapons? Rusty machete all the way. After I built the boomerang I just didn't need anything else. Nothing. And when I upped it with the red stone, nothing else would do. Now when I say I didn't bother with it, I mean I built every combination I could within 7 hours of play. Tested it, and still found the boomerang to be the best thing to use. Chainsaw? Nope. Flamethrower? Nope. Shotgun? Nope. Boomerang. Always.\n\nSurvival. Pha. My biggest problem surviving was diverting my attention from my current fetch quest to trek to water holes, or where I knew deer were or to safe houses when I got a little tired. Fuel for bombs was the biggest problem for my \"survival\". I had so much food on my person I could have fed all the survivors I had found with ease. Three jerry cans of water kept me going for days. Ammo was of no concern, I had stacks of the stuff on every island just sitting there. \n\nThe zombies, or should I say, \"Monsters\". Well there are ones you can kill in one hit, ones that have helmets, ones that have body armor, ones with both, tall ones, ones that come out at night, ones that explode, ones in fireman suits, zombie deers, zombie emus, and a big old boss thing. At first the ones that came out at night were a challenge but then, boomerang one hit kill. The ones with both pieces of armor are just annoying, takes two head shots to kill them, one to knock off the helmet and one to kill 'em. And when they're coming at you in a pack, it's just easier to run off and come back later. The firemen, hint hint, head shots, lots and lots of head shots unless you got yourself a means of using electricity. The deers just run at you, shoot twice, dodge, rinse and repeat. The boss thing is just like a very very weekend version of the Tank from L4D. They just seemed like distractions from the endless fetch quests.\n\nOh yeah side quests are, you guessed it, fetch quests. -_-\n\nThe camera angle is lovely, seeing the exploders just as they enter their area of effect is just dandy.\n\nThe lock on and head-shot system is good too, when your backing away from a group with your trusty boomerang out and it's just about to go red and another zombie bumps your target out of your aim and you gotta start over again. This is especially annoying against the fully armored zombies. Great.\n\nThe leveling system seems just, pointless, the most useful stuff is getting the upgrades that slow down your hunger, thirst and drowsiness. Everything else seems just like fluff to me.\n\nThe most fun I had in the game was going off doing the missions for the scientists on the islands where I was super-under prepared, there was a challenge, and it was ridiculous. Experiments that could change the magnetic fields surrounding the islands? Sounds good enough to me!\n\nIs this game worth the price tag, maybe in co-op. Maybe.

We had begun playing this game in 2019 the hardest mode (ironman mode). The game was somewhat interesting but wasn't thrilling enough for both of us to finish it in one queue. Somehow, after that day we didn't really feel like playing it and left it there like 2 yrs until 2 days ago. \n It's been almost 10 yrs since this game came out and even the sequel exists, but the essence of whole zombie survival vibe is lit. Playing the whole scenario wasn't so bad afterall. \n The story was kinda okay. There's a good twist in the story, full voice over and not so awkward plot-line. There are a lot of fetch quests though. It was pretty frustrating moving place to place so many times. I would have given up if I had played it solo.\n There are some variation of the infested. It feels like left for dead for some reason. Tanker, Boomer-like creature appears and the zombie sounds are very similar but there are also infested deer and ostriches so not total rip-off. \n You can make tons of weapons with lots of combination. Guns and bows look like the best choice at first, but getting the boomerang is the key. We wouldn't be able to finish the game with just using bows and guns because you have to fetch the ammo and arrows all the time and that's real pain in the ass.\n The game's a bit clunky time to time you might get some lagging moment but it's bearable. Sometimes saves got mixed up but starting over the game did fix the issue so I had no problem playing this game the whole time.\n  So, in short, it's not a game so entertaining that you would finish it right away, but somewhat interesting enough to remember finishing it and actually doing it 2 yrs later.\n<\ubc88\uc5ed>\n\uc774 \uac9c\uc744 \ub2e4\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc57d 2\ub144\uc758 \uc138\uc6d4\uc774 \uac78\ub838\ub2e4. 2019\ub144\uc5d0 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uae34 \ud588\ub294\ub370, \ud558\ub8e8\ub9cc \ud574\ubcf4\uace0 \ubb54\uac00 \uacc4\uc18d \ud574\uc57c\uaca0\ub2e4\ub294 \ub290\ub08c\uc740 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc11c \uc57d 2\ub144\uac04 \ub194\ub480\ub2e4\uac00 \uc774\ud2c0\uc804\uc5d0 \ub2e4 \uaeb4\ub2e4.\n\uc774\uac9c\uc740 \ub098\uc628\uc9c0 10\ub144\uc815\ub3c4 \ub418\uc5c8\uace0 2\ud0c4\ub3c4 \ub098\uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc880\ube44 \uc11c\ubc14\uc774\ubc8c \ubd84\uc704\uae30\ub294 \uc798 \uc0b4\uc544\uc788\ub294 \ud3b8\uc774\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ud588\uc744\ub584 \ub098\uc058\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc74c.\n \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac4d \uad1c\ucc2e\uc740 \ud3b8\uc774\ub2e4. \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc804\uc774 \uc788\uace0 \uc131\uc6b0\uac00 \ub2e4 \ubcf4\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud588\uc73c\uba70 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc5b4\uc0c9\ud558\uc9c4 \uc54a\ub2e4. \uadfc\ub370 \uc800\uae30\ub85c \uac00\uc11c \ubb50 \uc544\uc774\ud15c \uc5bb\uc5b4\uc11c \uac16\uace0\uc640\ub2ec\ub77c\ub294 \ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \uc870\ub0b8 \ub9ce\uc74c. \ud63c\uc790\ud588\uc73c\uba74 \uc544\ub9c8 \ub3c4\uc911\uc5d0 \ub54c\ub824\ucce4\uc744\uac83.\n \uc880\ube44\ub3c4 \uc5b4\ub290\uc815\ub3c4 \uc0c9\ub2e4\ub978 \uba74\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud3b8\uc774\ub2e4. \ub808\ud3ec\ub370\uac19\uc740 \ub290\ub08c\uc774 \uc788\uae34 \ud558\ub2e4. \ubd80\uba38, \ud0f1\ucee4\uac19\uc740 \uc880\ube44\uac00 \uc788\uace0 \uc18c\ub9ac\uac19\uc740\uac8c \ub808\ud3ec\ub370\uac19\uc740\ub370, \uac10\uc5fc\ub41c \ud0c0\uc870\ub098 \uc0ac\uc2b4\uac19\uc740\uac83\ub3c4 \ub098\uc624\ub2c8\uae4c \uc644\uc804 \ubca0\ub080\uac74 \uc544\ub2cc\uac74 \ud655\uc2e4.\n \ubb34\uae30\uac19\uc740 \uac78 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucf64\ube44\ub124\uc774\uc158\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc218 \uc788\ub294\ub370 \uc77c\ub2e8 \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d4 \ucd1d\ud558\uace0 \ud654\uc0b4\uc774 \uac13\uac13\uac19\uc740\ub370 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc740 \ubd80\uba54\ub791\uc774 \uc9f1\uc784. \ucd1d\ud558\uace0 \ud654\uc0b4\uc740 \uacc4\uc18d \ucd1d\uc54c\ud558\uace0 \ud654\uc0b4 \uc90d\uace0 \ud574\uc57c\ub418\uc11c \uac1c\uc9f1\ub0a8.\n \uac1c\uc784\uc744 \ud558\ub2e4\ubcf4\uba74 \uc57d\uac04 \ub809\uc774 \uac78\ub9ac\uae34 \ud55c\ub2e4 \uadfc\ub370 \ub9c9 \ubabb\ud560 \uc815\ub3c4\ub294 \uc544\ub2d8. \uc138\uc774\ube0c\ub3c4 \uac00\ub054 \uc774\uc0c1\ud560\ub54c \uc788\ub294\ub370 \uaed0\ub2e4 \ud0a4\uba74 \ud574\uacb0\ub428 \uadf8\ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0\uc120 \uc544\ubb34\ub7f0 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc74c.\n \uc9e7\uac8c \ub9d0\ud558\uba74 \ud558\ub8e8\ub9cc\uc5d0 \ub05d\ub0bc\ub9cc\ud07c \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub294 \uac9c\uc740 \uc544\ub2cc\ub370 2\ub144 \ub4a4\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ub3cc\uc544\uc640\uc11c \ub05d\ub0b4\uc57c\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uac01\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub05d\ub0b4\uac8c \ud560\uc815\ub3c4\uc758 \ub9e4\ub825\uc740 \uc788\ub294 \uac9c\uc774\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1641906789, "timestamp_updated": 1641906789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690376222133636475", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42435770": {"recommendationid": "42435770", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967260333", "num_games_owned": 338, "num_reviews": 159, "playtime_forever": 652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 496, "last_played": 1684592024}, "language": "english", "review": "I literally paid 1.5$ for this game.

The aiming mechanism is sometimes frustrating (especially with melee weapons, which it hardly even seems necessary for).

Best zombie game since those two that Valve did (and I'll play just about anything with zombies in it, let's face it).

The story is barebones, with plenty of space that was never expanded upon. Finally, the game is very short, with nothing more than trekking back and forth, plus ever increasing amounts of enemies that extend the time it takes to play.\n\nDespite all of that, the game manages to be quite a lot of fun.

Crash into the island, learn to survive, craft some stuff, do a few quests, try to escape. \n\nGameplay: Like I've said earlier, it's much like Dead Frontier. Some may slap titles like Diablo or Alienation but How to Survive is way less complex than those games. This title almost borderlines resembles a browser game FFS. It's a top down, you move with WADS, aim by hovering your mouse over the head of your enemy, and 100% headshot as long as the reticle is red, a bit like Zombie revenge.... Wow those references are making me feel old. Melee is also horrible, though it can clear space in a bind, and is necessary on later islands. Crafting is a huge part of the game; weapons, healing items, food, quest items, etc, all require thorough examination of the whole islands, which in turn can become annoying or boring AF to one who simply wants to have meaningful content. Not to mention how harsh the inventory can be if you go through it alone. Each of the 4 characters have a different skill tree but I'm not really sure if it really matters considering there are obvious better weapons and they aren't the ones you expect. The campaign is playable co-op, and to me was the saving grace. I'm a sucker for unique experiences that make me drag someone else along through my horrendous experiments and experiences. \n\nGraphics: They're not as bad as how wonky the game is, I'm surprised to say it looks okay! \n\nAudio: Repetitive. Nothing atrocious though.\n\nIMO, this is the kind of game you can have fun with a friend, couch co-op style. I had originally tried it on XBOX 360 with my son, but never managed to finish it with him. Time flies. Nearly 10 years later I thought I'd give it a finish. Still as dumb as I remember. KOVAC RULES.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's the term you're supposed to use.

You need to scavenge various materials to make weapons, tools, and food. There are different types of herbs, sticks, animals, various junk items that become useful later, and more.\nThe other main feature I would like to point out is the \u201cleveling system\u201d, mostly everyone is familiar with this concept by now, in this game when you level, you get skill points that you can spend to get different perks and abilities.\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] How to Survive has a total of 43 achievements. There are four categories: 1) Completed while playing through the game on you first play through [i](about 7-12+ achievements, depends on how thorough you are when you play)[/i]. 2) Complete these special abilities/conditions. 3) Difficulty related achievements... These are always the roughest achievements to get in the game because it requires Mastery and stubborn determination. 4) Lastly, there are DLC achievements so if you want to go for 100%, you'll need the DLC [i](about 6 achievements)[/i].\n\n[b]Price:[/b] How to survive is priced at $14.99 This game will definitely earn it's value from gameplay, My personal preference is that I always want a game to last one hour for every dollar. If you'd like a better deal I recommend waiting for a steam sale; be it summer or winter.\nI also need to mention that I didn't actually buy this game, it was gifted to me by Eyriana (other names: \u201cDecimaeya\u201d and \u201cUnreal\u201d), so thank you for the gift!\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] There is one more feature that should be mentioned before I wrap up my review; there is multiplier and local co-op, but I haven't played those modes yet. \nTo quickly recap, the story was stereotypical, the gameplay was crafting + looting * Zombies, the Achievements are generally hard earned + DLC, and the price is fair because of how long you'll play the game.\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes the following genres: Zombie, Survival, Crafting. Thanks for reading my review!\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update September 08, 2015:\n[b]DLC[/b]\nHere's the URL to see my review for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/258543/]Heat Wave[/url]\nHere's the URL to see my review for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/289730]Kovac's Way[/url]\nHere's the URL to see my review for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/289731]Hello my name is...

Incredibly deep crafting system makes you craft something completely useless and this is the first time I saw something like this in any kind of crafting games.\n\nHow To Survive is an indie gem that looks cheap, feels cheap and plays lovely. Basically, this is one of those games you've dared to love before huge web portals and trend-fueled magazines told you it's not OK to love these kind of games because of I don't know what reason.\n\nI recomend to all my friends...so get it now and embrace the zombie survival :D hooooooooooo yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaa", "timestamp_created": 1452022778, "timestamp_updated": 1452022778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658493518829345703", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9155458": {"recommendationid": "9155458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049226133", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 579, "last_played": 1416856827}, "language": "english", "review": "How to survive \u2013 more like how to not get frustrated :D\n\n-Before a friend and I could even play the game we needed to restart the game 3 times and even during the game it would freeze and a restart was needed. For example talking to character made the whole game freeze so we didn\u2019t try to talk to the character again :D\n- Another thing that really annoyed me was that you are not able to save the game in the Main Menu. You need to wait till you get to a checkpoint or something similar. If you die before the checkpoint\u2026yep playing everything again. Frustrating.\n-The looting system in the coop mode is horrible. If one person picks an item up only one of the player has the weapon so on. Also if you get a reward, my friend and I had the problem that only he gets the rewards and I get nothing. And that at the beginning of the game. Frustrating. \n-Your character has 4 \u201cneeds\u201d: Health, hunger, thirst and exhaustion. So you always need to make sure you have food and something to drink. But if you play as a pair it\u2019s not easy to have always enough food for both. Having these needs gives the game a realistic touch but I found it frustrating :D\n\nBut even if the game is having some bugs and so on I had fun playing it.\n\n+The crafting system is nice and easy to understand.\n+I liked the bird's eye view of the game. It\u2019s something different from what you normally play.\n+ The game is about Zombies. So yeah\u2026.fighting zombies is fun :D\n+The animations looked sometimes really weird but I still like them. For example the character has different \u201cfinisher moves\u201d.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have high expectations the game can make a lot of fun,especially if you play the coop mode.

I wonder what the new \"zombie\" will be and how long it will take to get here? Oh well, I shouldn't let that get in the way of telling you about How to Survive! HtS is actually a very enjoyable little game, kind of like Zombie Driver, Alien Breed and Diablo II ran a train on Krater. I can't put my finger on it, but it really did feel like I had played HtS before, and to me that's a really good sign that a game is made properly (at least to my liking, anyway). I found it challenging, but not so much that I wanted to go Super Saiyan on my screen, and was genuinely interested by the plot twists and creative story. I found this surprising because HtS, at first glance, looks like your run-of-the-mill horde grinder, but upon closer inspection I found it to be much more.\nThe crafting system is elaborate enough yet easy to understand, that it is not only enjoyable, but essential to the gameplay. The environments are colourful enought that you don't feel like you've been sating at ants scurrying across tea-stained paper for hours, though a little more variation like cave systems would have added a bit of contrast. Everything worked, no bugs, no pulling my hair out looking for fixes or walkthroughs, and the in-game tutorials on how things work were humorously done, adding an element of comedy that you don't often see in survival games.\nIf you're beween AAA titles and you're looking for something casual to break it up a bit, How to Survive has to be one of the best little games I've played in a long time.

Not that the story shines, it is pretty predictable although a great bite sized chunk of fun to play. Especially the Survival guide books, great fun presentation of zombie and survival staples and had me searching for them just to have a chuckle at what they had to say. Was pretty sad to see there are only 11 of them but there is a lot more to the game. \n\nOverall I felt a great sense of progression due to the decent crafting system, looking back to the start of the game and the end the power curve is good and left me feeling like a badass at the end. There are a decent amount of enemy types, but I would have preffered a few more boss battles. The combat at its most advanced will have you dodging enemy charges and reacting with a few shots where you can, the combat is satisfactory but can get tedious where some of the enemies spawn just out of sight and the whole map never really feels like you are making an impact. \n\nAll that aside it is fine, the combat is as fun as you want to make it, but you will not always feel as though levelling is necessary as the skill tree was pretty dissapointing. Crafting however was fun and I always had something to craft throughout the playthrough. I think I played it just right because the game was quite easy. \n\nIf you are looking for a good 8 hours to burn and enjoy top down twin stick shooters, then you will be pleased. But I would not come here for a challenge, unless you play ironman mode, but I'm not sure if that ramps up difficulty and might cause a few headaches. \n\nI did not encounter too many bugs, just visable glitches quite often but nothing to lay out and complain about. \n\nGood game, not great but definitely recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1526294299, "timestamp_updated": 1526294299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654784142971038818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119042755": {"recommendationid": "119042755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055017547", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 3344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3344, "last_played": 1658181656}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, it's time to write a review for a 9 year old game.

Ranged is annoying, your aim constantly switches between enemies stopping you from landing headshots and nothing you can do about it.\n-Camera positioned weirdly, it often places itself behind a tree so you can't see anything, which may easily lead to your death.\n-Repetative.

It is a shame when you consider the potential.  The gameplay starts out being fun, but quickly you are forced to notice a deliberate lack of polish.  The cut scenes look like something from a high school class.  Much of the game and the \"story\" felt uninspired.  The skill tree did not give meaningful choices.  You will notice more if you play the game yourself.  It's all the little things that add up and kill.\n\nThe main issue for me was there were tons of bugs and desynchronization issues that soured enjoyment.  Some bugs include characters disappearing from the screen, permanently losing items and weapons that took a while to build, quest tracking issues forcing you to guess the way, and game pausing constantly for lag in the middle of battles.  It leaves you feeling frustrated because you cannot seem to go more than 5-10 minutes without encountering a bug, especially when they impede your progress for the umpteenth time that session.  There was a breaking point that I reached where I just got tired of dealing with it all and just decided to finish the game, forgoing the rest of the DLC and side quests.\n\nI will mention that I played this strictly coop and I wonder if part of the problem we experienced was due to lag from one of us being in Europe and the other in the US.

There are stupid limitations, like 6 molotov max (MAX! i can carry loads of items, but allowed only 6 molotovs!), bullets stacks in 500, arrows in 100, wooden stick in 10, etc. \n- camera... oh my.. What is the use of long range weapon with camera which looks from above on me and hiding anything of turn?? Approaching anything from north means it will charge before you see it.\n- targeting.. I want to see how the guy who innovate this targeting system plays the game, because I think he never bothers to do so. I crafted 100 explosive arrows to waste 90 of them trying to shoot barrikade.. it targets anything else, but not goddamit barikade which I have to go through to progress.\n- respawn.. while trying to create a \"base\" (to keep all unknown loot and valuables) I had so much pain.. moving half screen away and then back to find dozens of zombies coming from nowhere.. really?\n- farming.. oh yeah, crocodile quests. I killed like 100, but never seen claws or head and they are needed for quests. Same goes for deers. What are the chances to have their head dropped? 0.0001%?\n- map.. best names of locations ever: \"Isle of <insert some strange word here>\", I can't remember names nor pathes, map doesn't let me to see all islands, how I suppose to navigate all that crap?\n- night.. the fact is: it's not dangerous enough, but annoying as hell. It's bad to explore (you see bad), it's bad to travel (you may run into a pack of zombies, or worse), it's impossible to skip. The only way to \"sleep\" is to get tired, I can drink while at full thirst, but I am not able to sleep..\n- craft, best example of how to make crappy and annoying craft. constant inventory micromanagement. some items have \"undo\" option, some not, go loose your precious component while experimenting or click 100 times while crafting few items..\n- bugs: items dissappears when dropped (loose my chain component, never been able to make it again), overstacking inventory issue (described earlier), constant crashes (luckily on map loading)..\n\nI could easily finish it.. wait, I couldn't it.

Using either a mouse + keyboard combination or a gamepad, you're hitting / slashing / shooting zombies. It works just fine with both, and you can switch to an axe with a simple press if you're getting swarmed with your bow. Obviously the game is an hack'n'slash with zombies so you can expect all its traditional elements: special zombies and bosses. How To Survive also features a neat craft system, so you can gather as much crap as possible in order to make the weapon of your dreams. One issue with that though, the inventory tends to be full most of the time since it's so small. As for the survival, you can hunt, gather plants or fruits, water, then cook it all before heading to bed.\n\n2) Story\nYou're a survivor, so you meet other survivors who just happen to want the same thing as you: survive in order to escape the zombie outbreak. Though the game is rather humorous, guess we'd all turn out crazy if zombies started to invade the streets.\n\n3) Graphics\nNothing much to say. The game looks nicey with \"realistic\" graphics, which somehow manages to feel refreshing. Hooray, no pixel shading!\n\n4) Coop\nIt's as good as the singleplayer: there are more enemies and they tend to hit harder since you're two. Yes. Two. That is a bit disappointing, but at least they did it right. Well, almost. Both players have to stay in the same \"screen\" in order to progress, so don't expect to finish a quest while your partner is farming xp.\n\n5) Conclusion: I picked it up for almost nothing and didn't actually expect the game to be that good, def one of the most pleasing hack'n'slash and coop game I tried. The survival elements and the crafting system tend to spice up the gameplay, which is just what the genre needed to last longer. I'd love it even more if the game was a little longer though... 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1415109151, "timestamp_updated": 1688030921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633396029472351074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23203164": {"recommendationid": "23203164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014906902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 1797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1737, "last_played": 1497619753}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice Survival game with nice crafting system and land to explore.

You can even make fishing rods to fish as well.  \n\nThere is a crafting system and it was somewhat unique and fun in my opinion.  You gather up resources you find throughout the island(s) and you can craft things like axes, bows, body armor, guns and explosive devices.  You will also be finding plants scattered about and you can combine them and make healing items.\n\nHerbalism ranges from making healing items, tonics for shields, better aiming and so forth.  For the most part all I ever used were the healing items.  Making shields and what not only lasted you 15-30 secs and it's gone.  There wasn't much threat throughout the game unless you neglected to upgrade your weapons.\n\nThreats on these islands range from your normal zombies to zombies in full tactical gear to giant Resident Evil Nemesis creatures.  Even the wildlife can turn and cause more problems than the zombies do.  Zombie deer?  You betcha!  If you happen to die you end up leaving a tombstone on the ground.  There's nothing for you to retrieve, but once your friends log in they can see where you've perished.  I saw plenty of people I recognize dead all over the place.\n\nThere is a story throughout your adventure and your goal is to get off the island.  There are other people stranded which act as quest givers.  Quests are mostly just fetching items or off to see your next NPC that always comes with funny dialog.\n\nThe DLC consists of challenge modes, the barricade mode and an extra story line that takes place on El Diablo Islands.  The challenge modes are just that.  Complete certain game functions without dying and nothing in your inventory.  Barricade mode is you build a base and keep the zombies out of the base to protect a wounded friend.  You run around and pick up wood and make \"barricades\".\n\nThe base games story mode took me around 14 hours to beat and El Diablo Islands takes 3-4 more hours.  Max level is 15 and you can respec the skill tree 4 times.  The full game runs around $20 (including all DLC), but can often be picked up for $2 on sale.  Well worth it if the above seemed interesting to you.  Fans of this game asked the devs to make a 3rd person view and there is one availabe.  So, if you'd prefer to play this 3rd person over top down then check that one out instead.  It's the same game just different perspective.\n\nIt's a great time and it was great fun.  Always looked forward to finding my next blue print so I could upgrade my gear.

The first time I heard about How To Survive it sounded like another survival game on a zombie apocalypse, with crafting elements, drinking, eating, cooking, hunting etc. After playing it I can safely say it's not exactly as it was advertised or as the videos seem to show you. How To Survive is an isometric shooter, pretty similar to the Alien Shooter and Zombie Shooter series, which in my opinion are very good ones, but with a slight different twist to it. Graphically I'd say the game is rather nice looking but nothing that will blow your mind and animation quality is somewhat rough and to be desirable. The sound assets are pretty poor in my honest opinion and the voice acting is something to laugh at but it does get the job done. Story wise the game has fairly little to it, you stranded on a series of islands and there you find that these islands are infested by zombies are other creatures, you also find various survivors and Kovac, a guy who helps you and gives you tutorials, which are present as chapters of his survival book and they teach you the basics of the game, Kovac is probably the only funny guy in the game because he has a russian/soviet accent. The game features a serious of basic mechanics such as fishing, crafting, hunger, thirst and tiredness. Fishing is best done at dawn and at sundown, as you might expect hunger and thirst are dealt with eating and drinking while tiredness is either dealt with by eating certian fruits or capturing certain safehouses, when you open the doors to these safehouses it will trigger a wave event of sorts, alot of zombies and creatures will come at you and after you've cleared the area you can enter the safehouse, close the door, and then you can save your game and sleep on some sort of bed that is laying on the ground. Now the crafting along with the inventory management system and the way it works is probably one of the things I was most disappointed by, your inventory is fairly limited in terms of space and that's to be expected from something that is similar to a survival game but the fact that you need to go to the menu and check each recipe individually and that you have to select an item and then you click combine and it will show you the items which you can combine that item with is rather frustrating to me because it won't tell you what you will get by combining those items together without you having to check the menu, I'm pretty sure they could've had putted something that indicated what would the outcome of that combination will be but whatever. Nonetheless in terms of actual crafting recipes it's actually very varied, you can combine harpoon grips with diving tanks and some other stuff in order to make a pressurized pistol, shotgun or submachine gun, the ammo for these guns are found in zombies bodies and I believe it's mainly metal scrap, shrapnel and screws, of course you can also craft various kind of armour such as combining a soldier helmet with a bone in order to make some sort of horned helmet or mixing plants in order to make various kind of potions such as shield potions, aim potions etc. Now the combat, the combat is probably the best thing from How To Survive, you usually have melee and ranged weapons and the melee weapons are pretty standard, machetes, stone axes or chainsaws, and you can charge your melee attack if you keep holding the attack button which will result in increased damage, ranged weapons are maybe the best way of fighting, there's various types of bows you can craft and when you kill someone with a arrow you can go to their body and get the arrow back so this is a very efficient way of taking out individual or small groups of enemies and you can also make incendiary arrows. The aiming system is fairly enjoyable actually, you basicly have one button for shooting/attacking and another one for aiming, by keeping the aiming button pressed a little circle will appear around the enemies head and the more you keep it pressed the little the circle will become and eventually it will become a red crosshair which means it will be an headshot which is the most effective way of taking down enemies the way I see it. However by the time you figure this out the game starts introducing you to zombies with soldier helmets which will require you to take their helmets off and only then taking them down and the same happens with zombies with kevlar vests which require you to charge your melee attack in order to chop their head off. In the end I didn't really enjoyed How To Survive but I can surely say that is a good game, even though it tries to get you in an emotional way at some times and it fails horribly, in my case it just wasn't what I was expecting it to be and so I ended up just abandoning my playthrough and I don't plan to go back and beat it. Overall I'd say that if this is what you're looking for you should grab it, if you're not sure yet I'd recommend waiting for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1391260144, "timestamp_updated": 1391260243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614171683788299561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11625940": {"recommendationid": "11625940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004535810", "num_games_owned": 965, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 639, "last_played": 1407660902}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy it while its on sale.

"language": "english", "review": "welp after so many years of playing this im actually going to make a review of this, its not going to be superb and mostly i suggest trying out the game for yourself to see if you like it but anyway, i remembered when this hit on the xbox 360 a long time ago and i really enjoyed it i had a blast playing it through to the very end and the style of this said game reminds me alot of diablo with the top down character angles along with the characters having sort of unique perks to grab but either than the stats you start out with all the characters are practically the same which by that point why not just allow us to create our own then?\n\nalong with the characters being somewhat bland they have no voice acting for any of them whatsoever which makes them pretty much more bland because at least diablo 1 and 2 of what this game tries to pull off here but at least the rest of the game has voice acting and some of the characters dialog its SO GOOD, especially Kovacs, his is pretty much my favorite besides the one in the El diablo islands dlc where you try to get the fireproof boots off of him i dunno who exactly voices him but he did a damn good job IMO, but the rest of the voices arent as good and some are flat out terrible not to mention but reading the text boxes and listening to the voice actor/actresses sometimes they go completely off script from what the text boxes show.\n\nnow for the gameplay, like i have said before it plays alot similar to diablo would play with sometimes fuck ton of enemies on screen but when you lvl up for perk points thats a bit different because mostly if not all just gives you the ability to craft certain stuff like potions along with some other tools but of course pending on what character you choose has some stuff a bit differently than the rest, like one chick named nina she can craft a flamthrower for an example while the rest of the characters cant or another as an ability to make incindairy handmade gun ammo as another example, one thing about the gameplay is its crafting system, its a pretty basic one but not bad just nothing to write home about and its easy to use also to craft everything you need weapons/armor/ect, but the biggest highlight but also IMO that shouldve been expanded upon is the weapons, the handmade guns in this game is 'the cream of the crop' if you love guns along with handmade D.I.Y. stuff this game has you covered, you can make to couple of handguns along with a machine gun and a rifle along with a couple of shotguns and bows and a crossbow along with a chainsaw (the meta weapon of this game when using melee) and this is also what im talking about, they couldve expanded on this section more because the handmade guns if were not counting the bows/crossbows and melee weapons so in total there are about 6 guns in the game you can craft but lets face it by the time you even get the machine gun or the rife the bows you have made are out of the window by that point, and the armor you can craft theres only like 4 if we`re talking about full on crafting while the chest pieces and headgear you get you`ll just end up adding on to over time with upgrades, so that i can say that also couldve been expanded but eh, also one last thing i forgot to mention about this are the redstones these stones are the most OP crafting item in the game with NO DOWNSIDES they can give your weapons a 50% dmg buff but technically the ONLY downside is once youve applied it to a weapons of your choice good luck getting that back along with so long not being able to uncombine your weapons because once its on it stays permanently, and dont worry about accidently using it on the wrong weapon because like i have said its EVERYWHERE, you can find these stones hidden away and some completely out in the open and if you chooses to partake in the monkeys side quests your going to end with with one of them handing it to you for collecting something basic they need that you more than likely picked up for crafted without even thinking about it, by the time you make it to end game all your weapons are going to have this stone applied reguardless, IMO they should cut down on most of these you can obtain because sometimes it makes the game WAY too easy especailly on the Zombie mini boss variants in this that im dubbing 'the tank' because you`ll know why after you see them :).\n\nspeaking of which thats another thing there are also zombie types but all of them arent even a threat besides 3, you got your casual walkers and shamblers and then you got runners along with some special ones like the tall zombies they dont do anything besides take a bit more hits that a normal one would along with that but you can chop off there heads or perform fatalities on them then you got the fat ones that explode if you get too close to them or if you damage one enough they`ll start to jog at you before blowing up these one are mostly like 80% of the time going to be your greatest threat because there everywhere and they arent usually alone either but you can see these guys coming a mile away before they get you in time especially during safe base raids, they like to spawn in bundles sometimes like 2 or 3 will be close to each other so they are easy to deal with, unless theres a horde and the game auto locks on whats infront of your sight thats when it gets a bit difficult to handle, then you got the zombie mini bosses which they rarely ever come into play and the dont spawn normal like the rest, these ones are scripted spawns in the story once you progress so far and they usually not that bad to deal with, all you can do to take one down is by just focusing for headshots the entire time and keep your distance and you`ve already won, because all there attacks mostly are melee anyway and it has only 2 attacks that are ranged, which it can through copses at you or charge which since meleeing it isnt an option be prepared to hide behind terrain and rocks often then you got zombie animals which arent that big of a deal but one particular one that i do need to mention because pending where you are along with where it spawn this thing can easily kill you but luckily it doesnt spawn often so, which is the zombie deer, these guys do nothing but ram you the entire time and hardly stop to give you a break, just like the tank you gotta keep you distance because melee weapons are useless and they WILL stunlock you to the ground if you try to confront them with melee, automatic weapons like the machine/sten/shotguns are good against these fuckers and also another hint of warning when these guys show up they arent alone either so be in a wide open area when facing these if you can help it, then you got zombie ostriches/komdo dragons them both are pretty much the same except the komodo dragons are a tougher variant and can be only seen in the dlc islands only these onse are just like the runner zombies but take a bit more hits and the run quicker than a normal zombie would and the go down easier than the normies so not that much danger besides being there a bit much of them and thats pretty much it.\n\ni would explain the story but this is already getting long as it is and im tired of typing this so and since the game pretty much explains itself and people have already done this but i`ll end this with this note if your a fan of zombies, diablo, and like some d.i.y. shit this games for you and id highly recommend picking this up when you get the chance its a good game with a

How To Survive is similar to Diablo in the sense that you have the same isometric camera angle and you eliminate tons of enemies - this time, however, it's zombies instead of demons.\n\nYou can pick one from the available 3 protagonists - each has different strength and their skill tree is also different. Attributes change automatically - when levelling up after a set amount of XP you get to decide only which skill to pick.\n\nOur heroes pretty soon meet Kovac, a mysterious fellow fully dressed in armor, who provides us with guidance as to how to survive. He explains eating, drinking, sleeping and the importance of - most of all - weapon crafting. There are dozens of items out there and they can be combined in various ways. When looting you'll bump into new guides regularly and these can be looked at from the menu.\n\nI like how many types of foods could be made to quickly quell our hunger or thirst. A special fruit or root even eliminated our tiredness. Sleeping is only possible at select locations - these are shackles that must be rid of the walking dead before they can be entered. Not only sleeping but saving our progress is done at these locations. \n\nYou find materials, you eliminate zombies, you pick up some herbs and fruits, you loot, free some locations, rinse and repeat. This is How to Survive in a nutshell. There are some side missions, extra difficulty levels and a separate challenge mode offering even more entertainment.\n\nWhile an indie game How To Survive looks very decent. Once night falls new enemies appear who try to jump at you from behind. Your flashlight, however, provides the very source they are afraid of. This and fire are especially nice and I liked the fog effect, as well. The game employs some excellent physics effect, too. My favourite weapon from halfway through till the very end of the story was a boomerang I reinforced greatly with some bones and flint. Initially, however, melee will do along with a bow which you also get to make better and better.\n\nIn any case, I found How To Survive an entertaining experience. Too bad some difficulty levels (including new enemies and weather effects) and additional locations are only available in the form of DLCs. Make no mistake: if you liked it you'll probably pick them up, too, it's just a shame they have to rely on the same concept as some of the AAA developer companies do.\n\nWhen discounted give How To Survive a try. But just the base game.

And, of course, it also depends on your skill. At the beginning of my time with this title, I was sometimes a bit frustrated because I did not know my way around. But after a while, I got hold of it, and then the game mechanics worked really well. Even on the hardest setting (\"Kovac's Way\"), I found enough resources to rather easily survive. Of course, I still died a lot because of the sometimes tough enemies (and of their sheer numbers, of course). This is expectable for such a title, I think, and I can hardly imagine anyone not dying quite regularly. Admittedly, I could have avoided many of these deaths if I used health boosters more often. I amassed them, and had about 100 of the poultices at the end. So, you see, you could use them fairly often (and much more often then I did). But even if you do not and die frequently, this is not too big an issue since you start at the last checkpoint with about 50% health. Here, I would have preferred the game always displayed when the progress is saved.\nThe presentation and graphics are very solid, and especially when the daytime and/or weather changes, the lighting effects are beautiful.\nOccasionally, there have been some minor graphic bugs, and also sound issues. For example, the voice level of the characters was not always identical. Also, some design issues were noticeable, such as the presence of one NPC at two places simultaneously which was illogical, of course.\nThe controls are decent, and the two stick combination when using an Xbox 360 controller is rather nicely done. I would recommend using a controller instead of the keyboard and mouse combination, but it is obviously up to you to find out what works for you.\nThe story is also surprisingly good as it is intriguing and offers unexpected plot turns.\nThis game is much more about action than horror I think. So do not expect a really creepy exerience.\nA very good point is also the playtime. I have spent around 50 hours to finish the storyline with just one of the characters, including all the DLC. \n\nAll in all, apart from the minor problems, I give this title a 76 % rating.", "timestamp_created": 1507415581, "timestamp_updated": 1507415581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609428167343139648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65859506": {"recommendationid": "65859506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211371321", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 10113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9842, "last_played": 1585447443}, "language": "english", "review": "This game works fine in Single Player and no achievement has glitch.

Usually with a rusty machete, chainsaw, an axe, a boomerang or some makeshift gun which looks more like a vacuum cleaner than a deadly weapon.\n\nLet's just get it out of the way, the combat is extremely boring. It's boring, tedious and lackluster, and when you got thousands upon thousands of zombies chasing you then you'll get bored relatively fast. The developers also added a finish-move/take-down mechanic when the enemies health drops too low, but even that function is in most cased an hindrance for you to use.\n\nThe difficulty is also laughable. On the games website it says:  [b]\"Try the \u201cIron Man\u201d difficulty for a demanding hardcore game experience.[/b] \nCalling the Iron Man difficulty a hardcore experience is an insult to people who crave hard games. I died a few times because of my own stupidity (I used the take-down move and it got me surrounded), but other than that the Iron Man mode is a walk in the park. I never had any problem finding ammo, food, water or shelter.\n\nThere isn't a lot of \"surviving\" to do in this game, the crafting is tedious and the items you can craft are very limited. Craft yourself a triple bladed boomerang (with spikes) as soon as possible (on the second island) and you'll never want to use another weapon ever again.\nAmmo, food, water and shelter can be found everywhere, it basically becomes a chore to survive, and that chore isn't even remotely fun.\n\nThe game also suffers from being ridden with bugs and is also terribly unoptimized. When you got an almost new computer with an i7 processor, 16gb ram and a 2gb memory card which has problems to render the water properly, then you know the developers were pretty lazy.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game, not by a long shot. It's simply not worth your time or your money.", "timestamp_created": 1391384678, "timestamp_updated": 1391384755, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 141, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600813984870910645", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 8, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 4264, "total_negative": 1321, "total_reviews": 5585}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwErkXi++9cE": "Mon Apr 22 23:41:57 2024"}}
