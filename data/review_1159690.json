Watch a Youtube vid or Twitch stream instead. \n\nThis is definitely a GREAT looking game, bar none. The graphics are gorgeous and the soundtrack can be both beautiful and epic (the BWAH of the piece as you enter the gates is magnificent). And although you can see the source of inspiration (Raft comes to mind), the concept is solid. Another well-shown crafting/survival game in limited confines.\n\nThat's all the good that is there. The biggest detriment to my enjoyment was the realization that everything was towards nothing. The sinking feeling I got around the fourth or fifth station was that every station is the same...same layout, same expectations, same loot placements. This speaks to a profound laziness in design that spreads throughout the game.\n\nThe enemies are all the same...faceless putties that you can massacre with time by just standing outside their travel range. The AI governing their movements is laughable and never presses advantages or is strategic in numbers. The fact that their actual bodies move in the same way every time just gives away the illusion.\n\nThe story is probably the other big example of this. I'm chasing a missing scientist, and at 12 hours I still am absolutely no closer to knowing anything. Vids I've seen show islands and other tech advancements (and very stereotypical \"battle wave\" fights), but even then once they got the train decked out, it was just more of the same. \n\nI dunno. I love the look, the feel, and the sound, but playing it just feels empty. Look pretty and do as little as possible, I guess.  I am willing to wait the inevitable years-long stretch for early access to churn through, but I don't hold out hope for more unless a drastic rewritting or redesign is made.\n\nPS: and please change the narrator.

To illustrate some similarities, both games have crafting, expanding a mobile base, attacking sharks, tech trees etc... Where this game fails to make things fun is that it decides to stack all the annoying mechanics of Raft that were made bearable by mechanics inside raft and turns them even more annoying. \n\nShark attacking you? He will absolutely chew through your train while having insane amounts of health and will cost you resources that are absolutely replaceable but annoying to get.\n\nGet a grappling hook? Cool, now instead of swimming midair you can pull every item ONE BY ONE instead of having something like Raft's barrels that contain multitudes of items. \n\nStandard chests? Let's give them four slots. Inventory? Ten slots. Most items stack to 10 so inventory is extremely limited for hours before the first and second backpack upgrades.\n\nYou have arrived at a station and need to deal with its goons?

You are part of a crew of an Interdimensional Express Train, or so it would seem. Voidtrain was out on EPIC for just over a year before It came to steam and I followed its development VERY closely as \"Open World Survival Craft\" games are my jam... sadly... Voidtrain falls flat on almost every single aspect that they are advertising it as. Below I will state my pros/cons, my opinion and why I think it is being \"falsely advertised\", so, let's get to it.\n\n[h1][b] Cons/Issues [/b][/h1] \n\u26abSo to begin with - The \"open world survival craft\" tag. The game is NOT \"open world\". Its a \"CONCEPT\" of open world. You are PERMANENTLY stuck/tethered onto a TRAIN 90-95% of the time you will be playing. NO open world exploration at all unless you count the \"TRAIN STATIONS\" as the open world part... which is another matter to attend to soon enough. \n\u26abThe enemies #1 - The Shark. This \"enemy\" is nothing more but a resource eating machine. Your \"GUN\" deals next to 0 damage to the shark enemy, expanding ALL your ammo, meanwhile the shark CHEWS through your train like it is bubblegum, again, expanding all your resources to repair.\n\u26abThe enemies #2 - The \"Humans\". All of the human type enemies are also stupidly high in health. No matter what you hit them with... they have at least 3-4x more health than you do.\n\u26abThe enemies #3 - Another note about the human enemies, once you encounter them once, from that moment onward they will have PERMANENT armour and fully automatic weapons while you are stuck with a 0 armour penetration pistol and 0 armour plates.\n\u26abYou can get access to a \"GRAPPLING GUN\" VERY early in the game. You know the steam videos showing gameplay and that, well guess what... it doesn't show you the ACTUAL gameplay. Standing on your train for HOURS reeling in materials over and over and over and over.... not only that, you have to reel the items in 1 by 1. Yeah you can get a \"MAGNET\" upgrade but trust me... materials are NEVER that close for this \"upgrade\" to work.\n\u26abStorage/Chests - When you think of a chest or storage youd think 10-15 slots for a small 20 for medium and 30 or so for large (all depends what game your thinking of) well... the STARTING chests only have 4 slots that stack 10 items per slot making storage/invetory management EXTREMELY tedious for countless hours, until you manage to upgrade for O N E extra slot per chest.... WOW... \n\u26abYou can complete \"arena missions\" to get specific materials. Good luck getting AMMO as the devs give you ammo AFTER you kill a wave and only ONCE. Whoever thought this was a good idea, hope they got fired.\n\u26abThe \"COOP\" aspect of the game makes it SO MUCH WORSE. If you have a train built up and  you have walls around a \"carriage\" and your friend stands in the way of the door,  they can body block you making navigating your train when it is NOT stationary an absolute hassle at times.\n\u26abThe guns/ammo - So, the ammo types in this game are just not good. They make no sense and deal NO damage to ANYTHING. With a maxed out gun (in terms of BEST of the BEST weapon parts) Hunter bullets (which track targets) deal next to no damage to ANY enemy at all because they all have armour.... plates.... on. Not only that you go through YOUR OWN ammo at an exeptional rate and if you run out... your back to your petty pea shooting pistol.\n\u26abThe gunsmith system is really cool. Being able to build my own guns in a way that I like is a fantastic idea but its VERY limited and lacking at times.\n\n[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] \n\u26abThe art style is gorgeous\n\u26abYou can get little pets called \"Rofleemo/s\" which gather materials floating, shoot guns to defend your train and provide several different types of buffs. These little guys are amazing to have and you can have around 10 or more of them. These are amazing companions and an amazing concept/idea.\n\u26abThe gunsmith system is really cool. Being able to build my own guns in a way that I like is a fantastic idea but its VERY limited and lacking at times.\n\u26abYou get to build your own train. Imagine Raft (the game) but its a train.\n\n[h1][b] My Honest Opinion/Personal Opinion [/b][/h1] \nI usually do not right this section in my reviews but I feel a need to share my thoughts about voidtrain before I give my verdict about it.\n\nIf you are looking for the/your NEXT \"Open World Survival Craft\" game... Voidtrain is really not that. It had so much potential. It had such an amazing concept. They did not pull it off. If they made the guns a bit better, the gun tinkering/building more intuitive, the sharks less TANKY, OUR bullets deal a little more damage, the enemies not have so much armour, more ACTUAL OPEN WORLD to explore, make the train not ALWAYS GO STRAIGHT.... ugh... HypeTrain Digital... you really messed up your own concept, and it was an amazing concept but poorly executed.\n\nI am speaking from my heart here - I am not trying to discourage anyone from buying Voidtrain but as a stupidly massive fan of Open World Survival Craft games... Voidtrain was nothing but a boring mess that showed a lack of passion, soul, creativity and love. They even had a year to develop and work on the game on Epic before it came to steam but it did not improve that much to be honest until... wait for it... IT CAME TO STEAM.

Sad that the story isn't even close to completion yet. (1/3 done according to their roadmap) As the farther I got the more intriguing it became to me.\r\n\r\nNow, to counter some of the \"don't recommend\" people's points:\r\n\r\n-The shark IS killable. \r\nYes the way it current is is bad design. But if you just stop the train right after leaving a station, kill the shark, and then start moving again, it won't return until after you leave the next station.\r\n-Looting gets better.\r\nIn the beginning you have to loot by hand, and the grappling hook really doesn't offer a lot apart from easy grabbing of stuff when you've too lazy to \"swim\" around. But you can now unlock lootcatchers fairly soon, which do the material grabbing for you. By the time I had 4 of them I just stopped my train in loot heavy areas, went to do some crafting, and then took everything from the lootcatchers. Easy. Now I have 9, and I don't stop the train for looting anymore. The lootcatchers grab enough already.\r\n-You get a better chest.\r\nYes the first chest has 4 slots, which sucks ass. But the second one has 6. And so far there have been 3 slot expansion upgrades, making that 9. And really, you don't need more. There's no need to hoard loot like crazy. A dozen or so chests and you can store everything you need.\r\n-There's multiple automation upgrades.\r\nLooting, farming, repairing, giving water to the lootcatchers, cleaning, it can all be automated with Rofleemos. (yes that's their real name...) You can also link crafting stations to chests with them so you can craft from chest directly.\r\n-Combat is only annoying/unfair in the beginning.\r\nOnce you unlock 1~2 weapons, especially one that uses hunter bullets, it becomes a spray fest. I just run around with hunter bullets, 2x armor plates on me, spraying in the general direction of enemies, and they die.\r\n\r\nNow some actual cons from me as of writing this review:\r\n-Lootcatchers make an annoying LOUD sound every 10 sec or so when they're full. Having 5 of them within audible range constantly make that noise is driving me insane.\r\n-Puzzles are...pointless. You can find the rewards they give anywhere else or craft them youself much more easily. They're cool for the little puzzle, but the reward is just bad.\r\n-Mines are more annoying than the shark. It's fine when you're going slow and can shoot them from far away. But when you want to go fast to get to the next station because you're already topped up on materials anyway, they piss me off. I have to slow down/stop the train, take all 20~30 or so of them out, and then continue again.\r\n-Before getting better weapons combat SUCKS. It feels like you are always missing due to bullet travel time and enemy erratic movement. Meanwhile enemies feel like they all have sniper aim.\r\n-The game isn't close to finished yet. Only 1/3 of the story is done, apparently. And apart from train upgrades and the story, there really is no incentive to continue playing.

The game fails to provide a clear sense of direction or purpose, leaving players feeling adrift in the void without a compelling reason to continue their journey. Without meaningful milestones or objectives to strive for, the experience quickly loses its appeal and becomes repetitive.\n\nIn conclusion, while Void Train boasts an intriguing premise and visually striking world, its myriad technical issues and lackluster progression system ultimately undermine its potential. Until these issues are addressed through updates and improvements, it's difficult to recommend Void Train to players seeking a polished and engaging gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1708225431, "timestamp_updated": 1708225431, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567262709140777588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161316933": {"recommendationid": "161316933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053064524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1001, "last_played": 1711249762}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the game.

It's starting strong, because you're interested in the mysterious story, but the thing is, everything what happens in the story at the current state of the game is told in like 2-3 sentences - in between it's just a painful grind through procedural generated areas that mostly don't change. There are events that can happen, or poi you can encounter, but none of them are really fun after the second or third time you encountered them, because they're always the same and there's not much to do.\n\nThe main problem in my opinion is the fact, that there is a logical problem regarding the speed you're traveling. Your goal is to upgrade your train (so the story progresses), a bigger engine has the ability to drive faster (but doesnt have to), but since you have to grab as much ressources as possible in the areas between the Depots you mostly drive at the lowest speed - so why even upgrade the engine in the first place (yes, you also can haul more trailers, but you know what i mean)... 80% of the time i was just standing in the front of my train and shot at resources with the grappling hook, or shot at mines / jellyfish you come by.

Let\u00b4s start with the positives. First of all the Idea is really good. Driving your own completely customizable Train through this world and it\u00b4s different voids while following an actually interesting story gathering hints on the way is right up my alley. \nThe game world looks absolutely gorgeous, the soundtrack is used as an indicator for random events and most tracks are really nice and sound great and the game itself runs really well, I never experienced any lacks or bugs. The humanoid enemies are boring to look at but they are at least good shots and their aim is good which makes for at least a small challange if you are not concentrated.\n\nThe negatives and reasons why I don\u00b4t recommend buying the early access product are sadly quite big.\nFirst of all the risk of losing your save file and with it literally hours of you life time is high. \nNext and that is the biggest problem in my eyes is a serious lack of variety in literally everything. \nThere are only two types of humanoid enemies and their designs are frankly boring. \nMonster enemies and other random events are even worse. \nLet\u00b4s start with the so called shark. That thing is literally just a plain nuisance. At the start of every new void a shark like enemy spawns and the first thing you have to do is stop your train and kill it because if you don\u00b4t it will endlessly harass you. Problem is it has a ton of hp and is most of the time far away plus it can actually heal itself if you stop shooting at it. With how the weapons work it\u00b4s either really easy to just kill the guy or it is a ten minutes fight thats more off an annoyance than anything else. I really don\u00b4t know why that thing isn\u00b4t spawning randomly for at least some suspense having it always start at every voids beginning is just plain stupid. \nThe other two enemies are not even worth mentioning because they are so rare weak and useless that if you encounter at least one per void you are already lucky but they are dispatchen with one or two shoots of the revolver.\nThe Arena (a random event normally at least once per void) is Incredibly boring. 3 different enemy types and one a bit bigger thing that you could call a boss if it wasn\u00b4t spupidly weak. You fight through up to 5 waves that are always exactly the same with the only difference being enemies having slightly more health and attack. And there is only one arena map.\nThe Witch house event is a funny idea but not worth the time you spend on it and the random crashed train wrecks look really cool but are in the end just loot boxes with always the exact same content or at least I never found anything special. \nThere is also a rare event with an actually moving train driven by raiders but that too is boring and useless. You can\u00b4t stop the other train you can\u00b4t hijack it and there is no real reward for killing the raiders again wasted potential.\nNext is the stations in between the voids. They are just way to similar. like close to 90% exactly the same similar. To the right you have an arena to fight some raiders and to the left either somthing story relevant and/or some loot.\nAnd the Dlc is an insult it\u00b4s literally just some skins for over 10 bucks really greedy for somthing thats 100% cosmetically.\n\nAll of that is in the end a very very big lack of variety like everything is still in alpha mode and no idea is even remotely finished. \nWith the fish theme going one there is literally an endless treasuretrophe of possible enemies there to pick from. Why are there no big field Bosses? A Megallodon, a giant kraken, a giant anglerfish, a Manta ray, a Whale etc the enemy possibilities are endless. \n\nLike I said. After playing the game for about 30 hours I am pretty sure I have seen everything and I belive that the potential of this game is great, like really great. But the early access version isn\u00b4t worth the time and money. And sadly I\u00b4m afraid it will take a few more years for this to actually reach a buyable state because saying that there is a lot to do is a gigantic understatement.", "timestamp_created": 1710483872, "timestamp_updated": 1710483872, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159870664": {"recommendationid": "159870664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098532062", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1709592611}, "language": "english", "review": "really really boring and i play project zomboid", "timestamp_created": 1709592686, "timestamp_updated": 1709592686, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "158474022": {"recommendationid": "158474022", "author": {"steamid": "76561199149102127", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1683761311}, "language": "english", "review": "empty game. shallow mechanics and world. not worth the money", "timestamp_created": 1708116582, "timestamp_updated": 1708116582, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54437488317489624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159733670": {"recommendationid": "159733670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308448513", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1709430607}, "language": "english", "review": "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE FIX THE REPAIR TARGETING AND LOWER THE RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF GRINDING THERE IS", "timestamp_created": 1709430836, "timestamp_updated": 1709430836, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543726265430450439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162845317": {"recommendationid": "162845317", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964795302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1567, "last_played": 1704526460}, "language": "english", "review": "Just felt like a grind building up to ... nothing.

The game is basically a raft clone, it has similar mechanics, Shooting/throwing a hook to gather resources on a moving platform, base building on that platform and an annoying shark that routinely comes by to damage your platform. If you've played raft you know what I mean. Not a problem that it has this design just raft does it better. It has a very annoying narrator who talks when the 'story' is happening, I muted him pretty quickly. These are just the mediocre parts of the game. Where it gets bad is the combat, It's really bad, I'm not going to go in-depth about why, all I'll say is that whenever you swap guns your character is forced to not sprint for like a full 2 seconds and trust me when you're trying to run away from something this gets really annoying very quickly. In addition to that, this game runs like shit. It crashed on me a few times, and it just ran poorly no matter what I did. What perplexes me more is that it runs better on my laptop which is a lower spec than my PC. In fairness, this could be a computer issue, not the game, but this is the only game that I've played on both that presents this issue. There are plenty of other things to complain about but I'm going to leave it there. When I buy a game and value if it was a worthy purchase I'll compare the price to the hours played. So for example, if I bought a game for 40 and played it for 40 hours I would consider that worth it. So taking that into consideration I would absolutely deem this game not worthy. If this game is on sale for 10 or less and you and some buddies just want something to play because you are all bored then sure try it out.

It feels really cool to ride your little ramshackle choo-choo train yoinking resources out of the ether, it's cool to upgrade your stuff and acquire new crafting capabilities, and most of all the game is gosh darn BEAUTIFUL. seriously, the environmental design is really wonderful and whimsical and cruising through it all on the floating rails is such a pleasant visual.\nMaybe give this a try during your refund period if you're unsure. I think it's worth it.\n\nUpdate: When I got to orange level weapon modules, the gunplay started to feel okay because fire rate and reload speed get a huge step up. Too much work for the guns to feel *just okay* to use.\n=====\n\nI got this because I watched Markiplier play the demo long ago, and it looked pretty fun. Been waiting on my wishlist until release.\nMy 35 hours have been defined by three phases:\n\nPhase I:\nIn the first 10 hours, my impressions were that Voidtrain was a great \"comfy\" survival experience.\nIn general, new content (namely locations, mechanics and major story beats) are paced/spaced out very well.\nAlso, the first 10 hours see rapid tech tree progression because most of the items only require raw materials.\n\nPhase II:\nIn hours 10 to 20, the player will likely become pretty darn powerful, but some of the cracks also start to show. The requirements for progression grew at a reasonable rate, but producing some of the intermediate components was really starting to get tedious. You have to wait a seemingly arbitrary amount of time for each component you craft at a station. You can get some parallelism going if you have, say, multiple smelters or labs, but the time really adds up.\nCombat also starts to show up more and more in this phase. Combat, in particular, needs a lot of work.\n1. It's kind of a nightmare to manage all the weapon modules you receive and understand at a glance which ones provide the best upgrade. They easily fill up your inventory, and then some.\n2. Gunplay feels really loose. Sometimes, inputs don't register for seconds at a time for whatever reason. It might be designed to counteract spam-clicking, which I inadvertently do sometimes. This gets really confusing because there is a mechanic where guns can jam as their condition worsens, so you can't tell if the game is just ignoring your left-clicking or your gun is jammed. Small idiosyncrasies like that really detract from harvesting resources, combat and building alike.\n2.5. Guns jam really easily. I feel like jamming should happen around condition 50%, not 80-95%. But that's just me. All you have to do is press the reload key for your character to fix it.\n3. Enemy AI is either completely ignorant of you or has borderline ESP and can hit you from very far away, and there is no in-between. I usually just engage at max distance and it solves the problem, but for reasons that would constitute spoilers that's not always an option.\n\nPhase III:\nAt this point I have two really powerful primary weapons, easily thwart any threats or obstacles the game throws at me and have a wealth of nearly every resource. Despite all the issues I mention here, the progression does feel really satisfying.\nTwo of the quests in this phase straight up give you no information about what you're looking for. I spent several levels traveling, not knowing what I was looking for, accumulating a bunch of one particular item and having 0 of another item I needed, and the quest tagline simply says \"Find a place to X the Y.\" Maybe these were obvious to some people, but it's worth mentioning.\nIf you want a wealth of resources, specifically, I think combat is one of the most efficient ways to accumulate them. That means a lot of time spent frustrated, feeling like you're trying to fight the game to perform proficient combat and tanking while getting beamed from all angles. Hopefully you've queued up your crafts before you start fighting, so you can at least pass the time fighting instead of staring at the timer on the crafting station.\nI am nowhere near done with the tech tree (as far as I know), but I wonder just how much more of the game there is. I'll update this review if I change my mind about anything by the time I reach the end.\n\nUPDATE: At the time of writing, it turns out I was 5 phases away from completing all the research in the game so far. There are 33 phases.\nNow that the research is complete, my train is fully armored and there seems to be no new content left (again, as far as I can tell), I'm just going for cosmetic unlocks now.\nWhen I got to orange level weapon modules (\"legendary?\"), there was a HUGE step up in fire rate and reload speed. Funny enough, it takes legendary weapon modules for my guns to feel okay to use. There is still an issue with inputs not getting processed for a few seconds every once in a while, usually when spam clicking.", "timestamp_created": 1684938771, "timestamp_updated": 1685237071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 236, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932623088359832764", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138560732": {"recommendationid": "138560732", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993330968", "num_games_owned": 992, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1461, "last_played": 1685390754}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: Crafting Menu Simulator [strike] 2023 [/strike] 2021\n\nThe game is pretty, but nothing in the environment has any motion. It's like walking through an abstract painting. The game has passable gunplay, but enemies remain the exact same and only increase in number, and if their drops aren't clipping through the floor, they're impossible to find because tokens are the only item in the game that don't glow. You have pets that serve as workers, but they only slightly buff [i] your [/i] crafting at best and very slowly get you a pathetic amount of the most basic possible resources, while using up a massive portion of your limited space, at worst. Impressive first-person animations that will wow you in the first ten minutes, but quickly get repetitive when there are no animation cancels and you must watch your character pull out a hammer for 3 seconds, and put it away for 3 seconds. Cute 'secret' reloads that will happen early enough to make no sense as one of your pets puts a mag into your gun for you... when you have no pets, then realize that these secret reloads are three times as long as your normal reload.\n\nThese are small gripes. Easily fixable given time and with more content. The things I just listed add up in annoyance but do not ruin the game.\n\nWhat ruins the game for myself and many others is the crafting. Let me run you through a recent example. Phase 27 of the research table. You must complete every research in one phase to unlock the next. I unlocked phase 27 after researching some food items despite never needing food, but on we go. One of the research items is the tier 3 container, the best in the game! Great! It holds 8 stacks, and a stack is 10 items. A tier 2 container holds 6 stacks. Not much of an upgrade for the increased cost. But bigger number is always better I suppose. The next research item is an upgrade for the diesel engine to make it more efficient. But in order to collect as many resources as possible you have to move at a snail's pace, which doesn't consume any fuel. So this upgrade literally does not do anything for most players, but you have to get it to progress research.\n\nLet's break down the requirements for this diesel engine efficiency: 2 steel ingots, 2 dampers, 2 rubber, 2 steel bolts. If I had all the direct resources to make these items, it would still take roughly 10-30 seconds crafting them at different workstations: the smelter 2, the workbench 2, and the lab 2. You have to have all required items in your inventory and run around your train and wait for them to finish. But you know damn well you DON'T have the direct resources required for this because you just used them all researching and creating the diesel engine itself. So you need to craft 10 iron, 2 sealant, 2 unstable chemicals, and 2 iron bolts, which require the smelter 1, the lab 1, and the workbench 1. That's right, you can't craft everything at the much better, much bigger, tier 2 stations. You must have both, and hopefully you remember which one makes what items, or you'll be doubling up on inventory opening. Congratulations, you've now spent the last 10 minutes running around on your train crafting things while parked, because if you're in menus while moving you aren't getting resources. \n\nThe game is so afraid to automate ANYTHING, remotely activate ANYTHING. No 'take all' or 'deposit all' for chests. No sort function as you somehow end up with 3 stacks of 3 zinc. Rofleemo are in the game to be cute and marketable, not to fuel your furnaces, not to grab heavy objects, not to slowly craft things for you. Rare puzzles of randomized tiers of chests? Scrap metal. Raid outposts? Scrap metal. Fight in an unbalanced alien arena? Scrap metal. I will probably start getting free steel ingots when I've researched a nuclear reactor.\n\nSo, so tedious. Please add collection nets. Magnets. Something. Let workbenches use items that are in chests. Allow players to smelt gun parts into metal, I don't even pick them up anymore. Put large story events much closer together. It should not take me 20 hours to get a train battle that's over in a minute. Why is there a narrator if they only talk once every 2 hours? Why do the tracks never converge or split, why do I never have any choice of where I'm going? Why are there mines that I can defuse for scrap metal, but if one of them explodes and hits my train, it costs iron ingots, making the risk worthless?\n\nSo much lost potential.

It tests my patience, and while they have just released an automation update that addresses some of the tedium, it doesn\u2019t address the root problems which are causing most players to quit long before they reach that point. The current build is closer to a first-person idling game than a survival/crafting game.  \n\nIn Voidtrain, you are on a train speeding through a surrealist dreamscape full of garbage, alien fauna, and nazis. Here\u2019s where it goes wrong: In other crafting/survival games you have a world of opportunities to interact with. Voidtrain can\u2019t support that; it\u2019s literally on rails. \n\nResources randomly spawn in the void and you need to swim over and grab them. It\u2019s extremely tedious because you can only collect one item at a time. There\u2019s not like a pile of wood, there\u2019s just single wood planks. It\u2019s like if Subnautica didn\u2019t have titanium debris, just outcroppings and you had to collect each One. At. A. Time. \n\nAnd because you need SO many resources (fuel and materials for each item you make), your super train moves at a crawl the entire time. Having a train in this format is a conceptually bad idea. There's no point in going fast because any kind of speed means you just miss items.  \n\nThere are 4 major crafting materials from which almost everything else is built through refining. There are also 4 minor crafting materials for a total of 8 raw materials, these aren\u2019t used nearly as often and are primarily for combat and late-game engine upkeep \u2013 moreover they are found floating in the void or from combat. They have addressed this slightly by removing ice from the void so you must synthesize water by building a condenser. However, raw materials are where Voidtrain breaks from the comparison with Raft, which has 10 major crafting materials and 9 minor crafting materials that form the basis of its balance.  \n\nAfter gathering resources, you have building development. It\u2019s awful. Before you can build a crafting station, you need to research it. To do this, you get either half or all the resources to build the structure\u2026 and then those disappear and now you can build it for real. Which means any time you build something, you need to collect the resources to build it twice. \n\nThe big issue here is that, like Raft, this only happens the first time you build something, but in Voidtrain you will only build most items once and the ones you build multiple times you need to make A LOT of (particularly storage and storage racks). You\u2019re not improving on existing designs (like taking an existing item and upgrading it), you\u2019re building a new upgraded version whole cloth. So there is no gratification for researching because it means you have to do all that work again. Likewise, the survival elements are so underdeveloped they can be ignored and the overall resource economy is weaker for it. \n\nHunger only affects your health regeneration, so you don\u2019t **have** to eat. If you don\u2019t need to eat, you don\u2019t need to build that garden and now a whole branch of the tech tree is unnecessary. Plus, there\u2019s no drink meter so drinking water (formerly melting ice) has the same effect as growing and cooking but for a fraction of the price. \n\nLikewise, refining is boring and hostile game design. You craft your metal ingots from scrap then you take those to another crafting station to convert them into a single piece of hardware (bolts, pipes, gears, etc.). It doesn\u2019t work in Voidtrain, but the reason it does work with Subnautica\u2019s wiring kits is because you need different resources \u2013 that\u2019s the challenge. Putting iron ingots into a machine that makes bolts and gears (at a cost of 10 seconds per item) is a waste of time by design. \n\nPut another way, because Voidtrain has a small variety of unlimited resources flying toward you, limited inventory space is the only way they balance against looting everything -- which is why the initial chest only has 4 storage slots. But almost every crafting recipe only uses variations on the 4 main resources, which invalidates the limited inventory space. \n\nTheir workaround to this is turning fungible scrap metal into single-purpose refined parts (created in a 1:1 iron in -> bolts out ratio) that don\u2019t stack so you\u2019re forced to make storage \u2013 and by extension collect more resources. So you\u2019ll make gears and bolts, each of which costs a single iron ingot (plus 10 seconds) and are functionally indistinguishable from iron ingots -- emphasizing that the only reason they do this is to make sure you have enough inventory space and also pad the runtime. It would be like if Subnautica made you craft titanium into \u201ctitanium sheets\u201d for habitats rather than making them directly from raw titanium. It\u2019s an extra step in the process and only serves to waste your time.\n\nBigger objects (like the steam engine) don\u2019t need different resources \u2013 they just need **more** resources, so you pull in dozens of pieces of scrap metal one at a time with the grappling gun, wait several minutes to smelt them, and then wait several more minutes to convert them into parts. It makes Voidtrain feel like a first-person idling game. Put it this way: Just in crafting time, the steam engine takes 14 minutes of waiting for material processing to research and build. \n\nBetween long stretches of void, you\u2019ll visit stations to do some exploring and shoot space nazis. These depots are light on resources; you can\u2019t break down any of the scenery or take decorations. You open specially marked loot boxes and some resources pop out. What should be an opportunity to reward you for making it through the void (especially because these stations are the only place where you can upgrade your train -- again being balanced around limited storage space) instead becomes a clunky combat diversion before starting over in another stretch of void nearly indistinguishable from the last one. \n\nSince space nazis don\u2019t often appear in the void, there are also Space Sharks to randomly attack your train. The problem is the UI is far too clunky for these kinds of encounters, making combat better situated to dedicated battle zones. Fitting with the \u201cVoidtrain hates your time\u201d theme, each tool has its own draw and sheath animation before the actual menu pops up, during which time you\u2019re locked out of anything else \u2013 which is annoying --  and drawing your weapon has its own animation and firing delay. So, if a space shark attacks and you\u2019re building something, you have 3-5 seconds where you can\u2019t do anything to stop it. \n\nAnd that\u2019s Voidtrain\u2019s gameplay loop. Every part of it feels designed to waste your time. Voidtrain\u2019s rail system and crafting system are each artificially slow and the gathering system is fundamentally repetitive and tedious.

Except you're not constantly having to slurp minnows so you don't starve.  You can be a proud gamer again.\n\nRaft is a game about floating down an ocean on a, yes, raft, picking up random trash and using it to fashion a bigger, better, tougher raft.\n\nVoidtrain is a game about gently pootling down a rail line in some Ineffable Weirdspace (TM), picking up random trash and using it to fashion a bigger, better, tougher train.\n\nRaft has sharks that come nibble on your Raft.\n\nVoidtrain has Flying Weirdsharks (TM) that come nibble on your train.\n\nRaft will have you visit random islands to pick up special resources, and much of the fighting is found there.\n\nIn Voidtrain... yeah, all that.  That too.  Except it's rail depots in quizzical stationspace, and instead of birds and boars it's dudes with guns who aren't interested in negotiation.  The combat is more combat-y, though.\n\nI mean, bluntly, it's Raft, with many Raft trappings.  And I, for one, do not mind one bit.  Raft had a pretty good formula for the missus and I.  So let me focus on the differences.\n\n1: Combat in Voidtrain is more involved and more classic FPS-y.  The enemies aren't super-brilliant and you can get a lot of mileage with just hunkering down and corner-peeking.\n\n2: The graphics are much sharper.  It's not a bright, cartoony world.\n\n3: The gamespace is really weird.  I don't know why there's giant bones, weird rocky islandlets or 50+ meter long arrows all just floating out of reach.  But there are.  Maybe this is explained later, but for now the best I can do is \"This is Ineffable Weirdspace (TM)\".\n\n4: R&D is more of an elaborate process in Voidtrain.  Raw materials need to be processed into various components, and easily more than half of my smelting has gone towards satisfying research requirements.  As the missus has enjoyed harvesting all the bric-a-brac she sees, it's made it possible for me to focus on all this.  I imagine this would be tedious solo.\n\n5: Food isn't the constant chore it is in Raft, my only real sticking point with that game.  Your character will want to eat, but will live just fine without.  The value of eating is only in increased health regeneration outside of combat, and literally nothing more.\n\n6: Base-building isn't as elaborate as Raft, as the first significant negative.  I don't mind, but I would have liked to build a cozy shack on my railcar.  Maybe a proper Pullman-kinda carriage, you know?  Maybe that's still possible as there are (ostensibly) furniture pieces.\n\nI actually quite enjoy being presented with a mystery of some sort, virtually any mystery, and being able to unravel it over the course of my gameplay.  Be it a computer game or some tabletop RPG action, this presses my buttons.  So what's with the world of Voidtrain?  I don't know, but I genuinely hope there's a reason and it wasn't just \"dump random weird shit out there.\"  And I look forward to finding that reason.\n\nSo to sum up, if you thought the gameplay loop of Raft was satisfying, here's something much the same.

There is a fundamental design choice though that makes me like Raft and not like Voidtrain as it is now and as much as i hope that it\u00b4ll change, i\u00b4m not 100% sure that it will.\nThe difference is collection nets. Raft has collection nets.\nIt scratches this itch of wanting to improve and reduce the tedium of the game.\nMany survival games have the same design philosophy.\nThat being said, i think i know why Voidtrain doesnt have \"collection nets\" and most likely they\u00b4re not going to add them at least before adding more content.\nIf you remove the manual resource grind, the nonsensical decisions with having to have multiple tiers of crafting tables eating away at fuel, the researching that needs most of the materials for the actual thing, there is nothing left to actually do in the game.\nI think the trains moving speed itself is a good illustration.\nIn Raft, you want to go faster to get to your destination quicker and you also get more junk in your nets faster. The game pushes you do go faster with game design, not tooltips.\nIn Voidtrain everything tells you in writing that you want to go faster. But the design punishes you for doing so. I think its funny how in the beginning there is this cute minigame when you just have the handcrank that makes you go faster. After pumping it a couple times, i understood right away that i actually dont want to go faster because i\u00b4ll be missing the resources. Been snailing away ever since.\nSo a recommendation for the devs. Add the \"collection nets\".

I've bought this game twice now, spent about 100 hours in it between Steam and Epic, and yet I still don't know whether or not I recommend other people buy it. \n\nVoidtrain is an enjoyable game to be sure, but it has been designed in such a way that the gameplay has a hard end to it. You have 33 phases to your research table, and once you've finished those, there's basically no reason to keep gathering stuff and therefore not much reason to keep playing the game. Your train caps out at 12 wagon platforms (not including the 4 that make up your locomotive) so there is very much a state of \"final evolution\" that the train cannot grow past, and that means there is no real creative endgame as once you have achieved the optimal layout for your 12 wagon platforms, there is little if any incentive to invest the effort of tearing down your train one platform at a time to redesign it or rearrange the order of your cars. You get about 20-30 hours of thoroughly enjoyable gameplay (plus however much time you spend decorating your train at depots), then you are coasting through the void on a train that can't grow any bigger, ignoring most of the resources you are passing by, doing combat arenas and occasionally stopping to follow fireflies out into the void, all for resources you don't even need anymore.\n\nAnd none of this bothered me when I played the game two years ago on Epic, but this is also functionally the same game I played two years ago. Two years ago we had 33 research table phases, 12 wagon platforms, two locomotive engines, and our side content in the void consisted of the firefly puzzles, abandoned trains, guarded outposts, combat arenas, and train to train combat. The only things they have added in two years of dev time have been the story about the scientist, and the Rofleemo based automation and the associated stations. So the gatherer's station, the cleaner's station, the trainkeeper's station, etc. Turrets are new. The rams are actually new since the last time I played. There have been some QOL changes, like the fact that enemies no longer spawn on the platform that you arrive at when going to a depot. Now they have their own little designated combat area. That's all nice.\n\nBut it doesn't even come close to providing an actual endgame. And I understand that the game has unique limitations being, quite literally, on rails. But I feel that survival games like Raft show us that we can have niche settings to where and how we are building but still have accessible and even wacky options for endgame. There's ultimately no real reason why our train can't be so long that the engine reaches the end of a void sequence before the final car has actually left the previous depot, but it is nonetheless a thing that cannot be done, and I feel like the game suffers greatly for it. As charming as the rofleemos and the narrator and the scientist story all are, I would trade all of it in a heartbeat for a removal of the building cap on train wagon platforms.\n\nI always hate saying negative things about smaller studios because it just feels like kicking down, and I want this game to be everything it has the potential to be, but it kind of feels after two years like the devs are more concerned with things like narrative and presentation and even production value over things like content and endgame. Feels a bit like putting the cart before the horse.\n\nI would start with the demo. If you enjoy it, buy the game with the knowledge that you're getting about 20-30 hours of content (plus decoration time, which if you're like me can literally double or even triple your playtime), but understand that your train will hit a metaphorical end to its journey even if there is no physical one. And do not harbor *any* expectations for the game to grow or evolve beyond what it is any time soon, if ever, because as of January 2024, the game still has basically all of the same core content that it had when it launched on Epic back in August of 2021. The game was also originally projected to achieve full release status back in 2022, if that gives any indication to Nearga's ability to deliver on promises made in a roadmap.", "timestamp_created": 1705776529, "timestamp_updated": 1705776569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.868685901165008545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138123274": {"recommendationid": "138123274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278424158", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 679, "last_played": 1684548465}, "language": "english", "review": "Just trying to combat the negative reviews and stuff i've seen... i've even seen others with 2x my playtime saying things that counteract this that are just factually wrong so ill cover the things people have said that aren't opinion based. \n\n----DO BE AWARE SPOILERS BELOW----\n\n1. Yes you do get to leave the train and explore at some points to kill enemies at outposts and stations and even go explore the void and see the islands.\n2, You do get to upgrade your train to go faster through various engines\n3. You do get gun upgrades and different gun types\n4. You do get grappling hook upgrades eventually\n5. There are bonuses you can get to make you produce more resources when you do as well as the fact yes you do collect them all by hand HOWEVER there are resources given after every gate as well as at each checkpoint and later on you can find cashes out in the void that also reward STACKS OF 10+ of multiple resources(from what i've seen so far) BUT things aren't really expensive and the resoruce numbers you need for something is quite low overall (some of the things i craft at this point that id say are expensive require 10 scrap metal total and to gather that yourself 1 at a time isn't that bad)\n\nThere are plenty of other complaints that i've seen that are just false as well that i can't recall.

Id like to see more action in it sure but that being said. I'M AT GATE 11... some of the gameplay in trailers shows gate 100+... there are many enemy types i see pics of and enemy trains that can show up and so many things that i've not yet seen even at 12hrs. DON'T let these negitive reviews discourage you from buying the game. It's a survival game. it gives you plenty of time to grind up even if you're speeding through because otherwise there's no going back so if the game doesn't progress slow and you ran through it all and skipped things you'd end up stuck. just keep that in mind when things are slow and you'll love the game. there are many RPG elements to the game as well that i wasn't expecting like gun attachments that add 300% projectiles or even poison damage as i just found out minutes before writing this.

Start with the most basic train.\n2. Travel and gather resources at the slowest speed.\n3. Hit up the depot, get into a fight, collect resources and upgrade train.\n4. Exit depot, research until you unlock the grappling hook after a couple of depots.\n5. Exit another depot, travel once again, gather resources slightly faster with the grappling hook but you'll occasionally back the train up to get that missing piece of scrap metal.\n6. Hit up the depot, upgrade train into a machine worthy of the rails.\n7. Exit depot, STILL go slow to gather resources, even with the aid of an AI companion station that slowly acquires resources [i]randomly[/i].\n\nSo the issue that became apparent to me was \"hey, I've got all this fuel, upgraded train, and I feel like I'm losing out on any resources out there if I go at a decently fast speed.\"\nSo I continue to slowly gather things, and sometimes you've got enough of a specific resource but there's things you ALWAYS need to keep grabbing, like wood and metal.\n\nI don't mind going slow at times. But it's going slow ALL the time is what threw me off. Yeah, I could blaze by, but like I mentioned earlier, I miss all the stuff I can't collect fast enough.\nRAFT gives you the option of building the net floors that collect stuff for you-you can't get EVERYTHING but you can get enough to keep you going. That's the difference here, I CAN get everything.\nSo, the crux of the issue is a lack of effecient resource collection that leaves room open for other mechanics or features to shine/show themselves later on when your train is fully upgraded.\nNow, the devs in the reply below did say that they are working towards an effecient resource collection system, so that's an issue that will be solved in the future.\n\nNow the second part that was itching me was the combat-At first I didn't mind it-but as time went on with each depot, I started to notice it felt shallow.\nYeah, you have tons of different weapon parts from the receivers to the stocks, and you can make a lot of cool-looking weapons from hard hitting semi-auto rifles, to full-auto shotguns, to even modules that let you have secondary fire abilities like grenades and flamethrowers.\nBut the AI enemies just leave so little to be desired, because you can walk in with 5 stacks of armor plates and mag dump everyone with the 200 rounds you stockpiled earlier.\nAgain, the devs did confirm in the reply below that combat at depots and in general will be changed, so that's another issue that's going to be solved in the future.\n\nBack to the loop again, it does get broken up occasionally by the arena, puzzles, \"ruins\", and the train-vs-train fight. They are not located at a depot, but rather on your journey to the next depot.\nWitch's house is your basic set of puzzles or puzzle, forcing you to leave your train explore, solve, and return with your plunder.\nArena is what it says it is-fight wave after wave of creatures as long as you have ammo, armor, and weapon durability.\n\"Ruins\" is the occasional floating, derailed train car you reach out to explore and loot-and I cannot stress this enough, this enhances exploration and satisfies curiosity so much. I know the game is literally \"on rails\", but spending 30 minutes to an hour exploring a massive set of ruins or blown out depot floating in the void every 4 depot stops would break the monotony a bit and give a reason to actually go fast.\nTrain-VS-Train is something I have yet to encounter as I haven't played that deep into it.\n\nNow, finishing this off, what I'm trying to say-At this moment, I can't reccomend it at full price, but if there's sale, go for it. Even then, know what you're getting into is a bit of a \"slow paced\" kind of game.\nAlternatively, wait for the next series of updates to fix the aforementioned issues, then jump in.\nI put some hours down into the game because I genuinely did like it, but was frustrated with the core loop.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Review\n[strike]I can't do this anymore.[/strike]\n[strike]The game has gotten a lot better in regards to everything else such as QoL, research table features, etc.[/strike]\n[strike]The core gameplay loop just sucks. Let me explain-[/strike]\n[strike]It's got RAFT vibes, but the key missing feature is the lack of any efficient resource collection.[/strike]\n[strike]There is one means of resource collection, but it's more random in the sense that an AI collects stuff for you instead of a net attached to the train.[/strike]\n[strike]So this means you're either slowly moving the train from one depot to the next, all on a single rail with no switches, no MAJOR twists or turns(it's more like a smooth arc with any turning) all the while manually grabbing as much resources as possible to complete the next research tier or replenishing supplies.[/strike]\n\n[strike]I'm not even done with the game yet. I'm tired of it. I just want to go FAST on the train, occasionally slowing down to clear a minefield, a cloud of local fauna, etc.[/strike]\n\n[strike]I didn't mind it at first, but man.[/strike]\n\n[strike]And the combat? Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle. Thousands of pregenerated gun parts with a rarity system, and most of it's negated by the fact that you can walk around with 5 stacks of armor plates and health and act like spongebob squarepants.

You are tethered to the train and can only venture out so far.  While riding the train, you may also encounter various Void creatures.  Some of them are harmless and provide a source of food.  Others will attack you or the train.  You can fight back using weapons you acquire during your travels.  You can also build various crafting stations on the train that allow you to craft items and resources, research new technology, and fortify the train.\n\nEvery so often, the train stops at a station where you can find resources, fight enemies, upgrade your train, and find clues about the world and story.\n\nGameplay so far has been driven by on-screen prompts to research and build the next level of technology and narrated events.  It's all very linear with little opportunity to make any decisions about how to progress.\n\nThe Train Stations have offered little variety so far.  I've encountered a handful so far and the layouts are mostly the same with a few minor variations.  There is a definite feeling of deja vu at each stop.\n\nI know the game offers more than I've seen so far, but it's not interesting enough for me to want to continue - at least for now.\n\nOverall the game just feels very basic and lacks excitement.  There needs to be a better sense of freedom and exploration.  I'm not sure how the developers could add that since the game is literally and figuratively \"on rails\".\n\nMy advice to the developers would be to add more variety to the outposts and add more things to do while travelling on the train.  Perhaps there is already more to it than I've seen, but  if there is it needs to be introduced earlier to maintain the player's interest.  I'd also shift the focus from simply telling players what to do next to letting them discover it on their own.  I read that there were plans to optionally disable the narrator and I think I'd also like to see the option to disable the \"quests\" that prompt you to build the next level of tech.  I'd like to feel like I have some level of control on how to progress rather than feeling like the game is just a series of checking off boxes.\n\nI think the game is priced far too high.  I've gotten far more enjoyment and play time out of less expensive games like Valheim or 7 Days to Die.\n\nLastly, I've seen some criticism of other negative reviews.  A lot of people seem to believe that you shouldn't criticize an \"Early Access\" game.  However my review speaks to my feelings about the current state of the game and whether I'd recommend it right now.  I do plan on revisiting it again if there are more content updates but for now I'm moving on to other games.  I think it's a good concept but it needs to be fleshed out a bit more before it's worthy of my time.", "timestamp_created": 1683999521, "timestamp_updated": 1683999521, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 150, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857110559940338135", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146065373": {"recommendationid": "146065373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258603771", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1976, "last_played": 1696001137}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite the seemingly mixed and negative reviews, I cannot recommend this game enough. Voidtrain perfectly encapsulates the \"slow paced\" gameplay loop and continuously rewards players for min-maxing their weaponry and over-stockpiling resources. The gameplay loop feels extremely satisfying to progress through and I could only wish the game had more content at my time of playing. Despite my love for the gameplay loop and progression, [strike]the user experience and mechanics are very unfriendly[/strike] and I hope the devs understand the constructive criticism I've seen in the reviews and discussion pages.\n\n[strike]The biggest flaw with the user experience would be the UI. The UI requires multiple clicks and short animations to menu through the crafting tables. I commend the devs and art team for sticking to a very nice style of UI and graphics, but the art-style interferes too painfully with the user experience. The most flawed menu in the game, in my opinion, is the smelter. The button to change fuel is extremely anti-user-friendly and discourages adding more fuel while the smelter is in the process of crafting. When a smelter is crafting an item and you choose to change the fuel - there's no option to add more fuel - the crafting stops and any fuel not yet burned gets deleted. This also occurs in the laboratory and I really hope the devs spend time working on a complete overhaul of all the UI elements.[/strike] [b] This has been fixed in the latest patch, I commend the devs for understanding the feedback from the community and I look forward to more and more updates in the future :) [/b]\n\n[strike]Despite the extremely flawed UI[/strike], my only other complaint a the current moment would be the inconsistent frame-rate issues.

Because this game has SO MUCH POTENTIAL!\n\nFirst off, I like the concept of riding the train through the void. You fly around with a tether, gather supplies, and make your own train. Great stuff! At first its honestly pretty fun! \n\nIts quite combat rich! There will be plenty of spots to go and get involved in a firefight! They have the depots, checkpoints, and even an arena! It really helps break up the monotony of just crafting!\n\nPuzzles! If you are more of a thinker, there is something for you here as well! This game has variety and I love it!\n\nThese are all great things and I'm sure will be crafted into a beautiful game! It is still early access after all, so I'm excited to see what they add! However, there are quite a few road bumps that make me give it a negative review FOR NOW. I'll be coming back to review the game as it progresses and will change my review accordingly! But here are the problems thus far....\n\nNo storage pull for crafting: You have a pretty small inventory that you can carry with you. So naturally you want to put things in storage to clear it up. As you progress further through the technology tree, you get more and more items which need more and more storage. When you go to a crafting bench, you need to manually pull out the ingredients, run them to a machine, let the machine craft, pick it up, then run it to the bench. So a lot of time is spent just running box to box yanking out what you need. It can really slow down the pace of the game.\n\nMine Fields: Speaking of pacing, you get the train at some point. And it goes at a decent clip. You'll never use that speed though because you keep running into mine fields so you have to bring your train to a crawl so you can shoot through the mine field which is surprisingly long. Its not like a small patch, its a full stretch of about 3-5 minutes. And if it isn't the mine fields, there are road blocks that you technically CAN plow through, but it will damage your train. And the repairing works like crafting. You need to get whatever necessary material from a box then run back to the damaged piece and repair it. No auto pull.\n\nLimited/confusing weapon modifications: There is great groundwork here for making your own weapons. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of variation. Sometimes you'll come across a part that might give you a tiny bit more damage but lose a bunch of accuracy, but give you more stability, but reduce range. I really don't mod my gun that much honestly. Its a hassle. And the gun parts take up valuable inventory space. And it doesn't really tell you certain things. I changed out a muzzle for my rifle and it turned into a shotgun. I didn't realize till I fired. Doesn't give much indication.\n\nUnrewarding rewards: So they have puzzles which I think is great. You finish the puzzle, you get a treasure chest. When you open it, you just get stuff that is easily available all around you. Wood, metal, food, chemicals, all things that are actively and abundantly floating around you in the void already. There isn't much that comes in these crates that you can't get by just casually reaching off the train and grabbing. It would be much nicer if it spit out things like rare weapon parts or more advanced resources like metal bars, coal briquettes, or steel. Base resources aren't much of a reward. \n\nI haven't completed the game but I'm going to wait for now just because I'm not having fun. I'll give it a few updates and try again.\n\nPS: Fuel burns off way too fast. I feel like 80% of my time is spent trying to get fuel to make some bars. More efficient fuel earlier in the game would be nice.", "timestamp_created": 1685472008, "timestamp_updated": 1685472008, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836925029754638672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138202775": {"recommendationid": "138202775", "author": {"steamid": "76561199432969247", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1683846524}, "language": "english", "review": "I\u00b4m sad to say, but I can\u00b4t recommend the game to anyone really.\n\nThe pacing is atrocious, the first half of the game you're forced to rapid fire every blueprint the game throws at you just to progress the non-existent storyline. \nIn between you are left with nothing to do, until the game decides to have the next unsatisfying piece of story that results in basically nothing, and off to the same old gameplay loop you are: gather resources, combine them to better resources, unlock blueprints for crafting stations to make even more resources for more blueprints.\nThe crafting menu is one of the worst parts about all that.\n\nNo upgrade tier feels remotely rewarding, no new equipment that makes you feel like you achieved something.\nYou can't explore at all, there are a few times you can get away from the tracks to have a little puzzle, but there isn't the magic of finding something interesting or out of this world, it's just a loot box you can cash in at the next station.\n\nAnd the most cardinal sin for the survival/building genre: Basically no decorations\nThe few that are in the game are locked behind random-drop mushrooms you get from some of the worst shooting segments i've witnessed in a game that makes a point to promote gunplay as a core part of the gameplay. \nThe shooting just feels off, you get no tooltips for the weapon parts that enemies drop, meaning you have to clutter your inventory with everything you find, just to see that it\u00b4s useless garbage that you immediately drop again.\n\nIt's a shame, my boyfriend and I were really looking forward to playing the game together, only to find out a few hours in that there is almost nothing besides a really cool concept.\nI wished I liked the game more than i did, i didn't expect a finished product by any means, but I'm disappointed we spend 60\u20ac for this rather sobering experience. \n\nI hope that I can recommend this game at some point in the future, but for right now i can't.\nI will definitely keep up with upcoming updates.", "timestamp_created": 1683923692, "timestamp_updated": 1683923692, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 188, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836783766746520996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147951586": {"recommendationid": "147951586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153145805", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 1780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1435, "last_played": 1710121027}, "language": "english", "review": "So, yes... massive, massive, massive \"recommend.\" This is quickly becoming one of those games I come back to again and again, and I feel like I've barely cracked the surface, as it is. I'm not even all the way up the tech tree, I don't have all the cool train stuff... but I just keep coming back to Voidtrain.\n\nNow, I see some others have called it out in their reviews, and it would be irresponsible for me not to say it as well.. This game REALLY isn't what it's trying to sell itself as with its preview videos. When I watch the previews, the image I get in my head is a combat-heavy, first-person-shooter, \"wave after wave\" / intense survival type game. Like, you're just running all around your train blowing away bad guys while desperately trying to craft a few things so you can have bigger guns to blow away more bad guys. At least, that's what it seems to bill itself as to me. For the folks who are thinking about buying this with that in mind, I'd take a look at the rest of this review before buying. This is NOT to say it's a bad game - it CERTAINLY isn't - but I feel like it's trying to make itself look like a mad scramble for survival while blowing through the void at break-neck speeds.\n\nWhat it really is, is... slow. I've seen some reviews comparing it to Raft, which I haven't played, so I can't comment.. but I hear that game is also fairly slow paced. In Voidtrain, you start out on a bare bones train.. a single platform with one of those \"pull it up/push it down\" engines like you see on the old black & white films. You go down the track, stopping along the way to jump off your train and \"swim\" around in the void gathering resources. You craft.. you research.. you build... and then you go down the track some more.\n\nThe combat, as it is, seems to be almost an afterthought... almost like the developers were thinking, \"we need to spice this up a bit.\" Again, I am NOT disparaging this game.. but I don't exactly feel like I'm playing Halo here. It can be fun and exciting... But it just feels a little weird. The AI's have no idea what they're doing - they don't know whether they want to gang up on you, take off in a mad retreat, storm you head on, hide behind a rock for protection... or, having achieved that protection, jumping right back out to crack off a few more shots. I find that I'm not very good at the combat elements of this game, because sometimes I feel like the natural reaction for a character would be to do this thing, and then they surprise me and do the opposite.\n\nIt's all right, though. It doesn't detract from the gameplay. If the combat IS meant to be a \"spice it up\" bid, it works - it's a bit of an occasional distraction that does add a little salt to the meat & potatoes.\n\nWhat this game does amazingly is keeping you in the grind. You're always thinking that that next upgrade is right around the corner, or that you can't wait to build this or that thing, or whatever else is going on. I always find myself gathering as much as I can, because there's always something new to go for..\n\n..Speaking of which, I've also seen several reviews which are a little down on the inventory system. Yeah, the inventories are a little small, haha. Of course, you can always craft to increase your own inv, or build chests and the like.. But in a world where you build a Minecraft chest and store thirteen billion cobblestone, the inventory in this game feels very limited! It still does not \"break\" it for me, because I'm just incentivized to build more chests.. but at a certain point, you realize you've got an entire side of your train filled with them, and you're like, \"huh.\" LOL\n\nI feel like this game is GREAT for the market of \"boring game players\" - and some of you will know what I mean - those games that would seem to bore some to tears, such as Farming Simulator 22, American Truck Simulator, stuff like that - where the actual gameplay can be somewhat repetitive and a bit of a \"mining\" grind (you know.. mine, so you can make money, so you can get better equipment, so you can mine even MORE, so you can make even MORE money, and so on). But for people who like that kind of thing, this one is going to tickle you pink.\n\nIt doesn't have quite the same freedom as, say, Space Engineers.. while the game claims an \"open world,\" it's hard to feel that it's truly open. Your building/crafting space is limited to the current state of your train, and your train more or less heads in one direction - forward. (You can back up a little, but there's a guard that prevents you from serious back-tracking.) This  doesn't bother me, but it also doesn't really comport with \"open world.\"\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. I LOVE them. The only sound effects I have issue with are the grappling hook, which makes a kind of a \"squish\" sound NO MATTER WHAT YOU GRAPPLE... otherwise, the sounds & ambiance are perfect. The world is lovingly detailed and it shows. I LOVE... being in the \"void.\"\n\nI'm not through the story yet. It's not terribly engaging. I don't mind - I'm here for the void and my train, and I don't need the story.\n\nSo it sounds like I've done a ton of complaining... but I genuinely love this game - just trying to be fair in the review. I feel like some people would hate this game.. I feel like some people would grow bored with it.. But this is one of those ones where if you're in the right niche, this is going to become a FAST favorite for you. It had me hooked VERY fast.\n\nAh, the standard \"should I pay full price\" question? I would. Oh, for sure. If you were looking for a fast-paced FPS, then maybe no... or if you're into fast action games or don't like grinds, then probably no (although again, the grind isn't so steep as to be annoying). If you find yourself loving games of patience and building and working for ever bigger and better, though.. yeah, you'd pay full price for it. Trust me.\n\nOverall, VERY, VERY solid game, and \"23.9 hours\" is just a START for me, I can easily tell.", "timestamp_created": 1696896982, "timestamp_updated": 1696896982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819244027137756348", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "154010572": {"recommendationid": "154010572", "author": {"steamid": "76561199124800109", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 876, "last_played": 1702768199}, "language": "english", "review": "This game concept appears to have considerable potential, yet the content seems either limited or stretched thin across overly lengthy, repetitive gameplay.

A significant issue arose when I built an engine requiring extensive material collection across numerous stations.

From a game designer's perspective, challenging the player is fine, but it's crucial to provide them with tools commensurate to the challenge. For instance, if a game mechanic penalizes player creativity by halving resources from dismantling items (a questionable design choice), there should at least be an efficient early-game method for automating this unenjoyable task.

Hitboxes are janky, enemy AI is a little clumsy, and movement feels sluggish and you get locked in animations often (as a minor note, your gun randomly jamming has never been fun in any game ever, but that's more of a personal take). Loot is also an annoyance; you have an incredibly limited inventory (as you do in these games), and you have to haul individual weapon parts back to your train to see which ones are any good for your modular gun. It would be nice if this information could be reflected on the item itself without needing to go hit up a bench.\n\nSo that world design... wow. The Void is spectacular to look at. It has an eerie beauty to it. The oppressive fog surrounding the tracks mask the silhouettes of vast structures and enormous creatures out there in the mists. Ominous whale-like calls sound in the distance, making your hair stand on end as you wonder just what lies out there in the gloom.

There's a heck of a lot to micromanage on your train, and you'll have your hands full doing it on your own. It's absolutely possible, but it'll take a long time to get anywhere as you rush from smelter to crafting table to storage box while your train is stopped because you might ram into some mines if you let it go on its own while you focus on crafting. The research tree is linear, which leaves me with mixed feelings. Also while there are many decor items in the game, it takes quite awhile before you can access them. My friends and I already had the final tier of train locomotive before we got our first walls.\n\nCurrently I'd give this a 6 or 7/10. I hope the devs stick with this.

The enemy AI is OK but nothing special.\n\nNow the big problem that I have with this game is how wildly unbalanced its upgrading is of the train and crafting system is. Leather is useless except for twice when upgrading for the back pack and suit. Sure, there are bandages, but once u get armor they are a more expensive and less useful option. Also gears are only used to upgrade  a few times, and then are forgotten about entirely. Then to top it off the crafting system is slow. Not like the crafting of items takes long (it does) but in the fact you have to click several different options on the crafting table to craft anything. then enter the amount, then accept the crafting. they should remove the quantity and just let me click the item icon a few times. Then worse is that time it takes to craft. The simplest thing to craft takes 5 seconds per item, its just a limitation so you have to spend more time in game. The smelting is just fujking awful. it takes too long, too much fuel, and has an atrocious ui. \n \nThe only good parts of this game are the theme, and he train. everything else is just a time waste.\nThat being said, i do enjoy these types of games and am just mad because they have a really good premise and vision, Its just about as rough as polished sand in its current state. Come back in 10 or so months and see if the reviews have changed before you buy.\n\nPS. there should be a sink for excess resources that gives the tokens as a reward.

They cannot ban for a review so they banned me for the post that they already locked several days prior. How are you going to ban after the fact for a thread that you already locked lol... I love how they prove me right at every turn: https:// i.imgur .com/ZvpIKTg.png\n\n\nTHE WHOLE STORY OF THE SHADY DEVELOPERS. - \n\n\nThey locked the thread I originally posted so here:\n\nI'm not defending or approving of actions by either party.\n\nThe Streamer WAS being slightly snarky\nThe Developers WERE being abusive\nBoth parties were likely in the wrong. It's how this was handled that is concerning.\n\nThe following information is as accurate and succinct as I could obtain from the people involved, posts by the \"Developer\" of Voidtrain and public Steam and Twitch chat posts.\n\nI'll sum the story up as simply as I can:\n\n-The developers originally announced a Steam release over two years ago. All of the advertisement branding even said Steam or had the Steam Logo.\n\n-The developers advertised the Steam release on Steam for a good while.\n\n-Very close to the Original Steam launch, they went silent and popped up on Epic Game Store.\n\n-The developers signed an exclusivity deal with EGS (Epic Game Store) which means two things:\n\n-EGS Gave them a pile of money in their attempt to compete against the Steam\nStorefront\n\n-They could not release on Steam for at least a year.\n\n-Rather than communicate any reason, they just went silent on Steam during this period.\n\n-They now pop back to Steam hoping to double dip and that people would have forgotten what they did.\n\n\nSHADY BEHAVIOR AND BANNING BELOW\n\nOn 5-8-2023 just under 200 people watched a Twitch streamer talking about the game receive a \"Community Warning\" from \"A Voidtrain Developer\" which was assumed to be \"SushiRice\".\n\nThe warning can be seen here: https:// i.imgur .com/WvkM5iQ.png\n\nAs you can clearly see, it was bogus. In no way could that be considered \"Disrespectful\" to the person who he was speaking to. On the contrary, the individual he was speaking to was being quite rude. It is my opinion that they specifically targeted him because he was being critical of their business decisions and shady marketing tactics.\n\nHe then allegedly received a double warning (Stated by the developer who did not show the warning from their end as it would be a violateion of Valve's ToS) for the same post on two different threads warning people of the developer's shady history here. The \"Developer\" \"SushiRice\" then violated Valve's Developer's TOS by allegedly posting private and identifying information (Doxxing) of said Streamer on Twitch.\n\nIt is my opinion that this was done on accident as \"SushiRice\" likely simply pasted the wrong thing from his clipboard. Rather than fess up to it and apologize or even acknowledge it. The developer has stated that they posses no identifying player information. This is untrue. The company's own EULA and Privacy policy specifically state that information is collected.  \n\nRight around this time is when people started posting about this. Suddenly and mysteriously several brand new Steam accounts created several threads that lauded praise on the game and developers. It's up to the reader to decide if these were White Knights on a throw away account or the Developers, themselves.\n\nThe \"Developer\" then attempts to justify their actions by posting an edited and clipped chatlog that can be seen here: https:// imgur .com/a/MzOwp8i\n\nIt's awfully strange that all the context was missing from these posts the \"developer\" posted.\n\nThankfully, the Streamer posted his community messages log: https:// i.imgur .com/wTVu0Fw.png\n\nWithin about an hour of this, a obvious forgery was posted complete with grammar and syntax completely different from the grammar and syntax that was being used by the Streamer. This entire post vanished as soon as it was called out. Very, very strange.\n\nBy the end of the day, the Developers of Voidtrain allegedly issued a DMCA request against the video to have it taken down citing that it broke \"media blackout\" and that the game was not released. \n\nIn fact, the game has been out for well over a year and the video in question had their publicly posted trailer video in it. Again, another alleged super shady action allegedly taken by these developers.\n\nAt the time of this post, the video has been removed from Youtube.\n\n-----\n\nTL;DR Shady developers broke Valve's ToS multiple times and whacked people who were critical of them a day before launch.\n\nI'll await my ban. I was genuinely excited for this game before this nonsense. It was quite infuriating being told that what myself and many other people saw live was just our imagination and they it never happened.

Performance was good enough for me and I never had any issues with the coop. Additionally the idea of having an up-gradable train is unique enough to catch my attention.\n\nBut the rest is just there.\n\nCombat feels and looks like it was build using an unreal engine tutorial for your first fps. Health bars randomly disappear and are only a red bar with no visible outline. Enemies have a very high aggro range and it feels like their accuracy is like 95% all the time. Moreover armor is not shown on the health bar but you rather have to try to shoot armor parts until they fall off, which is not very obvious at first and makes enemies a lot thiccer than they should be.\nThe whole idea of customizing your weapons (revolver and rifle / shotgun) sound cool on paper but actually finding the parts you need is depending on your luck since they only drop from enemies and those gambling machines.\nEnemies of the void are just useless. They can easily be killed right at the start and at least some don't respawn until the next area. \n\nAll the stuff you need to craft to upgrade your train is just time waste, it doesn't belong in this type of game. Time restrictions only really make sense in games with automation like Satisfactory.\n\nThe train itself is cool, for sure but it just lacks any truly game changing upgrades. I was hoping to automate most of the gathering task with these small voiddragons but it's not worth it.\nDriving with high speed not only consumes too much fuel but you loose the ability to gather new stuff effectively which makes the whole point of \"a train in space\" pretty useless.\n\nI completed all story events and researched all upgrades. Maybe there is more to discover in the endgame, but if it is close to those stupid which - puzzles I can live without it.\n\nThe game has potential, for sure.

I'll try to be as fair and balanced as possible having played it for a couple of hours.\n\nPro's \n- Looks good, stylised but I like it.\n- Similar to Raft mechanically while different enough to not be samey.\n- Great potential.\n- Only played for a couple of hours but no bugs, which for a game only a couple of hours old is impressive (though apparently it's been out awhile on Epic games which will be addressed in cons)\n\nCon's \n- Allegedly the developers did an exclusivity deal with epic, and I think by now everyone knows how the epiccp store is to a healthy market what a throbbing tumor is to a health body....though lacking the charm or moral fibre.\n- Research 'tree' is not a tree it's a line at least as far as I played there is no chance to prioritise early it's just do A then B then C etc. No choice to focus building a cooking station before containers for example, hoping this is less a problems later in game but first impressions wise, it's not good.\n- Apparently you need to use epic games services for multi player (haven't tried it yet) this is more of a result in being built in Unreal I suspect, which seems like more of a reason to not use unreal to build your game.\n- Also apparently if you get dc'd or leave the multiplayer game you lose all items, I can't confirm or deny at this point but if true needs to be fixed immediately that is enough to kill a resource gathering game. (this however was supposedly hotfixed today (10/05/23) so if that's fixed it's a good start.\n\nAt the time of this I'd give the game a 6.5/10 for your average gamer and 7/10 for raft style enthusiasts, the developers get  4/10, 1 for games issues and working with epic's current business model you deserve to lose 5 points from your rating but at least it's not your social credit score.\n\nI will update this as I play more and once I've tried multiplayer.", "timestamp_created": 1683740729, "timestamp_updated": 1683741753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800126969814300537", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139597022": {"recommendationid": "139597022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085134509", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1822, "last_played": 1687485259}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, I have officially burnt my entire weekend away playing this game. Guess I'll say everything I like about it, along with a few minor nitpicks.\n\nVisually, the game is impressive, especially for an indie company. On \"Epic\" settings, you can see grains of wood, pits on the metal, etc. The devs put a lot of love into making the game look good, and it shows. Despite being an indie survival game with amazing graphics, it even still runs well! Putting out a near-perfect 60fps using DX12 and all the highest settings on a 3060ti. Good optimization is important to me, and this launched with it. \n\nThe sound design is phenomenal. The guns sound punchy, and actually have different sounds depending on how you build them. I am a sucker for good sound design, and the sounds of this game are satisfying when they need to be, and when they don't need to be, they're downright eerie. The soundtrack is also dynamic and epic, filling me with chills every time I pull into the depot. I do feel the witch chest sound cue puzzle SFX are a little out of place, but that's nitpicking. Besides, those goofy ahh sounds match the humor the game continues to provide.\n\nVoidtrain is rich with personality. Sure, you control a thus-far muted character who has to give all their personality via first-person cutscenes, but this adds a lot of charm to the game. This genius engineer is also a complete idiot, which as someone who has worked in IT, is hilarious to me. My theory is some of the devs have done exactly what the engineer does: take out a hammer and beat something with it until it works. Hilarious! Genuinely gives me a smile every time I see it. There's also aliens/enemies outside of yourself, and a wise-cracking narrator to feel even a solo playthrough feel... less so.\n\nI love the narrator's voice and lines. The dialogue feels natural, not forced, which is a great feat considering this game is about a train flying through triangular portals in between reality. The fact I am immersed in such a ridiculous setting is a testament to convincing personality and writing. Props to the narrator by the way! They did a fantastic job.\n\nAs for game mechanics, I do admit, in the first hour or two, resource gathering can be repetitive. You jump off, mash E while looking at some boards, bring back to ship, build, rinse, repeat. Typical survival gathering... until you get the \"grappling hook.\" This little tool changes EVERYTHING. You can now break a resource rock, fly off the train, snipe like 5 items with your grappling hook, and swim back in no time at all. This already makes the resource gathering WAY quicker. Plus, shortly after that, you unlock prophecies. These make the resource spawn rate increase, which makes it so you get the materials you need even faster! But other than the resource gathering being slow at first, which is usual for this genre, the game mechanics are diverse and entertaining. Can't appreciate speedy gathering if you first don't get through the slog!\n\nShooting feels decent, and I love experimenting with different weapon parts to make my gun preform differently. The enemies range from dumb to \"wow this guy is armored, I need a lot of rounds to take him down,\" and even having things like boss aliens with varying attacks and armor plates you need to shoot off. Considering this game is a survival game first, and FPS second? I think they did a fine job making the shooting parts entertaining.\n\nBuilding your train is fun as well. I was encouraged to keep doing so since pets are such great buffs, and you need more wagons to get more pets. There's plenty of motivation to progress, and so far, after thirty hours, I haven't even reached the limit. I don't even think I'm close, looking at other trains in the game, and seeing all their upgrades... I'm sure I can get those as well. Just gotta keep grinding. I love the varied ways you can build your cabins on the platforms. The train editor is intuitive enough so that it only takes a few moments to understand, but complex enough to allow for a vast amount of combinations to make it look perfect in your eyes. As for placing furniture, such as chests and workbenches, I do wish there was an option to toggle snapping... but the placement system is precise enough to allow for perfect alignment, if one spends a few extra moments with it.\n\nI did try co-op with a family member, and, other than the fact it made progression way faster than it should be (we got a grappling hook from scratch in 55 minutes and we weren't hardly trying)... it worked pretty much perfectly! Though, fair warning, you can't no-clip through teammates, so getting around the starter trolley feels a bit cramped at times. That's honestly the only \"bad\" thing about MP, and it's easily prevented by user error avoidance.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite moving-base style survival games, if not my favorite. I definitely feels worth the price. It's well-paced, well-written, intuitive, smooth, and beautiful. It has captured my attention for every waking moment of this past weekend, and I am not ashamed to say so. I'm sure it will for many more hours after. I love trains, and I love space.

A weapon customisation system is present, but it is too extensive for its own good, as you will quickly become overwhelmed with individual parts with no clear indication on which is compatible with which and how to combine them for a specific result. Most of the times you will just loot a gun from the most-definitely-non-WWII-German soldiers, and simply  tinker with it by adding better parts.\n[*]Basebuilding - from the trailers you could deduce that you are riding a train and can upgrade it. It is not without flaws, but not bad either. There are some arbitrary restrictions imposed by the developers about the placement of some things. There is no snap-grid system, but it is not a significant drawback. The inventory managemend is.\n[*]Resource and inventory management - oh boy, where do I start.... Tell me, buddy, how big should your inventory be? This big? Well, let's just say that your inventory is limited and will clog quite soon. 12 default slots will take you only so far, so you use your precious resources to build a chest. Obviously you cannot expect a hammerspace ches, but what the hell! It has only 4 slots! I mean, it is Tier 1 chest, surely after research you will be able to get something bette- Tier 2 has 6 slots. This is not funny. You can make a backpack that will extend your inventory by whopping 3 slots though. This means that at least an entire fully extended wagon will be occupied by rows of chests, upgraded or not just to contain all your resources. A whole another bane are the aforementioned weapon parts that will clog half of your storage even if you will dump all the subpar variants. Also, to those who are playing with friends it is worth mentioning that the chests are \"shy\" in this game. If you know you know.\n[*]Crafting - just surrender. You will never be able to keep the furnaces and labs fueled. The stacks are way too small for that and they burn out extremely fast regardless of the type of fuel. I think the coal bricket may be an exception, but that's about it. The system is also weird that in order to start crafting, you need to enter a menu on a crafting station, but the result can be picked out only by hand outside of the menu. The immersion it adds is dubious and mostly causes confusion.\n[*]Riding the train - It will be fun for the first hour or so. After that you will suddenly realise that there is absolutely no reason to go faster than the minimum speed, except out of the boredom, as then you won't keep up with the passing resources. Also I am writig this from a co-op experience, and none of us could fathom how to play this alone. Sometimes you encounter obstructions like mines, blockposts, etc. There is some fauna flying around, but nothing a few shots can't scare off at least. At some point you will gain the ability to go off-track and explore the islands, but that already sounds much more exciting than it actually is. In actuality it is visiting some ruined islands with some puzzles that will grant you lootboxes. Doesn't even come close to Raft's island exploration (you can't even stand on them!). There are arenas that are on islands that you would actually expect for exploration, but apart from a few items that, as it turned out, were shamelessly gated behind arenas contrary to their desctiption in research and on the wiki, they are most definitely not worth visiting.\n[*]Atmosphere - bellissimo! Wonderful! The ambience and the zeitgeist are executed absolutely excellently! Too bad the game has nothing to back it up with and generally feels hollow.\n[*]The Plot - [spoiler]Where do I even start? The plot went through several iterations during development, but currently you are some no-name engineer that just stumbles upon the gates to this void. The void is inhabited by [strike]Pokemon[/strike] Rofleemos, [strike]Fishburgers[/strike] sharks and leeches, and [strike]wehrmacht remnants[/strike] generic non-affiliated soldiers that confuse you with some scientist and want you dead. You are going after the trail of this scientist, discover some scraps of lore and find his hideout in one of the outposts (the ones behind the gates with epic music that gets old after 5 times), find out that he is after some divine waterfall water vials, and the hideout starts collapsing. \"To be continued\". Seriously? I get that it is \"Early Access\" and all, but 2 years and we get about as much content as the first arc of Raft? This is supposed to be the major driving force and the reason to explore the void! To put the progress to scale, we have reached this cliffhanger without even reaching the diesel locomotive. We found out that in order to progress we didn't need to get to the plot checkpoint, but to visit the otherwise pointless arena and get acid there by reading reddit! This is not how games should be designed, and early access is a very poor excuse for this. Our dissapointment was immeasurable, as we have waited for the Steam version for quite some time, and instead of a hyped game we get this. Not worth the price tag, thank you. Maybe in 5 years it will be a good game if the developers continue at this pace, but that is yet to come.[/spoiler]\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1684971048, "timestamp_updated": 1684971048, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765643894672393799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138278888": {"recommendationid": "138278888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038394089", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1049, "last_played": 1684040480}, "language": "english", "review": "The closest game comparison to VoidTrain would probably be Viscera Cleanup Detail.\n\nIn VoidTrain, you are a janitor tasked with slowly cleaning up the debris scattered around the Void Rail, long after a much more interesting story took place. To cope with having such a lowly and meaningless career, you pretend that there is a mad scientist on the loose who is being chased down by the largest family of identical brothers that ever existed: The Generic Brothers!\n\nThe Generic Boys will definitely be some of the smartest, omnipotent rivals you've faced. They have impeccable aim, clairvoyance to know when a gun is trained on their location, and the ability to take several bullets in the head while pretending to be staring at the rocks, only to have Brother #55 attack your flank.\n\nIf you are fortunate enough to claim victory over the GenBros, you feel a rush from acquiring one of these super weapons they used to rain hellfire upon you! Rapid Fire! Eagle Eye Accuracy! Unfortunately, your tainted Janitor hands are a curse upon these fine objects, leaving you with a quality that matches their patchwork looks.\n\nDuring your journey you will long for a different view, anything to break up the monotonous scenery and tedium of continuously collecting garbage to convert into usable materials...so that you can collect even shinier garbage to add to your train filled with trash boxes and non-integrative crafting stations.\n\nUsing your wits and the junk that you've hoovered up, you create a hookshot device so that you can pretend that you're playing Raft, only to discover that the hook is just out of reach of every object in sight. Resigning to manual drift collection, you realize how unlike Raft your janitorial job has become. If only you had placed higher on your aptitude test, you could be traversing the oceans in any direction. Instead, you were better suited for a one-way path with little divergence to confuse your limited capabilities.\n\nEventually you'll come across a strange entity trapped in amber. Ignoring your primal instincts to scatterblast the creature into oblivion, you take it on as a taskhand. Each time you pick up this entity, it begs you to toss it into the Void, ending its useless existence. But, since you don't understand its language, you continue to allow it to stay aboard your Garbage Train, reading the same upside down comic book over and over.\nIn an attempt to find a greater purpose than that of a Void Janitor, this creature will stand in the middle of the platform walkway just to annoy you by blocking your path. But fortune smiles upon you once again! Because there is no roof to this train that will prevent you from hopping over the little slimeball. Its the minigames like this that really lift the spirits on the 'Storage Box Express' during the slower collection days.\n\nAs time passes and the collection continues, you begin to realize how grateful you are to not be distracted from your duties by any change in scenery. You feel at ease knowing that the floating bells and chains will always be there, as well as those floating islands that are just out of reach.\nThose same floating islands will fuel your dreams that one day you'll be able to somehow 'wench' your way over and plant your feet upon their surfaces. It will be a glorious day of exploration and new investigations. NO WAY will your attempts to stick these islands with your wench rings be deflected into the Void, leaving you yearning for your time and money back.\n\nUntil that day arrives, you can huddle around the hobo bbq for a tasty bite of Grilled Organics, which is most likely some form of human adipose tissue, left over from whatever catastrophe occurred that caused this Void realm. After, you can wash it down with a nice chunk of Void Ice while contemplating the source of this non-melting rock. But, then you recall your favorite movie, 'Joe Dirt.'

Only to realize that the big box didn't have a Nintendo 64 in it, rather a sweater, the itchy kind.\n\n[h2]TLTR[/h2]\nBoring and grindy as hell, don't buy it.\n\n[i]For the rest of you who like to read, please read on...[/i]\n\n[h2]Overall[/h2]\nIt's just boring. So, so boring. I've been through 15 gates and I am done!\nThe first 5 stages, you are still light headed from the Zero G experience. You had bit if shooting. Perhaps you got a nice machine gun. The grind got a bit better with a grappling gun.\nBut then you start notice some things...\nThe same assets floating around you everywhere, in every void. The same rocks, the same metal sheets and bits, even the same islands. The initial questions you had about their origin slowly is fading as you realize, that there is no answer to it and it's just world filler.\nThen you notice the stations being the same as well. Right side safe zone, left side fighty, shooty zone.\nYou also notice that the grind is the same, things seemingly don't get any easier just more complex.\nBut let's dissect the problems even more shall we...\n\n[h2]Resreach[/h2]\nDo you like researching and unlocking craftable things?\nWell, you are in luck because there is plenty of that with a lot of grind and seemingly no clear connection between the research stages. Yes, you heard right. I said stages.\nResearch is chopped up into small stages consisting of 1, 2, 3 or even four reseachable things.\nYou can even research more health. Just like in real life. When I read an article on WebMD I suddenly felt more healthy and my pain threshold has risen as well.\nBy the way... When your character can build a research table that clearly has some basic components in it, like nuts and bolt. Do you think you need to research nuts and bolts again? In other words, do you like to reinvent the wheel?\nOh and this is not even the craziest part.\nDo you think you research the chassis for your carts on the research table?\nWRONG! You give a rare mushroom to your rofleemo (don't ask why). And whilst that little bugger is chowing down on that shroom, enlightenment hits you and suddenly you know how to build a chassis. \nI don't know about you, but whenever I give food to my dog, I gain 10+ IQ. Forget the Matrix style uploading how to fly a chopper shit. Just feed your pet!\nWhere are these crazy mushrooms coming from, you ask? Do you think perhaps growing on floaty rocks? islands?\nAh, don't be absurd. They can be found in a box, you silly thing. Where else would you get mushrooms from?\nAnd then you research Zinc harvesting. Wow, that is great. Am I going to smash floaty rocks apart for more stuff?\nNO you DumDum! Zinc magically appears on the very next void stage, just floating around like the other crap. You just didn't saw it because you were too stupid.\n\n[h2]Crafting[/h2]\nDo you like clicking? Like a lot of clicking? Well, then this game is for you!\nYou want to smelt 10 iron bars?\nNo problem!\nJust click on the smelter; then on fuel; then on wood; then the right arrow how much wood you want to put in (max 10); then click out, click on the resource you want to smelt; click the amount in; click out; click on the hammer icon.\nEasy right? Just 30 clicks away from having 10 iron bars.\nOh and don't you even think exiting out of the menu, whilst you're doing all this clicking, or you will reset the whole thing. Just like in real life... I remember a time when I was putting away 20 cups in a cupboard, one by one and when I stepped away from the cupboard at the 13th cup, all of them reappeared in my hand! Damn You Reality!!!!!\n\nAnd whilst we are talking about smelting and whatnot. Do you think that a level 2 smelter should be able to smelt the same things as a level 1? WRONG! Clearly a more advanced tool can do only more advanced things! You can't just smelt regular iron ore in a super quality smelter. You have to still use your shitty small smelter for that.\nSame goes for workshop and lab. So if you like to hoard multiple equipment on your train. You are in luck my friend, this game is a must have for you.\n\n[h2]Exploration[/h2]\nThis takes the cake and eats it all. Right after it picked your fridge, freezer and your pantry clean.\nAs I said, cookie cutter trash floating everywhere. Small islands have nothing on them of any interest. No pickable flora, or killable fauna.\nAnd when you get the grappling hook and the small little circle crap it can hook into, that you throw into rocks?\nYeah, but you can only throw it into certain rocks. So most islands are really unreachable, but there is nothing on them as I said, so no value is lost I guess.\nThe only time you use them when you see small amount of shiny floaters in the distance, then you can go there, find some old destroyed shacks, with no story around them to explore and some stupid puzzles which aren't hard in a puzzling way...\nNo! They are hard because navigating and finding small stones with engravings is a chore.\nAnd what do you get? A box. Yes sir, a nice shiny box!\nWhat does it contain, you ask?\nWell the same crap you've been collecting ever since you arrived in this god forsaken place. And some other useless tat.\nHurrah for exploration!!!!\nWhat do you suggest? just muscle through the void from gate to gate?\nYeah, no...\nYou can't just afterburn through a level, first you need still to collect some crap, like water and wood, minimum. Then there are minefields, minimum 1 but later 2 per level.\nSo you just snail through on the lowest speeds all the way. Even with your big shiny train. You just chug along like Thomas The Tank engine going up the hill with 20 coal carts on it's back.\nOh and then you have this chubby dude giving you a trial (crucible like) 3 stage mission where you fight mindless Zerg-like aliens. Where do these come from? Why aren't these living on floaty rocks, so they spit at you when you pass by?\nLack of imagination, that's why. Probably...\nYou have outposts with shooty guys on it, but you can't have outposts with trader guys? Or just any kind of small outpost to break the monotony? A village maybe?\nYou are in a magical void place, driving a train! Anything! I mean anything that would appear next to the train tracks randomly would make it far more interesting a game. Here are some examples.\nA guy standing on an island in front of his shack, waving at you.\nA blowup doll.\nA boat with a fisherman, fishing for floaty rats.\nA bag of knives.\nTwo corpses hugging in mid air.\n\n[h2]Story???[/h2]\nI cared, but I don't at this point. When you drive through 3 levels with absolutely nothing happening!!! And then finally the boring narrator opens its mouth at the station... With no prior indication of something is going to await you at the end.\nSo far I haven't seen any junctions, places where you could potentially switch lanes mid void to go other places. Like if there were any other places.\nThis game needs more content. Like anything at this point.\nAnything that gives a sense of choice and direction!\nAnything that feels like something is waiting you at the other side of the gate, which lies 10 miles away from you with a minefield riddled empty space with mindless soldiers at an outpost in between!\n\nMaybe there is more to it after Gate X, but at this point I stopped caring. I have other games and hobbies I can enjoy and they give more content than this.\n\n[h1]The word \"VOID\" is quite fitting as this game feels like being devoid of content[/h1]\n\nSorry guys, but this game is a big NO NO. The concept is great, the execution is horrible at best.\nThe things which should be simple are overly complex, the things which need to be complex are either overly simple or non-existent at this point.\n\nDo not buy unless there is a radical change in the game.

Pick it up now, it'll most likely only improve with time.\n\n2: If you're playing SOLO, you will likely have a BETTER time than multiplayer. Most of the bugs myself and my friend have been experiencing are on my friend's side only, of which I'm hosting. It's not unplayable by any means, but be ready to be on their discord offering bug reports at a not infrequent rate. From what I've seen in their hotfix notes as well, they are both working on it and it seems to be partially a ping issue.\n\n3: If you are moreso considering the game because you have a friend who wants to play it, this might not be the best time for you. This ties a lot into point 2, where because the game's more buggy for people joining a lobby, you may struggle to find the game as fun as your compatriot(s). Come back in a month or two when more of the bugs are ironed out and consider it then.\n\nOther than that, if you enjoyed games like Raft, you should enjoy this game. The combat's fun, resource gathering, while slow at some points, has fairly good methods of progression (USE YOUR WORKBENCH, GET RANK 10!), and in general the game is graphically beautiful even for someone like me running entirely on medium graphics. Gunplay, while not as clean as your halo or your CoD, is still solid, and if you like customization or Borderland's rarity system, prepare for dopamine. The Narrator is a fantastic tutorial character, who enhances your tutorial experiences rather than hindering them. Tutorials also are paired with text based prompts, which also allow you to skip them, as well as going away on their own after a timer. Very good QoL feature. The pistol is also a very fun tool, being an infinite ammo tool that makes ammo more of a fun addition rather than a resource problem.\n\nOverall, I enjoy the game.

The textures are well made,the effects could be a bit more impactful,in gunfights especially,but there will definitely be more updates later on.\n\nSoundwise,there's a good voice actor for the narrator,makes it's lines actually sound funny,as they should be,the music is also very good,helps the atmosphere quite a lot and the sounds in general work quite well,the little allies you gather are a joy to watch and listen to as well,in general it's good,it works well,tho in the Arenas,it's a bit hard sometimes to pinpoint where enemies are coming from,might be an issue from my side,can't say for sure.\n\nThere is some story,you're supposed to follow some scientist who wanted to figure out stuff about the Void and why people are fighting around in it,but sadly,there's still more chapters that need to be introduced and worked on,so you only get like a basic idea of what's going on,but even so,it's presented decently and the narrator really backs it up.\n\nNow talking about gameplay,it's pretty similar to Raft,you basically get a tiny and sad looking piece of s....train that with a lot of gathering,researching and developing,will turn into a huge machine travelling in the depths of space,surrounded by a cute army that risk their lives for you....but not really,sadly.\n\nThe cute allies and the army part was only recently introduced to the game,so if you were playing before,you would have to farm almost everything all alone or with some friends,cause the game does support COOP,yet that was one of the reasons why many people have kinda given up on the game,it used to take way too long and way too many runs to have a decent progress,but now with the Automation Update,i'd say that it takes away that grinding hustle.\n\nResearching is easy,you just build a table,gather mats,do the studies and then slowly work your way up,unlock more train parts,new passives,the Roofleemo's and the Loot Catchers,which are the most important part,while new resources also unlock with the tree,although Acid is locked behind the Arena part,which also might drive away players,since you have to farm those properly,the allies can't gather that at all,at least for now.\n\nYour gear is pretty much crafted as you see fit,all the parts of your weapons can be removed and used as you want,which is really nice,giving you the ability to turn an SMG into a sniper and later on into a shotgun with ice bullets as a secondary,if you wish to do so obviously.\n\nThe runs contain a couple random events,which can be altered with certain rituals you unlock at a later part in the story,sadly yet again,there aren't that many so it get's really repetitive after a couple hours,hopefully this will slowly change as the devs keep adding new stuff and content,the station being the main hub where you get some free mats,a new ally once you unlock them and enemies that you can also fight for loot.\n\nEnemies are yet again,pretty much the same and not very different,the Arena has some alien mobs,the Void has some flying fishes and the main enemy are the wannabe nazis,who have different loadouts and HP,but still work in pretty much the same way. Gets repetitive quite fast as well,but surely as the story will develop,so will the enemies I'd say.\n\nOverall,Voidtrain is a crafting exploration game,with survival elements,similar to Raft,but it still has issues being an early access,the main one being that it gets repetitive pretty much after 5-6 hours,so unless you're a fan of this genre or have a few friends to play with,it might just be too boring to be worth getting. For me,it's a good game,that has a lot of potential,but I do love the train developing part and the Automation Update really boosted the time spent actually playing and exploring,rather than just gathering,being sad that you don't have enough of anything and gathering again,to get to the same conclusion.\n\nWould be wiser to get on a sale,maybe even for die hard fans of the genre,it's really up to your own preferences at this point. Still a solid 7/10 , that might be better and better in time,but with the latest update,i'm hopeful that it's heading into the right direction....just as the train.\n\nIf you liked the review and want to find even more content,reviews or just support me,you can do it on my Patreon : patreon.com/SteveAnton97", "timestamp_created": 1704999413, "timestamp_updated": 1704999413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743352591991424561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139172285": {"recommendationid": "139172285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179558934", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 941, "last_played": 1685159696}, "language": "english", "review": "Raft, on a space train instead of a boat", "timestamp_created": 1685300748, "timestamp_updated": 1685300748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.742951691150665283", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139001730": {"recommendationid": "139001730", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971855214", "num_games_owned": 444, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 1429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1023, "last_played": 1691981378}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Edit[/b]: Well, good news. They changed a lot of things and addressed several of my complaints. There are still flaws, but it's not nearly as grating as it once was.\n\nVoidtrain can be a little frustrating. Not frustrating in that it's difficult, not frustrating in that it's glitchy and poorly made, nor frustrating because there's anything in the game that is overtly offensive. It's frustrating in that there are some really good elements in here but it feels like the developers wanted to focus on... well, literally everything else.\n\n[b]TL, DR[/b]: Voidtrain has some serious identity issues. It says it's an open world survival crafting game, but there's no open world and no survival. Just crafting and shooting and gathering. No exploration, minimal player agency. There's promise there but it seems the developers got carried away at some point with feature creep and are now building what is essentially a looter shooter with tedious crafting, amazing music and as little player agency as possible. It's not a bad game by any stretch but right now it seems to be trying to be everything and not quite succeeding at all of them.\n\nThe Good\n - The Void and 90% of the stuff in it. It's ominous while being peaceful, there's a teensy bit of (unfortunately linear) exploration which feels really awesome, especially the first time. My only criticism of it is that there isn't really any threat in said void. The creatures present are effectively harmless despite trying to be implemented like Bruce from Raft. \n - The music. Oh man the music. Mwah. Perfect. 10/10. Approaching the gate for the first time is just fantastic and every time it triggers I enjoy listening to it. Combat music is good, too, and there's plenty of peaceful stuff for when you're just collecting. \n - The puzzles. They're weird, quirky, and just the right level of tricky. Even when you know how to solve them you still have to figure them out so it's all reasonably satisfying.\n\nThe Not-So-Good\n - Rofleemos. Yes, I know, ha ha meme pet. It doesn't fit - even remotely - with anything else in the setting. Every time you interact with them it's like a scene out of Who Framed Roger Rabbit with a cartoon floating around in a realistic setting. They're not going to get removed either so hopefully you really like them.\n - The Narrator. Again, it feels like they're going for a Stanley Parable or Breathedge sort of thing here but the game is neither comedic enough nor the narrator charming enough to make it fit. Removing the narrator would unironically improve the quality of the game as environmental storytelling is much, much more effective and immersive than a snarky disembodied voice breaking the fourth wall constantly.\n - The FPS. You remember I said the game was FPS-Crafting? Yeah. The FPS is... not great. Every bullet has significant travel time, the iron sights seem wonky at best and while the AI and fighting is alright on its own, it's not satisfying enough to carry the entire game. This would be totally acceptable if this was an open world survival crafting game with lots of other things to do, but the shooting is instead a necessary focal point for most of what you do and just can't shoulder that burden yet. \n - The crafting. Woof. Early on it's alright but the further you go the more complex the recipes get and eventually you need to have 3-4 steps for every different material. You don't have enough to mass-produce them, they take a long time to craft, often require fuel resources in order to craft, and when you're putting everything together it just feels like busywork after a while. Might be wise to look at games like Grounded for examples of similar but more satisfying crafting. Having us refine everything into infinity is not, in fact, very fun. Collecting a broader number of resources, or gathering and consuming them in larger quantities, is probably a better way to go. [b][This seems to have been mostly addressed/fixed][/b]\n - The Arena. A necessary side quest but as it is currently balanced the big \"shield\" enemy is wonky AF. They've added a marker indicating where its attack will land, but this doesn't matter because you can only dodge it if you are already sprinting by the time it appears. Walking, strafing, and sometimes even sprinting will not evade it. It turns battles into a literal test of how much damage you can soak rather than how skilful you are. \n - Weapon modding. It's... well, incredibly tedious. The weapon modifiers are unclear at a glance so you don't know what you're picking up until you've already nabbed it and gone back to the train. But even this doesn't really matter because ammunition is sufficiently limited that you want to maximize your per-shot damage so you don't have to go through multi-step crafting to waste resources on it. It could be significantly simplified to be a bit less burdensome (especially on your inventory as each gun hypothetically has 6-7 pieces) and ideally less of a looter-shooter.\n - The train. Early on it feels fantastic, very Raft-like. Very tense and eerie, evoking the sense that you are tiny and alone in a huge void. Then you start expanding, and the number of things you need in your train start expanding. Then you have Rofleemos randomly appearing on the ground blocking movement. You have other players blocking movement. Then you have nice-looking modules that add walls and ceilings... and a tiny door that it is comically easy to block other players from moving through unintentionally. If the train was 1-2 steps wider it would probably be great, but as it stands your train rapidly becomes cluttered and if you're not playing alone you will frequently be in each other's way. If nothing else the developers need to make it so players can pass through each other or push each other out of the way. Also it [i]desperately[/i] needs some form of internal lighting available by default. None of the wagon sections are usable in the slightest without light. [b][They recently added lights early on and spread out the cosmetic/decorations in a good way][/b]\n - The content, or absence thereof. Yes, it's still in early access so this is only a minor gripe - but at the moment the majority of the game occurs in the void and there's not really a whole lot they seem to be able to do to make it interesting or engaging. Just some busywork with mines, mostly. Fighting other trains is exciting, but other than that it's peaceful gathering. \n - Player agency. If you want to insist on calling this game open world you need to empower players to make decisions and explore. Not follow an oblique path to a predetermined outcome - to actually set out in a direction and forge their own path. You could do this by creating forks in the tracks, having broader sets of rocks that players can jump between with clusters of materials or rewards amongst them, etc. Prophecies are alright but the impact is so negligible on most of them that they might as well not exist.\n\nSo is all hope lost? Well, no. Do I regret my purchase? No, not really. I do enjoy the game - if I didn't I wouldn't be quite so frustrated with it - but it does seem like the developers are fumbling a bit with the direction. Or fumbled with it and made some questionable decisions. Either way the direction seems set now and, unfortunately for me, it seems unlikely to change dramatically in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1685077012, "timestamp_updated": 1688872485, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736968398094177246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138469297": {"recommendationid": "138469297", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996264627", "num_games_owned": 614, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3414, "last_played": 1687268857}, "language": "english", "review": "having a great time,\ni cant wait for the rest of the game\n\nafter finishing the story and all the research (so far) this is my 2 cents\n\nThe good\n- being on a train is fun\n- animations feel slick\n- there is just the right amount of combat and puzzles to break up floating around in the void\n\nThe bad:\n-it felt like i was in a tutorial for a good 6 hours\n-resource gathering can be grindy\n-i had one crash (early on and i think it was related to doing the story out of order)\n-that big bug in the arena can just launch you into the air anywhere on the map even if you're far away and out of vision. coupled with some other bugs you can get juggled without the ability to do anything\n\nThoughts:\ni could do with less hand holding.

I was skeptical at first with some of the negative reviews, but I thought the game looked fun so I decided to buy it anyway. Well, I can't stop playing it. Like literally I am addicted to this game (help lol). Buy this game if you want to enjoy a fresh and unique feeling as compared to today's popular games. Best aspects of survival and building feel, combined with FPS gameplay and endless exploring, and on a TRAIN? In another dimension? Best feeling ever. \n\nMy advice - just because a game has some negative reviews doesn't mean you actually won't like it.\n9.5/10\nThis game has serious potential, and has a lot available to offer right now. It's worth the money.\n\n~EDIT~\nI realize now that I should counter the negative reviews with actual data.\n\nInventory:\nThe inventory system is indeed tight at the beginning, with only 12 slots. I filled this up quickly, however, through the tech stages, you unlock more and more storage from backpacks (24). Early on, I filled up my inventory quickly, but having storage containers built ate up some materials, and enabled more to be stored. Inventory was not much of a problem later down the game.\n\nRepetitive nature:\nYes, the depots are mostly the same design. Yes, the void looks similar other than than the background design. But remember what the game's base is: an infinite void filled with mysteries as you progress. Those mysteries are what YOU find. Looking closely and seeing giant bones or shards as you go through the tracks wondering what caused those massive things. It is an incredibly relaxing feeling, wondering, thinking, and being creative as you traverse the void. Some depots, are incredibly different. They tie in with the story. And since most are the same design, it makes it significant when changes are made. I have 36 hours as of writing this edit, and I can safely say that 10 hours since the initial review, I still feel passionately about the game. \n\nKeep in mind, this game is in Early Access. They still are working on it, and will add much more. It has so much to offer. I am saddened by the mass of people hatting on it when they have barley any hours on the game. While 36 hours is no feat, it is still much more than some of these other people's time.\n\nBefore this. I was lost, searching for a new game to enjoy. That weird period of time when you don't really have a game to latch on or to enjoy. I was scrolling endlessly until I found Voidtrain. It's creative nature was a wonderful break from the standard that is today's games. While I know it doesn't have all the features, the creative nature and new experience made up for it. Too much time is spent on the fence when it comes down to decisions. I made one in favor of this game, and it has lived up to it for me. For others it did not. I'm not sure what else you could want from this game, it has such a positive aspect on my life, and gave me purpose when I was blanking staring at my screening watching videos. \n\nThis game is going places. If you have patience, you will love this game. If you want a quick, fast paced game, look at the thousands of other games that fit that category. Voidtrain has action, but the majority of it is you or a friend and the infinite void. Build a train to get you through the unknown, and enjoy a relaxing and calm experience. Occasionally, take out your custom made weapon and tear through the enemies. I hope this review gave some light in what takes place in my mind when I consider some of the negatives that many say about Voidtrain. No game is perfect. I have confidence in Voidtrain and the team's dedication to making this game amazing. My rating stands from the previous section.\n\nBest wishes\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1688698330, "timestamp_updated": 1689209407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.731868565082550049", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138191114": {"recommendationid": "138191114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048093559", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1171, "last_played": 1684010215}, "language": "english", "review": "The sheer amount of grind wouldnt be as devastating to me, if it werent for the fact, that it is just... so... damn... boring to do. \n\nDont get me wrong, its fun for like a couple of hours, but the game doesnt provide you with helpfull instruments to make it easier as the game progresses. It doesnt help, that the crafting system is getting more and more exhausting as you progress further. \n\nCrafting system explained:\nYou basically got 3 main crafting resources. \n- With them you craft different kinds of crafting stations in order to get new crafting options. \n- Through the stations you craft different types of materials out of the 3 original ones. \n- The new materials are then needed to craft better versions of the old crafting stations.\n- And so it goes on...\n\nthe better versions tho are no direct upgrade that provides you with both new and old recipes. No, it just gives you new ones, so you still need to keep all the old stations in order to craft everything else.\n\nThe result is you constantly running between 9 different stations in order to get one material you need. To be able to craft you mostly need fuel for your stations, that you need to farm as well. Manually.\n\nA quick example. Lets say I want to get a chest type 1. First i need to farm the necessary resources. That takes about 2-3 minutes. Then you need to process. Luckily its just a type 1 chest so you just need to run between 3 different crafting stations in order to get the job done. That shouldnt take longer than 2 minutes.\nSo after 4-5 minutes you got ONE chest.\nHave fun building a train.\n\nNote: The game has potential, the combat is fairly fun and the concept is neat. In the current state tho I cant recomment to buy the game unless its 50% off. Core gameplay improvements are heavily needed in order to play it long term.\n\n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1683909679, "timestamp_updated": 1683909818, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.731248974800109863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138348060": {"recommendationid": "138348060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080537822", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2418, "last_played": 1684131229}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun and and similar enough like RAFT, but has some glaring issues...\n\n-Combat- \nUtterly abysmal, enemies are far too numbered, deal way too much damage, dont take enough damage and stagger you so much its very difficult to fight back. Spend an hour gaining resources for simple fights and its all gone in a few minutes. Skip fighting if you can, not worth it even with high tier weapons. \n\n-Fuel-\nFor a train game you'll spend alot of time at a crawl. Fuel is so inefficient, spend another hour gathering resources to fill up your maxed out diesel train and it will last maybe 5 minutes at full burn. Total waste. Same issue for most crafting stations and their fuel too. \n\n-Scaling-\nThere doesnt feel to be any scaling for different group sizes, solo this game is a chore sometimes. This goes into issues with combat and resources. Difficulty scaling is drastically needed or tweaked. \n\n-Research-\nResearch is linear and a total resource sink, making all the items you need for the thing only to waste it for the research, and with certain resources being rare this can hurt alot. \n\n-Progress and worlds-\nThe different paths and randomness is neat (and theres a bit of a way to manipulate them later on) but with certain resources only coming from a specific place and you needing a good amount...good luck getting the area to spawn when you want it to. (and with combat as bad as it is, its hard to get a good amount you'll find out as well) The story is interesting and comedic though. \n\n-Shark-\nWhats its point...kill it at the start of every path and its not an issue till the next path. \n\nThese are the only issues im having so far, theres alot of cool mechanics in the game, puzzle solving, loot chests (good luck fighting to open them though with the awful combat), workers, the aesthetic is super cool, I like buillding up the train. \n\nOverall im having \"fun\" but for a game thats been out for 2 years on Epic theres alot of issues still. I mean right after the steam release they JUST fixed an awful UI pain with building tools. Devs what are you doing? Get it together.\n\nIm excited for the roadmap and to see the future, but right now its not a good loop.

That's a little questionable but okay, fine. This brief review isn't about bugs, glitches, screen tearing, because on a technical level this game is fine. In my 2.5 hours of play I didn't encounter any technical mishaps. It's stable, no stuttering or other issues, hit boxes are were they should be. This game's single biggest problems are pacing and indecisiveness. \n\nI played the demo before I bought it. The demo left me with the impression that after I was out of the tutorial I'd be gathering more resources and building a train pretty quickly. What actually happens is you're still doing the exact same thing in the full game that you were doing in the demo tutorial, collect the same resources in single increments (one per collection), over and over. I got to tech level seven, I think, where the task is to build a lab. I still didn't have walls or a roof on my train. I still didn't have any means of easily collecting the dozens of single items I needed to build anything or repair my stuff. \n\nThere are these long stretches where you're traveling through the void for 10-15 minutes at a time picking up single sticks, single pieces of metal, and converting them into ingots and other materials. I assumed these long stretches of quiet were basically to chill out and appreciate the great deal of effort they've put into the visuals but no, it's actually so they can waste your time. I'm not kidding. Someone made the decision to have annoyances follow you throughout the game. I won't call them enemies because the biggest pain in my ass, the shark, doesn't seem to be able to be killed. The slightly less annoying hindrance is a thing that latches onto the train and slows it down, halting it completely if you don't address it fast enough. All of that combines into the following scenario: you're swimming through space collecting individual twigs and hunks of metal, and if your train is going too slow then it's going to get eaten and/or halted by those annoyances I mentioned. If it's going too fast, you won't be able to get back on and deposit your loot because even using the \"haul yourself in\" button you still can't catch the damn thing. There isn't a happy medium, and even making the fucking train accelerate is a goddamn mini-game instead of just tapping \"Accelerate\" a few times. It's unnecessary and different just for the sake of being different, not because it adds anything to the experience (other than more aggravation). \n\nThey haven't bothered to implement features that you wind up banging your head against from the first outpost you stop in. It's full of bad guys who aren't interesting, but that's fine, this is early access. The larger issue is that you end up collecting gun parts that just take up spots in your limited inventory with no way to actually use them to improve the only weapon you have, the gun whose new parts you keep finding on the bodies of the guys you just shot. So six outposts in, multiple altercations with these dudes and I've got three crates full of parts and no way to use them despite passing six forges(?) or anvils(?) at every outpost. There is no connecting line between A (gather parts) and B (use what is clearly a forge to improve a weapon). Yeah, it's early access, but that's just dumb. But they have to keep something in the drop tables for those guys or finding them is just a futile, aggravating way of having your health and resources wasted. \n\nThere are ways around all of this and maybe they'll implement them further down the road. For instance, if they're going to keep having you collect sticks and metal piece by piece, increase the damn count. Add a perk system or a skill tree or something. Add nodes during those long, dull stretches with the shark that are actual whole trees or old buildings that can be demolished and carted off. Make a little sapling that grows on the train you can auto-harvest like the water collector. And did I mention the crates have four whole storage spaces? Four. Even after you get the storage racks and can stack them two per rack you end up needing a hell of a lot of them. Why? Because you're swimming in gun parts you can't use and \"junk\" that needs a stack of three before you can do anything with it. You can eventually upgrade your storage further down the tech ladder but why, in a single player game, is something so trivial so limited? How is it going to throw the game balance out of whack if I've got a shit ton of the necessities I need for literally everything? \n\nThere are a lot of ways to skin this cat, they're just not interested.

This is a high-concept survival game - a train piercing through the dark void, fighting off horrors, growing bigger and stronger as you fight to keep your locomotive functioning and growing! On that premise, it mostly delivers, and you can get a pretty nice train going before you hit the current content wall. However, the experience is soured somewhat by awkward and baffling balancing and design decisions. I started playing with the Automation update, and it seems like the devs are committed to making improvements, but there is still a lot to improve.\n\nIf update pace is important to you, the devs do consistently make updates, just... with multiple months in between them. I expect there will be a few more years yet before this leaves EA.\n\nMy honest feedback on specific points:\n-Farming is too weak currently. The game has a system where you can farm food, but what it offers pales in comparison to just building the totally automatic water condensers and just drinking raw water all the time. This seems like a new issue introduced in the Automation update, which may be fixed in the next update.\n-The inventory system - the game gives you very limited inventory slots and chest slots, which is annoying at first. However, the game doesn't have that many resource types to juggle, and you eventually get better storage chests and rofleemos to let workplaces access those storage chests, which solves most of the issues. There is one issue - [b] The weapon mod system and small inventory size do not work together at all! [/b].\nThe problem is that when you kill a group of enemies, you'll usually get a bunch of weapons and weapon mods, which all need their own separate inventory spaces. You have maybe 12-18 spots in your inventory to work with, and the weapons/weapon mods from a combat encounter can easily demand 20-30 inventory spots. You have to make multiple trips every time, and its aggravating! The inventory system isn't fundamentally broken or anything, but it doesn't have the capacity for the demands the weapon mod system places on it! The game has 2 systems which are at odds with each other, and it makes the experience worse.\n-I really like the Rofleemo crew system, its one of the games strongest points and has some real depth to it. However, it could use some better tutorials - an encyclopedia entry to explain the finer points of Rofleemo care would be plenty. As it is right now, Rofleemos have mechanics like workplace features and satiety and happiness, which aren't well-explained, and the player sort of has to muddle through it on their own.\n-Towards the end of the current content, your progress gets gated by a resource called Acid, which can only be acquired in 2 specific ways. Its very frustrating, and if there was just one or two more ways to get Acid, it would work. As it is, you go from having a lot of momentum and fun building up your train, to continuously slamming into research walls because you have no Acid.\n\nIf you like the concept of this game, don't let my feedback scare you off. There really isn't any other survival game quite like this out there, this one is just in need of work before it can achieve its full potential.

What could go wrong?\n\nEverything, unfortunately. Everything could go wrong. And most things did! The space swimming is slow, a little faster if you swim-dash. Resources are scattered about in front of, to the sides and above you... and I do mean scattered, as in \"gathering enough material to make stuff takes ages\".\n\nOh, and everything on your train is destructible, except the foundation I suppose. Not sure if that means things explode into dust, or just get 'ruined' and can be rebuilt with resources, but once the space-mines start drifting in, it's easy enough to get half your laboriously constructed array of crafting stations busted down to 25% durability or so, which feels like a good time for repairs.\n\nThe repairs cost a lot. This exacerbates the slow gathering problem. I got a grappling hook, about two hours in. It doesn't help much, except for hunting space leather-fish. Yes, we're in space, or rather the mysterious Void, and what wondrous substances do we have to capture and fuel the imagination? Lump of organic matter. Lump of random chemicals (which in technical terms means basically anything in existence). Lump of wood. Lump of scrap metal. Large bits of scrap are useless, you have to find tiny ones and pile them up in ridiculous quantities. And wood, to burn, to melt the scrap into iron ingots. Then you make a dozen or so kinds of parts out of the ingots.\n\nSometimes the train stops at a vaguely randomized outpost station, and you shoot some really generic guys. They look human, but the narrator seems to insist they're not really people. Who knows - or cares? They're certainly bland enough to be zombie stormtroopers born of some burnt out shooter designer's very laziest efforts. They drop weapon parts sometimes, but not often enough that I - about three hours into it all - got to experience anything other than the crappy starting pistol and a few unhelpful variations on it (think: plus extra projectiles in exchange for lower accuracy, but the extra projectiles don't actually work... oops).\n\nThree hours in, there was no sign of anything resembling Raft's nets, something to help you collect resources without swimming after or personally hooking every single scrap of wood for the furnaces. Maybe it comes later, but they've lost me already. I'm not going to keep playing something so utterly bland and joyless, with such uninspired writing and a narrator who really doesn't need to be there... just in the hopes that \"maybe it gets better later on\". Sometimes you just know; a ship sailing rudderlessly, or under a confused captain who doesn't really seem to understand how ships work, is probably not going anywhere you want to be.\n\nThe whole thing is just so joyless, dull, repetitive, and misses any kind of chill or cozy vibe by miles.\nHighly disrecommended.", "timestamp_created": 1683678382, "timestamp_updated": 1683678382, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 145, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695695877075195313", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138657931": {"recommendationid": "138657931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120695891", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 493, "last_played": 1685850560}, "language": "english", "review": "its pretty good - like most people say raft but in the void on a train........it 100% needs an item net to make it go faster and to allow you to do more than just collect resources 90% of the time and move 2mph", "timestamp_created": 1684638679, "timestamp_updated": 1684638679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690453827381134033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147177390": {"recommendationid": "147177390", "author": {"steamid": "76561199220057088", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 1503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1503, "last_played": 1687909264}, "language": "english", "review": "This is made by the same developers of the wild 8 which was a game they abandoned, and I say abandoned cause it was riddled with bugs when they stopped working on it but continued to try to make money on it.

The atmosphere, the visuals, and especially the music are frankly stunning. The game signals clearly and concisely to the player with consistent music cues, and the music is so good that it doesn't get old. I'm gonna be honest I've accelerated my train just to hear the approaching the depot music drop again because it goes that hard. Narratively speaking (and yes, the Narrator speaks to you directly), for a game that's literally on rails it actually does quite a good job of both keeping you on track and letting you wander. \n\nThe framework of the combat system is there and functions reasonably well, though the arena fights fall into the same trap that a lot of games do by throwing melee enemies at you and forcing you to awkwardly backpedal while firing your weapon and repeat. The gunfights especially feel thrilling, terrifying, and extremely satisfying when you pull off a cheeky maneuver--the blockade gunfights and train battles take place in a zero-G environment, and it's possible to swoop, launch, fling, or otherwise traverse around the enemies in dynamic and novel ways to get the drop on them. The gun crafting system is somewhat opaque, but honestly I feel that's for the best--Voidtrain avoids the metaphorical penny on the tracks of infinite optimization of weapons to fit a meta, and instead gives you multiple viable and powerful options and variations. I'd love to see some more long range combat options in the arsenal, and I'd love to see the enemy soldiers integrated into some less structured environments out in the void as well to really push the limit of the encounter design as well as interact with the other enemy types.\n\nSome elements of the gameplay are obviously still building up steam in the development process though the core loop of resource collection, inventory management, processing, and upgrading the train is generally satisfying. The inventory interface are a bit clunky as well--being able to refuel the locomotive without clicking through an awkward menu should be a high priority add. The resource grind is in my opinion too steep a grade though I seem to be able to keep pace with where I should be in terms of progression; the absurdly high repair costs are constantly threatening to eat all of my resources at any given moment. My main problem with the cost and storage issues isn't that they're inherently wrong or bad but that they mean I spend a lot of time with my train slowly rolling along picking up scrap, which brings me to my biggest issue with the game.\n\nI want to drive my train fast. However, there's many drawbacks and very few opportunities or reasons (that I've found so far) to accelerate the train past medium speed. This is where the game loses steam for me. On the bright side, there's so much design space to work with here that the possibilities are limitless: maybe some sort of resource reward for getting through a section of track quickly, a scenario where you need to race an enemy train to a destination for an advantage, or chase down and capture a runaway car on the track ahead of you.\n\nIn conclusion, the game currently has flaws (most small, a few large) but in most cases it's the standard early access placeholder type stuff that shouldn't derail the game. The vibes are impeccable, the writing is excellent, and boarding an enemy train and massacring inter-dimensional Nazis with a gun I built to function like the Needler from Halo is a video game experience I didn't know I needed until I had it.\n\nI'd give it a soft recommendation--if you're not in love with the premise I'd say wait until it's a bit more complete.

I have played about a bazillion hours of Ark and put more hours into The Raft than anyone probably should.  I am up for a resource grind, and I love base building, but this game just manages to make it as dull as possible.  Ill try to detail why that is.\n\nFor starters, no matter how upgraded your train is, the game practically forces you to drift at the slowest possible speed for the entire game.  This is in part because unlike raft, there is no reliable way to auto gather resources.  Later in the game, you can build a module and assign workers, but they really gather very little.  Certainly they do not gather enough to replace gathering by hand.  Secondly, mines are a common thing, and at any speed greater than the slowest possible, you will not have enough time to shoot them all and your train is going to get wrecked. \n\nThe second part of the issue is the resource grind and tech tree itself.  It is INCREDIBLY granular.  As you climb, you are turning one resource into another, which needs to be refined into another, which needs to be refined into a part, and there are 3 other parts with the same level of granular refinement necessary to build the thing you want.  This makes building and advancing through the technology tedious.  This is one of the things I normally enjoy in base building games, but voidtrain manages to make it a chore.\n\nThe next issue is, not to make a pun, but just how on rails the game is.  I would have expected track switches, or some way of choosing destinations and path.  But there isnt.  You just keep going one way for the entire game.  Worse, the stations and stops, which are the things meant to break up the slow monotonous chug forward, are all the same.  No, really.  They modeled 1 station, and one stop, and every one you come to will be exactly the same.  Some of the story specific ones will have different things you have to do at the stop, or an extra building, but the layout and design is copy pasted throughout the entire game.  Once you leave the intro area, the game delivers the same copy/paste visuals from start to finish.\n\nI might come back to this one if they make some serious changes, but for now, I cant recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1684412752, "timestamp_updated": 1684412752, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.64783167839050293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143608423": {"recommendationid": "143608423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836225286", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 340, "last_played": 1691436330}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, even with it's early access bugs, the single player is hard but forgiving. the multiplayer becomes very easy with the instant re spawning on the player boat, which is understandable as it's not fun to be out of the action. it might be better to put a revive mechanic into the game to keep it so that it can be punishing. the character creator update solved my biggest problem with the character creator so I really love the game as it is now. my biggest problem with the storage system would be happier solved if there were bigger stacks for certain items, as leather should store for more in my opinion, but I digress.

I feel as though the complaints others have are valid and the game certainly has flaws, but overall I think people are letting those issues overshadow the enjoyment to be had in this game. So far, 3 days in a row, the devs have released patches fixing a decent portion of the issues so far and have been transparent about what they intend to fix next. Many people have decided to IMMEDIATELY crucify this game, and refuse to give it any chance even over minor details. \n\nThe game heavily reminds me of \"Raft\", in the way that resource gathering and such works, however I will say that this game is certainly more time consuming and progression is slower, and that won't be for everyone. there is a bit less automation than raft, and certain things feel less forgiving, like the combat and the destruction of the structures you've built. The gunplay is alright, it feels a little clunky but it feels fitting for the environment. The gun crafting is also cool, and allows you to manage some of that clunkiness by using the right combination of parts. Great visuals, good vibes, good enemy design, and some interesting mechanics/encounters to be had.\n\nOverall its been great for me so far, only a few standout issues which already have/are planned to be fixed by the developers within the first few days after launch. its a grind, but many people won't have a problem with that. It looks great, feels nice to play, and has an okay amount of depth so far with hopefully more to come in the future.
